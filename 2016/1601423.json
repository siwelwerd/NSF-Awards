 "awd_abstract_narration": "Based on projected growth of the petroleum industry in Alaska and worldwide, the pace of process technician education will need to increase to meet employer demand for highly-qualified process technology technicians. The project's long-term goal is to build a sustainable program to enhance community college process technology education by introducing new hands-on opportunities through use of light-weight extremely low-cost miniature industrial equipment (LCMIE) with a small footprint that fits on a standard desktop or which can be taken home for use in homework assignments. The LCMIE technological approach is being developed in an ongoing NSF IUSE grant (DUE-1023121) and will be applied and expanded for technician education. The focus is on easing incorporation of this new technology and assessing its impact in community colleges with Process Technology programs with an end goal of educating a more flexible and knowledgeable technician for industries that use mechanical, physical, and chemical processes. \r\n\r\nThe objectives are to: (1) develop and pilot the means to easily incorporate existing, lower-cost, hands-on equipment into the classroom by developing student and instructor materials, (2) develop a new injector LCMIE suited for process technician training programs, (3) model and assess LCMIE implementation within an existing 2-year process technician program at Kenai Peninsula College (KPC), and (4) disseminate activities regionally and nationwide. LCMIE implementation strategies are expected to impact 2-year AAS Process Technology technician programs and trainees, vital to oil and gas production, chemical manufacturing, petroleum refining, utility and power generation, water treatment and food processing industries. Results will be disseminated through the Alaska Process Industry Careers Consortium, an advisory board to state process technology programs, and nationally through workshops at the North American Process Technology Association Instructor Skills, and American Society for Engineering Education Annual Conferences.",

We have employed LC-DLM modules as hands-on learning tools in small group classroom settings and to distance education students who need the equipment while taking online process technology courses at KPC. We evaluated LC-DLM effectiveness by comparing scores on assessments for control groups taught concepts via traditional lecture and intervention groups who used the LC-DLM modules. Results spanning multiple years across several semesters show significant improvements in performance for groups exposed to the LC-DLM modules. Concept assessments in the KPC PTC 130 Equipment class are exceptionally encouraging. The vast majority of implementations show positive gains which are statistically significant when comparing to the control group, which did not use the hand-held equipment. Companion student comments are in support of these gains as students say they &ldquo;like&rdquo; doing the hands-on experiments and that visualizing the concepts in action are greatly beneficial to learning the material. KPC found that involvement of Washington State University was instrumental in designing and modifying LC-DLMs and accompanying worksheets and assessment tools to enhance the success of the effort.</p>\n<p>Broader impact outcomes are numerous. LC-DLMs were successfully implemented at the Kenai Peninsula College in three different degree programs for the Process Technology and Industrial Process Instrumentation associate degrees, as well as in getting a Petroleum Certificate Degree. Over 200 students used the LC-DLM modules. LC-DLMs were presented in a poster session during the 2017 Hi-TEC conference held in Salt Lake City, UT. LC-DLMs were also demonstrated during the 2017 and 2018 North America Process Technology Alliance&mdash;Instructor Skills Conferences held in New Orleans, LA (2017) and League City, TX (2018) and interest was expressed by about 16 faculty members per year who desired to obtain LC-DLMs for their own classrooms. As a result, we are now applying for a second related NSF ATE grant allowing expansion to include additional LC-DLM modules for use at both KPC where 60% of the students use LC-DLMs in a distance education mode and dissemination to Bismarck State College for use in a Process Technology technical program that also serves the Native American Turtle Mountain Community College. Dissemination has occurred through an American Society for Engineering Education published, peer-refereed paper. An additional manuscript is currently in preparation for publication detailing results from LC-DLM implementations in the 2017-2018 and 2018-2019 academic years. Of 213 students, several females and minorities were involved and received training and professional development in areas related to LC-DLM implementation and conceptual assessment rubric implementation. These students also were surveyed on career development and/or impact of LC-DLM use and those with uncertainty about continuing in the Process Technology Program gained enthusiasm for completing their degrees.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 02/07/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Jeffrey&nbsp;Laube</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div
