 "awd_abstract_narration": "Embedded deep in the ice cap at the South Pole, the IceCube Neutrino Observatory (ICNO) is the world's largest and most sensitive high energy neutrino telescope. It is a 1 billion-ton detector using the Antarctic ice as a detection medium for high energy atmospheric and astrophysical neutrinos. Most of the neutrinos observed by IceCube exhibit energies in the range expected for atmospheric neutrinos originating from decays of particles produced in extensive air showers by cosmic rays coming from nearby sectors of the Milky Way Galaxy. These may be used to measure the fundamental properties of neutrinos. At higher energies, astrophysical neutrinos are key probes of the high-energy universe. Because of their unique properties, neutrinos escape even dense regions, are not deflected by galactic or extra-galactic magnetic fields and traverse the photon-filled universe unhindered. Thus, neutrinos provide direct information about the dynamics and interiors of the powerful cosmic objects that may be the origins of high energy cosmic rays: supernovae, black holes, pulsars, active galactic nuclei and other extreme extragalactic phenomena. This award provides funding for the scientists at the University of Wisconsin-Madison for the scientific analysis of data taken with the IceCube neutrino detector. The study of neutrino oscillations and the ongoing correlation studies between the arrival directions of cosmic neutrinos and high-energy photons are only two of a large range of current analyses, illustrating that discoveries are at best in initial stages.\r\n\r\nThe mystique of the South Pole environment and the compelling science of IceCube are an alluring mix. IceCube results have already enhanced scientific and technological understanding on many levels and have inspired the innovative capacity of a new generation of American scientists and engineers. The Madison group will continue to make IceCube science and resources available to existing education and outreach programs with a proven record of success. The group is also a partner of a new program, called \"El Universo es Tuyo\" (the Universe is Yours), to engage the Hispanic community in and around Madison in learning about research and STEM careers in astronomy and astrophysics.\r\n\r\nDeepCore, a densely instrumented infill array in the bottom half of the IceCube detector, has lowered the sensitivity threshold to 10 GeV. The Madison group participates in the development of analysis techniques that specialize to DeepCore data. They will result in improved measurements of the atmospheric oscillation parameters. The accumulating cosmic neutrino events indicate an enhancement of the flux below 100 TeV that may hint at another component in the cosmic neutrino spectrum.",

IceCube, completed in 2010, transformed a cubic kilometer of mile-deep natural Antarctic ice into a neutrino detector. Neutrinos are nearly massless particles that travel close to the speed of light, and the discovery of high-energy neutrinos of cosmic origin by IceCube has revealed that neutrinos are remarkably abundant in the extreme universe. Unfortunately, their weak interaction with matter makes neutrinos very difficult to detect. Immense particle detectors, such as IceCube, are required in order to collect them in sufficient numbers for scientific analyses.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The highest energy forms of ?radiation? reaching us from the universe are not gamma rays but atomic nuclei, mostly protons, called cosmic rays. Discovered in 1912, how and where they are accelerated remains a mystery. IceCube looks for neutrinos associated with extreme objects, like black holes or neutron stars, whose gravitational energy powers cosmic ray accelerators. In 2013, the UW?Madison group produced the first evidence for a flux of very high energy neutrinos from outside our solar system, some with energies over a thousand times those produced by earthbound particle accelerators. IceCube?s initial discovery was from a collection of 28 detected neutrino events, two of which had the highest energies ever observed, above 1 PeV, or petaelectronvolts (10<sup>15 </sup>electronvolts). The observation was recognized as the 2013 <em>Physics World</em> Breakthrough of the Year.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Most recently, IceCube has detected tau neutrinos and identified an event where an electron neutrino produces an intermediate W boson at an energy that attributes it to the Glashow resonance. These both represent further confirmation of the existence of and properties of the cosmic neutrino flux.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Also, IceCube had another breakthrough during this project reporting period. Established as a leading detector among an extensive group of diverse instruments, IceCube continued in attempts to pinpoint the still enigmatic sources of cosmic rays. Unlike the electrically charged cosmic rays, which are deflected by magnetic fields, neutrinos point directly back to their sources, as do gamma rays. In 2016, IceCube initiated a multimessenger campaign, triggered by the coincident observation of a gamma-ray flare and a 290-TeV IceCube neutrino, that eventually pinpointed the first cosmic-ray accelerator, TXS 0506+056. Subsequently, IceCube archival data revealed a three-month burst of 13 cosmic neutrinos in 2014-15 that dominates the neutrino flux of the source over the 9.5 years of IceCube observations.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The original identification of the source as a blazar was puzzling, but subsequent high-resolution radio images of the source with the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA), a system of ten remotely operated radio telescopes, revealed the interaction of two jets entangled in the source, suggesting a two-galaxy merger. Recently, the blazar PKS 1502+106 was found in the direction of a 300-TeV neutrino alert, IC-190730. Owens Valley&nbsp;<em>Radio</em>&nbsp;Array (<em>OVRA</em>) radio observations at 15 GHz indicate that the neutrino also coincides with the highest flux density of a flare that started five years ago.

The dominant hotspot in the neutrino sky map is a Seyfert galaxy undergoing a major accretion event onto the black hole, NGC 1068 (Messier 77). Another source is TXS 05060+056, mentioned above. A few-percent fraction of such special sources, now labeled as gamma-ray blazars, is sufficient to accommodate the diffuse cosmic neutrino flux observed by IceCube. While rapid progress seems likely, these observations also convincingly make the case for the construction of more sensitive and larger neutrino telescopes with better angular resolution that will help us learn more about these objects of interest.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With the mystique of the South Pole and its compelling science, the IceCube project provides a unique opportunity to engage the public and to enhance scientific and technological understanding on many levels. Examples of efforts during this reporting period include three editions of its IceCube Masterclass, production of a variety of multimedia resources, including research videos and a comic geared toward younger audiences, and webcasts from the South Pole. IceCube is in a unique class of projects, like the space program and the Large Hadron Collider. It inspires an upcoming generation of American scientists and engineers to solve our most vexing problems by applying new knowledge of the universe and creating innovative technology to improve lives and expand options for future explorations.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/10/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Francis&nbsp;Halzen</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1607644/1607644_10454502_1575990355506_trackUnderIcl_straightView_horiz--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1607644/1607644_10454502_1575990355506_trackUnderIcl_straightView_horiz--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"The IceCube Lab and a high-energy muon neutrino\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1607644/1607644_10454502_1575990355506_trackUnderIcl_straightView_horiz--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"The IceCube Lab and a high-energy muon neutrino\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A high-energy neutrino event, one of the astrophysical neutrinos detected by IceCube, is shown superimposed on an image of the IceCube Lab at the South Pole.
