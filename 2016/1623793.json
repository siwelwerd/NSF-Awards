 "awd_abstract_narration": "Pyroclastic flows and surges (here called pyroclastic density currents, or PDCs) are a fundamental phenomenon of explosive volcanic eruptions.  PDCs are poorly understood because they involve flow of complex mixtures of gasses and particles (such as volcanic ash and rock fragments) at a wide range of speeds and temperatures.  The flows are the most destructive of volcanic phenomena, but poor understanding has limited scientists? ability to predict their behavior in a way that optimizes mitigation of hazards and consequences.  Direct measurements of their dynamics in nature are rare because of their unpredictability and danger.  Instead, much of our understanding of PDCs at a given volcano relies on characteristics of deposits from previous eruptions, along with experiments and computational modeling.  Many pyroclastic density currents are caused by the falling back, or collapsing, of jets of gas and debris.  As the mixtures impact the ground they change from vertically falling flows to lateral flows (the PDCs), and this transition is complicated by the different ways that particles and gas respond to sudden changes in speed and direction. The impact process critically influences the characteristics of the resulting lateral flows (speeds, particle concentrations), yet this is a topic that has not been addressed by previous quantitative research.  \r\n\r\nThe project will combine numerical modeling and experiments, complemented by field studies, to address the following hypotheses:  (1) Impact dynamics depend upon collapse height, collapsing particle concentration, clast size and density distribution, slope of the ground at the impact site, and duration of collapse; (2) Collapse of vertical, impulsive jets tend to feed dilute PDCs (pyroclastic surges) by expulsion of fines and gas; (3) Collapse of sustained jets can feed concentrated and/or dilute PDCs immediately upon impact, depending upon the clast size and density population of the collapsing mixture; (4) Impact dynamics define initial conditions for the PDCs and should inform simplified flow models for hazards assessments. The work will define the initial conditions for jet/fountain-collapse fed flows so that simplified PDC models can be better used to guide decision makers coping with volcanic hazards. The experimental setup developed by the project will be available for follow-on used by anyone in the research community.  It is anticipated that the fluid dynamic aspects of the research will have applications to industrial processes that involve gas-particle flows. Aspects of the work will comprise a key part of a Ph.D. dissertation.  Additionally, a video-based education module will be prepared for university students, which will demonstrate the integrated approach and aid in developing an intuitive understanding of multiphase flow dynamics as a key aspect of geological fluid dynamics.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nPyroclastic flows (currents) are hot mixtures of gases and volcanic particles that move rapidly across the ground, forming the deadliest of volcanic hazards.  These flows are produced when gas and particles are explosively ejected from a volcanic vent, rise some height into the atmosphere, and then collapse back to the ground; when the mixtures hit the ground, their momentum is transferred into horizontal motion that can achieve speeds of 25 to 250 miles per hour.  The effects of the flow are strongly determined by the concentration of particles, with low concentrations behaving like intense, hot sandstorms that can blanket rugged terrain, while high concentrations are much more strongly confined to valley bottoms.  Prediction of these effects, for risk mitigation purposes, requires understanding the conditions that create the dilute vs concentrated conditions where the flows begin.  In most cases, our knowledge of a volcano's past behavior is what informs our forecasts for likely future behavior; the past behavior is recorded in deposits left by pyroclastic flows.  The characteristics of these deposits are also sensitive to the concentration of particles in the flows that produced them.  This project focused on constraining the conditions that produce concentrated vs dilute pyroclastic flows where they begin, i.e., where a falling gas-particle mixture hits the ground and turns into a lateral flow. \n\n \n\nWe used a combination of numerical modeling, experiments, and case studies of deposits to achieve our objectives.  We found that the particle concentrations of pyroclastic flows depend upon the flux of large particles at the impact site, and on the coupling between those large particles and the gases and small ash particles in the remaining mixture.  High coarse-particle fluxes and poor coupling promote the formation of concentrated pyroclastic flows.  This is complicated by supersonic effects, which can be important in some cases. The criteria for concentrated vs dilute flow initiation can be used to select the most appropriate flow models for hazards simulations and mitigation planning.  Our modeling also elucidated processes in impinging gas-particle flows that may be of use to some industrial applications. We found that deposits we had hypothesized as being related to the initial impact process are more likely to be related to the roiling, low-concentration ash clouds that accompany (mainly on top) the more concentrated, valley-confined flows.\n\n \n\nThe project supported portions of the graduate work of four students, including three females.  One of the students completed a PhD and is now working at a national defense laboratory.  Another PhD student is planning an academic career of teaching and research.  The research has been disseminated in both interdisciplinary and in discipline-specific journals.  A learning module is in development, which will be posted online for public use.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/29/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Greg Valentine"
