 "awd_abstract_narration": "The geometric structure that lies behind classical Newtonian mechanics is called symplectic geometry, where the coordinates of position and momentum, along with the conservation laws of mechanics, are modeled in even-dimensional geometries with distinctive structures.  While the familiar geometry of Euclidean spaces takes length and angle as fundamental notions, the structure of symplectic geometry begins from the measurement of two-dimensional area.  Much of the modern study of symplectic geometry is devoted to understanding distinguished structures on symplectic manifolds, a study that can reveal useful invariants for those manifolds.  The research to be pursued in this project is focused on questions in this area arising out of string theory.\r\n\r\nThis research project focuses on developing the theory of microlocal categories, such as the full sub-category of objects supported on a Lagrangian submanifold, and on developing an appropriate ground category for the microlocal category, which may be topological in origin.  The project also aims to find a description of the microlocal categories associated to flag varieties.  Further investigations are motivated by ideas of quantization, which is here understood in geometric terms abstracted from concepts in physics.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nI worked on applying theory of infinity categories to microlocal analysis.\n\nThis resulted in a new construction of a microlocal category on a compact sympliectic manifold.   This gives a purely topological approach to the Fukaya category which comes from the Quantum Field Theory and   its construction is based on the theory of pseudo-holomorphic discs.   The ring of coefficients of thi s category is the Novikov ring with rational coefficients with an added  variable of homologilcal degree 2,  in topological case, in addition to this version of characteristic zero one also gets $p$-adic versions where $p$ is any prime.\n\nOne first constructs a microlocal category associated to a product of a symplectic manifold with its opposite.  This is done by observing that this category has a monoidal structure where the meaning of the tensor product is the convolution of kernels, and  to every open subset of our manifold there must be associated an object with the meaning of the  projector onto full sub-category of objects supported on this subset.\n\nThe key tool used is the  deformation theory as well as the theory of cyclotomicstructure on the topological Hochschild homology,   where one has to develop an analogue of periodic cyclic homology which is stable under deformations/nilpotent extensions (in characteristic 0 case one can just use the periodic cyclic homology) \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/04/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Dmitry Tamarkin"
