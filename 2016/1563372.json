 "awd_abstract_narration": "Coastal areas in the US face substantial risk from storm surge. Data from modeling efforts can provide crucial information to decision makers to act against these risks, but available models are limited in scope. Current fragility-based models for flood defense systems are primarily focused on a single mode of failure without consideration of causal relationships and temporal correlations among various failure modes. Failure assessment is treated as a snapshot in time neglecting the time evolution of failure processes. The adoption of surge hydrographs in current methods to independently determine failure probabilities from reliability models neglects the impact of the performance of geo-structures on spatio-temporal surge response. Moreover, we lack an accurate conceptualization of how this informational shortfall impairs decision makers in making critical judgments about storm surge risk and infrastructure investment. This work will provide for the development of the next generation in storm surge and fragility models  and will provide for an experimental validation and assessment of the models' effects on decision making, as follows: 1) Development of an adaptive-resolution storm surge model that responds to the changing state of flood protection systems; 2) Derivation of novel time-dependent, multi-dimensional fragility models of geo-structures, fully integrated with the storm surge model; 3) Development and utilization of human-in-the-loop experimentation to validate and test the effects of these models on real-time decision making, and 4) Creation of enhanced educational and research opportunities for students and teachers, along with dissemination of research knowledge to critical stakeholders. \r\n\r\nThe research performed under this project will have a significant impact on the development of the next generation of storm surge models that are fully integrated with time-dependent fragility models to improve forecasting capabilities of flooding scenarios. The research will also improve understanding of how decision makers utilize storm risk assessment information to make critical decisions. Ultimately, this research will lead to more informed decisions about catastrophic risk and infrastructure failure (e.g., evacuation decisions, search and rescue operations, infrastructure investment, and pre-, during, and post-event planning). The educational plan will provide for integrated new curriculum in infrastructure modeling, resilience and risk analysis. Moreover, the educational plan will enhance the self-efficacy of K8 teachers to teach engineering in classrooms and help engineering students to develop pedagogical skills. Results will be disseminated to (and validated with) key federal and regional stakeholders (e.g., Dept. of Homeland Security, FEMA, US Coast Guard) as well as industry partners.  The results from this project will provide a significant improvement in storm surge modeling through the development of a novel, dynamically coupled modeling system consisting of hydrodynamic and fragility model components. The stochastic finite difference models combined with machine learning techniques will enable generation of a novel class of multi-dimensional fragility surfaces that will enhance our understanding of various failure processes and characterize time evolution of failure probabilities. The coupled surge/fragility model will adapt the mesh resolution in response to changing conditions of the flood protection systems, resulting in improved forecasting capabilities. The experimental analysis will provide for an assessment of how these modeling capabilities improve real-time decision making.",

Storm surge and heavy rains accompanied by hurricanes pose significant flood risks to the built environment and coastal communities. The objectives of this research project were to develop a reliable flood risk assessment framework through integrating hazard and infrastructure models and to examine the impact of how engineering risk estimates are presented on the evacuation decisions of emergency managers. In accomplishing these goals, the project introduced many research contributions. Key contributions and their significance are described below.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>One of the critical elements of risk analysis is the characterization of hazards. For storm surge, we have developed a new approach to capturing wave-overtopping flows in high-fidelity surge simulations through integration of parametric wave models. We have shown that wave-overtopping flow rates are resolved accurately for storm waves on simple barrier structures. Comparisons of numerically generated wave-overtopping flow rates with measurements show good agreements for more than 90% of the test cases considered.&nbsp;A regression plot for measured versus modeled overtopping rates is shown in Figure 1. The few observed outliers are attributed to either uncertainties in measurements or the lack of foreshore effects in the wave model. Moreover, it was found that the current computational approaches used for evaluating storm surge risks exhibited significant numerical errors for piping flows, due to integrating the full volumetric flow rate along the entire length of the barrier segment. These codes were corrected to instead compute the flow rate&nbsp;<em>per unit width</em>. The corrected codes are now successfully verified and validated.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Due to intricacies inherent to geologic features, high levels of uncertainty are present in various soil properties. To reduce uncertainties, observation data from these systems can be used to calibrate uncertain properties. We have developed an efficient probabilistic calibration framework that is integrated with surrogate models to quantify uncertainties in the entire space of uncertain system variables and capture spatial and temporal dependencies among the responses. Results indicated that this framework can more accurately and efficiently update uncertainties compared to existing methods and therefore can facilitate reliable predictions of future responses.&nbsp;Figure 2 shows the flowchart of the proposed framework.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A core focus of the project was component- and system-level reliability analysis of flood protection systems. This project developed an approach where the original computationally demanding models are emulated by an adaptively trained surrogate model. We introduced effective sampling regions that optimally exclude samples with weak probability densities, which was then leveraged to develop an effective learning function for active learning. We also developed a local and objective stopping criterion based on error bounds of failure probability estimates. Figure 3 shows the advantage of our active reliability method compared to passive ones. The project subsequently developed time-dependent fragility models for levee systems for backward erosion piping considering the hydro-mechanical coupling between material properties. Figure 4 presents the finite difference model towards capturing backward erosion piping. Another key risk to levees is the overflow of flood water. We have developed a set of overflow fragility models for levees that are a function of key risk factors including the initial water level before surge and peak surge elevation. Compared to existing fragility models, this new class of fragility functions can accurately represent various undesirable events in levees including initiation of breach, local geotechnical instabilities, and breach development.&nbsp;Figure 5 shows the developed overflow fragility models for a homogenous levee built with non-cohesive sediments.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>One of the final goals of the project was to integrate hazard, infrastructure and consequence models to arrive at estimates of risks posed by flooding to communities. For this purpose, the project developed an approach for risk analysis of levees against flooding that captures the interaction between the hydraulic properties of flood outflow and the performance of the flood protection system by embedding the multi-dimensional fragility models into the hydraulic model of flooding hazards. This development yields temporally varying inundation maps which have incorporated the temporal performance of the protection systems.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Finally, communication of engineering risk estimates with decision makers is known to be a complex and critical problem. The decision-making experiments conducted under this project integrated the inundation projection capabilities to address emergency management decisions. Results indicated that the availability of additional forecast information (e.g., wind speed, forecast tracks) significantly increases the probability and improves the timing of early voluntary evacuation. However, we observed that more numerate subjects are less likely to avoid relying upon forecast information that is characterized by probability. Consequently, more numerate emergency managers are almost twice as likely as less numerate ones to provide additional evacuation time to their coastal communities, and they do so by longer than a typical workday (8.8 hours).&nbsp;Figure 6 shows results for the spatial density of evacuation decisions for professional vs student subjects, different numeracies and human exposure.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 09/05/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Abdollah&nbsp;Shafieezadeh</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1563372/1563372_10417557_1630872769645_Fig1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1563372/1563372_10417557_1630872769645_Fig1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Fig 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1563372/1563372_10417557_1630872769645_Fig1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Fig 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Regression line and correlation for model overtopping discharge rates against measured values.
