This project focuses on biomass pyrolysis to produce fuels and biochar and then chemically modify biochar for use in applications related to carbon dioxide capture, water purification, and food production. The project is interdisciplinary and is a collaboration among four institutions (Jackson State University, University of Mississippi, University of Delaware, and the University of Wyoming) in three states.  The project aims to diversify the workforce through partnerships with Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs) in the region, hiring and mentoring of early career faculty and postdoctoral fellows, and training of graduate and undergraduate students.\r\n\r\nTechnical description\r\nUsing solar energy with chemical catalysis and steam pyrolysis, this project aims to produce liquid fuels and value-added biochar from biomass (e.g. corn stover).  The goal is to develop technologies for biomass refineries that produce net zero or negative CO2 emission.  The project combines experimental work with computations based on Density Functional Theory (DFT) to better understand the thermodynamics, kinetics, and transport in the chemical looping energy production system. The photochemical and ultrasonic chemistry and functionalization of biochar will use graphene related nanostructures and enable technologies for CO2 capture and utilization, water purification, and soil quality improvement. \r\n  \r\nThe project is interdisciplinary and addresses science and engineering issues in biomass conversion and will contribute to advances in materials chemistry, heterogeneous catalysis, and reaction theories. Each of the collaborating institutions brings complementary expertise in research and will hire new faculty in the areas related to Food, Energy, and Water. The project seeks to diversify the workforce through partnerships with Minority Serving Institutions in the region, national laboratories, and other national and international institutions.",

The United States has abundant biomass resources (214.7 million metric dry tons), about 61.3% of which is corn stover. Pyrolysis and gasification are two promising technologies that exploit the energy from biomass. However, biochar and bio-oil as the main products of the pyrolysis have not been highly deployed in the market due to their low quality. On the other hand, synthesis gas (syngas) as the main product of gasification is not markedly competitive since the price of natural gas is too low, and the situation will not change in the near future. Both processes are also highly energy-intensive, and their emissions, especially CO<sub>2</sub>, are high.</p>\n<p>We have developed a catalytic chemical looping biomass refinery<strong> </strong>process for the production of high-purity syngas by integrating the concepts of simultaneous pyrolysis/gasification with chemical looping. This new technology has been developed for producing chemicals, materials, and energies from renewable resources.&nbsp; The major factors affecting the performance of the new biomass utilization technology have been clarified. The reaction?s thermodynamics and kinetics as well as the reaction mechanism associated with the biomass process technology are understood, which provides the basis not only for scaling up the biomass conversion technology but also for studying pyrolysis of other biomass materials. Also, the knowledge gained via computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and Aspen computation results is beneficial to understanding the engineering principles of the biomass conversion technology.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In addition, we have developed ultrasound-based low-temperature methods for activation and functionalization of the carbonaceous structure of biochar for a sustainable FEW (Food, Energy, Water) nexus. Such modified and functionalized carbonaceous structures have a wide range of applications from adsorption of CO<sub>2</sub> and water pollutants to soil amendment, electrode fabrications for water desalination / deionization, fuel cell, and energy storage devices.</p>\n<p>Key to successful deployment of value-added biochar for modern engineering applications is by controlling the synthesis procedure, selection of raw biomaterials, and manipulating the surface chemistry during the synthesis of biochar. Many raw materials, including agricultural wastes, water treatment sludge, and marine sediments, were used to synthesize biochar at different pyrolysis temperatures with or without chemical additives, such as iron and manganese. The biochar materials prepared were used as catalysts and adsorbents. Biochar catalysts were excellent activators of several oxidants, including monopersulfate, sodium percarbonate, and persulfate, for the treatment of water and marine sediments contaminated with recalcitrant organic chemicals such as pharmaceuticals and phenolic compounds. Biochar adsorbents were used to adsorb water impurities, such as micronutrients (ammonium and phosphate), heavy metals, and salts from water. We have also synthesized several metallic electrodes supported on carbon for the <em>in-situ</em> water disinfection by converting chloride in water to chlorine.</p>\n<p>As part of the comprehensive studies performed in this project, magnetic nanoparticles have been synthesized by the chemical solution method in the presence of biochar, leading to the production of magnetic biochar, which can be used to remove some&nbsp;pollutants from water and is therefore useful in&nbsp;agricultural and environmental applications. The prepared magnetic biochar was studied in terms of dye adsorption. The magnetic properties of the nanoparticles with different morphology and sizes can be obtained by our method to control the biochar?s magnetic properties, which shows advantages over the traditional magnetic biochar. Semiconductor ZnO nanoparticles are also incorporated into the magnetic biochar. The photocatalytic properties of the ZnO nanoparticles increase the dye removal ability.

The current project combines experimental and computational studies.
