 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this CAREER project funded by the Chemical Catalysis Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Kalyani of the Department of Chemistry at St. Olaf College is developing Ni-catalyzed methods to construct biaryl bonds. Biaryls are used for numerous commercial applications. New carbon-carbon bond forming reactions using readily available, inexpensive and/or renewable substrates and earth abundant Ni-catalysts are being developed. These studies may ultimately contribute to the design of more economical and greener processes for the production of compounds prevalent in pharmaceutical, agrochemical and material science industries. St. Olaf undergraduate researchers benefit from a state-of-the-art experience in organometallic catalysis, a possible prelude to careers at national labs, employment in the chemical or pharmaceutical industry, or faculty appointments. The research program strengthening the scientific work force. In addition, Professor Kalyani has designed a course to introduce non-science students to science by addressing global economic and sustainability challenges. Finally, in collaboration with the St. Olaf College Upward Bound Program for high school students, outreach activities introduce minority and disadvantaged students to the exciting world of organometallic chemistry in our everyday lives.\r\n\r\nTransition metal catalyzed methods for the construction of biaryl compounds are well-established. However, the vast majority of these methods use expensive precious-metal catalysts such as palladium and rhodium. Furthermore, aryl halides are the most common coupling partners employed for these reactions, and their use leads to environmentally undesirable halide wastes. Professor Kalyani's research program addresses these limitations through the use of earth-abundant nickel (Ni)-catalysts and non-halide aryl sources. The insights gained from the mechanistic studies may be helpful in the design of versatile new Ni-catalyzed reactions capable of activating carbon (C)-hydrogen (H), C-oxygen (O) and C-C bonds. Both high school and college students participate in Professor Kalyani's research project, where they are introduced to chemistry and develop a sound foundation to conduct, interpret, and communicate scientific research.",
