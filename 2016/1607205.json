As one of the most prestigious conferences in data management research, ACM SIGMOD and the associated Symposium on Principles of Database Systems (PODS) have contributed significantly to the advance of all aspects of data management technologies and applications since 1975. Besides meeting with researchers from academia and industry during regular program sessions, in SIGMOD/PODS 2016 students will be able to participate in the following interactive activities as partially supported by this project: a new researcher symposium, an undergraduate research poster competition, face-to-face meetings with leading researchers, and a student mentoring workshop. These opportunities will have a long lasting impact on the future career of the participants. This award will provide partial support for students from U.S. institutions, especially female and minority students.\r\n\r\nACM SIGMOD/PODS is a dynamic and comprehensive program for publication, education, and interaction; and it is a leading international forum for database researchers, practitioners, developers, and users to explore cutting-edge ideas and results and to exchange techniques, tools, and experiences.  ACM SIGMOD/PODS plays a significant role in training the future generation of leaders and workforce in the critical field of data management.",
