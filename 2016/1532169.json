 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award funds the development of a new astronomical instrument at the McDonald Observatory in West Texas. The VIRUS2 spectrograph design will be well-adapted to future applications on the next generation of extremely large telescopes, and offers a cost-effective way to instrument such telescopes.  This program will provide the opportunity for students to be involved in the design, assembly, and commissioning of the instrument. \r\n\r\nVIRUS2 is a scalable Integral Field Spectrograph for the McDonald Observatory 2.7-m telescope. It will be based on technology developed for the original VIRUS instrument on the Hobby Eberly Telescope (HET), also at McDonald. The VIRUS spectrograph is adaptable to a range of spectral resolutions and wavelengths. VIRUS2 will utilize three replicated units to cover wavelengths 370-915 nm at resolution ~2300. The large investment already made in VIRUS makes this follow-on project lower in cost than starting from scratch and should allow for a rapid schedule and low risk. The resulting instrument will enable studies complementary to ongoing structure surveys of nearby galaxies (MaNGA, SAMI, CALIFA, VENGA) by extending observations to the outskirts of galaxies.",

An integral field spectrograph obtains spectra from a whole area of sky simultaneously, rather than targeting individual objects. The replication allows the problem of covering this area to be broken up into 6 identical pieces.</p>\n<p>VIRUS2 will be a new facility instrument on the McDonald Observatory 2.7 m Harlan J Smith Telescope (HJST, Fig 3). The instrument employs a novel beam-switch module within the fiber feed (Fig 2) to split the light into the 4 spectral channels covering ultraviolet to the near infrared wavelengths, while achieving a very compact and highly stable instrument. The six spectrograph units (Fig 4) are self-contained and designed to run continuously. They contain hundreds of opto-mechanical components (Figs 4,5) and are currently being assembled and tested. The light from the telescope, gathered by the fibers, is spread (dispersed) out into a spectrum by grisms which are combinations of diffraction gratings and prisms. Fig 5 shows one of the grisms being evaluated on our custom test bench. After being dispersed, the light in each spectrograph channel is focused onto a detectors by a set of custom camera optics. Each unit has a custom cryostat (Fig. 6) that keeps 4 CCD detectors at -100 <sup>o</sup>C. The design of VIRUS2 emphasizes stability and careful calibration so as to obtain the highest precision data, with light scrambling in the beam-switch module, compact spectrograph format, and tight thermal control. This is the first time such measures have been employed in such an instrument.</p>\n<p>Due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on deliveries of components, there was a schedule slip. VIRUS2 will be deployed at McDonald Observatory in mid 2022. The instrument will be the most powerful available for studies of the ways in which galaxies interact with their larger environments to regulate how stars form. Fig 1 shows the footprint of the VIRUS2 integral field unit (IFU) on the sky compared to the starbursting galaxy M82 and demonstrates this strength. Each facet of the IFU is a microlens assembly that couples the light into a fiber, so it will analyze the particular part of the galaxy that it covers. The footprint shows that VIRUS2 will cover most of the galaxy in one observation from the ultraviolet to near infrared wavelengths. This dataset will be obtained a factor of ten faster than any existing instrument can achieve and will provide a whole new view on how galaxies interact with their surroundings. The promise of VIRUS2 in this area was key in the recent recruitment of two new Faculty.</p>\n<p>A key goal of the program was to train and provide leadership roles for junior members of the team and foster the next generation of astronomical instrumentalists. We achieved this through the leadership role of our instrument scientist. He runs the weekly group teleconference and has gained valuable experience that has set him up to lead his own instrumentation projects in the future. Our lab manager has also worked with us to gain more experience in project management, and has played a key role in the production construction of VIRUS2 units. Our graduate student joined in all phases of the project. For a key Review she developed the fiber cable mapping scheme that traces the 1734 optical fibers from the telescope to the spectrographs (Fig 2). Over the summer 2020 she won a Fellowship that supported her work on this project and on science projects. She graduated in July 2021 and has joined the University of Colorado as a postdoctoral fellow.</p>\n<p>An unfortunate side effect of the pandemic was that we could not provide as many opportunities for undergraduate students to participate and gain experience as we had hoped.

The replicated spectrograph concept embodied in VIRUS2 allows these challenges to be broken up into manageable pieces and also breaks the extreme cost escalation associated with ELT instruments.
