 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project at Texas Lutheran University (TLU), a Hispanic Serving Institution (HSI), will determine the optimum combination of high impact inverted and active learning pedagogies (e.g., \"flipped classroom\") in order to maximize student success for groups underrepresented in STEM. The effort includes 40 college faculty and 350 undergraduate students in a flipped classroom experiment and the results will be compared with those gained from a similar, but more limited experiment which has been carried out at Harvey Mudd College. Results from the latter experiment appear to suggest that there is no difference in results between those students in typical versus flipped classrooms. \r\n\r\nThree primary research questions will be addressed: (1) What is the optimal combination of Inverted and Active Learning Pedagogies (IALP) that will maximize student learning for groups underrepresented in STEM? (2) How will the effectiveness and impact of IALP techniques differ for underrepresented groups and for students in highly selective STEM focused colleges? and (3) To what extent will the benefits of IALP be sustained in subsequent classes? The impact of IALP will be measured using pre-post test instruments, student scores on assignments, quizzes, exams and projects. Results gained throughout the semester are recorded and analyzed. Course content is optimized following data analysis at the end of each semester. The use of course sequences is providing control groups and facilitates measurement of impact on later courses. The research-design model and measurement tools produced are allowing researchers to replicate and further test IALP courses in institutions similar to Texas Lutheran University. A team of external evaluators are utilizing appropriate tools to conduct both formative and summative evaluation of the programs and the project. All evaluative processes are including checking and reporting systems designed to provide data and documentation of all activities from beginning to end.",
