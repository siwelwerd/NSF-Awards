 "awd_abstract_narration": "NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: In biology, a signal is passed from one biomolecule to another, such as in antigen-antibody interactions, or between a protein and DNA, and this function is transmitted via molecular interactions between their molecular structures. The result, in each case, is manifested as part of life's function. Similarly, in this project, peptides (small proteins) with short amino acid sequences will be designed and engineered to induce signal transduction into single atomic layer solids. As a consequence, the functions of the devices made from these thin solids will be monitored and controlled by carefully designed peptide sequences. Since the devices will be interfaced with peptides, they could be integrated with biosensors and bioenergetics devices of the future. The project will be executed at the cross-sections of diverse scientific fields such as molecular biology, genetics, biochemistry, physics, mathematics and engineering. The research, therefore, is expected to result in the development of novel experimental and computational tools that will enable the design of hybrid bio/solid devices, creating a common scientific language that could be used collectively in these diverse and convergent fields. The project will establish research training opportunities for the next generation of creative scientists who will be unique members of interdisciplinary engineers and technologists contributing to the continuing tradition of creativity, the hallmark of innovation in the USA. The transformative nature of the project will also lead to advanced intellectual properties and patents, enhancing the competitive edge of the USA at the global platform.\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: The key reason for this project is the shortcoming of knowledge of how biology interacts with man-made solids at the molecular scale. Despite numerous studies in this major topic, the understanding has so far been far from complete. This knowledge is essential to integrate devices with living systems, for example, for future health monitoring. Based on the collective expertise and facilities of the investigators, the project addresses these limitations by three major innovations: coded recognition of simple crystals, such as single atomic layer materials, by peptides; designed functional moieties via state-of-the-art predictive computational modeling and genetics; and, finally, advanced test-bed demonstrations of hybrid devices. Controlling the intrinsic properties of materials using simple biomolecules, i.e., engineered peptides, will be carried out by integrated experimental and computational approaches working iteratively and in tandem, in three Task Areas: Formation of self-organized structures of peptides on single atomic layer solids (Task-1), with interface structures and physical properties (predicted by advanced computational modeling) induced by biomolecular coding (Task-2), and interrogated by test-bed measurements (Task-3), for example in a field effect transistor. The overall work, therefore, will establish the foundations of biologically-coded physical properties of engineered solids. Finally, the bio/solid interfaces are also analogous to a famous technological problem, namely coherent interfaces in compound semiconductors developed during the 80s that enabled today's electronics (lap-top computers, cell phones, etc.,). It is conceivable that through this project a more complete understanding of the intricacies of the bio/nano interface structures, molecular recognition characteristics of different peptide sequences, and physical changes in the 2D materials across the interfaces, one can make major strides in the in vivo integration of the worlds of biology and solid-state devices of the future with unprecedented functionalities.",

In this integrated and iterative experimental and computational project, we benefited from the opportunities provided by the NSF-DMREF program, the combination of diverse recent developments of engineered solid binding peptides that can form organized molecular networks, and the advances in single layer materials with simple structures and rich electronics towards forming the strategic foundations in a wide range of highly potent and practical bio-nanodevices of the future. Realizing that the rapid advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence (ML/AI) algorithms combined with team?s expertise on biology-like molecular recognition and signal transaction would better lead to more exciting new directions with the higher goals of the high risk-high return project, now dubbed, materials intelligence. The team?s unique system is constituted by the smallest building blocks of biology interfaced with one of the smallest viable crystalline blocks in materials science, i.e., single layer graphene and related materials forming the smallest functional hybrid structures seamlessly combining biology and solid-state devices that can lead to accelerated implementations of a wide building range of current and futuristic practical devices. With this goal in mind, the original one-dimensional, sequential progress of the research (shown in Figure 1) in this project has morphed into a 3-dimensional feed-back loop architecture (Figure 2) involving all three key scientific fields - molecular biology/genetics, materials sciences and engineering, and data sciences/computational sciences, forming the more substantial convergence of all hard sciences towards accelerated research progress, the real intend of the DMREF program at NSF.</p>\n<p><strong>Intellectual Merit</strong>: During the last 4 years, the research team made enormous progress in the never-before-done attempt to bring together convergent science principles towards discovering the evolutionary methodology towards predictively designing structurally coherent, zero-energy loss electronic bio/nano soft interfaces using peptides and atomic layer materials. The key goal has been to establish a transitional hybrid structure from biological to solid state where the genetically coded information would flow in either direction without the loss of energy. Within a relatively short time, the team has achieved intellectual capacity to discover the required blend of theoretical and experimental tools and began to implement ML and AI approaches towards accelerating discovery and innovation, firmly setting the team to go forward with the Phase-II of the DRMREF project in establishing the materials intelligence platform. In short, during this phase-I period the team has established, e.g., high throughput selection of solid-binding peptides providing the unique, one-of-a-kind, data sets essential in the development of predictive machine intelligence and learning algorithms, established the experimental intrinsic (peptide sequence) and extrinsic (external field, pH, and temperature) parameters that affect their molecular assembly on atomically flat solid-state structures, and interrogated bio/nano interfaces at the highest spatial and electronic resolutions possible using scanning probe spectroscopic techniques, towards designing bionanosensors, e.g., for detection of rare cancer biomarkers from peptides to microRNAs and has even generated the potential of designed blue prints towards universal molecular vaccines against the pandemic causing, e.g., covid viruses. Given a chance, the team, with the reorganization of its new collaborative expertise, is now well suited for the challenges in designing bio/nano chip-based logic devices, mimicking synopsis in the brain towards establishing the wetware devices, the new paradigm of energy efficient molecular computational machines.</p>\n<p><strong>Broder Impact</strong>: For the first time, breaking all the traditional boundaries among the major science disciplines, this DMREF project is bringing biology, engineering, and computation fields together into a single platform to predictively design bio/nano hybrid structures and novel devices whose key principle follows the same code as biology, i.e., molecular recognition that forms the basis of life. Inevitably, therefore, the major broader impact of the project is the education and training of a young generation of undergraduate, graduate and post-doctoral scientists and students from diverse fields including molecular biology, biochemistry, genetics, materials sciences (chemistry and physics), and all branches of engineering, data sciences, informatics, mathematics, and computational sciences. The experimental, mathematical, and computational tools developed here will facilitate new devices and developing novel software that are expected to enhance the well-being and the competitiveness of the nation at the world stage. Education, partnerships and knowledge dissemination are accomplished in 5 different ways.
