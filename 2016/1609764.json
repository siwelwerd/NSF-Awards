 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Chemical Measurement and Imaging program of the Division of Chemistry supports the research of Professors Carolyn Cassady, David Dixon, and John Vincent from the University of Alabama. Their project improves the sensitivity of mass spectrometry (MS), which is a common analytical tool for identifying and characterizing chemical substances. The researchers use experimental and computational approaches to optimize MS conditions. This project specifically improves MS analysis of peptides.  Peptides are used in the study of protein structure and function. The ability to better identify and characterize peptides has benefits for basic molecular biology research, drug development, human health, and biotechnology. Students working on this project receive mentoring and training in an interdisciplinary, collaborative research environment. \r\n\r\nThis research project improves the sensitivity of mass spectrometry (MS), an important means of characterizing biomolecules.  Specifically, the researchers are probing the use of trivalent chromium, Cr(III), to enhance the intensity of the protonated ion signal obtained during the analysis of peptides and other organic molecules. This work includes optimization of experimental MS parameters and determination of the most suitable reagents for inducing proton transfer. Both metal salts and organometallic complexes are studied. The fundamental mechanism of the enhanced protonation process is also being explored. High level electronic structure calculations are used to elucidate the enhanced protonation mechanism with Cr(III) and to determine the locations of the added protons on the organic molecule. This novel Cr(III) method benefits proteomic researchers who use MS to identify peptides in protein digests. The ability to better identify and characterize peptides increases our understanding of biological processes and leads to the development of new pharmaceutical drugs to target specific metabolic pathways.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIdentification and quantification of peptides and other biomolecules by mass spectrometry (MS) is important to the fields of biological chemistry, biotechnology, and human health.  Protonation of an analyte molecule (M) by electrospray (ESI) or matrix-assisted laser desorption (MALDI) ionizations is often a crucial step in the analysis.  The major objective of this project was to develop and characterize a novel technique for protonation enhancement by use of trivalent chromium, Cr(III).  \n\nA goal was to determine the optimal conditions and reagents for supercharging of peptides during ESI.   In a study involving eleven Cr(III) complexes, chromium nitrate and Cr(THF)Cl3 generated the most intense protonation.  Aqueous solvent systems and complexes containing bound water ligands are necessary to enhance protonation.  Regarding instrumental parameters, only the ESI drying and nebulizer gases are important, suggesting that the proton transfer occurs during desolvation.  The design of the ESI source is also important.\n\nAnother goal was to evaluate the ability of Cr(III) to enhance peptide protonation by MALDI. This work considered the matrix, sample application, and concentrations.  Although some promising results were obtained, the low reproducibility of MALDI ion signals (with or without Cr(III)) hindered the ability to determine if Cr(III) increases protonated ion signal.  However, while exploring compounds without a carboxylic acid group, 2-nitro-1-napthaleneamine was discovered to be an excellent MALDI matrix for acidic peptides.  This contributes to an important overall goal of this project, which is to develop techniques to analyze acidic peptides.\n\nAn additional goal was to establish the scope of Cr(III) protonation enhancement.  In a study of 42 peptides, for a quarter of the peptides, addition of Cr(III) during ESI results in production of a multiply protonated ion with a higher charge state (number of protons) than occurs without Cr(III).  Thus, for some peptides, Cr(III) produces new charge states that can facilitate sequencing by MS/MS.  Peptides containing aspartic or glutamic acid residues are most likely to undergo this effect.  Glycans did not exhibit enhanced protonation, perhaps because they have no acidic site to bind Cr(III).  For smaller molecules, Cr(III) increases the production of singly protonated ions only if the compound contains a carboxylic acid group to bind to Cr(III) and a nearby basic site to accept the proton.\n\nThe enhanced protonation mechanism with Cr(III) is particularly noteworthy.  High-level electronic structure calculations, coupled with MS experiments, indicate such systems could be the basis for a new category of superacids that involve stripping water from hydrated metal ion complexes.  The unique mechanism developed provides a new approach to considering metallation in MS.  In addition, the superacid characteristics of metal-aqua complexes that were revealed may be important to other areas of science; for example, the high acidity of Cr(III)-aqua clusters could be relevant to very high ionic strength solutions, such as molten salt reactors.  The mechanism was developed primarily by computations from co-PI Dixon's group, while being consistent with the experimental MS results of PI Cassady's group and the chemistry of chromium that is the expertise of co-PI Vincent.  Density functional theory (DFT) showed that removal of water from Cr(III)-aqua complexes, as would occur during ESI desolvation, results in species that are highly acidic.  The pKa of Cr(III) with a single solvation shell is -10.8, making [Cr(III)(H2O)6]3+ a superacid.  Binding to glycine requires removal of two aqua ligands, giving [Cr(III)(H2O)4]3+ with an extremely acidic pKa of -28.8.  Removal of additional water further increases acidity.  The mechanism involves binding of [Cr(III)(H2O)4]3+ to the deprotonated C-terminus of a peptide.  As the ESI drying process strips water from the complex, the resulting superacid transfers protons to the peptide, leading to formation of [M+2H]2+.  Its substitutional inertness and long-lived hydration shell make Cr(III) uniquely capable of enhancing protonation during gas-phase processes. \n\nAnother goal was to determine if Cr(III) can be employed in the mobile phase during analysis of mixtures by liquid chromatography (LC).  Enhanced protonation occurred with LC, although to a lesser extent than by direct infusion of the liquid.  However, Cr(III) causes degradation of the chromatographic separation and the flow rates needed to enhance protonation are incompatible with optimal LC separation.\n\n An additional broader impact was the training of students in MS, computational methods, and inorganic chemistry.  Four graduate students working on the project obtained their PhDs in chemistry and are now employed as a college faculty member, analytical chemists in a forensic laboratory and the food industry, and a chemical safety officer.  Three other students will obtain PhDs in 2021.  Four former undergraduate researchers are now obtaining graduate degrees in chemistry/biochemistry or medical degrees.  This project exposed other undergraduates to MS and computational chemistry through outreach activities such as the Advanced Instrumental Techniques Colloquium and open houses of the MS facility.  The PI and co-PIs were also involved in programs such as Tide Together for first generation college students, research experiences for undergraduates (REU), and computer-based honors.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/03/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Carolyn J Cassady"
