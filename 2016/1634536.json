 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Gulf of California formed when continental crust rifted apart and seafloor spreading began.  The focus of this project is to obtain a better understanding of the processes involved in the initial rifting of the Gulf and its subsequent evolution. During this project heat flow measurements will be obtained on a research cruise in the Gulf of California.  The sea-going expedition is part of a funded Mexican research effort to understand the geothermal regime in this region. Variations in heat flow measurements will be correlated with the observed style of rifting to understand how rifting transitions to seafloor spreading as opening continues, a fundamental process that is still poorly known. The study includes strong collaboration with Mexican colleagues and allows acquisition of and access to a unique new heat flow dataset.  \r\n\r\n\r\nThe regional tectonic history and the structure of the Gulf of California are well understood from plate reconstructions, geologic relationships, recent swath mapping and seismic data. Less well understood are processes associated with rifting and those that have led to observed variations in rifting style and the ocean-continent transition.  A key to this understanding is observational constraints on the thermal structure of the Gulf.  The principal science goals of this project are to 1) characterize the background conductive heat flux through the thickly sedimented basins in the northern and central Gulf and thinly sedimented basins in the southern Gulf; 2) determine the pattern and magnitude of hydrothermal circulation and differences between the thickly and thinly sedimented basins of the northern and southern Gulf, respectively, and that associated with magmatic sills intruding sediments; and 3) link these observations to styles of rifting and the ocean-continent transition.  These goals will be achieved through the integration of new heat flow data with previously collected data and modeling.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nContinental rifting and formation of ocean basins is a fundamental Earth process that is still incompletely understood.  Rupturing a continent requires progression from initial rifting to continental rupturing that leads to oceanic spreading in a developing ocean. This progression and rifitng style, depends mainly on the thermal structure, thickness, and strength of the lithosphere, as well as forces at the base of the lithosphere.\n\nThe Gulf of California is a premier locality to better understand the transition from continental rifting to seafloor spreading.  The Gulf is a 1200-km long oblique extensional rift system that lies between Baja California, a sliver of continental lithosphere, and the Mexican mainland.  This work supported a joint project with Mexican scientists to understand the thermal regime in the Gulf of California.  We collected and analyzed heat flow data from two regions, the Wagner Basin in the northern most reaches of the Gulf and the Pescadero Basin in the southern Gulf.\n\nThe Wagner Basin is a tectonically active basin with thick sediments overlying a crystalline basement.  To better understand the thermal regime, we systematically measured heat flow along a 40 km transect that crosses the basin.  After making environment corrections to the data we find that the mean and standard deviation of heat flow across the western, central, and eastern parts of the basin are 220 &plusmn;60, 150 &plusmn;21, 889 &plusmn;419 mWm&minus;2, respectively.  These are very high values and reflect the influence advective fluid flow through the basin bounding faults.  Further, we find that crust beneath the Wagner Basin has not yet fully ruptured and that underplating is occurring at &sim;15 km, the base of the crust. We suggest that underplating may be an important process in weakening the lithosphere just prior to complete rupture and the onset of seafloor spreading.   \n\nThe Pescadero Basin, in the southern Gulf of California, is representative of nascent oceanic spreading centers.  The Basin is a stretched sediment-filled graben bounded by relatively recent normal faulting. The basin is sigmoidal to rhomboidal, strongly asymmetric structural depression developed between the overlapping Tamayo and Pescadero transform faults.  Within the central graben we made 45 heat flow measurements within and around two newly discovered vent fields.  The Auka field is at a depth 3,670 m. Fluids discharging from the vents have elevated salinity and temperatures as high as 291&deg; C.  The second vent field, JaichMaa ja' ag', is south of the Auka vent field and is less well known.  Heat flow values vary by approximately two orders of magnitude across the basin from over 120 W/m2 at the JaichMaa ja' ag' vent field vent to background values of about ~2 W/m2.  Heat flow highs assciated with the vent fields decay to background values at distances of ~ 1 km from the vent fields indicating the focused and intense nature of the heat source.  A numerical model of the Auka vent field predicts a reservoir depth of ~5.7 km.  The permeability and the rate of fluid flow in the fracture system associated with the vent field is ~10-13 m2 and 10-6 m/s, respectively.  Our model points to the importance of faults in controlling sediment hosted vent fields and their role in lithospheric rifting. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/10/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Robert N Harris"
