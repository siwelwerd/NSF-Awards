 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of this collaborative project is to increase the efficiency of utility scale solar arrays using sensors, machine learning and signal processing methods to detect faults and optimize power. New cyber-computing strategies, that rely on sensor data and imaging methods to predict solar panel shading, are used to improve efficiency.  A programmable 18kW testbed that consists of 104 panels equipped with sensors, actuators and cameras is used to validate all theoretical results and test new approaches for using solar analytics to optimize power generation.  Machine learning and dynamic image modeling algorithms are used to control each individual panel and change connection topologies to optimize power for different cloud, load, and fault conditions.\r\n\r\nOutcomes of the CPS project include advances in: a) cloud movement modeling and shading prediction using computer vision algorithms, b) PV fault detection and optimization methods that will switch array topologies dynamically while limiting PV inverter transients, d) experimental (testbed) validation of all array monitoring methods, and e) secure wireless sensor and data fusion.  Theoretical and experimental research which enables real-time analytics and remote connection topology control may influence PV array standards and smart grid initiatives. The project tasks also include: education activities, outreach at high schools, and engagement with several organizations including minority and HBCU institutions to enhance diversity.",
