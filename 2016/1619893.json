 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research explores the effects of the 2015-16 El-Ni\u00f1o on coral reefs in French Polynesia where the US National Science Foundation supports a Long-Term Ecological Research site.  El Ni\u00f1o brings a diversity of unusual conditions to the Pacific Ocean, but for coral reefs the most important effect is caused by seawater warming during the summer.  Bleaching, the process causing corals to lose color and die, is a dramatic example of the negative effects of El Ni\u00f1o on reef corals, but high temperature also has insidious effects through impaired reproduction and poor recruitment of baby corals.  As a result, El Ni\u00f1o conditions are likely to be associated with a degraded ability of coral reefs to regrow following disturbances, potentially preventing a full recovery, or favoring substantial changes in the community that develops.  This research builds on the unrivalled history of LTER investigations in Moorea to ask how coral recruitment is affected by El Ni\u00f1o, as measured by the number of baby corals arriving to the reef, the number of baby corals that grow, and the kinds of communities that develop as a result of these events.  The study involves fieldwork conducted in Moorea by faculty and graduate students, during which settlement tiles will be installed and monitored for baby corals, baby corals will be evaluated for overall \"health\", and natural and artificial reef surfaces will be quantified for community development.  The results of this study will help to understand how marine ecosystems are responding to the spectrum of natural and human-related disturbances to which they exposed, including global climate change, and will improve the capacity to understand in what form coral reefs in US waters and throughout the world will survive the coming century. The project creates unique opportunities for graduate students to work in an international context, where they will conduct research promoting STEM careers, an appreciation of diverse tropical ecosystems, and the role of climate change in modifying ecosystem dynamics.  The broader implications of this project will be strengthened by integrating the results into life science curricula at local high schools, in part by utilizing settlement tiles from Moorea in classroom exercises staffed by California State University Northridge graduate students.\r\n\r\nThis project addresses the effects of the 2015-16 El-Ni\u00f1o on coral recruitment in Moorea, French Polynesia, where coral reefs have been studied since 2005 thought the Moorea Coral Reef LTER.  Time-series research supported by this program provides a unique historical context against which the ecological effects of the upcoming El-Ni\u00f1o can be gauged.  As coral bleaching negatively affects coral reproduction, and previous El Ni\u00f1o events have been associated with globally-depressed coral recruitment, it is reasonably to hypothesize that coral recruitment in Moorea will change in magnitude (i.e., declining density) and type (i.e., taxonomic composition) over the next year.  These possibilities have important implications, because coral recruitment mediates community resilience to disturbances, and modulates the trajectories of future reef development.  In this 12-month project, a program of mensurative and manipulative experiments will be conducted to addressed four hypotheses: (1) coral recruitment will be depressed following El Ni\u00f1o-related seawater warming, (2) warming will affect post-settlement success of corals, (3) for Pocillopora, the effects on coral recruitment will be modulated through density-dependent processes, and (4) the resulting recruitment perturbations will modify trajectories of coral community development.  The results of this research will have general application in revealing the demographic processes determining the response of coral reef communities to recurrent pulse disturbances such as El Ni\u00f1o events.",

Previous strong El Ni&ntilde;o events caused catastrophic coral death, notably in 1998 when large areas of coral reef bleached and died. Therefore, the possibility that the 2015-16 El Ni&ntilde;o would be a &ldquo;monster&rdquo; event was cause for great concern. The best places to study El Ni&ntilde;o effects on coral reefs are locations where they have been investigated for decades, and in this regard, Mo&rsquo;orea, French Polynesia, is exceptional. Since 2004, NSF has supported coral reef research in this location through the Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) program, and by 2015, it provided a decadal context within which the effects of 2016 could be interpreted. With RAPID funding, this project focused on the effects of El Ni&ntilde;o on the appearance of baby corals on the reef through a year-long program of field ecology. This program provided unique opportunities for graduate students to assist with important research, to develop research leading to their MS degrees, and to strengthen their capacity to contribute to the scientific and educational workforce as globally-aware and technically competent professionals.</p>\n<p>As this project began in early 2016, El Ni&ntilde;o was proving to be very harmful for Australian coral reefs, as well as those in many other western Pacific locations. While large swaths of coral were dying throughout 2016 on many reefs, a different outcome unfolded in Mo&rsquo;orea. First, despite warnings of severe warming, seawater temperature increases in Mo&rsquo;orea were modest. Late summer temperatures reached 30.0&deg;C, but were above the decadal average for only a month; in the fall, they were above the decadal average for several months, although they did not reach harmfully high values. The late summer temperatures caused minor coral bleaching, but recovery was complete within 3&ndash;4 months, and bleaching did not occur in the fall. Terracotta floor tiles attached to the reef in January 2016, provided settlement surfaces for baby corals, and when these were inspected in August 2016 and January 2017, they revealed more baby corals than had been seen over the previous decade, and they reflected different abundances of the types of coral usually found in Mo&rsquo;orea. Therefore, while the El Ni&ntilde;o of 2016 created unusual temperatures in Mo&rsquo;orea, the effects on the corals were different from those in other parts of the Indo-Pacific. In Mo&rsquo;orea, the recent history of these reefs seems to have created communities that are resistant to some kinds of environmental disturbances, and these effects &ldquo;primed&rdquo; the corals to respond in beneficial ways to the 2016 El Ni&ntilde;o.</p>\n<p>There is more to understanding the effects of El Ni&ntilde;o on coral reefs than just counting the number of baby corals, for their survival determines the kind of reef that ultimately will develop. This project addressed these effects in two ways, first by evaluating the roles of existing corals in determining the survival of baby corals (i.e., &ldquo;density-dependent effects&rdquo;), and second, in determining whether the arrival time of baby corals determines the kind of communities they develop (i.e., &ldquo;priority effects&rdquo;). Density-dependent effects were studied by recording the number of baby corals in plots with reduced coral abundance, and in these locations the number of baby corals increased 65%. These results indicate that the implications of increased densities of baby corals will be accentuated where less coral is initially present. Finally, to address priority effects, patio pavers were installed on the reef in four seasons, and currently they are being evaluated for the kinds of community that develops on summer-, fall-, winter-, and spring- deployed pavers. This aspect of the project is slow to generate results, as they can only develop as fast as the corals appear. Maintaining this experiment as part of the monitoring research in this location will provide insight into whether the El Ni&ntilde;o of 2016 initiated events that will change the coral reefs through the appearance of large numbers of baby corals. The resilient reefs of Mo&rsquo;orea provide some optimism for the global fate of coral reefs, and perhaps the lessons that can be learned in this location can be used to good effect to enhance the survival of coral reefs for future generations. This important message has been conveyed to the scientific community through publications and conference presentations, and has been integrated into high school classrooms through presentations, lesson plans, and independent study projects.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 01/01/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Peter&nbsp;J&nbsp;Edmunds</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1619893/1619893_10407674_1514864692154_GOPR2863--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1619893/1619893_10407674_1514864692154_GOPR2863--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Installing settlement tiles on the outer reef\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1619893/1619893_10407674_1514864692154_GOPR2863--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Installing settlement tiles on the outer reef\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Graduate student, Dan Sternberg, installs settlement tiles on the outer reef at 10 m depth to measure the abundance of baby corals that will grow on the tiles.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">PJ Edmunds</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Peter&nbsp;J&nbsp;Edmunds</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Installing settlement tiles on the outer reef</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1619893/1619893_10407674_1514864779673_GOPR2924--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1619893/1619893_10407674_1514864779673_GOPR2924--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Installing settlement tiles in the back reef\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1619893/1619893_10407674_1514864779673_GOPR2924--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Installing settlement tiles in the back reef\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Research technician, Vincent Moriarty, installs settlement tiles at 2 m depth in the back reef of Mo'orea.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">PJ Edmunds</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Peter&nbsp;J&nbsp;Edmunds</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Installing settlement tiles in the back reef</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1619893/1619893_10407674_1514864899814_GOPR4374--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1619893/1619893_10407674_1514864899814_GOPR4374--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Mild bleaching in April 2016\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1619893/1619893_10407674_1514864899814_GOPR4374--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Mild bleaching in April 2016\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Corals on the outer reef underwent mild bleaching in April 2016.
