 "awd_abstract_narration": "Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) provide support to design, implement, and assess strategies that can lead to comprehensive institutional efforts to increase the number of students receiving undergraduate degrees in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) and enhance the quality of their preparation by strengthening STEM education and research. This project seeks to establish the foundation for a program for \"Data Science and Analytics Advancing STEM Education at North Carolina A&T State University\".  The goal of this integrated, multidisciplinary undergraduate program is to use data science and analytics to train undergraduate students in data science and analytics through computationally intensive tools and global research and education experiences. This project seeks to transform teaching and learning through evidence-based STEM gateway course reform.\r\n   \r\nActivities that are part of this project are: broadening student access and participation in data science education; strengthening undergraduate research experiences in data science; engaging faculty in research and scholarship; and developing an educational research pilot project. The project will be guided by an on-going evaluation and external and internal steering committees. Since African Americans are severely underrepresented in this field, the project can have great impact on diversifying the workforce.",

As a result of implementation of the planning project activities at NCA&amp;T, a statistical computing laboratory was configured and a statistics and analytics consulting center was established in the summer 2017, a statistical modeling course and a network science course were piloted in the spring 2017 with infusion of data science and analytics contents into the course instruction, and four capstone projects were tested in the spring 2017 with integration of big data analytics into senior design projects.
