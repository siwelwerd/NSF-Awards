These are pairs of large, horizontal counter-rotating vortices that appear in the ocean and in lakes and are aligned in the wind and wave direction. They play an important role in many environmental problems including the transport of oil spills at sea, transfer of greenhouse gases between the atmosphere and oceans, and the transport and mixing processes in lakes that affect aquatic ecosystems. \r\n\r\nIt is proposed to use Large Eddy Simulation (LES) models, where the numerical mesh continuously adopts to the water surface deformation, to capture and understand the dynamics and the process of formation of Langmuir cells. This is a step change in modeling such flows, since current simulations and existing theories, like the Craik-Leibovich (C-L) model, simplify the flow assuming flat interfaces. The goal is to capture the formation and evolution of Langmuir cells directly, without the simplifications of the (C-L) model. Detailed descriptions of the flow field will be used to investigate the fundamental mechanisms of turbulence fluctuations and vortex dynamics in Langmuir cells, based on which the C-L theory will be corrected and updated. This research could impact our understanding of transport of oil spills at sea, transfer of greenhouse gases between the atmosphere and oceans, and the transport and mixing processes in lakes that affect aquatic ecosystems.  As part of the educational scope of the project, Native American high school students will be introduced to environmental fluid mechanics through their participation in summer camp activities co-organized by the PI.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nWhen one is out on a lake or stands by the shore, they often notice that foam or debris line up in parallel lines.  This is because of a phenomenon known as the Langmuir circulation.  Langmuir circulation is caused by the motion of the currents underneath the water surface and the action of the wind blowing across the water surface.  Langmuir circulations play an important role in lakes and in the ocean.  The rotations act like a mixer and enhance an effect called turbulence, which is water flowing randomly within the lake or ocean.  Turbulence has many impacts in a lake or ocean. It can affect how greenhouse gases are transferred between the air and the water, which has an impact on climate change.  It can influence water quality and aquatic ecosystems.  It can also have an effect on how pollution, such as oil slicks or plastics, move across the water.  By better understanding the Langmuir circulation, we hope to find solutions for some of these complex problems.\n\n \n\nIn this project, we confirmed the hypothesis that the windrows are caused by the water waves combined with the action of wind across the lake using computational modeling.  Small eddies in the water, when acted on by waves and wind, can gradually turn from vertical to horizontal.  They are made bigger by waves and form Langmuir circulations.  These small eddies are happening everywhere across a body of water, so when they turn horizontal, with the wind and waves all going in one direction, they tend to become rotating rolls that align with the wind and waves.  Between them, one can see downward motions in one area and upward in others, and this amplifies mixing and turbulence in the water.  New studies in this project used computational models to reproduce the generation of Langmuir circulations, which can be visualized and analyzed for a better understanding of these processes.\n\n \n\nWe have studied the effects of surface waves on the vorticity in Langmuir turbulence using the wave-phase-resolved large-eddy simulation.  The wave-phase-resolved simulation captures the effects of phase-resolved waves on the vortical structures.  Many characteristic features of Langmuir turbulence, such as elongated quasi-streamwise vortices, were reproduced by our simulations.  It is found that the streamwise extension and the vertical inclination angles of the vortices vary with the wave phase, indicating that the turbulence vorticity is wave-phase dependent.  We found that the stretching and tilting by the wave orbital straining is the dominant mechanism for the variation of the vorticity strength and the inclination angle.  The cumulative effect has been studied by analyzing the Lagrangian-averaged transport equation of streamwise vorticity.  It is found that among the terms in the transport equation, the most dominant source term is the distortion term induced by waves.  We further decomposed it into the distortion term into the mean effect term and the fluctuation effect to separate their contributions.  The mean titling term, the fluctuation stretching term, and the fluctuation tilting term work together to enhance the streamwise vorticity in Langmuir turbulence.\n\n \n\nBy analyzing the data of large-eddy simulation with wave phase resolved, we found that the streamwise and spanwise Reynolds normal stresses vary appreciably with the wave phase, while the vertical normal stress is only weakly dependent on the wave phase.  We further conducted the budget analyses to reveal the mechanism responsible for the wave-phase variation of Reynolds stresses.  We found that the production due to wave straining and the effects associated with turbulence pressure are the dominant mechanisms.  Our analysis of the budget of the Lagrangian-averaged TKE showed that the main source of the TKE in Langmuir turbulence is the production due to wave straining when the wave effect is strong, indicating that the turbulence is energized by the surface wave.  Further analyses of the production term related to the wave straining revealed that the wave transfers energy to turbulence through two mechanisms.  The first mechanism is the interaction between the Lagrangian mean wave shearing and the mean shear stress; and the second is the correlation effect that is attributed to the phase correlation between the Reynolds shear stress and the wave orbital shearing.   \n\n \n\nThis study has offered a new method for the simulation of Langmuir cells and Langmuir turbulence.  The results of this study have advanced the understanding of the fundamental physics of turbulence?wave interaction, which is important to environmental concerns including global warming, pollutant transport, and aquatic ecosystems.\n\n \n\nThe results of this project have been disseminated through the education and outreach activities of the St. Anthony Falls Laboratory (SAFL), with the help of the lab?s Director for Diversity Dr. Diana Dalbotten.  In particular, we have developed a website (https://fluids.umn.edu/research/example-problems-outreach/langmuir-circulation) for outreach to the general audience and for data sharing with researchers. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/06/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Lian Shen"
