 "awd_abstract_narration": "General Summary\r\n\r\nState governments are commonly referred to as \"laboratories of democracy?\"because for many\r\ndecades they have experimented with new policy solutions to society's most important problems.\r\nPublic policy scholars and practitioners of politics often look to the states for innovative policies\r\nthat can be emulated by other governments across the country; a process referred to as policy\r\ndiffusion. However, the complex relationships between the states (that is, the patterns,\r\npathways, and mechanisms underlying how policies actually diffuse from one state to another)\r\nare not well understood. In this research, the PIs develop innovative tools and\r\ndata to facilitate the large-scale computational and data-intensive study of policy diffusion. They\r\nseek to develop and utilize the largest database on states' decisions to adopt policies to better\r\nunderstand which states are policy leaders, which are policy followers, and why. This will\r\nprovide a novel, expansive, and systematic view of the policy diffusion process that covers the\r\nAmerican states. As a result, policymakers and other interested stakeholders will have access to a\r\ncomprehensive look at the spread of innovation among state governments regarding financial,\r\nenvironmental, health, security, and other social problem domains.\r\n\r\nTechnical Aspects\r\n\r\nThis research seeks to make three central contributions to the study of public policy diffusion.\r\nFirst, it will produce a database on the adoption of hundreds of policies in the American states, at\r\nleast tripling the size of the largest database currently available and yielding a sample of policies\r\nthat is more representative of the universe of policies for which states make laws. It will also\r\nleverage these new data to map and analyze the network pathways according to which policies\r\ndiffuse (i.e., establish states that are leaders and followers in the diffusion of policies). As\r\nrecently published research by the principal investigators shows, cutting-edge computational\r\nmethods can be applied to large databases containing information on when policies were adopted\r\nby which governments in order to identify underlying networks along which policies persistently\r\ndiffuse. Another key contribution from this research is to improve upon the existing method for\r\ninferring network ties in ways that are most suitable for policy diffusion research (as well as\r\nsocial science more generally) and implement it in a user-friendly package in the R statistical\r\nenvironment. A final contribution, which is intended to maximize the potential user-base of these\r\ndata and methods, will be to build an interactive online portal to the data, complete with\r\nvisualizations and automated analytics.",
