 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study seeks to integrate the fundamental ecological concept of succession and metacommunity ecology. Succession is defined as changes over time in the type and number of species (species diversity) present in a community. A metacommunity is a set of interacting communities, which are linked by the movement of individuals (dispersal) of multiple potentially interacting species. Metacommunity studies have focused on the role of species dispersal among local communities in determining species diversity across spatial scales (local and regional). However, the role of the community successional stage in structuring species diversity within metacommunities is not well understood. The study will investigate the role of pond age (i.e., community successional stage) on the species diversity and the size of food webs of metacommunities of beaver ponds. Since many beaver ponds are essentially restored ecosystems, the results of this study will be significant for restoration ecology, by indicating how relevant the successional stage of the community is within the restoration process. In addition, the findings will facilitate decisions about the location and timing of beaver reintroduction efforts that are currently widespread in the US and Europe. This project will also provide research training for one doctoral student and several undergraduate students. The outreach activities will benefit 50 students from a rural high school. The PI and a high school student teacher will develop a laboratory and teaching module to introduce students to ecological succession and beaver disturbance. \r\n\r\nThe study will address the following questions across different successional stages: 1) Does species diversity and trait composition respond more strongly to habitat age and the local environment, or to processes at the regional scale? 2) Does ecosystem age influence food chain length? If so, is this the result of a regional driver (e.g. colonization of new species) or local driver (e.g., pond size, productivity), or both? The investigator will address these questions by analyzing community and species trait diversity, environmental habitat properties (water chemistry, area, maximum depth and flow rate), trait-environment relationships, and the trophic position of apex predators in replicated studies of beaver pond metacommunities (streams and beaver-formed ponds of three watersheds).",
