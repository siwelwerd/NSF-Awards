 "awd_abstract_narration": "This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translating operations research models and data analytics to improve situational awareness and decision making for mass gathering events.   Such mass gathering events are growing in popularity, and thus require significant resources to ensure safety and success. To date, event management tools have not grown to meet this need.  This project is designed to address these gaps in event management tools.   The research proposed in this project significantly expands the development of a Data Visualization System focused on medical preparedness for mass gathering events, originally conceived for marathons. This system was created for event organizers and relevant stakeholders to effectively manage and oversee all participants, monitor the dynamic location of participants, and manage health and safety resources throughout the event, both under normal operating conditions and in the event that emergency issues arise.  The system provides a dynamic representation of the flow of people and resources: at the core is a novel simulation tool that predicts and displays runner density on the course over time.  The data visualization system is the first comprehensive dashboard for endurance event management.  The project will result in a significant ramp-up of the current prototype of the data visualization system to expand functionality and make the system more turn-key.  The project will also result in the development of a business plan for commercialization, working with Northwestern University's Innovations and New Ventures Office (INVO). While this system was initially developed for marathons, its applicability can go beyond endurance events.\r\n\r\nThis project addresses several important technology gaps as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application.  The innovation of the data visualization system comes from the integration of data visualization, participant and resource flow simulation, event data, and event management services. As such, the next steps towards commercialization will require advances in data analytics related to event data and operations research decision tools that leverage the data analysis.  System capabilities will be expanded in new directions to allow us to scale up the technology for broader applicability.  The project focuses in three areas: (1) upgrading the simulation model to capture additional flows of resources and participants; (2) merging new streams of event data to more fully capture the nuances of mass gathering events, and (3) developing new event management services that improve decision making for mass gathering events.  In addition, personnel involved in this project, undergraduate and graduate students, will receive innovation and entrepreneurship experiences through INVO.  In particular, INVO offers a series of internship and fellowship programs for these students.\r\n\r\nThe project engages experts in event management and emergency response to guide commercialization aspects, specifically focusing on needed system functionalities in this technology translation effort from research discovery toward commercial reality.",
