 "awd_abstract_narration": "There is a growing need for the integration and/or stacking of multiple chips onto the same platform as the continual reduction of device size has begun to approach physical limits. However, such integration of multiple chips not only exacerbates fabrication, manufacturing, and assembly, but also lowers the yield of end products; this increases the possibility for failure to be induced at various stages of manufacturing processes. As a result, the role of extensive testing to filter any defective or damaged chips out for an emerging next generation chips is becoming increasingly significant. However, the testing of complex next generation chips poses a number of challenges. First, as size of the structures to be tested is reducing, they are more and more vulnerable to damage during testing. In addition to this, the distance between adjacent signal pads is reducing, and thus testing platforms should be able to correspond this drift. With the increasing complexity of integrated chips, the heat generated during testing is rapidly increasing adding further challenges to the testing methodology. Therefore, there is a critical need for a novel platform which can alleviate some current and possible future hurdles allowing electronic design, test and packaging companies to continue device and system level scaling for future generations. With the use of modern electronics spanning from wearables and smart cars to high performance computing and industries, the ability to keep pushing the envelope to get smarter and more efficient electronics would have far reaching effects.\r\n\r\nThe proposed testing platform, is a critical component in the testing of chips and should be able to overcome the challenges mentioned earlier. This team has successfully demonstrated microfluidic cooling on interposer level and have benchmarked the performance compared to the air cooled system. Similarly, the team has carried out extensive research on design, fabrication, and characterization of mechanically flexible interconnects which have high out-of-plane compliance. The proposed advanced testing platform featuring mechanically flexible interconnects and microfluidic cooling system has the potential to revolutionize next generation testing applications by providing efficient thermal management during testing and allowing the probing of dense and smaller structures with minimal damage; this would allow test cost reduction while preventing overheating during test However, the assessment of the proposed technology and the inspection of the readiness for commercialization will be conducted through this program. Also, through the NSF I-Corps program, the team will conduct interviews with various commercial entities in the semiconductor and electronics industry to better understand possible current and future bottlenecks in testing and to investigate how to best position of technologies for this space. With integrated ICs being an integral part of majority of the consumer electronics market, the proposed technology will aid in providing more and more powerful devices to the general public. this technology will also reduce the number of chips damaged during the testing phase and will allow higher yields and lower overheads allowing manufacturers to operate at a competitive price point giving consumers good value for money.",
