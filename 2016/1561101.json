 "awd_abstract_narration": "Securing future sources of sustainable energy is a global challenge that will benefit greatly from international collaboration.  The USA - Pakistan International Conference on Renewable Energy, to be held in Lahore, Pakistan on October 10 to 12, 2016, will facilitate these collaborations.  Pakistan is a developing country that suffers from energy shortages, lacks indigenous energy resources, and depends heavily on imported oil to meet its energy demands.  The energy demand of Pakistan is growing, and environmental pollution associated with the combustion of fossil fuels may increase as well.  A viable solution to secure future energy sources and address environmental issues is to exploit renewable electrical energy sources and environmentally-friendly clean fuels that are sustainable and economically beneficial.  The USA - Pakistan International Conference on Renewable Energy will provide a forum to encourage dialogue between scientists and engineers in the United States and Pakistan, and identify opportunities for scientific collaborations to explore renewable energy options for Pakistan.  This direct communication will facilitate collaborations that could lead to the future development and expansion of markets for renewable energy production in Pakistan as well as in other countries in the region.\r\n\r\nThe conference topics include New Energy International Cooperation, New Energy Storage and Smart Grid Technologies, Solar Energy, Hydrogen Energy and Fuel Cell Technology, Nuclear Energy, Wind Energy, and Other New Energy Sources and Technologies.  The conference will be structured to promote interactions between scientists of different disciplines and stages of their careers that are working in academia, national research laboratories, and industry, in both the US and Pakistan. The conference will also bring entrepreneurs, policy makers and planners side by side with scientists and engineers. The conference will have a floor for exhibition of new renewable energy devices and equipment, as well as books and related literature related to the latest renewable energy advances.",
