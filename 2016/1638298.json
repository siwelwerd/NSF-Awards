This travel support would increase the visibility of the US delegation at this conference, as well build long-term professional networks for the supported early career researchers to enable and encourage them to be active in the IUTAM and ICTAM throughout their career. The travel award will target early career researchers from US, with a significant number selected from underrepresented groups. The early career researchers will be exposed to the latest developments in theoretical and applied mechanics, interact with many of the leaders and pioneers in the field, and to establish professional relationships with their peers. In the long term, such visibility and mentoring will help ensure the presence of leading US researchers in the international theoretical and applied mechanics community.\r\n \r\nICTAM is the leading international Congress for world mechanicians and is organized under the auspices of the International Union of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics (IUTAM). The International Congress is held every four years and includes plenary lectures, mini-symposia, pre-nominated sessions and poster sessions.  The selected group of researchers will be paired with a member of the USNC/TAM or another senior US researcher who will assist the young researchers in identifying key activities and networking opportunities. A mentoring breakfast will also be held early in the Congress so mentors and mentees can interact.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nSummary\n\nThe National Academy of Sciences (NAS) obtained a grant (1638298) to run a travel fellowship program to participate in the 24th International Congress of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics (ICTAM) held in Montr&eacute;al, Canada on August 21-26, 2016.  The International Union of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics (IUTAM) holds ICTAM every four years, and it is an international meeting that covers a broad spectrum of topics, areas, and sessions in mechanics.  The goal of this grant was to increase the numbers of engineers and scientists from U.S. institutions presenting papers at ICTAM, particularly graduate students and junior professionals.  The work was conducted by the U.S. National Committee for Theoretical and Applied Mechanics (USNC/TAM), which is based at NAS.  \n\nIntellectual Merit\n\nTo broaden their knowledge and perspective, U.S. early career scientists were exposed to international meetings where excellence is presented and top researchers gather.  This grant: 1) supported 20 early career U.S. mechanicians in sharing their research at the 2016 ICTAM USNC/TAM, 2) provided opportunities for interaction between U.S. early career scientists and leading U.S. and international mechanicians, 3) provided a mentoring experience, 4) exposed the fellows to new areas of mechanics research, 5) built a network of early career and senior U.S. mechanicians, and 6) fostered international collaborations between U.S. mechanicians and their international peers.  For 90% of the fellows, this was the first time attending an ICTAM and 90% of them are planning to attend the next ICTAM in 2020 in Milan, Italy.  After the experience, 50% of them are considering the idea of organizing a session in an IUTAM sponsored conference.  Ninety percent of travel fellows considered the mentoring experience excellent (30%), very good (30%), and good (30%).  As stated by one of the fellows, \"this congress brings together many researchers in the field of theoretical and applied mechanics which makes it a perfect place to present my research, get feedback and talk to potential collaborators and mentors.  With a wide variety of talks on not just my research area of fracture mechanics but also on fluid mechanics and other areas, I wanted to attend this congress to learn about new and exciting research going on in the theoretical community.\"\n\nBroader Impact\n\nThe enhanced involvement of graduate students and young researchers made possible by the fellowships assist in building a robust academic and research infrastructure in the United States.  The exposure of students and young researchers to international leaders in their field and the opportunity for those leaders to be exposed to our future leaders is of obvious benefit to the scientific and technological strengths of the United States.  Around 64% of the travel fellows were post-docs or assistant professors, 29% were PhD students, and 7% MS students.  The grant had a strong focus on expanding the opportunity to underrepresented minority groups, so the announcement was widely disseminated through many different channels focusing on STEM minorities.  The expanded diversity of the program was reflected most significantly among Asian and Pacific Islanders (57% of the fellows).  Despite focused recruitment efforts, Latinos and African American, unfortunately, did not see the same growth.  Women represented 14% of the fellows, which is the approximate percentage of women graduating in mechanics in the United States.  \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/18/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Ana M Ferreras"
