 "awd_abstract_narration": "Civic engagement, active involvement in issues of public concern, is vital for democracy and helps promote healthy and vibrant communities. However, how children and youth acquire a sense of civic engagement is not well understood. The goal of this project is to investigate how multiple types of civic engagement develop from childhood through adolescence. The study will track whether and how youth become civically engaged over time. The project will explore how civic engagement relates to other developing capacities and to the family, school, and geographical contexts in which youth are developing.  Greater understanding of the developmental foundations underlying civic engagement may contribute to better informed and more involved citizens, and has the potential to directly impact public policy and educational practice.   \r\n\r\nDrawing on relational developmental systems theory, this project will: (i) document distinct patterns of change in different types of civic engagement across childhood and adolescence, (ii) investigate associations between developmental change in youth cognitive, emotional, and social developmental competencies and trajectories of youth civic engagement, (iii) test associations between youths' family, school, and organized activity ecological assets and youth civic engagement, and (iv) examine sequential pathways among ecological assets, developmental competencies, and youth civic engagement to better understand how they unfold over time. This project will add two longitudinal follow-ups to an ongoing study of 2,500 ethnically and socioeconomically diverse youth in grades 4-12 from three geographic areas of the United States. Youth will complete comprehensive surveys assessing ecological assets (parents, school, organized activities), developmental competencies (cognitive, emotional, social), and civic engagement (volunteering, political behavior, political beliefs, social responsibility values, informal helping, civic skills, environmental behavior). Statistical models will test longitudinal and bidirectional associations using latent growth curve and longitudinal structural models. Findings will contribute to a comprehensive theory of youth civic development that describes how and why civic engagement changes across childhood and adolescence.",

We worked with leading statisticians to employee state-of-the-science data analytic techniques for handling missing data including participant attrition. Aligned with our view that civic engagement is multidimensional, youth reported on various civic activities including political activities (intentions to vote, keeping up with political news, engaging in political protests) and non-political behaviors (environmental activities, volunteering, informal helping at school/neighborhood).

We have disseminated these measures to academic and applied research audiences. Questionnaires also assessed civic values, skills, and beliefs. A key project goal is to document age-related change in various forms of civic engagement and map out individual differences in these patterns. We are rigorously examining the longitudinal data using models that leverage our accelerated cohort design. For example, we are finding that trajectories of youth&rsquo;s awareness of societal inequality and civic beliefs differ substantially by race/ethnicity, with Black and Latinx youth showing more accelerated trajectories of awareness of inequality and greater prioritization of social movement forms of political engagement than other youth. These findings advance theory by identifying ways in which civic developmental processes diverge based on youth&rsquo;s experiences and background. Youth reported on normative developmental competencies such as empathy, prosocial moral reasoning, emotion regulation, and perspective taking. Our project advances civic and developmental research by demonstrating the ways in which these competencies intersect with and enhance civic development. Published findings have demonstrated that empathy and future orientation cross-sectionally predict nearly all forms of civic engagement, whereas emotion regulation and prosocial moral reasoning were uniquely associated with specific forms of civic engagement.&nbsp; Links were also stronger or weaker at specific points in development (e.g, middle childhood vs. late adolescence). Longitudinal analyses are ongoing and are indicating that developmental competencies predict increased civic engagement over time, but youth civic experiences also increase developmental competencies. Locating this bidirectional association constitutes a vital contribution to developmental science with implications for practice: Civic engagement may arise from growth in normative competencies, and civic experiences may also spark the development of prosocial emotional, cognitive, and social skills. Our project also collected youth&rsquo;s report of their experiences in developmental contexts such as families, school, peers, and extracurricular activities.  Initial findings indicate that high-quality and meaningful experiences in extracurricular activities predict growth in civic engagement over time. Published work has also shown that at younger ages, parental support and communication predict developmental competencies in general ways, but at older ages, parenting practices link more specifically to particular developmental competencies. This rich longitudinal dataset will be a resource for addressing important civic development questions for years to come, as we continue to address key study aims and share the data with students, colleagues, and the field.
