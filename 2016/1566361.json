 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Chemical Structure, Dynamics, and Mechanisms Program of the NSF Chemistry Division supports the research of Professor Dina C. Merrer in the Department of Chemistry at Barnard College.  Professor Merrer and her students use a highly collaborative approach to investigate the mechanism for addition of carbenes to strained cyclooctynes.  Carbenes are highly reactive groups with only two bonds to carbon instead of the usual four.  Cyclooctynes are the smallest cyclic compounds which can accommodate a carbon-carbon triple bond yet still be stable at room temperature.  These substances have relevance to chemical biology and materials science.  The combination of carbenes with cyclooctynes produces chemical reactions with unusual features of reactivity. The project involves Barnard undergraduates in research activities at Barnard as well as at Colby College, UCLA, and the University of Wisconsin, Madison.  Under development is a modular program on food chemistry for high school teacher professional development.  This teacher development program is aligned with New York State K-12 science learning standards and partners with Barnard NSF-funded Noyes STEM Teacher Scholars and Washington Heights Expeditionary Learning School (WHEELS).  This program serves as a model for a future science teacher professional development academy at Barnard, coordinated by Barnard's Education Program. \r\n\r\nThe Merrer group studies the influence of nonstatistical dynamics on the mechanism of carbene additions to strained carbon-carbon pi bonds.  Both experiment and theory are used to investigate dichlorocarbene and phenylchlorocarbene additions to dibenzocyclooctyne (DIBO) and dinaphthocyclooctyne (DINO).  The objectives of this research are to: (a) investigate the effect of microwave heating in thermal bimolecular reactions of carbenes; (b) probe dynamically affected systems experimentally by entering the mechanistic sequence at a critical midway point; and (c) obtain spectroscopic and nanosecond kinetics data on these systems.  Synthesis, steady-state photochemistry, product analysis, characterization, and calculations are carried out by undergraduates at Barnard College. Collaborative studies on matrix isolation spectroscopy, flash photolysis and quantum chemistry are carried out at the University of Wisconsin, Colby College and UCLA, respectively. Outreach activities to high-need New York City high school students and their teachers, including the beginnings of a science teacher professional development academy, are part of the funded project.",

Understanding inherent chemical reactivity enables predictability of these reactions. Predictability of reactions and the factors that influence those results enable chemists to utilize reactions in specific ways, whether it is to synthesize a new pharmaceutical or consumer product, or harnessing the energy that is released in a reaction for new energy sources.<br /> <br /> The Merrer group uses laboratory experiments complemented by computer modeling to study specific kinds of reactions that contain carbenes. Carbenes are a special class of very reactive carbon-based compounds. Carbene carbons make only two bonds with other atoms, as compared to four in a stable carbon. As a result, carbenes usually have very short (nanosecond or picosecond) lifetimes because they want to react to form four bonds. The Merrer group reacts carbene carbons attached to chlorine on one side and a phenyl (benzene) ring on the other with very strained carbon-carbon (C-C) double or triple bonds. They previously had found these reactions to proceed over a negligible energy barrier (0-3 kcal/mol) with a great release of overall energy (approx. 100 kcal/mol). They had also found these reactions to take surprising routes from start to finish, with multiple reaction paths and/or products generated from a single transition state (energy barrier maximum). This type of unanticipated behavior means that the reactions are under dynamic control: the reactions are controlled by atomic and molecular movement, vibrations, and momentum.<br /> <br /> <strong>Intellectual Merit.</strong> During this grant, Prof. Merrer?s students used ultraviolet light to photochemically react phenylchlorocarbene with C-C triple-bond-containing dibenzocyclooctyne (DIBO, <strong>1b</strong> in Scheme 1). DIBO has many chemical-biology and materials-science uses, including being used extensively in the Nobel-prize-winning click chemistry of Prof. Carolyn Bertozzi, among others. This reaction gave three products: two that appear to contain C-C double bonds (dienes <strong>4b-A-Ph</strong>, <strong>4b-C-Ph</strong>) and one that is more complicated (proposed <strong>4b-B-Ph</strong> or <strong>4b-B-Ph?</strong>). Calculations of these reactions (Figure 1) predict a barrierless reaction that releases 100-120 kcal/mol of energy to give the two dienes <strong>4b-A-Cl</strong> and unexpected product <strong>5b-Cl</strong> where one chlorine atom has changed the carbon to which it is connected. Although it is possible that this unexpected computational product is the ?complicated? experimental product, the experimental evidence finds it to be unlikely. The calculated three-dimensional surface of the reaction implies this reaction to be under dynamic control.<br /> <br /> The Merrer group also followed an unanticipated spinoff of their planned research by making progress towards the synthesis of an open-chain analogue of DIBO (<strong>1a</strong>, Scheme 3). Their experiments proceeded to compounds <strong>9a-Ph</strong> and <strong>9a-Cl</strong>. COVID caused a shift exclusively to computational studies, which could be conducted remotely. Merrer?s students calculated the rotational barrier around the C<sup>2</sup>-C<sup>3</sup> (red) bond<strong> </strong>of <strong>9a</strong> and <strong>23</strong>-<strong>26</strong> (Scheme 4). Surprisingly, the computed surface of each of the nine compounds exhibited two minima with twisted, nearly orthogonal O<sup>1</sup>-C<sup>2</sup>-C<sup>3</sup>-C<sup>4</sup> dihedral angles and two maxima with nearly planar O<sup>1</sup>-C<sup>2</sup>-C<sup>3</sup>-C<sup>4</sup> dihedral angles (Figures 2 and 3). The compounds with R<sup>1</sup> = H each displayed two other additional minima and maxima. We therefore divided the nine compounds into Group I (R<sup>1</sup> = Cl, Ph) with two minima connected by two transition states and Group II (R<sup>1</sup> = H) with four minima and four maxima for the bond rotations. The computed rotational barriers for Group I compounds (5.19-9.75 kcal/mol) were higher than those for Group II compounds (1.15-3.60 kcal/mol). We propose the additional minima/maxima and lower energy barriers in Group II are due to hydrogen-bonding between the vinyl H (R<sup>1</sup> = H) and carbonyl O (O<sup>1</sup>).<br /> <br /> <strong>Broader Impacts.</strong> This grant enabled the purchase of a microwave chemical reactor which was utilized in the Merrer group for research as well as to make advances in the Barnard chemistry laboratory curriculum. With colleague Dr. Richard Denton, Merrer and students synthesized natural product derivatives <strong>19</strong> (Scheme 5) via microwave with reduced temperature and reaction time, and increased yield over conventional laboratory heating. These results were published in the peer-reviewed chemistry journals <em>Heterocycles</em> in 2020 and <em>Synlett</em> in 2021 with Barnard student co-authors. The microwave was used to advance two experiments in Barnard?s chemistry curriculum, making these experiments safer, faster, and giving better product yields.<br /> <br /> Ten Barnard undergraduates participated in the research funded by this grant, including two of whom are members of a group underrepresented in chemistry. In addition to the students? research experience in the laboratory, they interacted with collaborators at UCLA, Swarthmore, and Columbia. Two Barnard students were first authors on the two papers published in peer-reviewed chemistry journals. Ten Barnard students co-authored/presented this research at three National Meetings of the American Chemical Society.
