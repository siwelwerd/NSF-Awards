 "awd_abstract_narration": "A workshop will be held at Whiteface Mountain Observatory to bring together a small group of scientists to design a coordinated measurement strategy to improve the fundamental understanding of cloud-chemistry processes and improve multi-phase chemistry representation in regional and global-scale models. The measurement strategy will include coordinated field, laboratory and modeling studies that address key scientific questions on clouds and chemistry.\r\n\r\nThe expected results of the workshop are: (1) a state-of-the-art protocol for cloud water sampling and paired measurements of key aerosols and trace gases, (2) a plan for a coordinated field, modeling, and laboratory investigation to improve the knowledge of cloud chemistry in the context of the cloud's physical and optical properties, (3) a strategic model development plan to improve representation of cloud chemistry, and (4) preliminary and publicly available chemically characterized cloud samples. The workshop agenda pairs senior and junior scientists at all stages to provide opportunity for younger investigators while ensuring a high likelihood of success by involving senior scientists with proven track records.",
