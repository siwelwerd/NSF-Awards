 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Innovative Technology Experience for Teachers and Students project provides an innovative new model for increasing student interest in STEM careers and active engagement of business and industry partners with grade 6-12 aged youth in Arizona.  The Chief Science Officers (CSO) program expands on the student government model to select one or several youth at each participating middle or high school who would champion campus-wide interest, engagement and communication in STEM.  On campus, CSOs would identify opportunities for speakers, field trips, and science nights.  Off campus, CSOs would participate in community forums and function as the point person for community initiatives in STEM.  Key deliverables include CSO training, on-going mentoring, media materials/guides, and on-going community programming.  Approximately 100 schools and 200 CSOs will be involved each year of the 3-year project.  Numerous businesses will participate in mentoring and community events. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe research would provide insights into how the investment in a small and select group of youth can achieve measurable results for a much larger population of students and communities. Key research questions are:  Does the presence of a CSO within a school significantly raise interest in STEM among the general student body?  Does the active cohort of CSOs within a community increase participation of businesses and industries?  Outcomes will be measured using a quasi-experimental, pre-post design with a treatment group of 4000 participants and a control group of 1000.",

CSO Prisah (Arizona) led workshops for 600 rural underprivileged students in Dharampur, India while attending a family retreat.20+ CSOs (International) advised the US Office of Science and Technology Policy on the importance of youth voice in the 2018 Federal 5-year STEM strategic plan. CSOs Kylin and Hailey (Oregon) established an online tutoring system for middle school students struggling with online schooling. CSO Sahiba (Michigan) trained as a facilitator for the Julia Robinson Mathematics Festival and hosted her own online National Math event.CSOs Makayla, Cynthia, Shae, Kendyl (Florida) organized a video series for their school to engage in a variety of STEM activities from home.CSO Kiersten (New York) showcased STEM during morning video announcements.CSO Amoretta (Texas) served as a mentor to elementary students to code robots.Through these settings, we iteratively evaluated and optimized the following features: Structure - The program starts with schools (typically 2-3 CSOs/site) supported by an advisor and cabinets (~8-12 sites/cabinet) supported by a cabinet coordinator . Training - Students attend an annual Leadership Training Institute (LTI), followed by two regional cabinet meetings during the year. As the number of students continued for additional seasons, the team developed additional training levels focused on advanced leadership and community impact. Virtual - In response to Covid-19, we shifted in-person activities to digital, including LTIs, cabinet meetings, action plans and launched a monthly CSO Saturday and weekly office hours for enhanced engagement and support. Communications - We explored multiple platforms for ongoing communications with CSOs and settled with G Suite. G Suite is now linked to our backbone database to provide dynamic reports and dashboards of student progress. Evaluation outcomes Annual CSO retro pre and post-surveys show consistent gains in skills for designing activities, building relationships, sharing goals, teaching peers a challenging concept, networking, helping others be successful, and inspiring others to advocate for their education. CSO event participant surveys found that events (a) were ?good,? ?very good,? or ?excellent? (93%), (b) increased their interest in the STEM topic (82%), and (c) was their first STEM event attended (41%). Adults rated their interactions as ?very good? or ?excellent?

They also felt prepared to support a STEM event at school (80%) or STEM initiative (75%) and collaborate with other CSOs on projects (84%). The evaluation team held focus groups with 20 Arizona CSOs from 9 schools in 2020.
