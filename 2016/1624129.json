 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Long Term Ecological Research network is developing a children's book series as one component of its broad effort to combine scientific research and science education. The books engage children and their families in learning about the earth's ecosystems through narratives that reflect the research conducted at Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) sites. This project will strengthen and advance the LTER 'schoolyard' book series by completing production of three additional books and by expanding the publication formats of all 12 books to include both eBooks and interactive ePub3 versions. Selected books will be translated into Spanish. Authors and the publisher will work closely with the LTER Communications Office to increase the profile of the book series and to develop a rich resource of materials that can be used by educators throughout the US. \r\n\r\nThe science theme underlying the narrative of each children's book is a topic investigated by LTER researchers; it uses this approach to engage young children from a broad range of backgrounds. This approach is based on an understanding of how children perceive their local environment and encourages young children to develop empathy for the ecosystem in which they live. This empathy can then lead to greater interest in learning more about their own local environments, progressing to interest in other more distant environments as a student matures. This modest award will advance the LTER schoolyard book series in three distinct ways. First, three books currently in development will be completed, bringing to 12 the number of children's books available. The books will represent half of the active LTER projects, bringing knowledge of diverse ecosystems to middle school students. Second, the investigator will develop a formal assessment of the success of the books as educational tools, including their relationship to new science standards. Third, the lead investigator will work with authors, Taylor Trade Publishers, and the LTER Communications Office to develop a business plan for future publications. In the composite these three goals will strengthen an educational book series that has already proved both popular and effective.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOutreach and education are integral components of the NSF Funded Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) Network.  Each site in the Network conducts site-specific education and outreach activities to disseminate its scientific findings and to encourage wider interest in science, especially among children.  One effective way of communicating LTER science to children and their families is through the publication of children?s books that tell stories about the scientific research taking place at different sites.  By publishing these books as part of the Schoolyard LTER book series it becomes possible to highlight the work of the Network as a whole and to help children to think about ecological similarities and differences across different sites. \n\n \n\nThis grant has facilitated the publication of three additional books as part of the Schoolyard LTER book series: The Golden Forest: Exploring a Coastal California Ecosystem (Santa Barbara LTER), One Day in the Desert (Jornada LTER), and Save Our Stream (Plum Island LTER).  500 copies of each of these books were sent to the respective sites for use in outreach and education activities.  In addition, a revised version of And the Tide Comes In: Exploring a Coastal Salt Marsh (Georgia Coastal LTER) was published during this grant in April 2017.\n\n \n\nAs well as publishing these four books, this grant has given us an opportunity to revise the business model of the Schoolyard LTER book series.  The development of the National Communications Office (NCO) for the LTER Network increases opportunities to coordinate the production, marketing, distribution, and educational use of Schoolyard LTER books.  The proposed changes will help the series to continue promoting the outreach and educational goals of the LTER Network into the Future. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/17/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Adrian Howkins"
