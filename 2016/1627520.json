 "awd_abstract_narration": "The term \"emergence\" is sometimes used for the process by which children acquire their first language because all children create language, even as they acquire it. This project addresses how much communicative input children require to eventually develop adult-like language proficiency. It will examine whether the source of the communicative input affects eventual fluency to determine if child learners benefit more from an adult language model or the model provided by same-aged peers. This project also will examine whether the emergence of a new language in a community of speakers or signers parallels or diverges from emergence in a single child who is isolated from users of a fully established sign language.  The findings from this study may inform educational policy and pedagogy for the deaf.\r\n \r\nThese issues will be addressed by studying the gestural communication strategies invented by deaf children and adults who live in Guatemala. Because of their deafness, the participants in this study do not have access to the spoken language in their community, and there is not an established sign language in use in their town. The systems that deaf individuals create under such circumstances are called \"homesign systems.\" Language-like features in these systems emerged in the absence of a language model. Thus the participants in this study lack language input, but they do have a model in the form of other homesign systems created by the other deaf individuals with whom they interact. Under the direction of Dr. Brentari, Ms. Horton will work with families with multiple generations of deafness as well as with deaf children who attend school together. The homesign input that a deaf child receives from a deaf adult relative is construed as a vertical form of transmission, whereas the homesign contact that deaf children attending school together experience is construed as horizontal transmission. The project will analyze the signs that each participant from a different social context produces to understand whether horizontal or vertical transmission accelerates the consistency of the forms and the grammar in each homesign system. Results from this study will be compared to datasets from other homesigners who have had little or no contact with deaf people as well as to native signers who use a more established sign language like American Sign Language.",

Remarkably, even though they are developed without typical linguistic input, when researchers studied these systems they found that they contained many properties that resembled standard sign languages. In this study, we describe homesign systems developed by children who have not been exposed to a standard sign language, but who do have a deaf adult relative, such as a parent or grandparent, or a deaf peer, a sibling or friend, at school.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In the town of Nebaj, Guatemala, the site of this study, all of the deaf people are homesigners because there is no standard sign language in use. However, many deaf people in Nebaj do interact with other deaf people at home, in the market, or at school. We describe three different <em>communicative ecologies</em>, and explore how the characteristics of a homesigner's communicative ecology affects the homesign system they develop. The term <em>communicative ecology</em>&nbsp;describes the social experiences that a person has - who they sign with, whether these communication partners are the same age, how regularly they interact, and where they sign together. These experiences may influence the signs that a signer creates to talk about the world and to communicate things about themselves - to make themselves understood as someone who coommunicates successfully with others. The three communicative ecologies discussed in this study include: <em>family communicative ecologies</em>, to describe families with multiple generations of deafness, <em>peer communicative ecologies</em>,&nbsp;to describe settings like schools with multiple homesigners who are the same age, and <em>individual communicative ecologies</em>, to describe the context of homesigners who are the only deaf person in their family or school (see figure 1).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Studying homesign systems gives us a unique opportunity to observe a new language as it emerges, and to begin to understand the relationship between social circumstances and linguistic structure. We analyzed the homesign systems of each focal child (N=10) on three dimensions: emergent phonology, emergent morphology, and their lexicon of signs. Then we explored the relationship between a signer's communicative ecology and properties of the phonology, morphology, or lexicon of their system.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>One way to think about an emerging phonological level of structure is in terms of the distribution of discrete units within a corpus of signs. We think of this as the dispersion of units which might ultimately be contrastive in the system. We quantify this by measuring the number of unique handshapes in the set of all signs that each homesigner produced. When we compare the number of unique handshapes to the total number of signs, we get a measure we call the <em>dispersion ratio</em>. We find that homesigners from individual and peer ecologies have a higher dispersion ratio than homesigners from family ecologies. This finding speaks to the distribution of complexity and discrete units within emergent sign systems. Future comparative work with standard sign languages will help us contextualize the patterns we find here for homesign systems.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As speakers and signers of established languages, we learn a language that already has a standard vocabulary for us to acquire, a lexicon shared by the surrounding speech or sign community. Homesigners, however, cannot access the vocabulary or grammar of the spoken language in their environment, so in this project we investigated whether they develop their own consistent set of signs. For homesigners in contact with each other, we explored whether they develop a shared vocabulary of the same signs, or maintain separate vocabularies from the systems that they developed on their own. We found that homesigners who are in contact with each other do start to use the same signs, but these shared forms are influenced by gestures from the surrounding community, how often two signers communicate, their age, and their gender. In this work we used two novel methods for comparing the signs that homesigners produced in a task in which they described photos - a jaccard similarity index and a measure we call a lexical diversity index. The first measure allows for a comparison between signers who each produce multiple signs to describe a photo, while the second measure considers the distribution of signs within a homeisgn lexicon, without a direct comparison of sign forms. These techniques, applied to a dataset of over 5,800 signs, offer new strategies for comparing and quantifying homesign lexicons. In addition to these methodological innovations, this project broadens our understanding of homesign systems, from individual children who are the only deaf person in their family, to deaf individuals who are interacting with hearing and deaf family members and peers in diverse and rich communicative ecologies.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/29/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Laura&nbsp;A&nbsp;Horton</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImage\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation onePhoto\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1627520/1627520_10438758_1577675473463_Horton_Figure1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1627520/1627520_10438758_1577675473463_Horton_Figure1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Communicative Ecologies\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1627520/1627520_10438758_1577675473463_Horton_Figure1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Communicative Ecologies\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Diagram of the three types of communicative ecologies compared in this study: individual communicative ecologies with a single homesigner, family communicative ecologies and peer communicative ecologies, with multiple deaf homesigners interacting together in the context of family or school</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Laura Horton</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Laura&nbsp;A&nbsp;Horton</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Communicative Ecologies</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
