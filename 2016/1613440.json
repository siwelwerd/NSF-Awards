 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nontechnical Description of Significance and Importance   \r\n\r\nThere is more pressure than ever before for organizations to actively evidence their social responsibility. This pressure comes from a variety of stakeholders, including employees, consumers, interest groups, and various industry and regulatory bodies. Corporate social responsibility (CSR) comes in many forms, including corporate philanthropy, volunteerism programs, compliance to voluntary codes of conduct, environmental sustainability initiatives, and personnel practices focused on diversity, fairness, and well-being. CSR has become both ubiquitous and entrenched within firm practices, and therefore represents a major operational consideration for organizations. Despite the omnipresence of CSR within organizations, as well as the increasing demand for CSR among stakeholders, there lacks a robust scientific literature focused particularly on the various multilevel influences involved in CSR decision making, implementation, participation, and evaluation. That is, whereas CSR research has largely focused on the relationship between firm social performance and economic performance, as well as the sociological predictors and outcomes of CSR, far less attention has been placed on the structural characteristics of CSR initiatives, as well as psychological phenomena influencing socially responsible and irresponsible behaviors within organizations. This includes a) the motives of leaders and top management teams in building CSR portfolios; b) the drivers of employee compliance with, advocacy for, and/or participation in CSR initiatives; c) the mechanisms by which firm-level CSR actions influence the attitudes and behaviors of organizational members; and d) the impact of CSR initiatives on society. The rich literatures on motivation, decision-making, pro-social behavior, ethics, program evaluation, etc. can be fruitfully applied to more fully understand CSR phenomena. The purpose of the proposed workshop is to identify key conceptual rifts, integrate diverse perspectives, and develop a research agenda focused on \"micro\" CSR processes, as well as CSR research that is both multi-disciplinary and multilevel in nature. As CSR activities connect organizations to government agencies and other regulatory bodies, a more integrated and multilevel understanding of CSR can aid understanding and facilitation of relations between the public and private sectors. Discoveries in this area can also help to facilitate diversity, fairness, and health within organizations and society at large. \r\n\r\nTechnical Description    \r\n\r\nThe proposed workshop will bring together leading corporate social responsibility (CSR) scholars with scholars from other areas within the organizational sciences (e.g., leadership, individual differences, cross-cultural psychology, human resource management, humanitarian work psychology, occupational health psychology, diversity). The lack of direct communication among these sets of researchers is unfortunate insofar as work from both groups can meaningfully contribute to the other. The focus will be on cross-pollination, as well as the sharing and joint-development of new ideas. The workshop will include keynote presentations, topical presentations, facilitated discussions, group work, multidisciplinary discussant comments, and networking opportunities. A key goal will be the identification of new directions for research in this area, the catalyzing of new collaborative and multidisciplinary projects among scholars who might otherwise remain isolated from one another, and the application of advanced research methodologies that have yet to be applied within this domain. Publically disseminated workshop outcomes will include a) a workshop website, containing the program, speaker bios, and where permitted, presentation materials and recordings; b) a press release with information about the event and the link to all of the corresponding materials, c) an overall report summarizing the conclusions, recommendations, and agenda items generated throughout the workshop.",

Examples of CSR initiatives include environmental sustainability programs; initiatives that improve conditions for workers within an organization&rsquo;s supply chain; and both local and international employee volunteer programs. For decades, organizational science has been focused on the benefits of CSR activities to the firm, with much less attention placed on how such organizational activities impact <em>individuals</em>, both internal and external to organizations. Such knowledge about the psychology of CSR (or &ldquo;micro&rdquo; CSR) is needed to inform evidence-based evaluation methods to better understand the impact of CSR within and beyond organizational boundaries.</p>\n<p>NSF Award 1613440 funded a workshop that brought together researchers who study such individual-level processes. The workshop a) targeted key experts across a wide variety of core organizational topic areas (e.g., leadership, diversity, cross-cultural psychology, human resource management, occupational health); b) brought them together with scholars conducting pioneering cross-level CSR research for the sharing of findings and ideas; and c) engaged participants in interactive, focused discussion sessions to integrate ideas and develop new directions for both theory and empirical research.</p>\n<p>The workshop was attended by a diverse set of organizational scientists, including graduate students and professionals working in both academic and corporate/executive roles. The 1.5-day workshop included keynote addresses, panel discussions, break-out groups, and networking opportunities, focused on:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What we currently know about CSR</li>\n<li>Other areas within the organizational sciences that are being applied to advance the study of CSR</li>\n<li>Emerging CSR theory and research</li>\n<li>In-progress CSR research</li>\n<li>Forging new collaborative work</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Throughout the workshop, attendees identified central areas in need of future research. During the second day, participants broke out into groups to further develop their ideas and make plans for follow-up discussion and potential collaboration. Group topics included:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>CSR Initiatives Focused on Internal Stakeholders (e.g., Employees)</li>\n<li>&ldquo;Green&rdquo; Initiatives Focused on Environmental Sustainability</li>\n<li>CSR Initiatives that are Central vs. Peripheral to Organizations&rsquo; Core Missions </li>\n<li>When Organizations Do Not Meet the CSR Expectations of Stakeholders</li>\n<li>CSR Interventions</li>\n<li>CSR Initiatives that Promote Living Wages</li>\n<li>Micro CSR and Positive Psychology</li>\n<li>Leadership and CSR</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the year following the workshop, this preliminary work grew in a number of ways. Twelve attendees are contributing chapters, which extend from their workshop presentations, in the forthcoming <em>Oxford Handbook of Corporate Social Responsibility: Psychological and Organizational Perspectives</em>. A <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDIisRHsSAs&amp;feature=youtu.be\">webinar</a> was conducted providing a summary of the workshop and featuring a panel of researchers and corporate executives entitled <em>Corporate Social Responsibility: Understanding the Triple Bottom Line</em>. A <a href=\"http://www.siop.org/csr/summit.aspx\">website</a> was created, providing public access to the workshop program, attendee biographies, presentations, and other information. A <a href=\"http://my.siop.org/Services/CSR-Prosocial-Humanitarian-I-O-Registry\">CSR registry</a> was developed<strong> </strong>where researchers and practitioners working within CSR can publically list their areas of expertise, such that they can be identified by the public, the press, and each other, in the spirit of further dissemination of CSR science. Finally, a follow-up networking reception was held one year following the workshop to allow for workshop participants, waitlisted participants, and others an opportunity to meet the workshop speakers and each other. The event included updates on research and projects that have come out of the workshop, and allotted time for further collaboration planning.</p>\n<p>This project allowed for organizational scientists from various sub-disciplines to come out of their silos and work together in understanding how organizations engage with society, as well as the impact of such engagement on a variety of stakeholder groups.
