 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Duke Lemur Center (DLC) is a unique institution dedicated to the study and care of the world's most endangered and biologically diverse primates:  The lemurs of Madagascar.  The DLC was founded on the principle that the study of lemurs and related primates can inform larger questions in biology such as the genetic and biological underpinnings of the human condition.  Investigators and students from around the world come to Duke to study the living and fossil collections of the DLC.  The DLC serves as a unique center for scientific inquiry, a hub for student activity, a nexus of knowledge, and a global partner for understanding and mitigating the Earth's escalating environmental challenges.  Founded on the unifying themes of scientific inquiry, scholarship, information, and global engagement, the DLC will capitalize on recent revolutions in genomics, informatics and nanotechnology to make possible much more detailed investigation of its endangered primates and the application of these approaches for enhancing public knowledge of the scientific process. The DLC serves multiple educational communities, including the general public, K-12, undergraduate, graduate, and postgraduate students.  A multitude of opportunities exist for engagement at the undergraduate and graduate student levels.  In the past five years alone, more than 400 students from 98 institutions have engaged in research and/or training activities.  \r\n\t\r\nLemurs are endemic to the biodiversity hotspot of Madagascar, and due to their critically-endangered status, it would be impossible to recreate the taxonomic diversity of the DLC colony that presently contains 19 species.  Over the past five-year period, 276 research projects led by 208 investigators from 100 institutions representing eight countries (primarily the U.S.) have been conducted at the DLC. These projects span a broad array of biological disciplines including, but not limited to, aging, behavioral ecology, biomechanics, cognition, epigenetics, life-history strategy, metabolomics, metagenomics, molecular evolution, neurophysiology, phylogeography, phylogenomics, population genetics, reproductive biology, sensory communication, speciation, and virology.  During this three year project, the DLC will continue to make lemurs readily available to investigators, along with extensive collections of biological samples, decades of medical records, fossil representatives of extinct taxa, and rich life-history records.  The DLC will also release a new version of the mouse lemur genome assembly, which will further enhance the research potential of the mouse lemur colony specifically, and the entire DLC colony by phylogenetic extension. In addition, the DLC will collaborate with Duke University's Center for In Vivo Microscopy, continue in vivo and ex vivo studies to produce an online multidimensional neural atlas of the dwarf and mouse lemurs.  The DLC is also wholeheartedly committed to conservation activities via both ex situ captive management and in-country programs. The DLC's conservation Initiative in Madagascar has already served as a \"landing pad\" for numerous student and faculty researchers engaged in projects ranging from disease transmission, to behavioral ecology, to ecophysiology, to climate change.  On-line access to colony inventories, demographics, metadata, research opportunities, and more is available through two web-based portals.  Details on all facets of the DLC mission and activities can be found online (lemur.duke.edu).",

In doing so, the DLC provides opportunities for scientists, conservation biologists, and educators to work &ndash; independently and together &ndash; to understand and protect these extraordinary animals. The DLC has assembled the largest living collection of endangered primates in the world, and strives to impact research, conservation, and education in the United States and internationally, particularly in Madagascar. The Center was founded on the principle that the study of lemurs and their close evolutionary cousins, the galagos and lorises, can inform larger questions in biology such as the genetic and biological underpinnings of the human condition, the generation and diversity of life on earth, and the relevance of biodiversity conservation towards preserving the capacity for evolutionary innovation. Investigators and students from around the world come to Duke to study the living and fossil collections of the DLC.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With the support of the Malagasy government, the DLC successfully imported two captive-born blue-eyed black lemurs (<em>Eulemur flavifrons</em>) from Madagascar (born at Parc Ivoloina, north of Tamatave) in May of 2017. Acquisition of lemurs from Madagascar, even those born in captivity, has been exceedingly difficult because of strict import and export regulations intended to protect the animals; this transfer marked the first time lemurs have been imported from Madagascar to the United States in 24 years. After arrival, the pair shifted to Northern Hemisphere photoperiod in time to successfully breed in the fall, producing a healthy daughter in the spring of 2018. All three are thriving and the addition of these blue-eyed black lemurs that are genetically unrelated to those in the current colony is a huge asset to the DLC's long-term conservation breeding program. In addition to the blue-eyed black lemurs, the DLC maintains 10 other breeding lemur species and is working with partners at European Zoos to expand captive breeding and conservation programs to a global level (starting with the Coquerel's sifaka, <em>Propithecus coquereli</em>), ensuring colony sustainability into the future.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The continued expansion and reorganization of the Research Department has fundamentally advanced research capacity at the Center. The number of animals used in research projects was fairly consistent at 80-88% of the colony from 2010-2015, and has reached upwards of 96% each year since then. Over the past two years, 162 principal investigators from 65 academic institutions carried out 189 research projects, including 58 undergraduate and 31 graduate student PIs. The number of biological disciplines impacted continues to increase and includes areas as diverse as genomics, virology, cognition, biomechanics, physiology, behavior and ecology. With increased sophistication in non-invasive methods of data collection, the DLC serves as a model institution for the collection of maximum data with minimal disturbance of vertebrate subjects. Moreover, the non-invasive research methods employed contribute to the DLC's system for maintaining animals that are in optimum health, thereby assuring that investigators are retrieving data of the highest possible quality.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>There are many student research and/or training opportunities across all departments not only in the capacity of student PIs as described above, but also as volunteers, interns, or research assistants. On-site student programs have experienced a remarkable increase in interest and participation with 281 high school, undergraduate, and graduate students participating in one of these areas over the past two years.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The DLC also serves multiple education communities, including the general public, K-12, undergraduate, graduate, and post graduate students. Counting all tour types and the newly expanded camp programs, the Center has hosted an average of more than 30,000 visitors per year over the past two years. Of these, there were a total of more than 11,000 K-12 and over 5,000 college or other student visitors. With recent enhancements to our web site (http://lemur.duke.edu) and expansion of our social media presence, the Center has been able to extend our outreach capabilities far beyond the scope of our physical footprint, allowing us to communicate information relating to strepsirrhine biology and conservation to interested communities everywhere.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/09/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Anne&nbsp;D&nbsp;Yoder</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1561691/1561691_10415525_1539115845320_DLC2_Blue-eyed-Black_Import_EflaInfantDam--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1561691/1561691_10415525_1539115845320_DLC2_Blue-eyed-Black_Import_EflaInfantDam--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Critical blue-eyed black lemur infant born at Duke Lemur Center\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1561691/1561691_10415525_1539115845320_DLC2_Blue-eyed-Black_Import_EflaInfantDam--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Critical blue-eyed black lemur infant born at Duke Lemur Center\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A pair of blue-eyed black lemurs was imported from Madagascar in 2017 and produced a stunning female infant in the spring of 2018 (shown here with dam).
