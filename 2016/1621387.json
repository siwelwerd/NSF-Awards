 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Discovery Research K-12 program (DRK-12) seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools (RMTs). Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects.\r\n\r\nThe project at The Center for Technology and School Change (CTSC) at Teachers College, Columbia University, is a four-year, early-stage design and development project aimed to refine a state-of-the-art professional development model to prepare K-8 teachers and instructional leaders in urban schools to facilitate and support successful K-8 STEM Education. This project will explore the most effective features for preparing teachers to design and implement authentic STEM learning experiences in twelve high need elementary and middle urban schools across New York City and Yorkers. The project will specifically explore which components of the program promote teacher change, which aspects of the program support structural changes for STEM teaching in schools, and what holds promise for interdisciplinary STEM teacher development. \r\n\r\nParticipants in this project will design and implement transdisciplinary STEM projects and learn to develop and support STEM learning environments for their schools. As part of this overall process, researchers will refine a situated professional development curriculum, including a suite of digital case studies that will assist schools.  The project will: 1) build a vision for trans-disciplinary STEM schooling; 2) design and implement STEM learning experiences; and 3) take capacity-building steps to sustain STEM practices. A mixed method design approach will be used to explore both the implementation of the project and the effect of implementation on participants.",
