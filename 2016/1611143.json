To meet these goals, GENIAL successfully organized and implemented a Summit, which was held on June 5&ndash;6, 2017 at the Exploratorium in San Francisco, CA. Ninety-one Informal Science Learning (ISL) practitioners, community leaders, media specialists, and researchers from across the United States and Puerto Rico participated. The Summit resulted in a set of actionable insights for sustained engagement of Latinos in ISL, disseminated through Summit proceedings, webinars, and several published articles with selections in English and Spanish. These results contribute to advancing knowledge and understanding within the ISL field, and can inform the work of broadening participation of Latinos in STEM more generally.</p>\n<p>The GENIAL Summit was organized around the following strands:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Strand 1. Latino Audiences</p>\n<p>Strand 2. Marketing, Communications, and Media</p>\n<p>Strand 3. Community Collaboration and Empowerment</p>\n<p>Strand 4. Relevant STEAM Experiences</p>\n<p>GENIAL publications include: Summit proceedings, summative evaluation reports, articles written by project advisors focused on the Summit discussion strands, and a GENIAL executive summary and call to action journal article in <em>Informal Learning Review</em>. These publications expand on the meaning and impact of the following actionable insights: 1. Co-create STEAM experiences with, as opposed to for, Latino communities; 2. Spend time and resources understanding Latino communities and identities; 3. Use data for analysis, reflection, and action in conjunction with community dialogue; 4. Cultivate ownership of the work across every function of the ISL organization to break down barriers and prevent assigning diversity work to only a few staff; 5. Acknowledge and shift power dynamics for authentic reciprocity; and 6. Celebrate successes, accept failure as part of the process, and work towards organizational change.</p>\n<p>GENIAL results were disseminated through two webinars (produced by ASTC and CAISE) for Summit participants and the broader ISL community. The hour long webinars provided opportunity to process the actionable insights of GENIAL in the context of practitioner's own work. Dissemination of GENIAL results also took place internally at the Exploratorium and through the attendance of the GENIAL organizing team and advisors at national meetings including ASTC and AAM.</p>\n<p>Evaluation findings demonstrate that the GENIAL Summit met its stated goals. Like a pebble in the pond, the success of the Summit ripples out into the ISL world as participants actively work towards all the GENIAL ideals at their various institutions throughout the country.&nbsp;Activities which these participants are engaged in are influencing organizational change from varied angles. A majority of the GENIAL-related projects these participants have expanded or initiated since the Summit relate to building human capital, the heart of any organization. They are working to deepen cultural competency and diversity among staff and volunteers. They are also growing relations with Latino communities, and bringing them into the fold for personnel and program development. GENIAL participants expressed a strong affinity for each other, and for all people engaged in efforts to be more inclusive. They also voiced a strong need to be and stay connected with each other, not just to learn from one another, but to provide emotional support and professional development opportunities. Many GENIAL participants feel alone at their institutions; for them this is a difficult fight and it&rsquo;s easy to get discouraged. Participants expressed the desire to be part of a framework of professional development opportunities and continued in-person gatherings at a regional and/or national level.</p>\n<p>The GENIAL Summit offered a renewed and strengthened platform of knowledge and strategies for the participants, who felt supported within a group of colleagues that were dedicated to the same cause. Because the GENIAL Actionable Insights pertain to diverse audiences in general, the Summit results can inform NSF policy makers and federally-sponsored projects focused on increasing STEM engagement of diverse communities more broadly. The Summit, even a full year after its implementation, continues to foster in participants a deeper understanding of how to support cultural identity in STEM through sustained engagement. Such work is critically important to the future and sustainability of the ISL field and to US STEM leadership.</p>\n<p>To learn more about the GENIAL Summit publications, proceedings, webinars, and what's coming next please go to the <a href=\"https://www.exploratorium.edu/education/genial\">GENIAL webpage</a></p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 07/02/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Isabel&nbsp;Hawkins</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1611143/1611143_10425614_1529558987141_genial_postcard_lowresFront--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1611143/1611143_10425614_1529558987141_genial_postcard_lowresFront--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"GENIAL Summit\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1611143/1611143_10425614_1529558987141_genial_postcard_lowresFront--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"GENIAL Summit\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A family at the Exploratorium engaged in ISL</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Photo by Amy Snyder</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Isabel&nbsp;Hawkins</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">GENIAL Summit</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1611143/1611143_10425614_1529559108941_AJF_3045--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1611143/1611143_10425614_1529559108941_AJF_3045--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"CHISPA Program in Miami\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1611143/1611143_10425614_1529559108941_AJF_3045--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"CHISPA Program in Miami\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">CHISPA Family Science Day.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Photo by Alfonso Ju\u00e1rez</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Isabel&nbsp;Hawkins</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">CHISPA Program in Miami</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1611143/1611143_10425614_1529559294199_AJF_7556--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1611143/1611143_10425614_1529559294199_AJF_7556--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"ISL at the Frost Museum of Science\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1611143/1611143_10425614_1529559294199_AJF_7556--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"ISL at the Frost Museum of Science\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Children exploring the immersive digital exhibition River of Grass at the Phillip and Patricia Frost Museum of Science, Miami</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Photo by Alfonso Ju\u00e1rez</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Isabel&nbsp;Hawkins</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">ISL at the Frost Museum of Science</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1611143/1611143_10425614_1529559441909_CHISPADIRTYJOBPICBrightonParkChicago--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1611143/1611143_10425614_1529559441909_CHISPADIRTYJOBPICBrightonParkChicago--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"CHISPA Program in Chicago\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1611143/1611143_10425614_1529559441909_CHISPADIRTYJOBPICBrightonParkChicago--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"CHISPA Program in Chicago\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Children learning about helping birds impacted by oil spills during the CHISPA afterschool science program at Brighton Park Neighborhood Council, Chicago</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Photo by Cheryl Flores</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Isabel&nbsp;Hawkins</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">CHISPA Program in Chicago</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1611143/1611143_10425614_1529559577408_DH_Media_3--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1611143/1611143_10425614_1529559577408_DH_Media_3--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Latino Youth Engaged in STEM\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1611143/1611143_10425614_1529559577408_DH_Media_3--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Latino Youth Engaged in STEM\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Latino youth learn about the human body.
