 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project uses the Greater Caucasus Mountains in southern Asia as a natural laboratory to study the early stages of mountain building.  Using data from over 106 new seismic stations in Azerbaijan, Armenia, Russia, and Georgia, the researchers gain a better understanding of the recent uplift of the Greater Caucasus and the nature of earthquake related deformation in the region. This research helps gain better understanding of the processes that lead to the formation of mountain belts on Earth and the sub surface processes that lead to large earthquakes and volcanoes in a continental collision. This project includes improving seismic hazard assessment in continental deformation belts where thousands of lives and billions of dollars are at risk from recurrent devastating earthquakes including some of the world's largest energy producers. The aim is to improve the scientific community's understanding of earthquake hazards and the forces that are actively deforming the earth in a very young mountain belt.  \r\n\r\nThe Caucasus region is a logistically and politically challenging region to collect seismic data; however, we have managed to establish collaborative agreement with all of the countries involved in this project to share the data with one another.   Due to a lack of quality data, the region has largely been unexplored in terms of the detailed uppermost mantle and crustal seismic structure thus this work is nearly guaranteed to find first order information concerning deep structure beneath the Greater Caucasus.  This seismic experiment has two components:  (1) a grid of stations spanning the Greater Caucasus and (2) a seismic transect consisting of passive stations spaced at distances of less 5 km that crosses the Greater Caucasus. In addition to the temporary stations, this research integrates data from the national networks to produce high resolution images of the seismic structure. The primary scientific question that this project intends to resolve with the images of the deep subsurface structure is the uplift mechanisms for the Greater Caucasus and how these relate to the uplift mechanisms for mountain belts in general.",

This project aims to understand parts of how these mountains formed over the last 10 million years. This is a very politically challenging part of thw world with 5 five armed conflicts having occurred in the last 30 years, however, we were able to bring scientists together from Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan and Russia to better understand these mountains and the nature of large earthquakes that are likely to occur in this region.\n\n\nStarting in June and May of 2017, teams from the University of Missouri, Michigan State University, and the Oregon State University successfully deployed seismic stations across the entire southern Greater Caucasus. This worked continued for another six years and in three different phases recording over 3 Terabytes of data in total. Figure 1 shows a map showing all of the stations installed over those six years. All US, Georgian, Armenian, Azeri, and Russian scientists shared data from all of their respective earthquake recording networks. This dataset has been and will be continued to be used to study the nature of earthquakes in this important region. It is important to note that this region is one of the world's leading energy producers and a large earthquake could seriously affect the stability of region and world wide energy availability thus understanding earthquake here is important for the global economy.\n\n\nWe have used the data from the stations in the region to make precise maps of where these earthquake occurred and we have made a few important discoveries. First, we see evidence of a band of deep earthquakes shown in the cross sectional plots in Figure 2. This band of deep seismicity likely marks the top of a subductin plate beneath the eastern half of the Greater Caucasus which is likely the mechanism of uplift for this part of the mountain range. We have also found very unusualy deep earthquakes south of the mountains that we are still trying to understand.\n\n\nRecently this region experience one of the largest earthquakes to occur in the past 100 years in southeast Turkey about a 1000 kilometers from the Greater Caucasus. The seismic stations that we and others deployed in this region recording some very interesting signals shown in Figure 3. We believe these high frequency signals are something seismologist call \"tremor\" and are often in other subduction zones across Earth. This kind of signal is consistent with a process known as slow-slip which migh help alleviate some of the stress build up that can lead to large earthquakes. It might be that tremor is more common is this region that we previously have known which is important for understanding the potential for large earthquakes in this region.\n\n\nOverall this project has given us very valuable insights into how this and potentially other mountain belts form across our planet. Using the very extensive network of seismic stations we will be able to analyze this data for many years into the future to learn more about this young mountain belt.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/05/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: EricSandvol\n"
