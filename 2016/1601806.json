 "awd_abstract_narration": "The evolutionary processes that have produced current patterns of species diversity are poorly understood. The best groups to better understand these processes are those that have radiated quickly both in terms of species number and morphological form. This study will use a group of gecko lizards restricted to Australia, New Zealand, New Guinea and associated islands in the Pacific Ocean (Australasia) that exhibit a diversity of body-forms, ranging from fully limbed species that are very adept climbers to terrestrial forms completely lacking limbs.  Researchers will reconstruct evolutionary relationships within the group and then investigate how changes in geographical distribution within the area have affected the rate of species formation and the rate of change in morphological form. One graduate student and several undergraduate students will be trained in laboratory techniques.  Findings from the research will be incorporated into a K-12 classroom activity and will also be broadly disseminated to the public. \r\n\r\nThis project aims to improve understanding of the phylogenetic relationships among Australasian geckos by using an ultraconserved elements (UCEs) phylogenomics approach. All of the estimated 200 species in the clade will be sampled for 5,000 published UCE loci to produce a well-supported phylogeny for the group. Pipelines developed in the Museum of Vertebrate Zoology will be used for DeNovo assembly. Concatenated and coalescent species trees (ASTRAL, ASTRID, SNAPP, and MP-est) will be used. A large ecomorphology dataset for this group of geckos (150 species, 1,100 specimens) has been assembled using photographs and 24 linear measurements to test questions regarding phenotypic evolution. The resulting species-level phylogeny will then be used to infer heterogeneity in net diversification rate across the tree and heterogeneity in the diversification of certain ecologically relevant characters using phylogenetic comparative methods. These same ecomorphological characters will also be used to test the prevalence of convergent evolution in unrelated geckos in this clade.",

This is a diverse group of geckos with over 200 species separated into three families: the Diplodactylidae, Carphodactylidae, and Pygopodidae. This radiation, or clade, is entirely endemic to mainland Australia and the nearby archipelagos of New Guinea, New Caledonia, and New Zealand. Despite accounting for less than 12% of all gecko species globally, the diplodactyloids are the most anatomically diverse group of geckos with some of the world&rsquo;s smallest species as well as the world&rsquo;s largest. Furthermore, it is the only group of geckos to have evolved limbless forms reminiscent of snakes. Despite their diversity, previous studies have failed to construct fully resolved evolutionary trees and few have asked questions regarding the tempo at which new species and phenotypes have formed. Here, I use an entirely new genetic dataset utilizing 4,268 genes to estimate the relationships amongst 180 species of diplodactyloid gecko and, using an anatomical dataset for a subset of 145 species, test how anatomical traits have changed over time. To date, this represents the largest genetic dataset for a group of geckos. This new evolutionary tree is the most statistically well-supported tree yet for this clade, with high confidence being recovered for nearly all relationships between species. This new dataset also indicates that this group is somewhat older in geologic terms than previously thought, with the earliest divergence events occurring around 76 million years ago during the late Cretaceous. Using various statistical methods, I found that the rate of species formation is effectively the same across the whole diplodactyloid tree. This pattern failed to support my hypothesis that the groups endemic to the islands of New Caledonia and New Zealand would have higher rates of species formation than those on the mainland. Additionally, I found that most of the anatomical traits examined evolved at similar rates between and within groups. However, a handful of traits were found to have much higher rates of evolution in some clades than others, sometimes by an order of magnitude. These shifts in the rate of trait evolution were likely associated with recent over-water colonizations to islands and the invasion of new habitats such as grassy and sandy regions. Lastly, using the same anatomical data, we find that convergent evolution has occurred extensively across the diplodactyloid family tree being tied almost exclusively in the two major island radiations (New Caledonia and New Zealand). This study highlights the power of evolutionary constraint on a lineage&rsquo;s ability to experience rate shifts in species formation and trait evolution. Rather, these same lineages may be able to stably generate extensive diversity given enough evolutionary time and ecological opportunity.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 09/28/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Phillip&nbsp;Skipwith</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImage\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation onePhoto\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1601806/1601806_10415320_1537901230059_5_rax_treePRUNED2_outgroups--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1601806/1601806_10415320_1537901230059_5_rax_treePRUNED2_outgroups--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Likelihood tree\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1601806/1601806_10415320_1537901230059_5_rax_treePRUNED2_outgroups--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Likelihood tree\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Phylogeny (evolutionary tree) displaying relationships of diplodactyloid geckos inferred from 4,268 genes</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Phillip L Skipwith</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Phillip&nbsp;Skipwith</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Likelihood tree</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
