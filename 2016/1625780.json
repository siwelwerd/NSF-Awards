 "awd_abstract_narration": "A magnetic field, measured in Tesla, is a fundamental physical variable, similar to pressure. As  a reference, the Earth's magnetic field is of the order of 0.5mT (milli Tesla). Although X-ray diffraction at high pressures is now a common technique, X-ray diffraction and scattering techniques at steady state magnetic fields above 15 Tesla are unavailable. The new 25 Tesla Florida Split Coil Magnet provides the opportunity to change this, increasing the accessible steady-state magnetic field for X-ray studies by nearly 66%. Adding a diffraction setup to the Florida Split Coil Magnet that is located at the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory in Tallahassee, will provide unique capabilities to probe the magnetic responses in crystalline materials. The instrument will facilitate structural studies in high magnetic fields for the broader research community. Examples of materials to be studied include superconductors, ferro- and antiferromagnetic materials, as well as engineering materials. An example of the latter is rolled steel, where a martensitic phase transition can be induced at low temperatures by magnetic fields in excess of 12 Tesla. The diffractometer will consist of an X-ray source, a beam delivery system, a sample holder, and an area detector. Due to the large fringe fields emanating from the magnet, it is imperative to include magnetic field mitigation in the design of the diffractometer. Electronic and mechanical components susceptible to magnetic fields need to be removed from the space where strong fringe fields are present, requiring custom built and custom modified devices and parts. To enhance the X-ray flux delivered to the sample, additional optical elements reflecting and focusing the X-ray beam, will be included. The diffractometer will become part of the user capabilities at the NHMFL, and will be available to the user community at large via the NHMFL proposal system. The instrument will be the only one of its kind, leveraging the investment of NSF in the NHMFL and the Florida Split Coil Magnet.\r\n\r\nThe National High Magnetic Field Laboratory (NHMFL) is at the forefront of resistive magnet technology, and holds the world record in DC magnetic field strength. The recent addition of the world's strongest split coil magnet, with 25T field strength and visual access to the sample allows the development of a novel X-ray diffractometer to study the spin-lattice coupling of materials at high fields. Spin-lattice interactions in crystalline materials where spin order or orbital order elicits an elastic response of the lattice that can be studied. Diffraction techniques are well suited to detect this elastic response via unit cell changes, with high accuracy. Additionally, a magnetic field can also induce magnetic phase transitions and magnetic order, and order temperatures can be shifted. Magnetostrictive effects are observed in a number of ferro-, antiferro-, and helimagnetic materials, as well as multiferroic materials that couple ferroelectric and ferromagnetic order via the magneto-electric effect. The diffractometer will consist of an X-ray source, a beam delivery system, a sample holder, and an area detector. Due to the large fringe fields, in excess of 0.2T, emanating from the magnet, it is imperative to include magnetic field mitigation in the design of the diffractometer. Electronic and mechanical components susceptible to magnetic fields need to be removed from the space where strong fringe fields are present, requiring custom built and custom modified devices and parts, together with passive and active magnetic field shielding. The diffractometer includes a high power rotating anode X-ray source, optical elements such as X-ray mirrors, evacuated beam paths, beryllium windows, a custom sample holder, and a modified X-ray area detector adapted to perform in the strong fringe fields at the X-ray exit port. The diffractometer will become part of the measurement capabilities at the NHMFL for the 25T split coil magnet, and will be available to the user community at large. The instrument will be the only one of its kind, leveraging the investment of NSF in the NHMFL and the Florida Split Coil Magnet. This system will complement the pulsed magnets at national synchrotron light sources, and it increases the available DC field strength for diffraction experiments. Development of the instrument is an excellent opportunity to train a student and postdoc in the construction and integration of components, building an instrument with unique capabilities.",

A number of different responses are observed, for instance ferromagnetism or more general, magnetic order. Often, magnetic order is accompanied by a structural response: the material deforms in the presence of a magnetic field. Such a response can be probed using X-ray methods, in particular X-ray diffraction, where small changes to the periodicity of a crystalline material can be detected. In this NSF award, a unique X-ray diffraction instrument was developed that leveraged the investment of NSF in the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory (NHMFL), where the 25 Tesla Florida Helix magnet is located. This magnet is the world&prime;s strongest split coil magnet, about 50,000 times stronger than the earth&prime;s magnetic field and allows optical access to the material under study, or sample, through the side of the coil. This geometry can be used to build an X-ray Diffraction (XRD) system, where access to the sample over a large angular range is needed. We developed an XRD system for the NHMFL 25 Tesla Florida Helix magnet, where several issues due to the large magnetic field strength had to be considered. Among the obstacles were that strong magnetic fields negatively affect electric motors and modern electronics. In addition, the generation of X-rays uses tube technology, where an electron beam is created that is aimed at a metallic target to generate X-ray radiation that is characteristic to the element that is bombarded by the electrons. However, electrons are the lightest elementary particles and are deflected in magnetic fields. This necessitated that the X-ray source be located far from the magnet, and that additional magnetic shielding had to be applied to eliminate any influence of the field emanating from the magnet. Furthermore, the modern direct readout X-ray detector had to be modified so that it could tolerate the high magnetic fields close to the magnet openings.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The XRD system was extensively tested and good resolution and short data acquisition times were achieved.

It was found that the shape change is highly anisotropic, with contraction along one direction, and elongation along directions perpendicular to the first direction upon application of a magnetic.
