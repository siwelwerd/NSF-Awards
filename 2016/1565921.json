 "awd_abstract_narration": "Digital  circuits  made  up  of  transistors  are  the  components  inside  computer  chips  that operate nearly all the computing devices (e.g. servers, desktops, laptops, tablets, smartphones, and wearables) in use today.  Although we can pack more than a billion transistors in one square centimeter, it is becoming increasingly difficult to make full use of them because they consume too much energy. Today, methods to lower the energy consumption always come with a price?reduced speed, which in turn makes them less capable to perform more challenging tasks (e.g. face recognition by smartphone).  This team has developed a new way to design digital circuits that consume much less energy (ranging from 20% to 40%) without sacrificing performance and can be made smaller. Thus the proposed technology will reduce energy consumption of digital systems, extend the battery life and/or improve the capabilities of laptops, tablets, smartphones and other battery powered systems. Another significant advantage of the proposed circuits is that they can be designed with the same commercial tools and the same semiconductor fabrication processes  that  are  used  by  companies  today,  \r\nenabling  easy  and  rapid  adoption  by industry. \r\n\r\nHigh  performance,  low-\u00ad&#8208;power  digital  circuits  are  required  for  a  large  class  of  products including smartphones and wearables. Current semiconductor solutions rely on clock and power management to reduce energy consumption, but reduction in energy per operation has relied on technology scaling with diminishing returns. This I-Corps team has developed a digital circuit implementation technology, that reduces joules/operation and area without compromising speed, and is based on three fundamental advances in CMOS logic design, all patent protected.  (1) Robust, low power threshold logic circuit design, (TLG), that combines the functionality of a large set of complex functions, and a flip-\u00ad&#8208;flop into a single  cell.  (2)  A  standard  cell  library  of  TLGs,  which  is perfectly  compatible  with conventional  cell  libraries  used  by  commercial  synthesis, optimization  and  physical design tools. (3) Software that optimizes a given logic network using cells and conventional logic cells, resulting in a hybrid design.  All three - the circuit architecture, cell library and design software - were designed to ensure 100% compatibility with existing  commercial  design  flows,  allowing  fully  automated  synthesis,  optimization  and layout using commercial tools.",

IoT devices will primarily employ 40nm and 28nm technologies.  Thus our initial target will be the fabless companies in the IoT market. \n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/10/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Sarma K Vrudhula"
