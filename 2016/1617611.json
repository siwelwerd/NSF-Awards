 "awd_abstract_narration": "Robots are projected to become ubiquitous in homes, hospitals, schools, and other everyday spaces, where they will have to interact not with experts but rather with ordinary people - adults, the elderly, and children, from different cultural backgrounds.  But untrained users may have negative beliefs, emotions, and attitudes about robots, due to lack of familiarity, which present potential challenges to their acceptance.  Furthermore, multiple people will interact with multiple robots.  Interaction between human and robot groups may be especially problematic, because intergroup interactions among humans are generally more negative, uncooperative, and aggressive than interactions between individuals, and human reactions to technological artifacts often resemble their reactions to other humans.  In this project the PI will draw upon research from social psychology that has examined stereotyping, prejudice, and intergroup conflict, and will   apply established and validated theories and methods to develop: (a) measures that can be used to understand the extent, nature, and bases of people's negative reactions to robots; (b) theoretical models of the causes and consequences of these negative reactions; and (c) interventions that demonstrably reduce negative beliefs, attitudes, and behavior in intergroup human-robot interaction (HRI).  Project outcomes will suggest ways to reduce or eliminate crucial barriers to future robotics applications that are due to people's beliefs, attitudes, and emotions. \r\n\r\nNine studies will be conducted over three years.  In Year 1, online and in-person measures will be administered to understand participant attitudes toward robots, and investigate fundamental factors that contribute to negative reactions.  In Year 2, group contact, perspective taking, and long term exposure will be explored as ways to reduce prejudice toward robots.  In Year 3, two more approaches to prejudice reduction in HRI will be tested: recategorization and norm-based intervention.  A final study will evaluate the interaction and design strategies found to be most successful in fostering positive intergroup HRI by implementing them in robots interacting with people in a naturalistic setting.  The studies will involve participants of different ages, socio-economic status, and cultural background (including four studies in Japan).  Because HRI has mostly focused to date on one-on-one interactions between people and robots, this application of psychological theory to HRI in groups has vast transformative potential.",

Additionally, social psychological research on intergroup interactions shows that people perceive and behave differently towards individuals and groups, and to ingroup and outgroup members. Grounded in this prior research, our studies explored four main themes: (1) people's reactions to multiple (as opposed to single) robots; (2) characteristics of robot groups, such as appearance and behavioral synchrony, that may influence people's responses; (3) tests of interventions that have been demonstrated to reduce prejudice in humans; and (4) tests of other theoretical predictions about group HRI drawn from work on human intergroup behavior. In the course of the project, we performed 21 studies with over 3200 participants in total. These included online survey studies, experimental lab studies, and field studies in public spaces. Several of these studies examined cultural differences between the US and Japan. The main findings of the project are summarized below.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We expected exposure to or interaction with multiple robots (compared to a single robot) would emphasize the intergroup nature of the situation, leading people to perceive the robots as more similar to each other and more different from humans, or to be more aggressive and competitive within the interaction. Our findings in studies that explored the effects of the robot number suggest that, though people do respond differently to multiple compared to single robots, the nature of the responses is also affected by other contextual factors, including the robot behavior, robot type, and in some cases the participant population. For example, participants evaluated multiple humanoid robots more positively than multiple single humanoids, while the opposite was true of mechanomorphic robots.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We also explored the group-level characteristics of robots that may affect people's perceptions and behaviors. These included entitativity (the extent to which multiple robots are perceived as a group, due to identical appearance, synchronized movements, or other factors) and the nature of robots' behavior toward humans and toward each other (e.g. competitive or collaborative, social or functional). These studies generally confirmed our expectations that entitative robots will be viewed more negatively than diverse ones in a competitive context, and more positively when they are cooperating with humans. They also support the novel hypothesis that in a group, robots' behavior toward each other has consequences for the way they are perceived: Social rather than functional behavior of the robots increased perceptions of anthropomorphism, while social behavior toward humans resulted in more positive perceptions overall.</p>\n<p>We performed several studies to examine how we might reduce prejudice toward robots based on techniques that have been successful in studies among humans. These interventions included individualized contact with outgroup members (robots), taking the perspective of an outgroup member, presenting the robot as a collaborative team member, and exploring the effects of explicit and implicit social norms on participants' perceptions of robots. Overall, presenting robots as teammates had the strongest and most reliable positive effects. In fact, the effects of team or group membership were so strong that, in our studies, participants responded more positively to ingroup robots than to outgroup humans. The other manipulations we tested, previously found to improve attitudes toward human outgroups, did not have similar effects for robots. We found no significant effects of direct or indirect contact with robots, or of perspective taking in a physical instantiation or based on instructions to take a robot's perspective. Manipulations intended to shift perceived norms had scattered effects that were inconsistent across studies.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A final finding from our studies concerns the impact of emotions on people's willingness to interact with robots. Willingness to interact in the future with robots is important because it can begin a virtuous cycle in which interaction can reduce prejudice, which encourages even more interaction, and so on.&nbsp;We examined whether positive or negative emotions are more powerful predictors of willingness to interact. Prior work has often focused on negative emotions (especially anxiety), but based on combined data from five studies that used different types of robots and different modes of interaction (live vs. video), we found that positive emotions were stronger predictors of participants' willingness to interact with robots in the future than negative emotions.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Overall, the findings from our project show that group human-robot interaction differs in various ways from one-on-one interaction, and should be taken into explicit consideration in the design and deployment of robots.&nbsp;&nbsp;The project also had broader impacts in the form of research participation of five graduate and over twenty undergraduate students, educational outreach to children, strengthened connections with researchers in Japan, and the organization of several academic workshops and seminars on the topic of group HRI.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified:
