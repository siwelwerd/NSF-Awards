 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this grant is to provide funding for the International Workshop on Operator Theory and Applications (IWOTA) to be held July 16-22, 2016 on the campus of Washington University in St. Louis.  IWOTA is an annual conference that has been held throughout the world and it returns to the United States for the first time since 2008.  IWOTA brings together mathematicians from around the world in both pure and applied areas (related to the field of operator theory) for the purposes of collaborating, sharing new research, and educating graduate students and early career researchers.  IWOTA 2016 makes a special effort to increase the participation of underrepresented groups in mathematics through its selection of speakers and its designation as a conference conducted \"in cooperation with the Association for Women in Mathematics.\"  The funds for this grant will be used to support the travel of main speakers as well as graduate students and early career researchers.\r\n\r\nIWOTA has two main scientific goals.  First, it serves as a meeting place for mathematicians in the field of operator theory.  Many of the main speakers of the conference are experts in operator theory with recent innovations to share with the broader community.  The conference has numerous special sessions to allow subgroups within operator theory (such as free analysis/probability, applied harmonic analysis, and systems and function theory) to collaborate.  Second, IWOTA has always had the goal of increasing the interaction of pure operator theorists, applied mathematicians, and engineers.  IWOTA 2016 intends to continue this tradition through its main speakers and special sessions.\r\n\r\nhttp://openscholarship.wustl.edu/iwota2016/",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe 27th meeting of International Workshop on Operator Theory and Applications (IWOTA) was held at Washington University in St. Louis from July 18 to July 22 of 2016 with the generous support of the National Science Foundation.\n\nIWOTA was originally conceived as a satellite conference to the biennial Mathematical Theory of Networks and Systems symposium, which in 2016 was held at the University of Minnesota.  The mathematical theory of networks and systems is an area of engineering mathematics often concerned with questions of control and feedback such as designing a thermostat or an automatic pilot.  The mathematical sophistication of this field has increased over the years to the point where it was beneficial to have a conference like IWOTA to expose pure mathematicians to this mathematics.  IWOTA 2016 has continued in this tradition while also serving as a valuable meeting place for the field of operator theory as a whole.  Operator theory, a field of mathematics originally conceived as a language for quantum mechanics, has proven itself to be a much more broadly applicable field notable for its utility in systems theory as well as many areas of pure math. \n\nIWOTA 2016 was a successful meeting by all accounts.  Over 160 people attended.  There were 20 plenary lectures by distinguished mathematicians and engineers.  The topics included fundamental operator theory, pure and applied harmonic analysis, complex function theory, mathematical systems theory, and the newer area of noncommutative inequalities and function theory. The afternoons of the conference consisted of 10 special sessions and 6 contributed talk sessions. \n\nIWOTA 2016 was also successful in expanding the opportunities of junior researchers and underrepresented groups in mathematics.  This NSF grant was used to help support the attendance of 18 graduate students, and 9 junior researchers as well as 13 senior researchers and the 20 plenary speakers.  IWOTA also gave all participants the opportunity to speak in one of our contributed talk sessions.  IWOTA 2016 also held a panel discussion about women in mathematics with a focus on the experiences of women in mathematics in several different countries.  Eight out of the twenty plenary speakers at IWOTA were women.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/02/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Greg Knese"
