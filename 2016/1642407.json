 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Directorate of Geosciences supports over six hundred students each year to participate in Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site programs at about sixty institutions across the country. Competition to be accepted to these programs is fierce, with most programs having a selectivity of 6% or less. These sites provide research experiences for students who are likely to become the future geoscience workforce, and therefore, it is important that the scientists who manage them are aware of current best practices in student recruitment, career training, ethics training and other professional development practices. This award provides support for a workshop to be held at the University Corporation For Atmospheric Research in September, 2016 so that NSF GEO REU site managers can facilitate the sharing of effective management strategies. During the 1.5 days of the workshop, about 55 representatives of GEO REU programs will meet to continue the development of community connections between REUs, offer training for new REU site directors, and allow for advances on issues such as adapting REUs for community college students, supporting students from all backgrounds, and assessing the combined impact of REU-type programs in the Geosciences. \r\n\r\nThe goal is to improve how REU Sites engage students in science through research experiences, both by improving the experience for REU participants and by broadening the student population that is accessing these opportunities. Collaboratively, the PIs will contribute to the common understanding and research base of this educational approach. The workshop is critical in achieving these goals because it allows PIs who live in geographically disparate locations to work together intensively over a couple of days.\r\n\r\nThe workshop will bring together the REU managers from across the Geosciences Directorate to support the sharing of strategies in running inclusive and effective programs. The workshop builds on prior NSF-funded workshops for GEO REU PIs in 2011 and 2014, and the face-to-face interactions between PIs has helped to facilitate further sharing of insights and tools in the intervening years. In particular, PIs learned about ways to recruit students from populations that are underrepresented in the geosciences, including students with disabilities, Veterans, first-generation and non-traditional students and those from community colleges and minority-serving institutions. The 2016 workshop will repeat this training for new PIs and will further the discussion to include ways to connect students with appropriate support and networks after their participation in an REU to ensure they are retained in the geosciences.",
