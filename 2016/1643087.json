We also aim for exchanging young scientists, including the graduate students. The Forum proceedings and findings will be published on Carnegie Mellon website,  and will be available to a broad audience in addition Published as a special issue journal publication.\r\n\r\nTechnical:\r\nThe novel contribution of this Forum is its ability to bring together a bi-national community of expert researchers and innovators who are working on the leading edge of brain-inspired computing and nano-biomimetics for sustainable WE. The proposed forum will simulate efforts to promote nanotechnology for the next generation by fully utilizing nanotechnology convergence and biomimetric methods. The outcome will lead to milestone for the timely technology. Along with the exchange of ideas among the leading scientists and engineers in nanotechnology area, this Forum will recommend timely new paradigms in this field for the next decade and promote collaborative initiatives between the two countries. This Forum will contribute to society, and the global environment and econo.",
