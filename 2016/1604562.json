They will study the mechanics at the subcellular level to understand transduction of mechanical stresses and the roles of key proteins in both focal adhesion and the cell cortex.\r\n\r\nThe key technical advance this project will pursue is to incorporate FRET (Forster resonance energy transfer)-based tension sensors into the current quantitative phase imaging platform. Tension sensors were developed by incorporating two fluorophores into load-bearing proteins. Traditionally dynamic loading has required indirect measures and complex devices. The proposed platform will be able to directly visualize cell stresses and to do so without mechanically displacing the cell. Further technical advances will develop FRET sensors for a load-bearing protein in the cell cortex to enable simple, reproducible loading of cells while preserving imaging capabilities.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project investigated the use of a holographic imaging technique to study how cells respond to applied forces.  Understanding how cells perceive force is an important aspect to identifying their behavior in fields such as tissue engineering, where applied force is necessary to generate various tissue types, and cancer biology, where changes in force sensitivity can influence how cells become metastatic.\n\nThe advances in this project included development of multiple imaging and analysis techniques.  The holographic technique allowed us to see nanoscale changes in cell due to applied flow of cell media.  This allowed us to contrast the mechanical properties of different types of cancer cells which can help in understanding cancer biology but also may be useful as a diagnostic.  The cells were specially prepared to with fluorescence (FRET) based sensors which responded to local applied forces to illustrate how the force was experienced by the cell.  These sensors are useful in cell biology and here we showed that in combination with holography, precise information can be obtained.  We also conducted several analyses which improved our understanding of how the measurements made here were linked to previous efforts to examine cell mechanics, such as atomic force microscopy and disorder strength. These studies will help improve the utility of the advances shown here by showing connections with existing knowledge.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/30/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Adam P Wax"
