 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation Program (MRI) and support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program (CRIF), Professor Miroslav Peric from California State University Northridge and colleagues Radha Ranganathan and Jussi Eloranta have acquired an X-band electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectrometer. This instrument will allow research in a variety of fields such as those that provide insight on how biologically relevant species behave as well as advance environmental studies. In general, an EPR spectrometer yields detailed information on the geometric and electronic structure of molecular and solid state materials. It is also used to obtain information about the lifetimes of free radicals, short-lived, highly reactive species involved in valuable chemical transformations as well as the initiation of pathological tumor growth. These studies impact a number of areas, from the synthesis of inorganic and organic molecules to the development of new solid state materials to compounds of magnetic and biological interest. Employing examples inspired from ongoing research, this instrument is an integral part of research and teaching at California State University Northridge. The instrument provides students with outstanding practical experience in modern instrumentation.\r\n\r\nThe award is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels, especially in areas such as studying (a) translational and rotational diffusion of spin nitroxide probes in protein-phospholipid aggregates and ionic liquids; (b) mechanistic and kinetic studies of radical intermediates in wastewater treatment; (c) physicochemical characterization of molecular aggregates; (d) electron rich aromatic and diene interactions with electron-poor imidazolium compounds; (e) bimolecular collisions in low-viscosity liquids and (f) solute jump diffusion in supercooled water.",
