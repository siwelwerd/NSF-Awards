High-value items such as packaged medicines, which are often sold online through untrusted supply chains, are particularly prone to fraud. The trade in such illicit medicines is worth tens of billions of dollars annually, and these products now account for about 20% of all illegal goods seized at national borders. This project developed and tested novel low-cost materials authentication techniques that enable end users (including the general public) to easily and reliably verify the chemical composition of medicines, dietary supplements, and certain food items. The widespread adoption of such authentication technology is expected to eventually have a major positive impact on public health both domestically and internationally by significantly enhancing the security of the supply chain for pharmaceuticals and food products.</p>\n<p>The proposed authentication approach is based on comparing signal features generated by the material under test - either the zero-field nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) spectral features (for solids) or the low-field nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) time-domain features (for liquids) - with reference features stored in a secure database. About 50% of all the atoms in the periodic table contain so-called quadrupolar nuclei that generate NQR signals. In this project we focused on the NQR spectra of nitrogen (14N), which is found in a large majority of pharmaceutical products. Depending on the application, we also studied spectral features from chlorine (35Cl) NQR measurements and time-domain features from hydrogen (1H) and sodium (23Na) low-field NMR measurements.</p>\n<p>The proposed signal features are highly sensitive to chemical composition and physical properties, and thus act as unique &ldquo;chemical fingerprints&rdquo; that are difficult to emulate or falsify. Moreover, the technique is non-invasive, non-destructive, quantitative, and can be implemented using miniaturized low-cost instrumentation. This project explored a variety of measurement, data analysis, and machine learning techniques to further improve the sensitivity and specificity of NQR- and NMR-based based chemical fingerprinting. These techniques were incorporated within easy-to-use portable materials authentication devices.These devices incorporated i) low-cost miniaturized circuitry for the analog front-end and digitial back-end (for portability), ii) digitally-programmable impedance matching networks (for flexibility), and iii) automated motion control systems to enable software-controlled polarization enhancement (for improved sensitivity). Systematic surveys and several field trials were conducted using these devices in order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach in detecting fraudulent substances; quantify potential health benefits; and also expand the size and quality of the reference database.</p>\n<p>In addition to analyzing the intrinsic signatures of NQR-sensitive materials, the research team also pioneered the automated additive manufacturing and machine learning-enabled readout of embedded NQR-senstive \"tags\" to authenticate high-value products. The proposed approach was demonstrated using several 3D-printed plastic objects, and shown to provide excellent security against counterfeiting.</p>\n<p>The project has trained 4 Ph.D. students in an interdisciplinary environment that combines circuit design, signal processing, machine learning, applied spectroscopy, imaging, and hardware/system security. The project outcomes have been described in multiple peer-reviewed journal and conference papers. In an effort to reach a wider audience, the PIs also co-authored a general-interest article describing the proposed approach for <em>IEEE Spectrum</em> magazine, which has a global readership of over 500,000. This article generated significant interest from both large companies and individuals, and eventually resulted in multiple research collaborations with companies and government entities. The research team also developed (and continues to maintain) a detailed database of NQR spectra that is freely accessible online.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 06/09/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Soumyajit&nbsp;Mandal</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1563688/1563688_10438929_1623270564079_flowchart_full_new3--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1563688/1563688_10438929_1623270564079_flowchart_full_new3--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Flowchart for NQR-based authentication of objects\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1563688/1563688_10438929_1623270564079_flowchart_full_new3--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Flowchart for NQR-based authentication of objects\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">(a) Overview of NQR signature generation.
