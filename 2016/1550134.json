 "awd_abstract_narration": "Although plate tectonics provides a first-order explanation of the origin of mountain belts, the tectonic processes that drive surface the uplift and exhumation of mountain belts are not well understood. Even less well understood are the interactions of between uplift, erosional processes, and climate that shape the mountain landscape. This project uses state-of-the art to examine the interaction of tectonics, erosion, and climate in the Peruvian Andes to test new and controversial ideas concerning the uplift of the Andes. The project advances desired societal outcomes through: (1) full participation of women and underrepresented minorities in STEM through support of an female researchers and students plus outreach programs to high school and undergraduate students from underrepresented minorities; (2) increased public scientific literacy and public engagement with STEM through participation of outreach programs that provide research experiences for high school and undergraduate students from underrepresented minorities ; (3) development of a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce through undergraduate and graduate student training and support of several early career researchers; and (4) increased partnerships through international collaboration. The Division of Earth Sciences Tectonics and Geomorphology & Land Use Dynamics Programs and the NSF Office of International Science and Engineering supported this project.\r\n\r\nEarth's surface topography responds directly to mantle processes and plate tectonics, controls surface drainage and sediment transport patterns, and influences atmospheric circulation and climate. As the type example of ocean-continent subduction-generated high topography, the Central Andes are critical to evaluating geodynamic models of orogenesis. Although previous studies of the structural history, past elevations, and incision record have provided important insights on surface uplift, these studies also suggest a disparate range of uplift histories and associated tectonic drivers. Current geodynamic models for Andean orogenesis include: (1) continuous late Cenozoic crustal thickening and shortening, resulting in gradual surface uplift and canyon incision; (2) late Cenozoic delamination of South American lithosphere, resulting in rapid surface uplift and a late Miocene pulse of incision; and (3) early Cenozoic contraction-driven crustal thickening, resulting in near modern elevations in the west by late Eocene and propagating deformation eastward through the Cenozoic. To distinguish between models, this project uses: (1) stable isotope analyses of volcanic glasses and soil carbonates to provide quantitative estimates of paleoelevations over time, coupled with geochronology to constrain timing; (2) isotope-enabled general circulation modeling to determine how changing elevations affected climate and to quantitatively interpret stable isotope data, constrained by modern elevation-isotope and climate-isotope relationships; (3) data-validated fluvial erosion modeling to predict the erosional response to different models; and (4) fluvial and lacustrine sedimentology and sediment provenance to identify changes in drainage system extent and basin development. By synthesizing these data, the research team will quantify surface topography and erosion during orogenic evolution and distinguish between proposed tectonic and climatic controls.",

The Western Cordillera is a mountain belt containing active volcanoes resulting from subduction of the Nazca Plate beneath the South American Plate (Figure 1). The Western Cordillera is separated from the Eastern Cordillera mountains by the Altiplano: a high elevation, internally drained plateau.</p>\n<p>The hydrogen and oxygen isotope compositions (typically reported as &delta;D and &delta;<sup>18</sup>O values) of ancient water are commonly used to determine past elevations because in many regions these values decrease substantially with increasing elevation. The first component of this study was to investigate the modern relationship between isotopic values of precipitation and soil waters and elevation in this region. We focused on soil water in addition to precipitation because it provides an approximation of the average isotopic composition of rainfall. We sampled rainfall from across the Andes by developing an observational network that relied on the assistance of local people. We also excavated soil pits (Figure 2) to collect soil samples for measurement of soil water &delta;D/&delta;<sup>18</sup>O values. These samples provided data on the modern climate.</p>\n<p>The second component of this study was to investigate elevation and climate change across the Andes in the past. We collected samples of deposits from explosive volcanic eruptions (ignimbrites, Figure 3). We compared the &delta;D values of water preserved in volcanic glass from these samples to our modern data to determine how the elevation and shape of the range has changed over time. Our sampling allowed us to reconstruct profiles of &delta;D values across the Andes extending back 25 million years.</p>\n<p>The modern profile of the Andes exhibits large variations in &delta;D and &delta;<sup>18</sup>O values in soil water and precipitation. The region between the Pacific coast and crest of the Western Cordillera is exceptionally dry and is associated with high &delta;D and &delta;<sup>18</sup>O values. These values decrease abruptly near the crest of the Western Cordillera, remain low, but variable, across the Altiplano, and increase down the eastern flank of the Eastern Cordillera.</p>\n<p>Moisture from the Pacific Ocean is almost entirely recycled as it moves across the hyperarid southwest region towards the Western Cordillera crest (Figure 4). Some of this recycled Pacific moisture is funneled up large, westward-draining canyons and reaches the Western Cordillera crest where it mixes with Amazonian moisture (Figure 5). The abrupt change in values at the crest likely represents the mixing between air masses. Moisture from the Amazon is carried over the Eastern Cordillera and across the Altiplano but does not cross the Western Cordillera crest.</p>\n<p>The alignment of the highest topography with this moisture-source divide suggests that we can identify where the highest topography was in the past using the &delta;D values recorded by volcanic glass. Our results suggest that 16 million years ago the crest of the Western Cordillera was 100 km further inland from the Pacific than it is today. The migration of the crest to its current position occurred within a few million years.</p>\n<p>To interpret the environmental meaning of the isotopic values, we also conducted paleoclimate simulations with water isotope tracking using the NCAR Community Earth System Model. These simulations confirmed that the &delta;D values that we observed could only be explained by the presence of high topography. Further, these simulations tell a story about the evolution of South American environments, including the Amazon rainforest, as the South American continent rifted from Africa and the Andes formed.</p>\n<p>To complement the isotopic record of elevation changes, we also explored the erosional history of rivers in southwest Peru. When land masses are elevated by tectonic processes, rivers incise into the elevated topography, potentially leaving a record of past tectonic uplift. We mapped locations where the rivers deviated from the typical pattern of decreasing slope with distance downstream to reconstruct the pre-incision level of the river path. We combined these metrics with rates of erosion using cosmogenic radionuclides to reconstruct the timing and magnitude of recent uplift in the area. Results show that the most recent pulse of incision (and tectonic uplift) varied from 100?s of meters of incision in the last 5 million years in the southeastern part of the study area to &gt;1 kilometer in the northwest. We attribute the spatial variation to crustal processes associated with the subducting Nazca ridge at the northwest corner of the study area.</p>\n<p>This work involved three graduate students, one postdoc, and three undergraduates, who all received advanced training that will support their career goals. We also shared our findings, including how mountain belts influence climate and the fundamentals of field-based investigations, to 18 University of Texas undergraduates on a week-long field trip across the region (Figure 6).</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/01/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Elizabeth&nbsp;J&nbsp;Cassel</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1550134/1550134_10415003_1633115786832_Figure1_PeruFO_sm--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1550134/1550134_10415003_1633115786832_Figure1_PeruFO_sm--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1550134/1550134_10415003_1633115786832_Figure1_PeruFO_sm--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">View towards the Pacific Ocean from the crest of the Western Cordillera in southwestern Peru.
