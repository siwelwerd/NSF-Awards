 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent advances in biomaterials, biomaterials fabrication, computation, biology, and biomedical research have highlighted the need for advanced experimental tools, new materials synthesis and fabrication methods, state-of-the-art analytical techniques, and computational methods. This workshop identifies grand challenges and opportunities in biomolecular and biomaterials systems that would benefit from investment in both research teams and instrumentation. The workshop will identify critical need areas where mid-scale level facilities and instruments would be catalytic and collaborative interdisciplinary teams working in a tightknit and iterative fashion could eliminate bottlenecks to accelerated materials discovery. Making these instruments available to the biomaterials community at large, through mechanisms such as a user facility program, could lead to accelerated new biomaterials discoveries and technological innovation throughout the nation. The workshop will include faculty and students from US universities and researchers from national laboratories and industry. The workshop will comprise of invited lectures, panel discussions, group break-out sessions and reporting on current and emerging trends.  This workshop, whose results will appear in a formal report, will capture the excitement and promise of potential opportunities.",

The Chair, Prof. Rigoberto Advincula of Case Western Reserve University, five discussion leaders, and other speakers provided a brief overview of current biomaterials research and technology and brought into focus the tools and foundry that will be needed for leadership in 21st-century research. Five biomaterials fields and discussion groups were sub-divided as follows:&nbsp;&nbsp;A) Biomanufacturing: Natural and Synthetic (Leader: Pupa Gilbert) B) Dynamic and Adaptive Biomaterials Surfaces and Interfaces (Leader: Marek W.
