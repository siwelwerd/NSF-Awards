The HPLC front-end will allow for the determination of the speciation of trace metals and metalloids in the environment for investigations of the geomicrobiological cycling of trace elements, in particular Arsenic and Antimony, that are toxic at certain valence states.  The LA probe will allow for the introduction of evaporite and marine carbonate hosted fluid inclusions into the ICP-MS for determination of major (e.g., Na, Mg, Ca, K) and minor (Ba, Br, Sr) element concentrations and their ratios as proxies of the chemistry of the seawater from which they formed.  \r\n\r\nStudies of fluid inclusion chemistry in Halite and marine carbonates can shed light on the variability of past ocean chemistry throughout the Phanerozoic with implications for understanding past climate and mid-ocean ridge hydrothermal processes.  The instrument will also support studies of trace metal concentrations in mineral aerosols with relevance to environmental health research, studies of igneous petrogenesis with implications for understanding magma chamber processes, and studies of the composition of metallic and oxide nanoparticles used for advanced fuel cell and Li-ion battery engineering.  The instrument will support graduate student research training in analytical geochemistry.  This support is congruent with NSFs mission of promoting the progress of science and may advance the national prosperity and welfare through advancing knowledge of the fate and transport of potentially toxic trace metal species in the environment and related strategies to mitigate environmental health impacts and in promoting green energy technology engineering.\r\n\r\n***",

This new instrument provides state-of-the-science analytical capabilities on the SUNY Binghamton campus to measure the chemical speciation of trace metals and metalloids in the environment, as well as the elemental composition of solid-phase samples and fluid inclusions.

The research activities enabled by the instrument directly benefit the thesis and dissertation projects of around 15 current graduate students within Geological Sciences, some of whom are receiving hands-on training in operating the instrument and processing data.  Several courses taught within the department will make use of the instrument for class laboratory projects in the coming year.  This includes a newly established and NSF-funded Freshman Research Immersion (FRI) program in Biogeochemistry.  The FRI Biogeochemistry program is a three-semester long laboratory-intensive education program that is being instructed by a faculty team that includes several co-PIs of this grant.  The FRI program admits up to 30 first year undergraduate students per year and actively recruits from groups that are traditionally underrepresented in the STEM disciplines.  It also includes active outreach to local and regional high schools.  Other classes in the department that are supported by this acquisition include a laboratory-intensive senior and graduate level Geomicrobiology course and a field-intensive senior and graduate level course in Environmental Measurements which often includes students from Biology, Geography, and the School of Education who plan to become Earth Science teachers.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/24/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Thomas Kulp"
