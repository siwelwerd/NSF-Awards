 "awd_abstract_narration": "The near-Earth space and upper atmosphere (Geospace) is a complex natural system that can impact various human technologies deployed in space and on the ground. To forecast, and thus mitigate that impact, it is necessary to develop accurate understanding of the interaction processes between the solar wind and Earth's magnetosphere and ionosphere. These processes are mainly initiated on the planet's dayside and can be observed at high latitudes in both hemispheres, near the ionospheric intersection of geomagnetic field lines that map from the high-altitude interaction region. A variety of coupled phenomena at multiple spatial and temporal scales are produced by this interaction that transfer the solar wind energy and momentum through the magnetosphere down to the ionosphere and upper atmosphere. Developing our understanding of these interaction processes and how they couple to both polar ionospheres is important for developing physical models that can describe and predict \"space weather\" disturbances ? a major goal of the recently adopted National Space Weather Strategy. This goal has been hampered so far by the lack of sufficient data to investigate processes and to validate global models, particularly in the Southern hemisphere.\r\n\r\nThis award will overcome the above problem through the operation and use of data from a new generation of autonomous instrument platforms strategically deployed in the Southern polar cap. This research will continue studies of various physical mechanisms involved in the solar wind interaction with the Earth's magnetosphere for better understanding of the multi-scale, global, and interhemispheric electrodynamic coupling within the entire Geospace system. Important aspects of these investigations include operation of a new chain of autonomous low-power ground-based instruments deployed along the 40-degree geomagnetic meridian in the East Antarctic. These stations are geomagnetically conjugate to the Greenland West Coast chain of long-term-running magnetometers supported by Danish scientists. These interhemispheric connections are crucial for interpretation of satellite observations (such NASA's THEMIS and MMS missions) in and near the magnetopause and for further understanding of the global geospace system's dynamics. The project will employ young scientists in the operation of remote Antarctic stations, as well as investigate space weather events, and, thus, contribute to the development of the nation?s scientific workforce. Use of the project's data to validate space weather models can provide benefit to society as a whole as it aids to protect various navigation, communications, and defense technologies that can be impacted by space weather.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe investigations supported by this project are relevant to understanding the complex interactions of the solar wind with the Earth's magnetosphere and ionosphere that lead, in turn, to various space weather phenomena.  These include: the development of electrical current systems in space and in the ionosphere that carry over a million amperes of current; the energization of charged particles in space that can damage satellite electronics; the production of density irregularities in the high latitude ionosphere that can disrupt communications and navigation systems; the production of induced electric fields in the conducting Earth that can disrupt power distribution systems and produce corrosion in long distance pipelines.  The Antarctic stations that are operated and maintained through the support of this project monitor the region where geomagnetic field lines that first encounter the solar wind intersect the dayside high latitude ionosphere, thus enabling investigation of the processes that couple energy from the solar wind to the magnetosphere and ionosphere.  The remote Antarctic stations supported by this project are specifically located along the 40-degree magnetic meridian to be magnetically conjugate to a chain of magnetometer stations in the Northern hemisphere along the west coast of Greenland.  This enables, for the first time, the simultaneous measurement of phenomena in both hemispheres related to the energy coupling with the solar wind and to investigate asymmetries that result from the conductivity differences in the summer and winter hemispheres and magnetic field twisting due to different solar wind coupling geometries.\n\n\nThe solar wind is a highly conducting gas of protons and electrons flowing supersonically from the sun.  Because of the high conductivity of this gas, the solar magnetic field is embedded into the gas and is pulled outward from the sun.  Since the solar wind is composed of charged particles, a planetary magnetic field presents and obstacle to the solar wind flow.  The Earth's magnetic field is confined to a cavity in the flow called the magnetosphere.  The Earth's magnetosphere is compressed on the dayside and drawn out into a comet like tail on the night side.  Various processes couple energy from the solar wind into the magnetosphere and produce what we now call space weather. These processes can drive electrical currents through the magnetosphere and into the conducting upper atmosphere called the ionosphere.  Such currents are one form of space weather and variations of these currents, for example, can have serious impacts on electrical power distribution systems and long distance pipelines on the Earth's surface. \n\n \nChanges, particularly sudden changes in the solar wind dynamic pressure can also produce impulsive distortions of the magnetopause that produce various types of waves that propagate through the magnetosphere.  The primary purpose of this project is to measure the electromagnetic consequences of various coupling processes between the solar wind, magnetosphere, and ionosphere on the dayside of the Earth.  For many of these processes, electrical currents flow along magnetic field lines into or out of the ionospheres in both the northern and southern polar regions.  The ionosphere is a complex plasma medium that is described using a conductivity tensor.  The interaction processes between the solar wind and magnetosphere can produce both Hall currents orthogonal to both the magnetic field and applied electric field as well current in the direction of the electric field within the ionosphere.  Asymmetries in the conductivity tensors in the summer and winter hemispheres as well as asymmetries the the magnetic field strength produce added complexity that requires simultaneous measurements in both hemispheres to understand the consequences of these asymmetries on the coupling processes in order to develop and validate space weather models.  A secondary purpose of this project is to examine inter-hemispheric asymmetries at other local times related to other magnetospheric dynamics.\n\n\nUsing the support from this project we have been able to operate and maintain the chain of six remote Antarctic stations, collect and archive the data from these stations, provide the data to researchers and other large data archives, and undertake analysis of these data together with data from the Greenland west coast magnetometer stations and ancillary satellite data to investigate solar wind - magnetosphere - ionosphere electrodynamic coupling.  Several scientific papers have been published, results presented at various scientific meetings and educational opportunities have been given to several students who have participated in various aspects of this research.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/29/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Calvin Robert Clauer"
