 "awd_abstract_narration": "Phages, the viruses of bacteria, are the most numerous genetic entities in the biosphere, outnumbering bacteria by 10-100-fold, and contain most of its DNA diversity. Phage biology is a driver in global ecology and in the global dynamics of gene transfer. Phages, as the natural predators of bacteria, have recognized potential as antibacterial agents, both in human health and in animal husbandry and agriculture. Phages, because they can be restricted to specific bacterial species or genera, represent the only currently available tool for manipulating the diverse populations of bacteria in microbiomes, now known to be an essential component of health and development. Despite all of these factors, only a tiny fraction of phage biodiversity is captured by sequenced genomes; in fact, phages are by far the most under-sequenced genetic entity. As Next Generation Sequencing advances, the flow of phage DNA sequence is going to increase enormously. However, phage genomes represent special problems in genomic analysis, in part because of biological factors, including rapid sequence divergence, the compression of gene sizes and extensive gene overlap. Even more problematic is the general lack of expertise in phage biology, which makes quality annotation of phage genomes inaccessible to most of the scientific public.\r\n\r\nThe project will implement scalable infrastructure for bioinformatics analyses, focusing on the automated structural and functional annotation of phages. Publicly accessible infrastructure will be developed and deployed, from new and existing components to support community re-annotation of paradigm phages into \"gold standard\" curated annotation sets. Additionally the infrastructure will develop components focused on the acquisition and annotation of new phage genomes going forward, as the field of bacteriophage genomics rapidly expands. Tools will be developed and released encoding expert annotation knowledge to improve the state of the art in automated, quality, phage annotation. The entire project will be developed as open source software under an OSI approved license, permitting the re-implementation of the project's infrastructure in other genome annotation communities where it will provide value. Phage Genomics Education resources developed as part of our well-established course in Phage Genomics at TAMU will be improved to take advantage of the new community resources being built. As implementation progresses, the infrastructure deployed and progress updates will be available at https://cpt.tamu.edu/phagedb/",

Diverse fields including microbial ecology, human and veterinary medicine, agriculture, food safety, and rapid diagnostics have come to a new appreciation for the importance of phages, both for their roles in natural systems and for their potential as a biotechnology platform (e.g., as therapeutics or for detection of bacterial pathogens).  As is the case for many life sciences fields, obtaining the complete DNA sequence (genome) of these organisms is now a common procedure that supports many aspects of phage research.  The number of phage genome sequences available in the public databases has tripled in the past four years, raising a clear demand for infrastructure and trained scientists capable of analyzing this data.  Despite this interest, the computer infrastructure to perform bioinformatic analyses of phage genome data is still out of reach for many scientists.  \nGalaxy and Apollo are free, open-source, Web-browser-based bioinformatics platforms that are widely used and internationally supported.  Galaxy is designed for management and execution of bioinformatic analyses and Apollo for visualization and annotation of genome data.  With NSF support, our team within the Center for Phage Technology (CPT) at Texas A&amp;M University developed a phage genomics platform based on the Galaxy and Apollo platforms.  This project included the development of 35 new Galaxy tools designed to specifically address phage genomics, making the CPT Galaxy system a \"one-stop shop\" for the annotation and comparison of phage genomes.  By coupling the Galaxy platform for analyses with the editing capabilities in Apollo, contextualized evidence can be used to iteratively annotate genomes as a team effort.  \nOne of the long-term goals of the supported project is to make the CPT Galaxy-Apollo platform publicly available to the larger phage research community for the analysis and interpretation of phage genomic data.  In this funding period, 269 internal users (users from Texas A&amp;M University) have used the Galaxy/Apollo system, conducting 182,438 individual analyses and generating 1,367 genomes in Apollo.  In the same period, the Galaxy-Apollo system has accumulated 399 external users, who conducted 169,190 individual analyses in Galaxy and generated 1,000 Apollo genomes.  This broad access, coupled with the rigor and reproducibility of the CPT\u2019s Galaxy/Apollo phage annotation platform is allowing researchers around the world to more rapidly advance projects in phage biology and biotechnology.\nNSF support has allowed further development of the long-running phage genomics course BICH464, which is offered to undergraduate and graduate students every Spring at Texas A&amp;M University.
