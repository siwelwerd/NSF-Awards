The novel approach is enabled by multidisciplinary integration of\r\nphotonics, microfluidics, MEMS, and bionanotechnologies that creates a new\r\nmodality of all liquid laser array that can be controlled and configured by\r\nbio/chemical molecules and fluids.\r\nThe project includes prominent interdisciplinary education and training\r\ncomponents for undergraduate and graduate students. Plans are also in place to\r\npromote involvement of underrepresented students, which leverages the UTA's\r\nstatus as one of the Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Minority\r\nServing Institutions. Special attention is paid to recruit and retain female students in\r\nengineering. Finally, the proposed project has extensive outreach programs to train\r\nhigh school students and engineering teachers and to disseminate knowledge and\r\nresearch discoveries to the general public.\r\nTechnical Abstract\r\nThe objective of this CAREER project is to develop an array of bio compatible and\r\nbio configurable optofluidic lasers that are self assembled at the liquid liquid\r\ninterface and study this novel optofluidic laser enabled versatile biosensing\r\ntechnology platform to achieve exceptional detection sensitivity, selectivity, and\r\nthroughput in various biological and biomedical sensing applications. The proposed\r\noptofluidic laser features a monolayer laser gain material (i.e., only a few\r\nnanometers thick) confined at the liquid liquid interface, which allows biological\r\nand biochemical molecules to access and directly modulate the laser gain material,\r\nand thus forms the basis of enhanced detection sensitivity and selectivity. The\r\nproposed laser sensing platform is studied for rapid and low cost multiplexed\r\ncancer biomarker detection towards a final goal of addressing current challenges in\r\nthe point of care medical diagnostics and health monitoring. The outcomes\r\ngenerated from this research will lead to new development and discoveries in the\r\nfield of bioinspired optofluidic devices and engineering, as well as fundamental\r\nresearch on extreme sensing and extreme photonics.",
