 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recognizing that there is an established need in the United States to increase the number of American scientists in the workforce, this NSF Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (S-STEM) project aims to increase retention and graduation rates in biology, chemistry, environmental sciences, and physics and prepare participating STEM majors for post-graduate success.  The objectives of the project are to (a) provide 24 academically talented, low income students at Longwood College with high quality support services and curricula that incorporate evidence-based practices, (b) provide professional development activities that will prepare students for future careers, (c) maintain a high level of faculty participation in curricular and co-curricular activities, and (d) investigate the outcomes of the implementation of a learning community and career-readiness activities.  This S-STEM project will have a significant impact on the region surrounding Longwood College (Southern Virginia), which has a low high-school graduation rates, low college attendance, low family incomes, and a high unemployment.\r\n\r\nDrawing from emerging research on retention of STEM majors, this program will address the scholars' needs as they transition to the university environment and grow personally, academically, and professionally. Scholars will develop as scientists by honing their skills in quantitative reasoning, modeling, and simulation and learning to apply interdisciplinary approaches to complex real-world issues through an early research experience and subsequent course-embedded collaborations.  Additionally, students will be immersed in an ecosystem of support designed to foster strong cohort development, build meaningful relationships with trained faculty mentors, and cultivate mindsets for postgraduate success. Throughout their college experience, students will collect key artifacts and reflect on their development as scientists using e-portfolios.  Faculty mentors will initiate regular conversations about the e-portfolio work and use the information to engage the students in conversation about their progress.  Formative and summative evaluation of each project component will determine the extent to which the curricular and co-curricular activities on promote students' retention to graduation.  Research will address the mentoring relationship as it relates to students' transition to college and professional development.  The PIs will disseminate findings, in journals such as Science Education and Civic Engagement: An International Journal, Primus, Journal of College Science Teaching, Physics Teacher, and Honors in Practice.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Longwood Initiative for Future Excellence in STEM (LIFE STEM) program was developed to provide scholarships and wrap-around student support for undergraduate students majoring in biology, chemistry, environmental science, and physics.  \n\nThe LIFE STEM Leadership Team, which included faculty members from the natural sciences, a research scholar from Longwood\u2019s psychology program, and an academic administrator, developed and refined a robust application process.  In collaboration with the university\u2019s admissions office, the leadership team recruited prospective scholars through personalized mail and email to students and their parents/guardians, activities at admissions events such as open houses, outreach to high school counselors, and more.  The recruiting process proved to be both rewarding and challenging, and the team adjusted its approach as it reflected on its successes and barriers.  The leadership team found that connections with parents/guardians were particularly valuable, in part because prospective students are inundated with so much correspondence from colleges and universities.  \n\nThe LIFE STEM Scholars started their university experience with a summer bridge program on the Chesapeake Bay.  This immersion experience not only engaged students in learning about science in a challenging civic context but also in developing meaningful relationships with their fellow scholars and faculty mentors.  Student feedback &ndash; shared informally or collected systematically by the external evaluator &ndash; indicated that the community building that took place during the summer bridge was particularly meaningful to these students navigating the transition to college.\n\nOver the duration of the project, the LIFE STEM Leadership Team implemented five new courses designed to support the scholars\u2019 development as scientists and to promote strong connections among scholars in the cohorts:\n\nA first semester seminar focused on knowledge, skills, and aptitudes for the successful transition to the university environment;\nA two-semester first-year course focused on scientific research skills;\nA sophomore seminar focused on honing scientific reading, writing, and presentation as well as exploring research opportunities; and\nA junior seminar focused on the transition to the STEM workforce and the graduate/professional school context.\n\n\nAll scholars were paired with a faculty mentor with whom they met regularly throughout their four-year academic journey.  In the first year, scholars and mentors met weekly, and the frequency of meetings decreased in later years as the scholars became acclimated to university life.  Mentors were provided with focused resources to guide their conversations.  For example, at key points in the semester, mentors were prompted to connect scholars with stress management resources, time management guidance, etc.  The mentoring resources developed by the LIFE STEM Leadership Team have already been put to use in other programs, including Longwood\u2019s Computer Science Scholars program, which is funded by a state grant, and LIFE STEM II, which is funded by a National Science Foundation Scholarships in STEM Track 2 grant.\n\nIn parallel to these student supports, a teacher-scholar in Longwood\u2019s psychology program developed research questions focused on the mentoring relationship and worked with faculty mentors and scholars to systematically collect data that will provide insights about the establishment, development, and conclusion of mentoring relationships.  These insights will be of use to other STEM faculty members who seek to develop mentoring programs to support success of academically talented students with financial need.\n\nIn addition to wrap-around student support, the LIFE STEM Scholars benefited from scholarship awards that ranged from $3,300 to $10,000 (average $6,223) per year and were based on students\u2019 unmet financial need.\n\nIn total, 27 scholars participated in the program, including 11 in biology, 2 in chemistry, 11 in environmental science, and 3 in physics.  Of those students, 17 graduated from a science program at Longwood.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/13/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Michelle L Parry"
