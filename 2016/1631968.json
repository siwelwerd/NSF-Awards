 "awd_abstract_narration": "1631968\r\nChen\r\n\r\nThe Flint (Michigan) drinking water contamination crisis brought national attention to lead contamination in drinking water systems. Between 6,000 and 12,000 residents (including children) had severely high levels of lead in the blood and experienced a range of serious health problems. Therefore, rapid and accurate water quality test for various contaminants such as lead (Pb) ions at the point of use is a core requirement for drinking water safety. \r\n\r\nThis project aims to: (1) validate a prototype handheld device for lead ion detection using Flint water samples and improve the handheld device performance, and, (2) enable rapid screening of Flint water for lead ions during the pipeline retrofitting, during seasonal transition from winter to summer, and after, at various point-of-use systems. This RAPID project will contribute to the development of a rapid and low-cost detection method for lead ions in Flint water using a handheld device. Similar to the glucose meter for home use, the handheld device consists of a meter and a disposable (one-time use only) sensor test strip based on reduced graphene oxide. The device is capable of detection of lead ions in water at a concentration well below the maximum contaminant level defined by the US EPA. In this project, the prototype handheld device will be validated for rapid lead ion detection in Flint water samples, which is representative of lead-contaminated drinking water. The resulting handheld device will then be used to enable rapid screening of Flint water for lead ions during the pipeline retrofitting, during seasonal transition from winter to summer, and after new point-of-use systems being developed. The anticipated result of the proposed project is a reliable and rapid point-of-use handheld device for lead screening in drinking water.",

First, water can get contaminated with toxic heavy metals along the distribution line, despite water utilities? rigorous and regular monitoring of water quality at the water supply intake and the treatment plant.  Second, many pipes in U.S. water supply systems are near or even past their operational life, and replacing the aging water infrastructure would take years and cost trillions of dollars. If these pipes are not replaced in time, the public health may be jeopardized due to water contamination associated with aging distribution infrastructure. Third, water catastrophes have occurred, with some of them on a large scale.  For instance, the Flint Water Crisis, partly caused by the corrosion of aging, lead-containing water pipes, has resulted in severe health issues for ~8,000 children.  To safeguard water quality and public health, it is crucial to monitor toxic heavy metals and other water contaminants throughout the water supply system and particularly at the point of use.\n\nCurrent quantitative detection methods for aqueous heavy metal ions are often laboratory-based and accurate down to parts per billion (ppb) levels (maximum acceptable contaminant level is 15 ppb for lead).  However, these methods are costly (~$25&ndash;50/test) and require days for sample analysis to be completed, making them unsuitable for regular on-site detection.  Qualitative detection methods are suitable for the field, relatively inexpensive (e.g., colorimetric tests are ~$10/kit), and quick, but they are unreliable and provide inadequate sensitivity. \n\nWe have developed a sensitive, selective, and cost-effective micro-sized sensor chip for quantitative, real-time, in situ detection of heavy metal ions in drinking water, eliminating many disadvantages of current practices.  The sensor chip is built upon a reduced graphene oxide (rGO)-gold nanoparticle (NP) sensing platform that can be used for detecting a wide range of analytes such as heavy metal ions, bacteria, and nutrients in water.  The sensor chip works as a field-effect transistor (FET) with rGO as the sensing channel.  The combination of unique electronic properties of rGO and its low cost makes this technology a truly transformative one for the water industry.  Target analytes can be detected by measuring the sensor resistance change, since rGO?s conductivity varies with the binding of analytes to the probes pre-anchored on the gold NPs.  This breakthrough technology allows for real-time detection of contaminants with unprecedented sensitivity and specificity in field settings for single point testing with a handheld device as well as for continuous monitoring through deployment in existing water equipment. \n\nWe have successfully demonstrated a prototype handheld device for detection of lead ions in drinking water, e.g., Flint water samples, below the EPA action level (15 ppb).
