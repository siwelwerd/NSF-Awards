 "awd_abstract_narration": "STEM education provides both technical training and the development of cognitive skills, such as designing experiments, testing hypotheses, and analyzing data.  While traditional STEM training is essential for developing a highly skilled technical workforce, the cognitive skills developed through this training are beneficial in almost every type of career.  To provide cognitive skills training to undergraduates in psychology, who typically do not receive this type of education, this project will develop a computer program, named TELLab, that allows psychology students to design experiments and gather data using the internet.  Using this program, students will have the opportunity to experience first hand the challenges of doing science, learning skills and concepts, and most importantly, formulating and solving problems of personal interest to them.\r\n\r\nTo this end, the proposal has three broadly defined goals: (1) Up-scaling and maturation of TELLab, so that it can handle hundreds of thousands of users, in countless numbers of classrooms, with students at all levels - all at the same time, (2) evaluation of TELLlab-based pedagogy in diverse settings, including evaluating STEM competencies in non-STEM students, particularly those in undergraduate psychology classes, and (3) advancing the effort to create an open source community of faculty and students across the nation to develop and sustain collective expertise.  Through a collaborative partnership across a variety of institutions, TELLab modules will be developed and deployed in a variety of psychology courses.  These modules will allow students to design experiments and test hypotheses, providing immersion in the cognitive skills that are at the core of STEM education.  Course instructors and participating students will be evaluated to identify and assess the factors that influence student experiences and learning.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "This NSF-IUSE sub-award to Princeton is part of a larger funded collaboration between researchers at Harvard, Wellesley, UC San Diego, and UC Berkeley.  The following outcomes summary pertains to select and representative results from the portion of the research funded at Princeton University.  Research and development was conducted from Fall 2015 through Summer 2020.  \n \nOverview.  Our research investigated the novel use of an active online learning platform called The Experiential Learning Laboratory (abbr. TeLLab).  This technology platform was designed to support student learning of research practices and methods by 1) Enabling participation in classic and influential experiments from the field of Psychology, along with novel experiments developed by instructors and students from around the world, 2)  Providing accessible data generated by the user, to directly link data comprehension and analyses to the first-person experience of participating in an experiment that generated the data, 3) Allowing every experiment on the site to be copied directly into a Graphic User Interface (GUI) experiment editor, to modify stimuli and parameters and test new research questions, along with the capability to use the GUI experiment editor to design entirely novel studies as desired, and 4) Empowering students to rapidly and easily collect data for their designed experiments online (e.g. recruiting participants via email or social media).   \n \nResearch Summary. At Princeton we incorporated the use of TeLLab in a variety of ways into five Psychology courses (Introduction to Psychology, Cognitive Psychology, Research Methods, Statistics, and Computational Modeling of Psychological Function) in order to investigate an overarching question: How effectively did students learn from using each kind of functionality provided by TeLLab?  \n \nMethods &amp; Primary Outcomes.  To measure student learning using TeLLab we collected a mixture of quantitative (survey item ratings &amp; behavioral metrics) and qualitative (interviews and free response questions), along with collecting feedback on desired additional functionality and suggestions to improve the platform.  One metric of interest was a free-choice research opportunity for final projects in courses that used TeLLab along with multiple other data-collection tools (e.g. Google Forms, Qualtrics): a large portion of the students opted to use TeLLab for their final projects.  In another context we had students rank their learning from lab-based activities in Introduction to Psychology labs that featured TeLLab in 2 of 6 lab units, and the ranks were: (1=best) participate in experiments, (2) design new experiments, (3) analyze your own data, (4) discussions, (5) analyze group data, and (6=worst) lectures during labs.  These results provided some validation for engagement by the kind of active and interactive learning supported by TeLLab.  In multiple course offerings students ranked the specific lab units featuring TeLLab among two of the top three (out of six units) for overall learning.  Qualitative feedback provided via a free-response prompt highlighted opportunities to improve the TeLLab platform and a good number of the suggestions in the first years lead directly to implemented changes/improvements.        \n \nAdditional Outcomes.  During the five years of funding support from NSF-IUSE, approximately 50 graduate students and post docs were trained to teach using active learning on the TeLLab platform, and many of those trainees subsequently advanced to positions involving teaching at other colleges and universities, and adopted TeLLab into their own curricula.  At Princeton about 1100 students took courses that featured TeLLab. One of the most encouraging qualitative metrics was that a notable number of students who used TeLLab as part of the curriculum in one course went on to use it independently for projects in courses that did not include TeLLab in the curriculum, along with independent senior thesis research.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/10/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Justin A Junge"
