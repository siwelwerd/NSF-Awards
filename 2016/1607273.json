 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the Chemistry Division supports the project by Professor Matthew Zimmt in the Department of Chemistry at Brown University.  Professor Zimmt is developing methods to prepare patterned molecular films. Each patterned sheet is used as a high-resolution template to assemble objects, polymers, and biological molecules into a patterned array. This process generates fields of molecules regularly distributed across a surface. The potential uses of these surfaces include converting solar energy into electricity. Research students involved in this project receive broad training in interdisciplinary science. The public is engaged through the production and circulation of animated videos that introduce self-assembly and its relevance to modern life. Undergraduate art majors and science majors, the Brown Science Center, and Brown faculty collaborate to produce these videos, which are distributed through various platforms.\r\n\r\nProfessor Zimmt is investigating strategies for preparing patterned, multi-component, self-assembled monolayers with unit cell repeats extending to 40 nanometers (nm), and with spatially patterned chemical reactivity on a less than 10 nanometer length scale.  Methods to cross-link and stabilize these films are developed.  In order to study these films, laser desorption-ionization, time-of-flight mass spectrometry is developed as a tool to investigate the assembly, composition, and reactions of physisorbed self-assembled monolayers on graphite and other conductive surfaces. Professor Zimmt integrates the research outcomes into the education of undergraduate and graduate students at Brown University.  Through collaboration with the Brown Science Center, the project team produces an animated video introducing self-assembly and its relevance to daily life. This self-assembly video is being distributed online and through other media platforms.",
