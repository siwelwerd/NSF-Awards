 "awd_abstract_narration": "How are distinct niches in communities filled when interactions among species may constrain potential overlap? Robber flies in the genus Lasiopogon are a widespread group of insect predators that hunt in many environments, such as dunes, beaches, trails, streamsides, and sagebrush landscapes. Specializations such as perching habits or seasonal emergence times provide a way for species with overlapping ranges to reduce competition. The goal of this project is to compare diversification patterns and similarities in geographic range, niche, and morphology throughout the 60 species of North American Lasiopogon to uncover not just when and where a given species split, but how regional communities (i.e., who it evolved with) influenced this diversification. Understanding the processes of adaptation at regional and local scales will help show how environmental cues and interactions among species maintain and promote biodiversity, providing lessons about potential responses of species to shifting environments. This research will promote taxonomic expertise and training in a diverse but understudied group of insects (robber flies). Furthermore, since many Lasiopogon species have highly specialized habitat requirements, this work will provide data for studying community changes precipitated by urban spread, manmade irrigation, and climate change. An undergraduate student will be trained in Asilidae taxonomic and biodiversity research, and distributional and ecological information&#8232;from this study will be shared on general and taxon-specific websites. \r\n\r\n\r\nSpecies niches are a distillation of their interactions with other members of the community and their phylogenetic history. This research will estimate evolutionary relationships among North American Lasiopogon from sequencing multiple loci. Microniche characteristics and ecological niche models will be estimated from museum specimens and samples by the PIs. Phylogenetic comparative methods will then be used to examine the effects of ecological specialization at different spatial scales and morphological character displacement on diversification and community assembly. This study design will reveal whether ecological and morphological differences accumulated during or after species divergence, and which axes of variation (coarse- or fine-scaled ecology, morphology, phenology) have been more influential in fueling character displacement and competitive specialization.",

This project looked at a widespread group of predatory flies and examined how ecological niches of species in a natural community are built from specialization, diversification, and coexistence. The focal group of this project (robber flies from the genus Lasiopogon) live in environments such as dunes, beaches, trails, streamsides, and sagebrush rangeland. Several species typically are codistributed across the same region, but each species usually has unique specializations such as perching habits (e.g., on rocks, logs, or sand) or seasonal emergence times (e.g., in April/May or June/July). Adaptations like these may provide a way for similar species with overlapping ranges to reduce competition and thus coexist. <br /><br />In order to make inferences about how these specializations have developed, we first needed to have a clear idea of who the species are and how they are related in evolutionary history.&nbsp;Many species in this group have not been recognized as discrete lineages before, and so work before this project has revised the taxonomic boundaries of 27 Lasiopogon species.&nbsp;We used DNA sequenced from several genes to estimate a phylogenetic tree (a statistical representation of evolutionary history) for the genus,&nbsp;using both traditional Sanger sequencing as well as more modern Illumina RadSeq techniques. A total of 59 species and 180 specimens of Lasiopogon were included in this analysis. <br /><br />Once we had a clear idea of what the species were and how they were related to each other, we could begin studying their ecology. We transcribed locality information from around 5000 museum specimens to build a comprehensive database of species distributions, showing us which species have ranges overlapping other species and who comprise the regional communities. We compiled notes on robber fly behavior from comments in the professional literature and fro our own fieldwork observations. Finally, we began testing&nbsp;how ecological character displacement explains coexistence and diversity in local communities of robber flies. <br /><br />Our research has revealed a complex tapestry of diversification unfolding in varying ways among different groups of species. For example, one major clade of Lasiopogon (the bivittatus and opaculus sections) show evidence that shifts in seasonal phenology and perch choice help separate codistributed species. However, this pattern was not echoed in the other main group of species, where&nbsp;coexistence was instead more strongly linked to morphological differences like hair color. Decoding the causes of a successful species radiation may require using complex mixed models and partitioning to scales that are relevant for the species in question. Increased species diversification rates were weakly correlated with more narrowly constrained ecology, suggesting that generalist strategies can limit the ability of closely related species to coexist in the same region. <br /><br />This work helped contribute to the training of graduate and undergraduate students in biodiversity research.
