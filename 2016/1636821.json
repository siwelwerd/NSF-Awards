Clostridia represent an important class of bacteria that are used for the conversion of either plant-derived carbohydrates or gases into biofuels, such as ethanol or butanol and other useful chemicals.\r\n\r\nThe scope of this international conference is to bring together the world's leading scientists, young investigators, industrial researchers and practitioners, and graduate students working on fundamentals and applications of solvent- and acid-forming Clostridia to assess the latest contributions and future opportunities in this field.  Discussion topics will include physiology and genetics of Clostridia, synthetic biology, metabolic engineering, feedstock utilization and ecology as well as bioprocessing and industrial applications.\r\n\r\nDue to the interdisciplinary nature of the Conference, the award by the Biotechnology and Biochemical Engineering Program of the CBET Division is co-funded by the Systems and Synthetic Biology Program of the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences.",

Concerns and opportunities related to climate change and the supply and security of fossil resources have led to a resurgence of interest in using clostridia to produce a variety of fuels and chemicals.

This series of meetings provides the only international forum at which the world?s leading clostridial experts assemble to present and discuss their findings and latest developments in the field. The success of these meetings has been due to both the quality of the science presented and the informal and welcoming atmosphere.  \n\n \n\nDisciplines engaged include microbiology, molecular biology, and chemical and biochemical engineering, including representatives from both industry and academia.  By design and as in fact readily observed, informal interactions provided opportunities discussions aimed at private sector initiatives, and for younger scientists to interact with each other as well as more senior scientists.
