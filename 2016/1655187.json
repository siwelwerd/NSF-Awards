 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Division of Chemistry is sponsoring this workshop entitled \"Quantum Information and Quantum Computation for Chemistry: Challenges and Opportunities\" to be held on November 14-15, 2016 in Arlington, Virginia.  Since the early contributions by Richard Feynman in 1982, quantum information science and technology has become one of the most dynamic and promising fields of scientific endeavor. The possibility of accessing new forms of cryptography, communication, and computation has led to new intellectual frameworks for understanding our physical reality as well as to the understanding of the complexity of different tasks such as the simulation of quantum systems.  The field of chemistry, with its core at the quantum realm has several points of contact with quantum information science and computation. The physical implementation of quantum information processors is poised to benefit from chemistry-related advances starting from surface science, nanoscale control and spectroscopy. The understanding of chemistry, on the other hand, benefits from the promise of scalable, efficient quantum simulation of chemical systems enabled by quantum simulators and full-blown quantum computers.   \r\n\r\nProfessors Michael Wasielewski (Northwestern University) and Alan Aspuru-Guzik (Harvard University) are organizing a workshop that brings together a representative sample of the leading researchers working on the topic of quantum information and quantum computing.  Through a series of discussions, the workshop participants develop deep perspectives on the challenges and opportunities for Chemistry in the field of quantum information science and technology in a timescale of five to ten years.  The participating researchers are a  mixture of theoreticians and experimentalists with a variety of backgrounds.  The long term goal of this workshop is to develop a new subfield of chemistry at the interface of the core of the discipline with the emerging fields of quantum information and quantum computation. The outcomes of the workshop will be disseminated to the scientific community via a workshop report.",

Despite significant advances in the field of molecular simulation, many important problems in chemistry such as the prediction of chemical reactions and the description of excited electronic states, transition states, and ground states of transition metal complexes, which are necessary for nearly all aspects of material design, remain challenging.  In order to more accurately model chemical systems, we must account for their inherent quantum nature.  The hope for simulating increasingly complex quantum systems lies in a new paradigm for information processing: quantum computation.\n\nThe NSF Workshop in Quantum Information and Computation for Chemistry assembled experts from directly quantum-oriented fields such as algorithms, chemistry, machine learning, optics, simulation, and metrology, as well as experts in related fields such as condensed matter physics, biochemistry, physical chemistry, inorganic and organic chemistry, and spectroscopy. The goal of the workshop was to identify target areas where cross fertilization among these fields would result in the largest payoff for developments in theory, algorithms, and experimental techniques.

From the theoretical aspect, the understanding of chemical phenomena within the framework of quantum information may enlighten our understanding of chemistry by approaching these problems with a different toolset. From the computational perspective, harnessing the power of quantum computers will likely be the key to unlocking new approaches to computational chemistry that were impossible to achieve in the past. The intuition gained from quantum algorithms have given rise to new approaches for their classical counterparts as well.  Better experimental methods in chemistry has potential to improve these techniques and to create novel platforms which shorten the time scale in which we can develop powerful quantum computers.  Thus, a unique interface exists between chemistry and quantum information which enables progress in either of these fields to exponentially compound, making this a ripe opportunity to exploit.\n\n  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/18/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Michael R Wasielewski"
