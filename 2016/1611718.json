 "awd_abstract_narration": "Current therapeutic drugs are typically tested in static culture dish first, followed by testing within animals, and finally progressed into pre-clinical trials in humans.  This is a long and expensive process, which could benefit from a tool designed to assess nanomedicine performance in an inexpensive manner while still maintaining conditions presented within the human body.  The proposed technology is a small and transparent device which allows for blood vessels to be mimicked outside of the human body while still retaining the characteristic features of such vessels.  The significantly easier to use and more cost effective system will save both time and money when testing therapeutic performance prior to animal and pre-clinical testing.  The proposed platform allows for therapeutic candidate screening which in turn reduces costs and time required to run animal and pre-clinical trial.  As such, any researcher working in industry or academia would benefit from the use of the proposed microfluidic system to analyze key characteristics of new therapeutics.  Through the use of the proposed novel microfluidic device, this I-Corps team is able to deliver a platform capable of improving  the testing and analysis process for drug/therapeutic development and ultimately aiding in the delivery of new and improved drugs to market for patients in need.  Overall, expediting the drug development process will help extend and improve the lives of patients around the world. \r\n\r\nTechnically, the device is comprised of a microfluidic chip that is cast from molds in order to form micro-scale channels.  The bilayer channels which make up the devices are separated from each other with a semipermeable membrane which spans the entire device, allowing only specific content to pass from the apical (top) channel into the basal (bottom) channel.  Using this simple yet effective device, research has been conducted proving the ability to culture cells within the device, ability to assess drug carrier binding and uptake, as well as work geared towards more specific applications such as tumor micro-environment studies, inflammation, and permeability.  As such, the main goals for the I-Corps program are, to further develop a customer base through in-depth market analysis and research, to identify customers' needs and perspective of the technology, and to gather customer feedback for improvement of the technology.  Given such goals, the major scope for the completion of the I-Corps program is to bring the technology to market so that it can begin to assist researchers and scientists outside of the Lehigh University lab.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThrough funding provided by the National Science Foundation, the executive team comprising of Yaling Liu (PI), Ira Weisberg (IM), and Christopher Uhl (EL) have been successful in the completion of the NSF I-Corps Program and have continued to make strides towards successful commercialization of the microfluidic technology developed at Lehigh University.  Throughout the duration of the I-Corps program, the executive team was successful in completing 91 customer interviews with individuals from various backgrounds in biotech and pharmaceutical companies.  Through these interviews, the executive team has come to better understand who the targeted customers are for this specific technology and how to develop a business model around their perceived needs.\n\nInitially, the team entered into the I-Corps program operating under the assumption that the microfluidic technology itself would be sold in packs or kits to customers who would then utilize them \"in-house\" to perform therapeutics testing.  However, after many interviews, we came to understand that the potential customers would prefer a testing service to be provided.  In addition to the 91 interviews conducted, the team has been given the opportunity to attend many different pharma-related conferences which have generated much interest in the microfluidic platform and has resulted in discussions for future testing.  Those who were interviewed, found that our technology would be able to provide their companies will in vitro data which mimicked conditions associated with in vivo testing, while being a cheaper and less complicated solution.  Throughout interviews, concerns were expressed in regards to personnel training for the technology and the overall complexity of the solution, however, being able to leverage the functionality of the microfluidic platform without needing to personally worry about the details of proper use was identified as very attractive opportunity.  Through these understandings, the team proceeded to investigate the commercial potential of providing a therapeutics testing service for biotech and pharmaceutical companies.  This process is still ongoing, however, at the completion of the I-Corps Program, the team was successful in establishing an initial business model canvas which is constantly being tested and revised.  Currently, the team is working through its initial phase of benchmark testing, for the developed therapeutics testing service.  This stage of early benchmark testing is not geared around generating revenue or cash-flow, however instead is geared around building up a body of scientific findings which support the functionality and performance of the platform as a whole.\n\nIdentified as a broader impact, the I-Corps program and project have led to training of researchers from various institutions on the use and functionality of the microfluidic platform, including PENN Medicine, Lehigh University, and international students from the Imperial College of London, UK, and the National University of Ireland, Galway.  Further technology based advances are being collaboratively worked on in order to extend the functionality of the current platform.   The goal is to provide testing services which cover a wide range of needs posed by biotech and pharmaceutical companies. \n\nThe executive team continues to take steps moving forward with commercialization efforts.  Further industry collaborative efforts are currently being pursued in order to generate further benchmark trails along with generic benchmark trails utilizing commercially available active compounds with known effects and properties.  Additionally, continued contact with members of the teaching team from the I-Corps cohort have proven useful and enjoyable as there is a wealth of knowledge and assistance available as a resource.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/16/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Yaling Liu"
