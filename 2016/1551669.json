 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigators will study skull and jaw anatomy in primates, to better understand how the anatomical components of the chewing system (teeth, jaws, and related joints) work together and how these components are affected by aging and pathological changes. Although the components of the masticatory (chewing) system are known to work together as a unit, previous analyses of this system have typically examined specific components in isolation from the rest of the anatomy, providing an incomplete picture of anatomical interrelationships. This project will address how the different anatomical components are correlated with each other across the entire masticatory system, in the context of changes that may occur during the lifetime of an individual, such as normal and pathological dental wear, and normal and abnormal (e.g. arthritis) changes in temporomandibular joint (TMJ) shape. Quantifying anatomical correlations using three-dimensional modeling in the dentition and TMJ will allow for new interpretations of the skeletal masticatory system and an improved understanding of the evolutionary pressures associated with different feeding behaviors and diets across primates. Determining whether TMJ pathology covaries with dental wear and pathology in multiple non-human species will provide an evolutionary context for dental and TMJ disorders that are very common in humans. The broader impacts of this research include encouraging gender and ethnic diversity in science by providing research opportunities for undergraduate students at universities that primarily educate first generation college and minority students; supporting the research of three early career female scientists; training a postdoctoral researcher in advanced techniques for capturing and analyzing shape variation; building a large database of 3D data that will be available to both anthropological and biomedical researchers and that may inform clinical studies of dental problems in humans; and conducting community outreach that will further disseminate the results of this investigation and help generate public interest in STEM research. \r\n\r\nBecause changes in diet and subsistence patterns often lie at the root of major evolutionary shifts, documenting and understanding the adaptive significance of the masticatory system during human evolution, as well as across living primates, has been a major goal of functional morphological studies in biological anthropology. The masticatory system acts as a single functional unit, such that perturbations in one portion of this system may affect other regions of anatomy; thus, age-related changes and pathological conditions of the masticatory apparatus are likely to be multifactorial and affect the entire system. Through a detailed assessment of dental and TMJ morphology and covariance between the dentition and the TMJ, this study examines both normal and pathological dental wear and TMJ remodeling in 16 anthropoid primate taxa, including humans. The specific aims include testing for covariation between the maxillary and mandibular teeth, the cranial and mandibular components of the TMJ, the teeth and TMJ, and dental and TMJ pathologies. Shape variation in the dentition and TMJ will be quantified using advanced morphometric techniques, including 3D landmark and surface data. Specimens will be assessed for pathology using published criteria for antemortem tooth loss, tooth wear, pulp cavity exposure, and TMJ osteoarthritis. By determining whether TMJ pathology covaries with dental wear and pathology in humans and non-human primates, this research will provide an evolutionary context for the evolution of primate feeding behaviors and of TMJ disorders in humans. The research has public health relevance, given the high prevalence of antemortem tooth loss and TMJ disorders in modern human populations. The resulting data and analyses will be relevant to a variety of fields including public health, dentistry, biomechanics/kinematics, feeding ecology, functional morphology, and mammalian evolution.",

While clinical studies have examined the link between tooth disease and problems with the TMJ, there is no consensus on the way they interact. We also lack comparable data for non-human primates, so that human diseases are not placed in a broader evolutionary and biological context. Although the parts of the chewing system must work together as a unit, studies typically examine small, specific segments (for example, the teeth) in isolation.

For each individual we used advanced 3D techniques to capture the shape of the skull, teeth, and jaw joint, and we documented a range of pathologies of the skull and teeth. First, we examined the relationship between the upper and lower teeth (Aim 1) and the relationship between the cranial and mandibular parts of the TMJ (Aim 2). Next, we studied relationships between the dentition and TMJ in primates both with and without skeletal signs of disease/ injury (pathology) (Aims 3 and 4). We especially focused on the ways tooth wear and arthritis of the TMJ affect chewing function.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>While the relationships between dental anatomy and diet have been extensively studied in primates, the ways that wear changes dental anatomy and function have largely been ignored. Teeth wear as soon as they erupt, meaning that for the majority of an individual's lifetime their teeth are not pristine. Though primates lose occlusal morphology&ndash;the teeth become flatter as they wear&ndash;they compensate by increasing the exposed surface; thus, teeth may continue to function well over the entire lifespan of an individual. This has significant implications for dental health as well as understanding how the TMJ may compensate for these shape changes.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>The shape analyses identified considerable variation in the skull, TMJ, and teeth both across and within primate species.

In particular, asking questions about the relationship between feeding behaviors and pathologies as well as variables about age and social group provide valuable information about primate behavioral diversity. For example, our work found that macaques have higher rates of dental cavities compared to other African and Asian monkeys, likely because their diet includes a lot of fruit with high sugar content and because they hold fruit in the mouth using cheek pouches for long periods of time.

Examining the ways in which various primates adapt (or not) to diverse geographies, food resources, and health conditions is particularly relevant during a time when our global climate is undergoing significant changes. Our project also trained nearly two dozen junior researchers (including multiple from underrepresented groups) in 3D visualization and data collection techniques, statistical analysis, and scientific writing. These methods are useful not just in anthropology but also in a variety of fields including industrial/ biomedical/ mechanical engineering, biomedical research (for example, orthopedics, dentistry), the arts and education, and many more, thus providing broad societal benefit. This work also involved outreach to multiple communities, including a variety of K-12 educational groups and the general public. This type of outreach is critical because it provides real-life examples of how basic science research can be applied to everyday life, and invites the next generation of scholars to ask important questions about ourselves and our world.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<div><span><br /></span></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 11/29/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Siobhan&nbsp;Cooke</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1551669/1551669_10444165_1638197181244_Macaquedamageandpathologyexamples-01--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1551669/1551669_10444165_1638197181244_Macaquedamageandpathologyexamples-01--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Examples of damaged/pathologic crab-eating macaques\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1551669/1551669_10444165_1638197181244_Macaquedamageandpathologyexamples-01--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Examples of damaged/pathologic crab-eating macaques\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A) postmortem broken zygomatic; B) perimortem buckshot, abscess fistulae of incisors; C) incisor loss, pulp cavity exposure of canines, cheek tooth wear; D) abscess fistulae/ alveolar recession; E) healed fracture; F) antemortem tooth loss with alveolar recession.
