 "awd_abstract_narration": "Maker spaces have been widely touted as a potentially liberative moment for science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) education, presenting an opportunity to bring traditionally underrepresented groups into STEM fields by engaging them in spaces that are open, creative, and supportive of people from all backgrounds. At the same time, early reports indicate that many maker and hacker spaces are already enacting certain norms that are more conducive to participation of white, male, middle-class, able-bodied hobbyists. Despite this trend, there are spaces that explicitly stand out in their inclusion of homeless makers, women, people of color, and people with different kinds of abilities. This project examines how diverse maker spaces welcome groups traditionally underrepresented in STEM, and how these practices can inform the design and operation of campus and community maker or hacker spaces that presently struggle to achieve diversity. \r\n\r\nEthnographic methods and Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) are used to understand these spaces in terms of their physical and linguistic artifacts.  This Participatory Action Research (PAR) includes ethnographies at 6 to 8 inclusive maker and hacker spaces, an Open Space Technology (OST) workshop focused on identifying and analyzing core attributes of transferable inclusive practices, and CDA that reflexively summarizes and propagates this information in applicable ways to academic and community sites. Research questions include:  (1) What practices and artifacts do participants in diverse maker and hacker spaces employ to establish and maintain environments that are diverse and inclusive? (2) What does the discourse in diverse maker and hacker spaces reveal about how meaning and value are co-constructed around identity, creativity, and the culture of production / the production of culture in engineering? (3) What best practices emerge from diverse maker and hacker spaces, and how can these translate to design or transformation of existing maker spaces on campuses and in communities? Intellectual Merit: This work is early in its use of CDA, the Highlander strain of PAR, and OST, all novel in engineering education; and early in seeking to characterize features contributing to the liberatory nature of emergent diverse maker spaces. The work is interdisciplinary and potentially transformative in leveraging linguistic analysis and social theories to ferret out root causes of exclusionary STEM practices for the potential high payoff of building campus and community maker spaces (and other STEM spaces) that are inclusive. Broader Impacts: This project co-constructs ways to stimulate innovative design thinking in experiential curricula; increases retention and broadens participation in STEM by embedding inclusive practices; empowers citizen engineers through local and national networks of makers, students, and faculty; and enables new ways of STEM learning and design thinking that will enrich the U.S. innovation ecosystem through progressive learning environments for undergraduate engineers. Findings are propagated non-tradtionally via maker virtual communities, maker faires, and informal networks, in addition to traditional propagation through the STEM education literature and the network of 150 engineering deans and other academic leaders committed to making on campus.",

Guided by open space technology, the participants created the agenda and schedule of discussions based on the concerns of their makerspace communities.\n\n\n3. A collaborative data analysis workshop that further infused the participation of maker space community members into the research, and served as both an analysis and supplemental data capture activity.\n\n\nData was analyzed by makerspace participants from both academic and non-academic organizations, and by graduate and undergraduate research assistants trained in thematic coding. A grounded theory approach was used to identify themes that can be characterized as liberatory and impactful to inclusive makerspaces.\n\n\nOverwhelmingly, the participant researchers stated that being inclusive requires intentional actions that promote awareness, attention, and advocacy beyond typical membership agreements. Four thematic areas emerged from the data (Community, Identities, Leadership, Resources), with each including three action categories (Learn, Grow, or Practice).\n\n\nTo share the findings generated throughout the project with a broad public audience, we created action cards and designed an accessible website, Building Inclusive Makerspaces. The website contents include:\n\n\n1. An overview of the project and its methods, and a page acknowledging the people who contributed to the research.\n\n\n2. A set of action cards that invite people to consider the different ways they can make their makerspace more inclusive. The cards are written for a broad audience so they can be used by members of both academic and non-academic makerspaces.\n\n\n3. A library of resources related to inclusivity and equity in makerspaces, featuring theoretical models, empirical research, and examples of exemplary makerspace programs.\n\n\nThe Building Inclusive Makerspaces website is hosted by the Virginia Tech Center for Education Networks and Impacts and is also included in the resource libraries of many of our partners. \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/10/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: LisaDMcnair\n"
