 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Geospace Environment Modeling (GEM) Program is a broad-based, community-initiated research program on the physics of the Earth's magnetosphere and the coupling of the magnetosphere to the atmosphere and to the solar wind.  The work of GEM is accomplished in a series of campaigns and focus groups that solve specific problems leading to the construction of a global Geospace General Circulation Model (GGCM) with predictive capability. This project will contribute essential results to this goal pertaining to understanding a fundamental and mysterious mode of magnetic storms termed Sawtooth oscillations. Particularly, the project will investigate the potential role that heavy Oxygen ions escaping from the upper atmosphere may play in this. In addition, the project will support a graduate student participating in the research effort at University of New Hampshire. \r\n\r\nThe specific goal of this investigation is to perform a superposed epoch analysis of ion outflow observed by the FAST spacecraft on the nightside during sawtooth events.  The study will utilize a publicized database of 122 sawtooth events, comprising nearly 500 individual oscillations, which occurred during the FAST era (October 1996 to April 2009). About two thirds of these have coverage of the nightside aurora. This constitutes a sufficiently large set of events to allow for a comparison between the two main solar-wind drivers of Sawtooth events (SIR-driven and ICME-driven events, respectively) and to be able to compare these with the outflow from non-sawtooth events.  Specifically, the superposed epoch analysis of the FAST data will be used to determine whether the observed outflow increases after each \"tooth,\" driving the next tooth.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nSawtooth events are periodic substorms that tend to occur during storm times.  This goal of this project was to determine if sawtooth events are driven by heavy ion outflow.  There is a hypothesis that sawtooth events are driven by a feedback mechanism in which one substorm drives energy into the nightside auroral region which causes enhanced outflow, and then that enhanced outflow triggers the next substorm.  Simulations indicated that this mechanism may be operating during ICME driven storms, but that sawtooth events during SIR storms are externally driven.  To test this hypothesis, and further our understanding of sawtooth events we have used magnetotail data from Cluster, auroral outflow measurements from FAST, and global auroral images from IMAGE to study the development of one CME and one SIR substorm (Lund et al., 2018).  The results did not show a systematic increase of O+ density or pressure in the plasma sheet prior to each event, in contrast to the hypothesis.  In addition, a survey of the O+ observed in the tail during sawtooth events showed that in most cases they had the characteristics of ions coming from the cusp, not from the nightside aurora.  Thus, no evidence was found supporting the hypothesis that increased nightside outflow was driving each subsequent \"tooth\".  A second method to test the hypothesis is to determine how the outflow in the auroral and cusp regions change before and after each substorm onset during the sawtooth events.  As a first test, we determine what energy input is required to drive the H+ and O+ outflow.  We determined empirical relations that show how the H+ and O+ outflow depends on Poynting flux and on soft electron preciptiation (Zhao et al. 2020).  This is the first time these relationships have been determined for individual ion species. These relations can be used to drive outflow in the global models used to study sawtooth events.  We have performed an initial superposed epoch analysis of the how the outflow varies as a function of time relative to the substorm onset during CME and SIR storms using 2 years of FAST data.  However, there were not sufficient events to draw a significant conclusion.  We are finalizing a recalibration of the FAST/TEAMS dataset that will allow us to use the full dataset, from 1996 to 2009, which will provide enough events to do a significant comparison. \n\nThis project had the broader impact that it has resulted in a significantly improved FAST/TEAMS dataset.  When trying to process the full dataset, we discovered that the calibrations needed to be updated, and there were some digital problems with the on-board diginatl processing that needed to to corrected.  This has now been accomplished.  Separate money has been obtained to make this improved dataset publicly available.  This project had the additional broader impact the it supported the graduate education of a student from an underrepresented group.  She learned both the in-depth details of space flight instrumentation in addition to the physics of ion outflow and magnetospheric physics.  Understanding the drivers of sawtooth events improves our ability to understand and predict Space Weather, which has broad societal impact.  The improved characterizaton of the heavy ion outflow will be an important contribution to future model development and validation.\n\n \n\nPublications\n\nLund, E. J., Nowrouzi, N., Kistler, L.
