 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to build cybersecurity capacity of the United States in pervasive computing. Although significant efforts have been made in addressing the security and privacy issues of pervasive computing in research community, a strategic implementation that promotes workforce development from both academic and experiential learning in cybersecurity education is still lacking in pervasive computing. It is imperative to bring cybersecurity research results into education, cultivate the well prepared cybersecurity workforce, and strengthen the long-term collaboration among academic institutions, industry, and government. \r\n\r\nThe project identifies five major objectives in security and privacy issues of pervasive computing: 1) developing new courses and course modules; 2) constructing hands-on virtual labs; 3) engaging students in research with timely research topics; 4) establishing and strengthening relationships with partners; and 5) developing career interest and professional capabilities in cybersecurity with a focus on women and underrepresented students. Unified under the central theme of security and privacy, the wide coverage of cyberspace facets in pervasive computing will allow students to learn the state-of-the-art research findings, gain hands-on experiences from the most up-to-date software, platforms, and infrastructures, engage in scientific research in their best interests, and obtain a comprehensive in-breadth appreciation of the overall cybersecurity state-of-the-art through the new courses and labs, industry-sponsored capstones, cooperative research projects, cybersecurity student organizations, invited talks, and webinars held by the proposed project.",
