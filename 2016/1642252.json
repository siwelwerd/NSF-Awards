 "awd_abstract_narration": "The process of collecting traffic data has long been considered as one of the important components of a city, because traffic data are used not only for traveler information systems but also as an input to support traffic control on urban streets. In the foreseeable future, we envision that in a smart and connected city the current roadway-based infrastructure for traffic data collection, such as loops, microwave sensors, or laser detectors, will be replaced by vehicle-based data. Such a paradigm shift would result in significant cost savings as well as the generation of a new form of traffic data that is more powerful than the existing one. It will make our traffic management systems more efficient and our cities more livable. The aim of this EArly-concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) project is to expedite the process that would lead to such a paradigm shift. The project envisions a system in which drivers interact with traffic control by providing their time-dependent speed and positioning information to the system as \"votes\" in exchange for possible priority service. Involving system users in system control through \"voting\" will engender interest in cutting-edge systems engineering techniques, especially for K-12 students. \r\n\r\nThe research will provide significant advances in understanding opportunities for traffic management systems in smart and connected communities, where interaction between traffic control and individual drivers is practicable. Such interaction, a feature currently available only to special-class vehicles, would fundamentally change conventional theory for algorithm development. It could impact user-equilibrium and system optimum theories that govern route choice behavior of drivers and optimal system control at the network level. This project explores a new class of algorithms that directly utilize spatial data, as opposed to spot data used currently, to support traffic control algorithms. The new algorithms will differ from existing ones in that \"qualitative information\" about traffic states will be employed as an input to traffic control (e.g. \"a very long queue\" instead of the actual queue length). Such information can be readily inferred from speed and positioning data of individual vehicles. The interaction between individual vehicles and system control will provide system users with opportunities to inform the system of the value of their trips. Such capabilities will engender a need to rethink user equilibrium and other models of travel behavior.",

The combined model is comprised of the Normalized Scoring Method (NSM), Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and the similarity measure based on the Proportion Discordance Ratio (PDR).  From each of the three proposed methodologies for the combined model, scores are obtained for all entities, and the combined model outputs a final set of ranking based on these scores.  The numeric analysis shows that the overall results based on the combined model are more realistic than the ones based on only one method.  This methodology is capable of measuring traffic congestion levels more objectively, especially when data from individual travelers becomes available since a sample dataset collected from individual travelers is more representative of the general population of drivers, and the analysis based on this dataset would be less biased.  The combined model we proposed can be applied to new data sources to generate an even more accurate assessment of traffic congestion levels for the metropolitan areas.  Such assessment would lead to the development of effective policies to reduce traffic congestion levels, which would then contribute to cost savings for both governments and drivers. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/12/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Wei Hua Lin"
