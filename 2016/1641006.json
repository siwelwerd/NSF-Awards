 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract Title: Electrodynamic simulation software for modelling the quantum effects in hybrid optoelectronic devices. \r\n\r\n\r\nNontechnical \r\nElectrodynamic simulation software is indispensable in designing optoelectronic devices. It is used to predict and optimize device performance. Conventional simulation software solves the Maxwell's equations, which govern the propagation of light. It is designed for classical devices, which means that it does not include quantum effects. In recent years, quantum effects have become increasingly important in miniaturized optical devices. For example, a quantum dot, an element that can absorb or emit a single photon, can be used as an extremely energy-efficient switch. Such devices cannot be modelled using existing electrodynamic simulation tools. The project will develop a new simulation tool to incorporate quantum effects into classical electrodynamic simulation. To achieve this goal, the project will research a new quantum scattering theory that can interface with the classical Maxwell's equations. The result of the project includes a general-purpose simulator that allows scientists and engineers to efficiently explore quantum effects for next-generation optoelectronic devices. Preliminary studies show that intriguing quantum effects in this new design space could be used in fast and secure communication, renewable energy sources, and medical imaging. These technological areas are of significant societal benefits. The software development will also bring significant educational benefits, particularly through an online open-source platform. New opportunities will be created for K-12 students to learn light sciences as well as scientific programming through an integrated research and education program.\r\n\r\nTechnical\r\nThis project will develop a general-purpose, open-source simulation tool for modeling hybrid photonic devices. Hybrid devices integrate complex nanophotonic structures with quantum two-level systems. These quantum elements enable unconventional functionalities, such as low-power optical switching, quantum information processing, and dynamic wave-front generation. However, the numerical modeling of hybrid devices is extremely difficult because both the Maxwell's equations and the Schrodinger equation must be solved simultaneously. Analytical methods do exist today, but they are only suitable for low dimensional problems such as those in cavity and waveguide quantum electrodynamics. The project will develop a numerical tool for generic modelling of hybrid devices. It will first develop a non-perturbative quantum scattering theory to model the transport of Fock-state photons in three dimensional spaces. The theory explicitly includes the spatial degrees of freedom of photons, which makes it possible to be directly integrated into classical electrodynamic simulation. Based on the theory, numerical simulation software will be implemented and will be released as an open-source project.",
