Approximately 200 young faculty will attend the workshop, which will last a full day.  The workshop will enable young faculty to better frame their research and to write higher quality proposals.  This will lead to better research, more effective teaching and more effective use of NSF funds.\r\n\r\nThis workshop will be conducted on August 23, 2016, in Charlotte, North Carolina.  The workshop agenda includes a session on proposal writing best practices, presentations by previous CAREER awardees, and a session of framing research hypotheses and broader impacts.",
