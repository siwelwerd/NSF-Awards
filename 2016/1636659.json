 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary research objective of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program award is to investigate the microstructural and mechanical properties of materials composed of randomly cross-linked fibers. Fibrous materials are ubiquitous, multifunctional entities with distinctive benefits such as high specific stiffness and adjustable mechanical properties. In these materials, regardless of the intended functions, a filamentous skeleton provides the structural integrity against external forces. In this research, state-of-the-art computational models and novel analysis tools will be created to determine the underlying physical mechanisms which govern the mechanics of three dimensional fiber networks. Specifically, a multiscale model will be developed to bridge different length scales and characterize the mechanical behavior in terms of morphological and microstructural properties. This research will establish a new way of thinking about the mechanics of three-dimensional fiber networks and its relationship to the spatial distribution, assembly, and structural properties of the constituents. \r\n\r\nThe creation of new knowledge on the key mechanisms governing the mechanics of generic three-dimensional fiber networks is expected to carry significant potential for creating a more complete understanding of mechanical properties of biological and manmade materials such as the cell cytoskeleton, collagenous soft tissue, blood clots, battery substrates, filters, and paper products. Therefore, the outcomes of this project will be of great importance not only from a computational mechanics perspective but also as a computational framework for other scientists investigating properties of filamentous materials. A comprehensive educational plan and outreach activities are also planned to enhance the engagement of high school students in science and engineering disciplines, and to train the next generation of diverse and capable scientists and engineers. Presentations on the general topics of engineering will be given to the high school students, an engineering project based on this research will be developed for the incoming freshman students, and undergraduate and graduate students will be mentored to gain the required training for independent research in the field of mechanics of materials.",
