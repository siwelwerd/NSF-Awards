 "awd_abstract_narration": "Through the acquisition of a Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectrometer with extended spectral ranges and optical cryostat, this Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) award supports and enhances the research and educational capabilities at Ramapo College of New Jersey (RCNJ), a predominantly undergraduate institution. The instrument will enable several research activities pursued by one tenure-track and one tenured faculty at RCNJ. These activities include optical spectroscopy studies of: (a) spintronics materials, aimed at manipulating the spin of electrons in technological applications such as high-speed electronics, high volume storage or quantum computing; (b) hard coating ceramic thin films for use in space and nuclear applications; and (c) monolayer thin films of functional polymers, which play an important role in different technologies, including liquid-liquid extraction, stabilization of emulsions, and formation of supramolecular structures by self-assembly. The FTIR spectrometer will also provide research and training opportunities for a significant number of undergraduate students majoring in engineering physics, chemistry, biochemistry and biology, will increase the enrollment in the Research Honors course supported by the college, and will attract more undergraduate students in science and engineering.\r\n\r\n\r\nMeasurements of optical reflectance (and/or transmittance) over a wide spectral range (from THz to VIS/UV) allows extraction of optical properties such as dielectric function, optical conductivity, loss function, refractive index, and extinction coefficient. In turn, these optical parameters provide critical insight into the electronic band structure and electronic transport properties, as well as into the chemical structure and lattice dynamics of materials. The FTIR spectrometer, with additional capabilities, will enable several research activities, including: (a) temperature dependent optical spectroscopy on single crystals of bulk Dirac fermions and bulk Rashba semiconductors. The goals are to advance the understanding of the origin of bulk Dirac band dispersion, and to provide a reliable experimental procedure for determining the bulk Rashba parameters in noncentrosymmetric semiconductors with strong spin-orbit coupling; (b) effects of ion-irradiation on hard coatings of ceramic thin films. This research aims to utilize optical spectroscopy as a non-destructive tool for assessing the effects of irradiation on crystal and chemical structures of ceramic thin films; (c) direct structural measurements of the orientation of functional groups in polymer films. The main goal is to further the understanding of the structure and orientation of polymers and proteins in mixed monolayer films.",

We performed a detailed study of optical properties of transparent conductive oxides deposited by pulsed laser deposition and by ion plating with direct-current arc discharge. In particular, we investigated In, Al and Ga-doped Zinc Oxide (IZO, AZO, and GZO respectively) thin films. Figures 1.a, 1.b and 1.c show an example of optical reflectance measured using the FTIR instrument on GZO thin films deposited on Corning glass by ion plating. We studied here the effects of current discharge (I<sub>D</sub>) and oxygen flow rate (OFR) on optical properties. One of the challenges to overcome was to correctly subtract the substrate contribution. This was accomplished by measuring the uncoated substrate separately (Fig. 1.d), then fitting its corrected, single-bounce reflectance with a Lorentz-Drude (LD) model. Once the LD parameters for the substrate were obtained, we used them to fit the data for the film on substrate with a two-layer model (Fig. 1.e and 1.f), which allowed us to extract the optical parameters of the film alone.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>2. The results from Outcome 1 were presented as an oral contribution at the E-MRS Spring 2018 meeting. The talk, featuring as the first author a Ramapo College undergraduate student trained on the instrument and who had performed much of the reflectance measurements, was given by one of our European collaborators.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>3. We studied the effects of Au-ion irradiation on ceramic thin films, such as ZrN and ZrC. Figure 2 left shows the measured reflectance of three ZrN films obtained by Pulsed Laser Deposition, before and after irradiation. The main findings are that Au-irradiation increases the carrier concentration, i.e. acts as a charge dopant (Fig. 2 right), and enhances the plasmonic properties, reflected by the increase of two plasmonic quality factors shown in Fig. 3.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>4. The results of Outcome 3 were presented by the PI as an invited talk at the 12 International Conference on Physics of Advanced Materials (ICPAM-12, Heraklion-Crete).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>5. Results from Outcome 3 were also part of an invited talk presented by the PI at EMRS-Fall 2019 Meeting.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>6. We have measured the low temperature infrared reflectance of Ge-doped FeGa<sub>3</sub> single crystals. This was a particularly challenging task, as the surface of samples is very small and irregular for optical measurements. In order to overcome these shortcomings, we designed and fabricated special sample holders for optical cryostat, polished samples and involved a gold overcoating technique to correct for surface roughness.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>7. The same challenges and similar solutions like in Outcome 6 were involved to measure low temperature infrared reflectance of single crystals of PrAlSi. Figure 4 shows temperature dependent reflectance for a PrAlSi sample.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>8. Two abstracts based on Outcomes 6 and 7, respectively were submitted for the APS 2020 March Meeting.

Seven Ramapo College undergraduate students were trained on the FTIR instrument so far.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>10. Five high school students were supervised by the PI on projects involving the use of the FTIR instrument.
