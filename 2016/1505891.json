 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project funded by the Environmental Chemical Sciences Program in the Chemistry Division supports the efforts of Professor Geraldine Richmond and her students at the University of Oregon to perform experimental measurements and theoretical calculations of the adsorption and reactivity of atmospherically important organic species at the surface of aqueous solutions that mimic aqueous aerosols in the atmosphere. Much of the chemistry in the earth's atmosphere occurs on tiny specks of solid particles and liquid droplets known as aerosols.  Although it is known that atmospheric aerosols have major impacts on our climate and our health, little is known about adsorption and reactive processes that occur on these aerosol particles and the role they play in influencing these impacts.  \r\n\r\nThe studies take a stepwise approach towards understanding surface aerosol processes of increasing salt and organic surface composition and morphology.  The results may fill the current demand for a molecular-level description of environmental interfaces and the need for surface-sensitive and real-time measurements made under environmentally relevant conditions.  State-of-the-art laser spectroscopic and surface tensiometry measurements are used to measure the detailed molecular characteristics of the adsorbed surface species. The computational studies that involve a combination of molecular dynamics calculations and density functional theory provide a complement to these experimental studies.  In addition to these studies accelerating the understanding of aerosol surface chemistry that contributes to air quality, Professor Richmond uses this research in outreach activities to scientists in developing countries in Asia and Africa where air and water quality are both a local and global concern.",
