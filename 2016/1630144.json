 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the important, long standing events that is held annually in conjunction with the International Conference on Automated Planning and Scheduling (ICAPS) is the ICAPS Doctoral Consortium (ICAPS DC). The ICAPS DC is a primary method for broadening participation and improving retention of doctoral researchers in the field of automated planning and scheduling, which is essential to ensuring the continued vibrancy of research and scientific advancement in this area. This travel grant will enable travel awards to be provided to US doctoral students to support their participation of in the ICAPS 2016 DC. The ICAPS 2016 DC will be the fourteenth inception of the event, and will take place in June 2016 at London, England UK. \r\n\r\nThe objective of the DC is to provide a forum where doctoral students, in any phase of their training, can receive career and research advice from peers and mentors, present preliminary results and plans for their dissertations, and build professional relationships. A popular component of past ICAPS DCs that will be included in the 2016 edition is the formation of several small focus groups where students and assigned mentors meet to discuss each student's dissertation topic. To broaden the feedback that students receive, students will also prepare posters that they will present during a social event open to all conference attendees. To support career development, two invited speakers will address the students, discussing research skills and the process of transitioning to the workplace after graduation. Finally, students will have the opportunity to attend to all ICAPS conference events, including the technical program, workshops and tutorials.",
