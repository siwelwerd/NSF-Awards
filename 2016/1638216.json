 "awd_abstract_narration": "The study of extreme environments, especially those that are similar to conditions thought to be prevalent on early Earth, provide insights not only into how life ekes out an existence in the most hostile places on our planet today, but how it might have done so long ago, perhaps at the dawn of life. This work will examine life in such an extreme environment. It is a serpentinization site where liquids emerge from the Earth at very high pH, very low redox potential, with almost no organics to eat, and virtually no oxygen or other things to respire: one of the most challenging environments on Earth.\r\n\r\nPrevious studies of two geochemically-different highly-alkaline groundwater sources revealed genomically and phylogentically unusual organisms and microbial isolates having highly-adapted physiological and genomic features to the serpentinizing environments. Here the PIs will expand their previous studies, focusing on questions related to the geochemical and microbial metabolic interactions occurring at this site: e.g., 1) how do each of the major microbial groups/players cope with the stringent geochemistry of The Cedars, 2) how do these microbes interact with one another to sustain the taxonomically stable communities of The Cedars serpentinizing environments, and, 3) how do the microbial activities potentially contribute to the occurring geochemical transformations? To answer these questions the PIs will test a number of conceptual, strategic and metabolic hypotheses, using several approaches, including: 1) a combination of advanced microscopic observations to visualize the localization of each organism, 2) stable-isotope probing to identify organisms that utilize a given carbon substrate, 3) stimulus-induced metatranscriptomics to illustrate the gene responses to the specific geochemical compounds (conditions), 4) metaproteomics to obtain the in situ protein profiles, and 5) detailed metabolic capabilities of isolated strains that are abundantly observed in terrestrial serpentinizing sites on Earth. Successful integration of results from these five strategies is expected to produce a functional interaction-model between geochemical factors and microbial metabolic activities in a relatively simple microbial community, functioning under extreme environmental conditions.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe proposal represented a continuation of work begun with a previous NSF to KHN.  It has been an in-depth study of a high pH site in Northern California called The Cedars.  Because it is extremely high pH (11-12.5), low Eh (-500  to - 700 mV), and low salt (mM or less), One of the most extreme environments for life on Earth.  it was reasoned that if any organisms were growing or even surviving, they must use mechanisms that are different from previously studied organisms.  In the early stages, extensive geochemical work was done (1), along with examination for the presence of life (2).  Not only was microbial life abundant, but organisms were grown in the laboratory under conditions identical to those in The Cedars, and a new group of bacteria call Serpentinomonas were characterized, with many unique properties that allow it to prosper in these alkaline springs (3).  Along the way, techniques were developed for studying the community gene expression of microbial communities so that the active genes of importance could be identified, and linked to the organisms that contain them (4).  Continuing studies of community metabolism produced evidence of the production of both production of methane and acetate, compounds that could stimulate growth of microbes under alkaline conditions.  With a link to other activities in the lab, it was discovered that some of the microbial community could utilize solid minerals and electrodes for respiration (9), and that the communities from one of the springs (which is fed by very deep subsurface water) contains many groups of bacteria that have never been grown in culture.  These have now been sequenced and their genomes have been published, and the work has been extensively cited and commented upon (10).  Finally, using the approaches of gene activity noted above, the community activity of the Cedars springs has been studied, revealing some new types of metabolisms involving the production of acetate.  This work is now is in press (11).  In summary, we have: 1) defined serpentinization systems to a level not previously done;  2)  found many new organisms, several of which are in cultivation now, revealing their metabolic secrets; 3)  trained many people (5 doctoral students, 6 postdocs, and about 15 undergraduates; and, 4) presented talks around the world about this remarkable ecosystem.In addition to the usual training of undergraduates, graduate students and postdocs, we took advantage of our laboratories on Catalina Island, and had great success in training undergrads from community colleges in an NSF sponsored program, as well as undergraduates in our NSF-sponsored REU program.
