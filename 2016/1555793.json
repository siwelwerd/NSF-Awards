 "awd_abstract_narration": "Vanuatu is a group of 80 islands located in the South Pacific, situated roughly equidistant from New Caledonia, Fiji, and the Solomon Islands, all of which are globally important biodiversity hotspots. Despite its significance as a treasure trove of biodiversity, Vanuatu's plants and fungi remain poorly documented, leaving a significant gap in our knowledge of regional biodiversity compared with neighboring island countries, all of which have active or completed flora surveys. The few existing plant surveys in Vanuatu have focused primarily on the northern end of the archipelago. In the southern part of the country, little reliable botanical data exist, and there is great potential for new scientific discoveries.  This project focuses on Tafea Province, the five southernmost islands of Vanuatu. In March, 2015, Tafea Province was the site of a catastrophic category-5 super-cyclone.  Just prior to that, eight forest transects were established to characterize vegetation growth and change over time. These study sites were severely impacted by the storm, and monitoring efforts will provide an important opportunity to understand how Pacific-Island forests recover from this type of event. Along with its rich biological diversity, Vanuatu is also the most linguistically rich country in the world, with 112 languages for a total population of only 253,000; nine of these languages are found only in Tafea Province. As globalization and economic development are proceeding in Vanuatu, local languages are being replaced by English, French, and Bislama (a local Creole), and thus there is a critical need to document local languages and the botanical knowledge that is encapsulated therein. Undergraduate students will be trained in the analysis of linguistic data, and graduate students will participate in all aspects of the research and receive valuable training in tropical botany and mycology.\r\n\r\nThe researchers will complete the first comprehensive survey of angiosperms, gymnosperms, ferns, lycophytes, bryophytes, endophytic and macro-fungi, and lichens ever undertaken in Tafea Province. Surveys will be conducted using two approaches: 1) establishment of permanent monitoring transects and plots, which will allow for both vegetation analysis and dense floristic and fungal sampling, and provide an opportunity for long-term monitoring in the face of global climate change, and 2) a general collecting approach will be used across larger areas. From these data, an annotated checklist (both hard copy and online) will be assembled using the database of newly collected and historical specimens. The checklist will allow for tests of phytogeographic relationships among Vanuatu and its closest neighbors (New Caledonia and Fiji), allowing the researchers to address questions relating to levels of endemism, species distributions, and evolution of the regional flora. Because most land in Vanuatu is held under customary ownership, and local people are the stewards of their environments, the loss of biocultural knowledge is a serious threat to their ability to manage biodiversity resources sustainably. To support local environmental education efforts, the project will combine the expertise of the team's linguists and botanists to work with indigenous speakers of eight Tafean languages to document names of plants and fungi, providing a tangible linkage between biodiversity, traditional culture, and conservation. Project linguists will produce printed and digital dictionaries of indigenous plant and fungal names and will use web-based videography and 'story maps', which spatially link names and traditional uses of organisms onto the landscape, helping viewers visualize the connections between biodiversity, knowledge, and place, providing a complement to the botanical databases.",

To this end&nbsp;we developed a collection-based checklist of 1,631 species of vascular plants, of which 1,262 (77.4 %) are putatively native, and 360 (22.1 %) introduced (the distributional status of the remaining 0.5 % are uncertain). The detailed checklist is posted online at the Flora of Vanuatu website [http://www.pvnh.net].&nbsp;As part of this work, we&nbsp;documented the vernacular names and/or uses of 10 species of lycophytes and 88 species of ferns. Vernacular plant names were documented in the languages endemic to the islands of Aneityum, Futuna, and Tanna, including Anejom, Futuna-Aniwa, Kwamara, Nafe, Naka, Netwar, Nahuai, and Whitesands.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because our project coincided with the aftermath of Category 5 Hurricane Pam (2015), we assessed how forests respond to, and recuperate from high intensity cyclones.&nbsp;We assessed the resistance and resilience of forests in three contrasting sites on&nbsp;the island of&nbsp;Tanna, Vanuatu drawing on our transect&nbsp;data&nbsp;established pre-and post-cyclone. In sites that sustained a direct hit, 88% of trees were defoliated, 34% sustained severe damage, and immediate mortality was 13%. Initial mortality, but not severe damage, was lower in areas that received an indirect hit. Larger trees and those with lighter wood had a higher probability of uprooting and snapping respectively, and these relationships did not vary across sites. Canopy and ground cover recovered within three years and, across sites, regeneration was widespread across plant types, from pioneer to mature forest species. Three invasive vine species recruited post-cyclone but largely disappeared&nbsp;or declined&nbsp;with canopy closure. Tanna?s cyclone frequency, combined with customary&nbsp;stewardship practices that actively maintain a diversity of species and multiplicity of regeneration pathways, are likely responsible for the island?s resistance and resilience to one of the highest intensity cyclones on record.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, a long-term vegetation monitoring study was leveraged to understand the factors shaping fungal distributions within an island biogeographical context. We examined fungal communities located within soils and plant leaves.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our result showed that the similarity of fungi in plants is proportional to the distance separating them. In contrast, the similarity of fungi in soils was generally better predicted by the composition of plants at all but the largest scales. Fungal communities from the soil and plant leaves are spatially autocorrelated and the spatial distribution of fungal species are coupled between habitats. Habitat breadth did not influence range sizes, but did correlate positively with occurrence frequency. Fungi that were frequently found were also found in high abundance, a common observation in similar studies of plants and animals. Fungal abundance-occupancy relationships differed by habitat and habitat-specificity. Soil specialists were found to be locally abundant but restricted geographically. In contrast, phylloplane generalists were found to be abundant over a large range in multiple habitats.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our research represented the most comprehensive analysis of botanical diversity of this biodiversity hotspot.&nbsp;&nbsp;In conjunction with our Vanuatu colleagues, we trained undergraduate and graduate students in field botany and mycology, systematics, and ecology.
