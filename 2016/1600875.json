 "awd_abstract_narration": "Algebraic geometry is the study of shapes defined by polynomial equations.  The field of algebraic geometry is central to modern mathematics, describing spaces that play important roles in physics, computer science, and certain subfields of biology.  The most important feature of a shape is its curvature -- how much it deviates locally from a flat plane.  An active topic of current research is how the curvature affects the other properties of a shape.  For example, it seems to influence the number of integer solutions to the defining polynomial equations.  This research project aims to deepen the study of curvature and its implications in algebraic geometry.\r\n\r\nThe first goal of the project is to study the geometry of subvarieties from a numerical perspective.  More precisely, the project addresses how the position of a numerical class in the pseudo-effective cone relates to the asymptotic geometry of representatives of multiples of this class.  This is a well-established story for divisors, and recent work suggests a similar beautiful theory for all subvarieties.  Second, the project will study Manin's conjecture predicting the growth rate of rational points of a bounded height.  Using recently developed geometric techniques (known as the minimal model program), the investigator will analyze the geometric underpinnings of Manin's conjecture.  This work is anticipated to provide positive evidence for the conjecture and to identify new examples that lie on the boundary of known techniques.",
