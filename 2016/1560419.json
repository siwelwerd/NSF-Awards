 "awd_abstract_narration": "Through participation in the National Weather Center (NWC) REU program, 60 United States undergraduate students over a 5-year period will participate in a potentially life-changing research and career exploration experience. Participants experience the joy of scientific discovery while conducting cutting-edge research and learning skills to become scientists. Each student collaborates with one or more scientists in the weather, climate, and radar organizations within the University of Oklahoma-Norman's University Research Campus to conduct research and live the life of a scientist. Participants attend lectures, participate in workshops to build skills and knowledge relevant to the job, learn and practice a variety of research methods, and present their research in both written and oral formats. Past participants' research has advanced knowledge and understanding in basic and applied research.  Additionally, in this site renewal the grant investigators will leverage ever-advancing innovations in education to incorporate additional skill-building of software development and data management practices at the undergraduate level on top of the comprehensive activity set. The research community in proximity to this REU Site enthusiastically supports this program, and this renewal will include new partners in the Radar Innovations Laboratory and South Central Climate Science Center, allowing the program to include 12 participants each year. The majority of participants will come from departments with little to no active STEM research. This REU will have broader impacts at the individual, local, university, state, national, and international level through the production of formal and professional conference publications each year while also producing or improving databases and tools useful beyond the individual research projects. Participants' research results may be used for National Weather Service training and emergency management operations. \r\n\r\nThe goals of this REU site are to 1) recruit and select a diverse pool of competitive applicants from across the U.S., 2)  show participants the nature of a research career through direct experience and interactions with scientists, peers, local graduate students, and REU staff, 3) build participants' self-efficacy in regard to their capability to conduct research, 4) expose participants to the variety of career options found in and near Norman, Oklahoma, 5) assist each participant with graduate school and career decisions and 6) track and network past participants.  The learning objectives will move participants from a pedagogical (dependent) to andragogical (independent) role.  The participants will read, discuss, and comprehend technical journal articles, build and use computer skills for research and presentation, lead their own research project (with guidance), learn and apply a variety of research methods to conduct quality research, learn about additional research methods through peer presentations, scientific lectures, workshops, learning contracts, and literature reviews, prepare a print-ready manuscript and abstract on their work, present their research in written and oral formats to both the NWC community and to the broader scientific community.",

Each student collaborated with working scientists to conduct research and live the life of a scientist. They attended science lectures, participated in workshops to build skills and knowledge relevant to the job, learned and practiced a variety of research methods, and presented their research in both written and oral formats at the end of the summer and at a national conference. Over the five years, 543 students from over 100 different colleges and universities from across the U.S. applied to our program; all were U.S. citizens or permanent residents and 11 to 20% were from students who were members of groups underrepresented in the atmospheric sciences by their race, ethnicity, disability, and Veterans status. A selection committee of scientists from throughout the National Weather Center organizations chose competitive applicants whose interests aligned with our research areas. The resulting cohorts were just over half female and the majority were White; 12 participants were Black/African American, 10 were of Hispanic/Latinx ethnicity, three were Native American, one was multi-racial, two were Veterans of the U.S. Armed Forces, and two had a physical disability. Our mentors were employed by organizations throughout the academic, federal, and private sectors in atmospheric sciences in Norman, Oklahoma, and two Tribal Nations.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>All students built and practiced skills for research including the basics of Linux, programming with Python, software version control, how to forecast severe weather, present scientific results, scientific writing, how to design scientific posters, how to use of social media to promote your science, and how to create a personal statement for career or graduate school applications. They also learned how to run a mobile radar and use other research instrumentation. All participants learned about the responsible conduct of research and professional ethics, workplace safety, what work in a research environment is like, and how the lack of a result or outcome is actually a scientific finding. Depending upon their projects, some participants learned one or more of these: supercomputing; how to run numerical weather prediction models and interpret results, spectral analysis; composite analysis; significance testing; interpretation of synoptic maps; statistical methods for verifying meteorological data; how to handle large datasets; computer programming languages MatLab, IDL, Perl; and ARCGIS tools. A few students learned electrical engineering skills including soldering, wiring, basics of microwave circuit operation, and/or rectifier design.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Thanks to enthusiastic support from our mentors and workshop leaders, all elements of the 2020 program were conducted online. Tours were personal and insightful, and the virtual nature enabled many alumni to share their experiences. One mentor team successfully piloted the team mentoring approach, where two participants shared their literature search and dataset handling before branching to different analyses. Participants were grateful we held our program when so many internships were canceled.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Participants' research results have advanced knowledge and understanding of basic science and mission-relevant, applied research. Results have been used for training, emergency management operations, and risk planning. Research experiences were supplemented with tours and field trips which varied each year according to participants&rsquo; interests. We also had speakers from all sectors of the atmospheric sciences by using our extensive alumni and professional networks to talk with the participants about a wide variety of careers, including the many forms of research careers.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Our impact on participants is significant. REU programs show undergraduate students the nature of science through participation in it. The outcome of this program is a cohort of bright, young scientists and science enthusiasts with a deep appreciation for quality research. Of the 41% who are currently in the workforce, 32% are leading productive careers in the atmospheric sciences or another STEM field. Others are using their scientific skills in a variety of other positions including banking and city planning. Almost half of the alumni are currently in school, pursuing graduate degrees.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Participants report experiencing the joy of scientific discovery while learning skills they report as invaluable to later graduate school and career experiences. The scientific workforce is more diverse because of this program, with 60% of participants being female and 10&ndash;20% members of racial and ethnic groups underrepresented in atmospheric sciences. Participants produced or contributed to five formal publications and led 28 professional conference presentations. An additional 22 presented their research at a student research conference. This program also continued its important collaborations across the academic, public, and private sectors to accomplish its goals and mentor the next generation of scientists who will work across all sectors of the atmospheric sciences. This REU program has proven to effectively nurture the next generation of scientists and contribute to NSF's goal of creating an internationally competitive, globally engaged public, private, and academic scientific workforce.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 07/26/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Daphne&nbsp;S&nbsp;Ladue</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1560419/1560419_10419172_1690309784999_2017Schroers-grouppicoutfrontNWC--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1560419/1560419_10419172_1690309784999_2017Schroers-grouppicoutfrontNWC--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"The 2017 REU group in front of the National Weather Center\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1560419/1560419_10419172_1690309784999_2017Schroers-grouppicoutfrontNWC--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"The 2017 REU group in front of the National Weather Center\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">This REU program works with mentors from throughout the National Weather Center and its partners organizations.
