 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project investigates how environmental conditions along mountainsides leads to genetic change and divergence among different frog populations. Identifying the mechanisms by which populations genetically diverge, and eventually become separate species, is important for understanding the origins of biological diversity. Ecological differences along environmental gradients can drive divergence among populations. This project will identify the genes responsible for genetic divergence of trait values among populations of Anthony?s poison arrow frog, Epipedobates anthonyi, which occurs along multiple mountainsides and elevation gradients in Ecuador. The researchers will test for natural selection on genes and relate that selection to environmental factors so as to determine which are responsible for the observed divergence. The results will contribute to our understanding of why tropical systems are so diverse and help predict evolutionary responses to climate change. In addition, the project includes the training of undergraduates, educational workshops, and K-12 outreach activities. \r\n\r\nThis project takes advantage of a unique study system to investigate the drivers and mechanisms that promote population divergence in the absence of geographic isolation. Populations of Epipedobates anthonyi show phenotypic divergence along elevation gradients in putatively adaptive traits including size, coloration, male advertisement calls, and thermal tolerance. Despite this phenotypic divergence, analyses of neutral genetic variation indicate that these populations are not isolated. Using genomic approaches, the researchers will examine signatures of divergent selection across the genome, correlate environmental variation with the observed divergence, and detect genetic changes likely responsible for observed phenotypic variation across elevation gradients. Tissue samples have been collected from 35 populations that encompass the distribution of this species across four replicated elevational gradients. This highly integrative project will provide an in-depth analysis of the relative roles of adaptive genetic differentiation and phenotypic plasticity on observed patterns of phenotypic divergence in natural populations.",

More specifically, the Co-PI and PI examined the influence of geography and environment in promoting population divergence in a poison frog, <em>Epipedobates anthonyi</em>, which is distributed along a broad elevational gradient (0&ndash;1800 m above sea level) on the western slope of the Andes of southern Ecuador. Although populations show differences in size, color, males&rsquo; advertisement call, and thermal tolerance traits, genetic divergence is low at neutral regions of the genome that are not expect to be under natural selection (microsatellite loci). Two processes might explain these conflicting phenotypic and genetic data. On the one hand, genes that are under selection, which have not previously been explored, could directly underpin observed phenotypic divergence. Alternatively, phenotypic divergence could be solely due to environmentally induced variation (plasticity). Many studies have focused on putatively adaptive traits, but recent advances in genomics greatly facilitate the ability to determine the genetic basis of adaptive divergence in non-model species. Funding from the current project was used to genotype loci potentially under selection (single-nucleotide polymorphisms, SNPs) from previously collected samples to elucidate the genomic basis of observed divergence in putatively adaptive traits. The research team examined: (1) signatures of selection at the genomic level; and (2) the environmental forces driving divergent selection. These additional components will provide data to assess the extent of observed phenotypic divergence that is explained by genetic differentiation and/or plasticity.</p>\n<p>During execution of this project, the research team obtained genomic information (9907 SNPs) from 118 individuals corresponding to 9 populations (Fig. 1). Sample sizes varied from 5 to 28 individuals per population. Preliminary analyses with SNP data show evidence of genetic differentiation between populations from low elevation, while most populations at higher elevations are relatively similar (Fig. 1). One exception is a population from high elevation (Paccha, 1700 m asl) that was previously found to be very divergent and with low genetic diversity compared with the rest of populations based on microsatellite data. These overall results contrast with patterns observed with microsatellites that suggested gene flow through the lowlands, while populations at higher elevations were relatively isolated. The genomic similarity among relatively isolated high elevation populations suggest that the same alleles (variants of genes) are involved in adaptation to higher elevations across gradients. When searched for correlations between loci and environmental variables, thermal variation across the year is correlated with several loci (20 or 69, depending on the method), but we plan on conducting additional analyses on our final cleaned dataset to test our predictions more thoroughly.</p>\n<p>The addition of genomic data will allow the research team to tease apart the relative role of environmental variation on divergent selection at specific loci associated with phenotypic divergence.
