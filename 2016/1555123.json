The investigator will study the interactions among climate, soil, topography, bioenergy production conditions, stakeholder participation, and socioeconomic uncertainty to assess their impacts on the sustainability and development of bioenergy markets.  The project will provide new perspectives for U.S. energy by assessing the sustainable production of forest and crop-based biomass dedicated to bioenergy production.  Project results will enhance public awareness of bioenergy and will provide educational and outreach material about renewable energy resources and their conservation for elementary and middle school students.  The educational agenda of this project will strengthen the talent pool in science, technology engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines through mentorship of undergraduate and graduate students, course development, research, and participation in K-12, public outreach, and environmental education programs.\r\n\r\nThe investigator will perform a comprehensive geospatial analyses for bioenergy suitability by analyzing biophysical factors and by incorporating variables assessing human factors, such as stakeholder participation and socioeconomic uncertainty.  A geospatial model will be developed to evaluate bioenergy suitability, while interviews and surveys will be used to assess stakeholder participation in bioenergy markets.  Feedstock planting and harvest decisions made under uncertain market conditions will be integrated using a reservation price approach.  This approach will ameliorate negative spatial factors associated with increased bioenergy crops production and will provide a learning environment to assess the effectiveness of place-based analyses as a policy instrument.  The insights obtained from this innovative project will be adaptable to other bioenergy feedstocks and regions and will contribute towards development of longer-term strategies that benefit the agricultural sector and support rural economies and within the U.S. and globally.",

This project explored place-based solutions for cellulosic bioenergy sustainability by applying three strands of research: fuzzy logic-based geospatial suitability analysis, stated preference survey and stochastic analyses based socioeconomic uncertainty, and life cycle assessment based environmental impact analyses. The activities supported by this research opened opportunities for faculty and students to enhance their research capabilities and dissemination opportunities, and increasing data availability and methodology transparency throughout the research community at large.</p>\n<p><strong>Enhancing Research Capacity and Opportunities:</strong> Over the project tenure, the research efforts of faculty, research staff, graduate, and undergraduate students have been supported. 4 postdoctoral research fellows, 9 PhD students, 8 masters students, and 6 undergraduate students have work on aspects of this project over the years, and have since earned their advanced degrees and transitioned into their careers. In addition, there are 3 active research staff members, and 4 enrolled PhD students who have worked on aspects of this project. Beyond the research group working directly on this study, the greater Montclair State University academic community has also seen benefits from this project. A bioenergy module was added to the The Human Environment course curriculum which introduces the concept of biomass energy generation sustainability to undergraduate sustainability students. Additionally, the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) course was developed (offered to both undergraduate and graduate level students) where students could gain an introduction to environmental impact analysis methods and hands-on exposure to SimaPro LCA software. Further, this grant has partially supported the initiation and ongoing efforts of the Montclair State University's Clean Energy and Sustainability Analytics Center (CESAC), which was founded in 2018 by this project's PI, Pankaj Lal. CESAC supports an interdisciplinary research group of faculty, staff, and students, many of whom have contributed to this project over the last five years.</p>\n<p><strong>Enhancing Research Dissemination and Science Communication:</strong> Throughout the six-year project period, supported research has been disseminated throughout academic, professional, and scientific communities on state, regional, national, and international platforms. This project has supported 1 book publication, 23 publications in peer-reviewed journals, 67 paper and poster conference presentations, 7 seminar/workshop presentations, 8 magazine/ research report publications, and 17 thesis/dissertations publications. Additionally, CESAC hosts an annual Clean and Sustainable Energy Summit which allows student researchers the opportunity to present their research to academic and industry professionals alike each year since its founding in 2018. In addition to these professional outreach efforts, this award has supported several K-12 community outreach initiatives. In partnership with other campus organizations, we hosted&nbsp; a STEM summer camp&nbsp; where middle school-aged students could learn about and apply STEM concepts to the environmental sciences field in workshops and classes led by university professors and student researchers. Several other initiatives including attending and supporting local K-12 STEM education promotional events have been pursued over the project's duration, which introduced concepts like GIS-modelling and bioenergy technology to New Jersey youths.</p>\n<p><strong>Enhancing Scientific Contribution:</strong> This project included four key objectives, which were achieved and act as a foundation for continued and future work in the bioenergy research field. A geospatial suitability model rooted in fuzzy analysis in order to optimize suitability of bioenergy feedstocks was developed for Virginia (loblolly pine) and Missouri (switchgrass), and acts as a template for other regions and bioenergy feedstock varieties. In both states, stakeholder participation in bioenergy markets, and landowners? feedstock management decisions were assessed through multiple survey distributions and analyses. Information from these surveys was also used to inform the geospatial model to add objective/subjective weights to various layers regarding aspects which impact wide-scale decision-making. Life cycle analysis was applied to assess the environmental impact of bioenergy development in these regions, with consideration to resource scarcity and public health impacts as well. Finally, the economic-environmental tradeoffs of bioenergy expansion were assessed in order to inform place-based policy development with stakeholder and public preferences, geographic suitability, and region-specific environmental challenges in consideration.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 04/03/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Pankaj&nbsp;Lal</p>\n</div>\n<div
