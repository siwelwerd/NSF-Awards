 "awd_abstract_narration": "The completion of this project will boost human knowledge of biological evolution through the study of animal weapons. Understanding evolution is essential for figuring out solutions to modern problems such as antibiotic resistance, a major problem in medicine, and for understanding how life on our planet became so diverse and how it will change next. Animal weapons including such intriguing structures as horns on bighorn sheep, antlers on deer, and tusks on elephants, have fascinated people for centuries. The earliest-known human paintings show wild animals fighting with weapons. In spite of the interest these structures have attracted, understanding of weapon diversity is in its infancy. This project will increase understanding of why even closely-related species can have profoundly different weapons. Simultaneously, it will provide important insights into why other shapes and forms in nature can be so variable. Data and specimens collected as part of this project will be stored in scientific archives and museums, where they will be shared freely with other researchers for use in future projects. This project will also contribute directly to the science education of more than two hundred college students. These students will learn how to do science and to recognize that science is a process, not just a collection of facts. The researchers will also interact and share their results with the general public through blogs, presentations, and student-made videos about experiences doing science.\r\n\r\nThe diverse traits resulting from sexual selection offer outstanding opportunities for understanding the evolutionary interactions between behavior and morphology. It is now well established that mate choice and male-male competition can select for differences in the sizes of ornaments and weapons. However the evolution of the shape of these traits is more puzzling. Why has such shape diversity evolved? In the case of animal weapons, habitat-driven changes in male-male competitive behavior are hypothesized to be a central factor. However, explicit tests of this hypothesis are virtually nonexistent. This project will examine the roles of fighting behavior, ecology, and function in the evolution of weapon shape, capitalizing on the extreme weapon shape diversity and myriad of fighting styles in leaf-footed bugs (Hemiptera: Coreidae) to address the long-standing puzzle of weapon shape diversity. Methods include experimental selection analyses, finite element analysis, phylogenetics, and ancestral state reconstructions. The successful completion of this project will offer an unprecedented analysis of the evolutionary interplay between behavior and morphology, using the medium of weaponry. Data and specimens will be stored and shared with other scientists through international archives, including NCBI, DRYAD, and the Florida Museum of Natural History. Over 200 undergraduates will contribute to the completion of this project through Course-based Undergraduate Research Experiences (CURE), and curricular materials developed for this purpose will be shared with other educators through workshops and publications. Training in the integration of research and education will also be provided to a postdoctoral researcher, graduate students, and undergraduates. Substantial outreach will be accomplished through the production of short videos by students, blogs, research spotlights, social media, and public presentations.",

We directly reached 120 undergraduate students via five Course-based Undergraduate Research Experiences (CURE courses; Miller et al. 2013) and dozens more via 1:1 research in my research laboratory. This award also supported the training of three postdocs and 18 graduate and advanced undergraduate students in innovative teaching methods via the CURE efforts (e.g., Cirino et al. 2017). Importantly, this NSF Award sparked the institutionalization of CURE at my institution. The administration of UF learned of the success of these courses through my team&rsquo;s presentations, workshops, and networking. As a result, two faculty were hired in my department with CURE courses as part of their responsibilities. Further, the Provost&rsquo;s office at UF provided funding and structure to develop 23 new CURE courses across campus <em>under our direction</em> in topics as varied as soil science, engineering, and computer science. These courses are ongoing, revealing the broad and expanding impact of IOS-1553100 well beyond the initial scope. <strong>Broader Impacts</strong>: Highlights include over 100 student presentations delivered at local and national conferences and authorship on scientific manuscripts by 22 diverse undergraduate students. I served as a panelist, and eventually an organizer, for three professional-development workshops for women and members of underrepresented groups under the NSF-funded program, &ldquo;Weaving the Future of Animal Behavior.&rdquo; Further, I recently became certified by the Center for the Improvement of Mentored Experiences in Research (CIMER; Handelsman et al. 2011) and now train new faculty mentors in evidence-based mentoring approaches. I also spoke to over 100 faculty at a research forum and recorded a podcast on juggling parenting and work during the pandemic.
