 "awd_abstract_narration": "Remote gas measurements by floats, gliders, and moorings are used to indirectly determine the Annual Net Community Production (ANCP) in the ocean by examining the gases produced by the biological community during photosynthesis and respiration (i.e. oxygen and carbon dioxide). In principal this method works well, but currently there is a great deal of uncertainty regarding the role of bubbles in the air-sea exchange of gases, and thus in altering the concentrations of gases important for ANCP calculations. This research aims to constrain the effects of bubbles on remote gas measurements used for these production estimates. In particular, oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide will be studied.  By making measurements of these gases under storm conditions, the study will attempt to determine how much impact turbulence has on bubble processes and air-sea gas transfer. Data from the field observations will then be used to create a bubble process model which will help researchers more accurately use gas measurements to estimate how the biological signal (i.e. ANCP) is modified by physical processes (i.e. bubbles). One graduate student at Louisiana State University will be funded through this project, and the Program for Climate Change at the University of Washington will be supported through training of high school teachers on the role of the oceans in the earth's climate.\r\n\r\nUpper ocean turbulence has a significant effect on the air-sea transfer of gases. This effect is known, but currently not very well understood or constrained. In particular, the role of bubble processes in this exchange are largely a mystery and introduces a great deal of uncertainty into the use of oxygen measurements as proxies for Annual Net Community Production. This research plans to merge fieldwork and modeling methods to create mechanistic models that will allow researchers to more accurately quantify bubble processes as a mechanism for air-sea exchange of biogenic gases, thereby resulting in a more precise method to calculate Annual Net Community Production from remote sensors on floats, gliders, and moorings. By making precise measurements of  O2, N2, and CO2 at the air-sea boundary before and after the rapid pressure changes during storm conditions, a better understanding of the these effects on the exchange of these gases between the surface ocean and lower atmosphere will be achieved.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n     Mechanisms involved in the rate of gas exchange between the ocean and atmosphere are key aspects of global models used to predict climate change in response to anthropogenic increases in carbon dioxide.  A nagging uncertainty in models used to predict air-sea transfer of atmospheric gases is the role of bubbles at high wind speeds.  The goal of this research project was to improve our understanding of the role of bubble processes in air-sea gas exchange of O2, N2, and CO2.  Our approach to this problem used both experimentally-determined measurements of N2 and O2 at two locations in the ocean and a numerical simulation of the upper ocean that resolves bubble processes.   The research was a joint effort by an experimentalist and a modeler (PIs Emerson and Liang, respectively). \n\n     Experimental aspects of the project used nearly continuous, remote measurements of temperature, salinity, total dissolved gas pressure, and oxygen on surface moorings at two dramatically different locations in the Pacific Ocean--the subarctic Northeast Pacific at Ocean Station Papa (OSP; 50o N, 145o W) and the western subtropical ocean (32.3o N, 144.5o E).  These are locations where surface moorings are deployed annually by NOAA oceanographers, who were collaborators in this project.  The model used to calculate the role of bubbles in gas exchange explicitly calculates turbulent flows in the ocean boundary layer, bubbles of multiple sizes, and different gas concentrations as a function of wind speed (Liang et al., 2013, Global Biogeochemical Cycles 27, doi:10.1002/gbc.20080).  We compared model predictions with observations of the change in nitrogen gas concentration as a function of time during winter storms, when N2 gas is inert to processes other than gas exchange.  Our results suggested that gas exchange by bubble processes during six different winter-time periods over the span of ten years (2007 to 2017) was about 30% less than predicted by the model at windspeeds of 12 meters/sec.  Parameters in the gas exchange model have been adjusted to more closely agree with our observations.\n\n     The main broader impact of this research is that more accurate air-sea gas exchange formulations in global circulation models will improve predictions of the change in atmosphere and ocean gas concentrations due to future global warming.  A second broader impact of this research is that the grant funded training of early career oceanographers in the study of air-sea gas exchange (post-doc Bo Yang at UW and PhD graduate students at both the UW and LSU).\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/16/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Steven R Emerson"
