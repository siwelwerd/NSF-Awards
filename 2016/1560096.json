 "awd_abstract_narration": "This REU Site award to the University of Michigan (UM) located in Ann Arbor, MI, will support the training of 10 students, for 10 weeks during the summers of 2016-2018. This project is supported by the Division of Biological Infrastructure (DBI) in the Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) and the Division of Chemistry (CHE) in the Directorate for Mathematics and Physical Sciences (MPS). The program will expose students to the nature of interdisciplinary research within the framework of protein structure-function studies. Participants will be engaged in experimental training and independent investigation in the areas of biochemistry, biophysics, bioinformatics, cheminformatics, molecular biology and plant biology.   In addition to the research experience, students will participate in weekly seminars focused on ethics in research, scientific communication, graduate school admissions and scientific career options as well as various cohort building activities.  Students will be recruited from across the Nation via email postings, website listings and announcements at conferences, and networking with faculty at diverse institutions.  Undergraduate students, who are US citizens or permanent residents, majoring in a STEM discipline are eligible for participation.  Special consideration will be given to students from community colleges and to those with no previous research experience.  Individuals who are from underrepresented ethnic/racial groups and those who are from institutions with limited research opportunities are encouraged to apply.  All participants will receive housing, meal and travel allowances and a stipend.  Applications will be accepted from early December - March 1st.   \r\n\r\nIt is anticipated that a total of 30 students, primarily from schools with limited research opportunities, will be trained in the program.  Students will learn how research is conducted and many will present the results of their work at scientific conferences. The student centered REU program and enrichment activities have been designed to develop key skills and attitudes, and it is anticipated that the experience will promote persistence in the STEM disciplines at the undergraduate, graduate and post-graduate levels. \r\n\r\nA common web-based assessment tool used by all REU programs funded by the Division of Biological Infrastructure (Directorate for Biological Sciences) will be used to determine the effectiveness of the training program.  Annual tracking surveys will be sent to program alumni to determine their level of engagement in the STEM disciplines.   More information about the program is available by visiting: http://pharmacy.umich.edu/reu or by contacting the PI (Dr. Cherie Dotson at crdotson@umich.edu) or the Co-PI (Dr. Ronald Woodard at rww@umich.edu).",

IREU students from the 2016-2018 cohorts collectively made 11 research presentations and they were listed on 4 co-authored publications in peer-reviewed journals and 1 co-authored published abstract.\n\nThe Undergraduate Research Student Self-Assessment (URSSA) tool was used to assess the level of educational enhancement of the students.  The 2016-2018 students consistently reported high gains in their \"ability to work independently\" and in their \"confidence in their ability to do research.\"  With regard to overall program impact, 100% of the students, who provided feedback, attributed the IREU Program to helping them to confirm, clarify or alter their educational and career goals. \n\nWith regard to persistence in STEM disciplines, 15 (47%) of the 32 NSF-funded students over this award period are currently pursuing PhD degrees, (1) is pursuing a MS degree, (4) are in industrial STEM positions, (2) are currently pursuing or planning to pursue a professional degree (MD, PharmD) and (1) will be pursuing a non-STEM PhD.
