 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ion channels, specialized proteins that reside in the cell membrane, shape the electrical activity of nervous systems in all forms of life.  Naturally occurring variation (mutations) in genes that encode ion channel proteins can determine electrical properties throughout the nervous system.  To better understand the relationship between sequence, structure and function of ion channels, the investigators will use mutations discovered in a potassium channel gene found only among the weakly electric fishes of Africa.  They hypothesize that these mutations confer extraordinarily rapid molecular movements, and thus rapid electrical activity, enabling these fishes to produce rapid pulses of electricity used in communication and navigation.  The first aim of this grant will be to sequence this gene from a variety of African electric fishes to determine the evolutionary origin of this mutation.  The second aim will be to express these genes in-vitro to investigate the physical properties that the mutation confers.  This work is important because it gives us greater insight into the role that genetic changes play in determining electrical properties of all types of cells, including heritable diseases of the nervous system (channelopathies), as well as adaptive differences that may shape the nervous system in the evolution of new behaviors.  As part of their work, the investigators will train undergraduates, including those from underrepresented groups in science, through coursework and laboratory experiences in molecular evolution, physiology and genomics.\r\n\r\nInvestigators will investigate the relationship between sequence evolution and biophysical properties of a potassium channel (Kv) exclusively expressed in the electric organ, a derivative of muscle, in African electric fish. Most electric organ discharges (EODs), are used for communication and navigation, and are extraordinarily brief (500 microseconds) within this group, however a few species have secondarily evolved long duration discharges.  One Kv channel (kcna7a) is abundantly expressed in the electric organ, and preliminary data suggests high rates of sequence evolution and amino acid substitutions in otherwise highly conserved regions of this protein, likely conferring unique biophysical properties. In the first aim investigators will perform RNAseq on electric organ and muscle tissues from 10 species of African electric fish strategically chosen for their phylogenetic relationships and waveform duration, and examine kcna7a sequence evolution as it relates to EOD phenotypic evolution.  In the second aim, investigators will perform site-directed mutagenesis on kcna7a channel genes, guided by discoveries in aim 1, express mutagenized channels in frog oocytes, and perform physiological recordings to determine biophysical properties conferred by specific amino acids.   This work will give insights into the genetic basis of rapid evolution of a communication signal involved in speciation; investigate novel amino acid substitutions in a class of medically-relevant ion channels that are universally important in shaping neural activity; potentially provide resources for making channels with hyper-fast kinetics for shaping electrical activity in tissue engineering and provide transcriptomic resources for laboratories studying other aspects of electric organ development and evolution.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n In this project, investigators explored the relationship between the evolution of DNA sequences in weakly electric fish and the and biophysical properties of a potassium channel in African electric fish. African electric fishes (mormyrids) produce brief pulses of electricity called electric organ discharges (EODs).   EODs are of incredible importance for mormyrids&mdash;they serve as part of an active sensory system that enables electrolocation, and also serve a social role in electrocommunication. Mormyrid EODs are attractive for understanding genotype-phenotype relationships because they are simple: EODs are the result of synchronously produced action potentials from hundreds of cells.  Yet, these same action potentials are responsible for the function of human excitable tissues, including brain and muscle.\n\n            This project demonstrated that specific DNA changes result in specific physical changes to the potassium channel that contribute to the operating speed of the potassium channel, which in turn shapes the speed of action potentials.  In electric fish, this results in a change in the duration of electric signals produced by these fish.  By leveraging the natural variation found in these fishes, we gained greater insight into fundamental relationships between the structure and functions of these important ion channels more, which will have long-term impacts on understanding the nervous system, developing novel therapeutics and improvements to human health.   \n\n            The broader impacts of this work are equally important: this project provided training to developing scientists at the undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral level mainly in Michigan but also in Gabon, West Central Africa.  In addition to this, this work led to the development of curricular tools and outreach programs aimed at elementary school students, as well as continued development and improvements to the EFISHGENOMICS data service, which facilitates genomic studies in electric fish for scientists all over the world.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/06/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jason R Gallant"
