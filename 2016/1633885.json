SIGMETRICS brings together professionals from academic and industrial backgrounds in what has become a premier forum for discussing the development and application of state-of-the-art, broadly applicable analytic, simulation, and measurement-based performance evaluation techniques. The SIGMETRICS conference presents innovative, exciting work related to all aspects of performance, including speed and scalability as well as reliability, availability, and manageability of systems. Highly original ideas, new approaches, and/or ground breaking results are expected and this year offers a poster session for the presentation of promising preliminary work\r\n\r\nTravel support will make possible the participation of students who would otherwise be unable to attend. Particular attention is paid to directing support towards under-represented groups. The support will provide students who attend with the opportunity to interact with a diverse group of mentors and peers.",
