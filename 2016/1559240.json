 "awd_abstract_narration": "This International Research Experiences for Students (IRES) project provides a 12-week research experience at the University of Strathclyde in Scotland for fifteen Carroll University students. The goals of the project are twofold.  First, to develop students? cross-disciplinary scientific research skills by embedding them in projects and facilities that are not available at a small undergraduate institution.  To achieve this goal, each student will join a research group and project in the Department of Pure and Applied Chemistry at Strathcylde for a summer of research.  The second goal is to prepare students to thrive in an interdependent and multicultural scientific environment (and future career) by emphasizing the cultural aspects of the experience.  This program produces increased cross-cultural awareness and competence - derived from a pre-trip cultural competence course, cultural seminars overseas, and the experience of living and working in another culture for a summer. In order to support broader participation in this project, special effort is given to recruiting into the program students from groups that are traditionally underrepresented in the sciences.  \r\n\r\nThe research that the students will undertake is cutting-edge and highly relevant to today?s world. While at Strathclyde, our students will carry out individual projects related to alternative energy technology, nanoscience and materials chemistry.  In particular, they will work on self-assembled organic photovoltaic materials, redox flow battery systems, and nanoparticle assemblies for healthcare diagnostics and therapy.  The students will benefit from working on some of the most advanced instrumentation available, while collaborating with researchers who are pre-eminent in their fields. All students will present their work at local and national meetings, and we expect that many of the students will also contribute to peer-reviewed publications, thus helping to disseminate their results to the broader scientific community.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nResearch is an integral part of undergraduate education for students in chemistry and biochemistry. Research experiences allow students integrate and apply knowledge they obtain in multiples courses. Providing students with peer-reviewed publishable research projects is difficult at primarily undergraduate institutions. Teaching loads for faculty tend to be larger and teaching typically occupies the majority of faculty time.\n\nStudents graduating in chemistry and biochemistry will be expected to work in multicultural settings with people from around the world.  These multi-national groups tend to be more productive and successful, but they require that participates have multicultural skills and sensitivities.  The exploration and understanding of diverse cultures are at the core of the general education program at Carroll University. All students must enroll in courses from their first semester at Carroll which explore multiple cultural perspectives.  These are culminated in a course that requires students be immersed in some culture other than their own.\n\nThe goal of our NSF IRES grant was to establish research opportunities for students majoring in chemistry or biochemistry at an international major research university.  As such our CREATE (Chemistry Research Education Abroad and Transcultural Experience) program was established.  We partnered with the Applied Chemistry program at Strathclyde University in Glasgow, Scotland.  Four groups of Carroll University students between their junior and senior years participated in research projects working with undergraduate, graduate, and post-doctoral students from around the world.  These 10-week research experiences were coupled with two cultural tours.  We began the summer experience with a 5-day tour through London, Edinburgh, and Glasgow.  Half-way through their summer experience another faculty member led the students in a 4-day tour of Ireland and Northern Ireland.\n\nThe success of the program can be identified in many ways.  All students who participated in the project provided extremely positive feedback.  Additionally, the research mentors provided positive feedback about our students and many of the mentors requested Carroll students for multiple summers.  Over 50% of all students who participated in the CREATE program pursued graduate education in chemistry or biochemistry including several who for whom the CREATE program changed their career focus towards graduate school.  We were very successful recruiting female students into this program with over 75% female students.  Additionally, we were success attracting ethnic minority students to the program.  While the numbers were generally small, the percentage of ethnic minority students who participated was over five times the percentage across campus.\n\nGiven what we learned from CREATE program and its successes, we plan to establish a partnership with a different university.  We will continue to integrate cultural immersion with participation in cutting-edge research.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/03/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Michael D Schuder"
