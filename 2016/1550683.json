 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the supervision of Dr. Natalie Munro, Siavash Samei will investigate variability in pastoral practices by developing models of pastoral organization and applying them to the pastoral archaeological record.  The organization of pastoral societies informs and shapes the role pastoralists play in regional cultural and political processes. Throughout history, pastoralists have been instrumental in shaping larger processes such as the emergence and evolution of the earliest cities and states, the institutionalization of social inequality, and long distance exchange networks. Archaeological research affords a deep-time perspective on how pastoralists affect larger regional processes through their modes of economic organization and herd management. Because of their relatively light archaeological footprint, however, pastoralists are vastly underrepresented in the prehistoric record. Scholars must depend on a number of indirect measures to detect pastoral activities: proxies that tend to lump pastoralists into broad categories that mask their organizational diversity. This project contributes to an increasing body of recent archaeological scholarship centering on the role of pastoralists as significant agents of social and political change in general. The criteria developed for identifying variability in pastoral practices are thus applicable to an array of archaeological sites in different times and places. Because of its geographic setting in Armenia and Iran, this project also contributes to the resurgence of collaboration between American and Armenian scholars since the 1990s and provides a small but significant intellectual and academic contribution to the thawing relationship between the United States and Iran. \r\n\r\nMr. Samei uses economic theory to understand the organizational variability of pastoralists by focusing on economic specialization and population mobility. These two variables define four models of pastoral organization, each with a unique set of expectations for faunal remains and stable isotopes. A battery of analytical methods, such as herd animal demographics, is used to study economic specialization. Specialization should manifest itself in the species composition of herds, age-sex structures, and the types of animal products exploited. Stable oxygen and carbon isotope values from tooth enamel carbonate and bone collagen track animal provisioning as well as mobility along topographic and seasonal gradients. These methods will be applied to investigate the fit between the models and the faunal remains from two sites in the South Caucasus, where pastoralism played a central but ambiguous role in shaping broader mechanisms of cultural change and migration; mechanisms that made the Kura-Araxes cultural tradition of the Caucasus (mid 4th-late 3rd millennium BC) the most extensive cultural horizon in southwest Asia prior to the 6th century BC. The fortified settlement of K\u00f6hne Shahar in Iran (ca. 3300-3200 BC) and the Areni-1 cave complex in Armenia (ca. 4300-3400 BC) are ideal sites as they are characterized by exceptional bone preservation. By combining economic theory with zooarchaeology and stable isotopic methods, the proposed approach has much greater analytical power and methodological versatility to detect and assess diversity in past pastoral practices through time and across space.",

It also investigated mobility and migration associated with the Kura-Araxes expansion across the Near East (Figure 1).</span></p>\n<p><span>Pastoralism played a variable but central role in shaping the social and economic structure of prehistoric societies, particularly large-scale regional dynamics such as trade and exchange, and the emergence of social complexity. How pastoralists interact with their world is modulated by the degree of production specialization and herd mobility strategies. Variability in pastoral specialization and herd mobility may be difficult to detect in the archaeological record, because different pastoral strategies can produce similar settlement patterns, material culture, and site sizes, layouts and internal structures, resulting in equifinality. In order to increase the archaeological visibility of various pastoral strategies, in this dissertation a socioeconomic framework was used to explore variation in herd mobility and management strategies reflected in the zooarchaeological and stable isotope records. Zooarchaeological indicators investigated in this study include age-sex demographic profiles, taxonomic richness, relative species abundance, and the indirect proxies of exchange, butchery patterns and body part profiles.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span>Pastoral strategies were investigated through the study of two faunal assemblages from the South Caucasus: The Chalcolithic occupation (4300-3400 BC) at Areni-1 Cave in Armenia (Figures 2 and 4), and the Kura-Araxes EBA site of Kohne Shahar (KSH, 3200-2500 BC) in northwestern Iran (Figure 3 and 4). These data were compared to a large database compiled from 33 published faunal assemblages from across the Kura-Araxes oikumene.</span></p>\n<p><span>Zooarchaeological studies at KSH and Areni-1 revealed pastoral strategies based on small mixed herds of sheep, goat, cattle, and pigs that were kept and exploited by households and communities for their own needs. Sheep and goat were exploited for wool/hair, milk, and meat. At KSH, cattle were primarily used for milk and labor, while at Areni-1, they were exploited for milk and meat. Stable oxygen and carbon isotope analyses are still ongoing, but preliminary results indicate that cattle were herded at KSH year-round, while sheep and goat were herded separately and moved away from the settlement for at least part of the year. Stable isotope studies could not be undertaken at Areni-1, but herd and human mobility are implied by the heavy reliance on sheep and goat management and the mountainous landscape around the site.<span>&nbsp; </span>Another significant outcome of this research at KSH was the discovery of several antler storage units; waste disposal areas; and craft manufacturing workshops, where bone and antler tools were used to manufacture an assortment of small, possibly ornamental objects. Our analyses suggested that craft production took place at the community level; and that each workshop produced a similar range of objects, though textile production and horn-working were practiced in some workshops. We concluded that each workshop represented an independent, self-contained process managed by a household or group of kin.</span></p>\n<p><span>The comparative zooarchaeological analysis revealed that in the South Caucasus, the transition from the Early Chalcolithic (5000-4000 BC) to the Late Chalcolithic (4000-3500 BC) was marked by a sudden shift in pastoral strategies, that saw goats supplant sheep and cattle as the primary herd animals. This shift corresponds with the onset of a seasonal Mediterranean climate in the South Caucasus. Goats are hardier than sheep or cattle and are much better adapted to Mediterranean climates. A second major shift in the representation of domestic taxa occurs across the Chalcolithic-EBA transition, when herd structure reverted back to the Early Chalcolithic pattern. This transition is associated with the onset of a warmer and wetter period and increased regionalization in pastoral adaptations, with sheep being more important in higher elevations and more northern latitudes. The animal economy of the first Kura-Araxes communities in the South Caucasus are similar to those at KSH: i.e. household-level management of small mixed herds used for a variety of resources. This is followed by a diversification in the use of animal products within Kura-Araxes diaspora communities in Iran, Turkey and Israel?who engaged in the specialized exploitation of wool, hair, and dairy products, and potentially more systematic modes of transhumant sheep and goat pastoralism. This diversification reflects changes in regional dynamics and demographic factors.</span></p>\n<p><span>This award funded seven months of data collection from the faunal assemblages excavated from Areni1 and KSH between 2007-2012 and 2012-2014 respectively. The data compiled from these sites and from a number of published assemblages provided the basis for the largest zooarchaeological study of the Kura-Araxes cultural tradition to date.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span>Under the supervision of PI, Natalie Munro, Samei was trained in zooarchaeological analytical methods and the production of manuscripts for peer-reviewed journals.
