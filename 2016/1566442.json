 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Chemical Structure, Dynamics, and Mechanisms program supports the collaborative research projects of Professor Leah O'Brien at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville and Professor James O'Brien at the University of Missouri, St. Louis.  They investigate the spectroscopy of diatomic metal containing molecules that also contain nitrogen or halogen atoms (for example fluorine or chlorine). The work is enabling a deeper understanding of these molecules' chemical bonding and electronic structure. Participants record high resolution spectra in the visible and infrared wavelength region with light-absorption and/or emission spectroscopic methods. This project continues an inter-institutional collaboration of faculty and students at a primarily undergraduate institution and a major research university.  It enhances the research infrastructure at both Universities, and develops students and faculty with skills in contemporary spectroscopy and instrument development.  The project also contains an outreach program that allows talented high school students to participate in the research.\r\n\r\nThe O'Brien groups use intracavity laser absorption spectroscopy combined with high resolution Fourier transform detection (ILS-FTS).  The plasma discharge techniques to produce the molecules of interest employ radio frequency (RF) and direct current (DC) plasma generators as used in industry. The spectra are rotationally analyzed to obtain new and/or improved molecular constants (e.g., transition energy, rotational and vibrational constants, and angular momentum coupling constants). These constants are used to develop energy level diagrams and potential energy curves for molecules, which enable comparison of the experimental results with computational results for these small molecules. This work enhances our understanding of metal-ligand interactions, periodic trends in for metal-ligand binding, and provides insight on metal-catalyzed reactions.",
