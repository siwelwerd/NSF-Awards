 "awd_abstract_narration": "A goal of the Tribal Colleges and Universities Program (TCUP) is to increase the STEM instructional and research capacities of specific institutions of higher education that serve the Nation's indigenous students. Expanding the STEM curricular offerings at these institutions expands the opportunities of their students to pursue challenging, rewarding careers in STEM fields, provides for research studies in areas that may be culturally significant, and encourages a community and generational appreciation for science and mathematics education. The focus of the proposal from the University of Montana (UM) is on developing faculty at tribal institutions, so they too will be able to support the needs of their students. In addition, UM continues to build and strengthen collaborative efforts with the Montana tribal colleges, which could provide more opportunities for tribal students to do research at UM. \r\n\r\nThe University of Montana will expand upon a pilot to provide tribal college faculty exposure to UM researchers and research opportunities.  Tribal college faculty will be offered laboratory rotations to gain familiarity with various research groups on the UM campus, while investigating lab reach practices that are appropriate for the tribal colleges' campus lab infrastructures, the needs of their students, and the knowledge, skills, and abilities of the tribal college faculty members.  The research group model will continue to strengthen a faculty network as tribal college faculty come to the UM campus for one week during the summer and have two additional meetings during the subsequent academic year.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOne main outcome of this one-year project is the strengthening of the consortium of Tribal college (TC) STEM faculty and two University of Montana (UM) faculty that oversee the program.  Twelve faculty from six Tribal colleges from two states participated in the project.  This has led to various research collaborations including: (a) TC faculty's participation in the current UM EPSCoR submission, (b) starting a faculty exchange grant proposal which will be submitted to NSF or other funding agency; and (c) involving TC faculty to start math circles for teachers in K-12 and TCs on two reservations in Montana.  In addition, the consortium has led to the development of a professional community that has led to many discussions and exchanges among the TC faculty and with faculty at UM.  \n\nOther outcome is the desired continuation of the workshop with more exposure to the Flathead Biological Research station and starting two workshop tracks designed for new TC faculty and more experienced faculty along with developing mentorship between the two groups.  This consortium of TCs and UM is ready to move forward with the next stage of professional development and collaboration in research and teaching across institutions and for the Indigenous communities.\n\nThe ultimate outcome is to create a better education experience for Native American students and enable them to enter STEM disciplines.  Faculty participants of this project take away with ideas about curriculum and pedagogies that work well at other Tribal colleges as well as increased knowledge in research which they will bring back in their home intuitions.  The project helps provide a number of opportunities for Native students in STEM through working together with their instructors and mentors. \n\nThe workshop and follow up meetings provided space and opportunities for TC faculty to connect with folks outside the institutions.  Being a member in such learning community helps faculty develop a sense of belonging and gain professional support from people like them who work closely with Native American student populations and face similar challenges.  This helps them to overcome the obstacles such as professional isolation due to the small enrollment size and rural location of TC.  This is the current direction of the project in providing resources to TC faculty, fostering community to help retain talented faculty and increasing collaborative efforts, and helping create cultural understanding across institutions.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/28/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Aaron M Thomas"
