 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) in Engineering and Computer Science Site, entitled, Incorporating Engineering Design and Manufacturing into High School Curriculum, at Lamar University (LU) Beaumont, will provide opportunities for STEM high school teachers from underserved school districts in Southeast Texas to engage in cutting-edge advanced engineering design and manufacturing research and develop curriculum modules based on their research. Advanced design and manufacturing is an industry with growing opportunities for creating the next generation workforce. Given the many petrochemical, manufacturing and military operations in the Beaumont-Port Arthur area the research topic is of high economic impact to the region. LU is uniquely located amongst the local manufacturing and petrochemical industry in the Beaumont-Port Arthur area and it is anticipated that the project will help strengthen education in design and manufacturing, and ultimately help the workforce to be more competitive. Research projects include: advanced design and manufacturing, including computer-aided design and manufacturing, computer-numerically controlled machining, 3D printing, laser marking and micro-machining; sustainable microelectronics manufacturing and design; intelligent sensor technology in building materials design; computational fluid dynamics (CFD) assisted design in industrial applications; and synthesis, simulation, and manufacturing of legged robotics. This research experience will help teachers to develop and implement innovative curriculum by translating cutting-edge research in advanced design and manufacturing into high school classrooms, strengthen education in design and manufacturing, enrich the professional development of future leaders in STEM education, result in innovative STEM curriculum and stimulate the interest of high school students in scientific inquiry and engineering.  The project will positively influence the learning and career paths of young students, especially those from underserved districts and underrepresented groups in Southeast Texas for years to come and contribute to a technology-savvy workforce. \r\n \r\nOver a three-year period, this RET Site will offer an intensive 6-week summer research program to a total of 36 STEM high school teachers.  They will join faculty mentors and their research teams in performing cutting-edge advanced engineering design and manufacturing research and developing and implementing innovative high school curriculum based on their research that meets Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS) standards. The RET Site program will also include workshops, seminars, field trips to local industry, teacher project and course module presentations and extensive follow-up activities during the academic year.  Dissemination of the project outcomes will be through LU's RET website, conference and journal papers, TeachEngineering.org and alumni and  students in the largest domestic online Masters Program of Educational Leadership at LU.",
