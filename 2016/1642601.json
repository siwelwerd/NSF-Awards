 "awd_abstract_narration": "Wireless communication systems are in increasingly high demand among industry, government, and the public, even while a large swath of the radio spectrum in the millimeter-wave (mm-wave) band goes underutilized. Such network systems support diverse uses such as smart grid electrical infrastructure, homeland security, military applications, environmental monitoring, and medical and transportation advances. To meet demand, cellular providers need access to more bandwidth, which also happens to be their primary capital expenditure. By making better use of available spectrum in the 30-300 GHz, i.e., mm-wave band, providers not only could offer less costly service, but also could potentially make transformative cellular access and coverage improvements for current customers and the underserved. This project addresses a number of stubborn technical obstacles limiting mm-wave band use. To overcome these challenges, a multidisciplinary team will extend signal processing, communication theory, and electromagnetics knowledge to develop novel reconfigurable antennas and communication technologies for this band. Further, strong industry connections among team members will help facilitate commercialization. The project also includes goals to share a mm-wave testbed with industry and the public for remote testing, and to educate students at several universities--notably at California State University, Bakersfield, which primarily serves underrepresented students.\r\n\r\nThe project goal is to leverage the additional degrees of freedom provided by a new reconfigurable antenna design to establish new beamforming and beamsteering methodologies that overcome substantive propagation challenges at mm-wave frequencies. The project can also significantly impact electrical engineering, computer and information science, and the mathematical and physical sciences. Outcomes will include: (1) NEW ANTENNAS. The proposed reconfigurable antennas have various states, each with varying and predefined radiation patterns. Hence, they will support simultaneous transmission of multiple radiation patterns, each with large directional gain. The former provides beam diversity to overcome mm-wave frequency shadowing, while the latter reduces power amplifier design constraints; (2) NEW METHODS. More degrees of freedom will enable new precoding, beamforming, and beamsteering approaches to overcome pathloss, shadowing, and channel sparsity; (3) VALIDATION. Outcome validation on the Boise State University testbed will ensure that researchers can realize projected gains in realistic hardware and propagation settings at mm-wave frequencies; (4) NEW FRAMEWORK. A new framework for state division multiple access will use various reconfigurable antenna states and their corresponding known radiation patterns to serve multiple users; (5) EXPERTISE. Investigators across four academic institutions in Idaho, California, and Wisconsin share complementary expertise, and academic and industry experiences.",

The need to use sophisticated wireless technology has expanded from personal communications devices to telemedicine, smart cities, self-driving automobiles, and a plethora of other application areas that require high data throughputs. To meet these demands, wireless communications systems need to have access to more bandwidth and use system architectures that employ the available bandwidth more efficiently. This has necessitated the move to use higher microwave frequencies (e.g., frequencies above 6 GHz) and millimeter-wave frequencies (e.g., 30-300 GHz frequency band) in future wireless communications systems. However, propagation and hardware challenges such as large path loss and severe shadowing are major challenges of designing cellular wireless systems that operate at such frequencies. Many of these propagation challenges can be overcome by using directional reconfigurable antennas that can adaptively change their radiation characteristics to meet the requirements of the changing propagation environment. In this project, we developed techniques for designing such reconfigurable antennas for operation at high microwave (14-16 GHz) and millimeter-wave (28-32 GHz) frequencies.

This type of antenna uses a cylindrical, all-dielectric lens with a graded index of refraction similar to a Luneburg lens. The graded index of refraction is implemented by tapering the profile of the lens itself, thereby eliminating the need to use different types of materials or complex fabrication techniques. One of the unique features of this antenna is its all-dielectric nature and the fact that a single type of dielectric is used to implement both the lens and the feeding waveguides. An all-dielectric structure is particularly useful at higher millimeter-wave frequencies where ohmic losses can severely degrade the performance of transmission-line based beam-forming networks and feed components. Using only a single type of a dielectric material also allows for the rapid and low-cost implementation of the lens and its feeding waveguides using additive manufacturing (i.e., 3D printing) techniques. We envision that as the quality of 3D printed dielectrics improve and their losses at millimeter-wave frequencies decrease, multi-beam antennas of the type developed in this project can be manufactured on a large scale with very low cost. We fabricated a 2:1 scaled-model prototype of this antenna operating in the (14-16 GHz) frequency band (28-32 GHz for the 1:1 scale) with 17 dielectric waveguide feeds and experimentally characterized its performance.
