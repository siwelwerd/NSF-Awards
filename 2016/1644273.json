 "awd_abstract_narration": "Students who transfer from a community college to a four-year university in pursuit of a Bachelor's degree often face difficulty in the first year.  This difficulty may be academic (adjusting to different expectations in the classroom) as well as social (finding friends and study partners, accessing resources, and feeling a sense of belonging within a larger campus environment).  The combination of academic and social challenges is known as \"transfer shock,\" and this is even more apparent when students face other barriers to success.  This includes students who are the first in their family to attend college, or come from a low-income background.  The Hornet Science Scholars program will ease the transition of high-achieving, low-income new transfer students by providing scholarships as well as the academic and social support needed to overcome transfer shock in the first year. Scholarship recipients will participate in four innovative pilot programs designed to promote the success of transfer students. The first is a \"Transfer Ready Initiative\" to improve advising and communication practices between local community colleges and Sacramento State, resulting in enhanced transfer preparation for all students, and assisting incoming students in knowing what to expect at the four-year university. The second pilot involves group scheduling of incoming Hornet Science Scholars within majors courses, so that they are clustered with students they know, who are also adjusting to the new environment. This practice will allow well-prepared Scholars to \"fast track\" through their remaining major requirements, speeding time to graduation. The third innovation puts into place proven academic support strategies (such as peer mentoring, peer-led team learning, and focused practice with study skills) to ensure immediate success in upper level courses and allow positive progression towards graduation. Such peer-facilitated programs encourage positive relationships between new transfers and continuing students. Finally, the fourth pilot features engagement with faculty mentors to prepare Scholars for immediate entry into science-related summer employment and research opportunities. This will include partnerships with the California Internship Network, which is based on the Sacramento State campus. \r\n  \r\nThe Hornet Science Scholars project will explore six research questions that will investigate how an integrated set of evidence-based strategies, along with creative curricular structures and connection to science-related summer engagement, will transform the success of low-income, high-achieving science transfer students. This project will advance knowledge of academic and support interventions that might ease \"transfer shock,\" and will provide a more accurate understanding about the types of support essential to increasing retention and graduation rates of science students. Formative and summative evaluation will provide information on mid-course corrections to the leadership team. Sacramento State shares student demographics with the majority of the 23 campuses that make up the California State University system, and has a ready audience with whom to share outcomes and successes.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Hornet Science Scholars (HSS) project sought to improve the success and swift degree completion of STEM transfer students by addressing issues of community and integration at the transfer institution, as well as highlighting opportunities for leadership and undergraduate research that had been previously untapped by this population of undergraduates.\n\nInterventions that focused on establishing a sense of belonging and academic success among new transfers included: 1) a novel, 1-unit Transfer Seminar course, 2) academic cohorting of transfer students within STEM courses, 3) providing Peer-Assisted Learning (PAL) sections for the upper division courses most frequently taken by new transfers (PAL is detailed below), 4) targeted academic advising, and 5) consistent messaging about successfully navigating the transfer process from community college faculty advisors, transfer advisors, and faculty advisors at the transfer institution.\n\nInterventions that focused on providing STEM-related opportunities for new transfers included: 1) paid undergraduate research within their chosen STEM field, 2) paid positions within the Hornet Leadership Project, and 3) recruitment into positions of leadership within STEM academic success programs, such as PAL.  PAL, which is based on the Peer Led Team Learning model, pays academically adept students to facilitate the success of their peers using specific pedagogical interventions.  Previously supported by NSF (DUE 1068383), the PAL program (www.csus.edu/pal) provides highly impactful leadership development for undergraduate facilitators.\n\nUsing the metric of degree completion, students within the HSS project were highly successful.  100% of students from all cohorts have remained in STEM and have either graduated or are on track to graduate. Scholars have an overall time to graduation of 2.59 years post transfer (n = 33), which reduced the graduation time (previously 2.8 years), but did not meet our goal of 2.3 years.  Progress to degree was clearly slowed by the COVID-19 pandemic, but we are pleased that all of our students are retained and graduating in STEM.  \n\nStudents in all cohorts were integrated into other campus support programs.  An impressive 91% of Scholars participated in some form of undergraduate research, with 42% of them engaged in NSF-LSAMP or NIH-RISE research programs (four students were active in both). Moreover, 79% were members of the Science Educational Equity program, were facilitators in the Peer-Assisted Learning (PAL) program, or were Summer Scholars in the Hornet Leadership Program.  \n\nOne of our most impactful interventions has been the Transfer Seminar course, which has continued to grow, and is presently being tapped to expand to three other colleges on campus.   Faculty and staff attitudes towards transfer students (previously an invisible majority on campus) have shifted significantly.  Many faculty either have 1) course requirements to get into the research lab or 2) will require a full-year commitment from a student.  Transfer students may not have had the time to make connections until their second year post-transfer, making them potentially ineligible for research opportunities.  However, as a result of this project and the Transfer Seminar, students are able to make connections earlier and pursue valuable extracurricular opportunities.  Moreover, several faculty have changed their requirements to be more transfer friendly.  And, programs within our college Success Center have changed their rules for hiring, so that students with less time left (even one semester) are eligible to partake in their career-building opportunities. \n\nFinally, our campus has finally (summer, 2022) constructed a Transfer Student Center, and invited the members of our Community College Advising Consortium to provide input on its services.  We consider these to be important successes.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/27/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jennifer A Lundmark"
