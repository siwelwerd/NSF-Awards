 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Internet has become an integral part of everyday life. The great benefits of the Internet also come with potential risks, security issues, and privacy concerns. Internet security products are usually employed to inform users about security incidents. There are three major problems using these security products: (1) these tools often overwhelm users with a great many features making their usability a serious issue, (2) these tools are not always accessible to every type of user such as those who are visually impaired, and (3) most of the Internet users are unfamiliar with various types of security threats and thus their impacts.\r\n\r\nThis project translates security warnings and threats into various forms of sounds. The introduced user-centric sonification takes a security warning and maps out the risks and consequences associated with the underlying security threat into a certain type of sound that reflects the emotional feelings of the potential risks and harm caused by the threat. The project builds a repository of sounds tagged with their emotional impacts such as fear, happiness, and sadness. The project also builds a second repository of security threats tagged with similar emotional impacts such as fear of loss of sensitive information, impersonation, and privacy exposure. The intellectual merit of this project includes introduction of a user-centric sonification framework in which a cyber threat, along with its risks, severities, and impacts to users, is mapped out to a representative sound that reflects the emotional impacts of the threat to the user. The sonified security warnings undergo extensive usability testing in order to assess the effectiveness of the sonified security threats. The broader impact of this sonification project includes introduction of two repositories of possible sounds and security attacks tagged with their emotional impacts. The constructed repositories can be useful for music and computer security industries such as Amazon, anti-virus software developers, and producers of major Web browsers. The sonification-based technology for translating security warnings to sounds can be integrated into any popular Internet Web browsers. The project will have direct impact on the development of technologies that enhance accessibility for Internet users who are visually impaired and will increase their Internet safety.",

The research team reviewed over 30 research articles with the goal of understanding the state-of-the-art of risk perceptions and whether designs of warning messages have any impacts on why non-expert users are not protecting themselves against cyber attacks. The result of such effort shows that the current recommendations do not adequately address many non-experts? reasons for not protecting themselves. As a result, there is little agreement on the effects of implementing such recommendations on non-expert users and their behavior in protecting themselves.</p>\n<p>II) To fulfill the second and sixth objectives, the research team collected the descriptions of over 140 cyber security attack incidents with the goal of creating a threat model and taxonomy for classifying cyber attacks based on aspects that would be relevant to users such as how such attacks would affect them personally. This effort resulted in introducing a user-centric threat model called UC-STRIDE (User-Centric STRIDE), which is basically an extension to the well-known threat model designed at Microsoft called STRIDE. The introduced threat model classifies cyber attacks with respect to their impacts to users. Therefore, the three descriptions collected for each cyber attack were annotated with features relevant to users such as (a) goal of attack,&nbsp; (b) intention of attacker, (c) target of attack, (d) consequences of attack to the Internet users, (e) mechanism of launching the attack, and (f) the assets being attacked.</p>\n<p>III) To fulfill the third and fifth objectives, the research team compiled over 70 open source sounds. The collection strategy was syntactical search for the title of sounds where the title included the key terms often found in the title or description of each attacks that were semantically equivalent to certain cyber attacks (e.g., broken machine for denial of&nbsp;service attack). The sounds then were shortened and normalized in order to fit into the requirements of being less than three seconds so sonification would not be disruptive for users. The research team then performed extensive analysis to find out the best form of presenting each sound to users. The research team then performed an extensive study with over 428 participants where various forms and combination of sounds were presented to participants to investigate whether participants were able to recognize each combined sound properly.</p>\n<p>IV) To accomplish the fourth and fifth objective, the research team analyzed the outcome of objective six and obtained very diverse results. As a result, the research team explored some other approaches to build sounds. One of the promising approaches that the research team explored was the adaptation of figurative speech and metaphor in representing cyber attack incidents. As a result, the research team conducted two different surveys, with over 30 participants each, to solicit figurative speech and metaphors for each type of attack consequence to users. The collected metaphors were then analyzed to identify possible patterns in the figurative speech provided by the participants. The identified classes of metaphors were then used as a means for general usable security where descriptive, visual, and sound-based alarming systems could be developed.</p>\n<p>V) To accomplish objective seven, the research team publicized the two repositories through peer-publications (ACM Symposium on Applied Computing (SAC)) and GitHub repository. The technical results of this research project were also published in several peer-reviewed journals including international journal of human-computer interactions, journal of human factors in cyber security, and journal of information and computer security.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 01/24/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Akbar&nbsp;Siami Namin</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1564293/1564293_10459903_1674256272154_MappingCrowdsourcing--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1564293/1564293_10459903_1674256272154_MappingCrowdsourcing--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Flowchart of Sonifying Cyber Threats\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1564293/1564293_10459903_1674256272154_MappingCrowdsourcing--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Flowchart of Sonifying Cyber Threats\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A mapping mechanism to demonstrate representing cyber attacks through sounds.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Akbar Namin</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Akbar&nbsp;Siami Namin</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Flowchart of Sonifying Cyber Threats</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1564293/1564293_10459903_1674255975327_DenialofService--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1564293/1564293_10459903_1674255975327_DenialofService--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Threat modeling for Denial of Service Attacks\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1564293/1564293_10459903_1674255975327_DenialofService--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Threat modeling for Denial of Service Attacks\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">User centric threat modeling -
