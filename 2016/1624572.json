 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Center for Metamaterials (CfM) provides a one-stop-shop for research and development of metamaterials with collaborations between UNC Charlotte, Clarkson University and its many industrial and government members.  Metamaterials are man-made or engineered materials having remarkable properties that do not occur in nature. The focus of the CfM is primarily on optical, infrared and radar applications of metamaterials and the new ways in which they permit to control the flow of light and sophisticated filtering and detection of light.  Examples include improved performance of light harvesting systems for energy production and designs for smaller higher performance antennas for broadband communications.  The CfM works closely with members to address fundamental and precompetitive questions regarding the design and fabrication of metamaterials with customized properties.  Fundamental questions include how radiation can be made to interact more strongly with the meta-atoms that compose the metamaterial.   It is these interactions that lead to new approaches for engineering designs for improved technologies ranging from imaging sensors to improved heat sinks. The projects conducted within the CfM are developed collaboratively with the Industry Advisory Board (IAB) deciding on the viability of metamaterials solutions for achieving smaller, better, lower-cost and higher performance products for both commercial and defense deployment.  The global metamaterials market sector is growing fast and through the CfM, members remain current and competitive on the many emerging technology opportunities.  In addition, all projects are conducted by a cohort of students on each site, several from under- represented groups in science. Students' projects typically fold into their dissertations and work closely with members as interns making them well-positioned for employment after graduation. \r\n\r\nThe CfM's faculty and students at UNCC and Clarkson to work hand-in-hand with IAB members to develop new knowledge, new materials' capabilities and software tools. The technology roadmap, developed by our members, provides a framework for the clustering of project objectives into more specific goals.  To ensure the long-term success and viability of the Center, we focus on research that impacts a broad range of industries. CfM goals are to better understand and exploit new properties associated with structured materials, publish and generate IP related to new components and devices.  Within the CfM there are many foundational scientific questions to be addressed, concerning understanding and modeling the physical processes that occur when waves interact with subwavelength sized structures.  Resonant behavior combined with effective medium descriptions can predict unusual material properties, such as negative refractive index.  Exploiting resonant behavior in subwavelength elements, surface patterns and composites, all demand more complete descriptions and a deeper understanding of field-matter interactions. At the nanoscale many new phenomena are being unveiled that are ripe for technological advances. The rich resources of the CfM are well suited to address the tiers of challenges associated with advancing metamaterial applications and filling technology gaps.  UNC Charlotte has an interdisciplinary team of faculty participating in the CfM.  It also has excellent optical, microwave and micro/nanofabrication facilities user facilities housed in its Center for Optoelectronics and Optical Communications to support CfM projects. CfM supported graduate students are drawn from several graduate programs including Optical Science and Engineering (OSE), EE, ME and Nanoscale Sciences (NS).  Moving forward, we plan to include medical and acoustic metamaterials while retaining a brand for the CfM primarily tied to sensing, imaging, antennas and energy harvesting.",
