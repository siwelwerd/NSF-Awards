The research will provide new insights into interpretations of pollen from lake sediment cores that reveal changes in vegetation over time and contribute important information about interannual variation in pollen productivity and composition of a natural grassland environment.  Although conducted in a contemporary context, the project will help answer important questions in paleoecological research by helping quantify the relationships between pollen (as a vegetation proxy) and key drivers like fire, herbivory, and topography.  The project will enhance the value of a long-term dataset that is the longest-running annual record of North American grassland pollen composition.  The doctoral student will work with a high school serving underrepresented populations to integrate a research-based module into their science curriculum.  In addition, the project also will yield new information and insights to more effectively refine allergy assessments in the health and medical fields.  As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award will provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent research career.\r\n\r\nNorth American grasslands emerged about 25 million years ago and have persisted despite dramatic changes in climate and fauna.  Over time, and especially throughout the Holocene Epoch, the species composition and the extent of the biome has changed, but the role of the biotic and abiotic factors influencing those changes remain unknown.  The doctoral student will conduct this project in a tallgrass prairie in Kansas.  The study area is diverse, with variable topography, and includes sites that have experienced a range of different burning and grazing treatments.  The research will focus on quantifying the relationships between grassland pollen assemblages and the biotic and abiotic variables influencing the region.  This will be accomplished by identifying pollen from multiple traps throughout the study to produce a multi-year set of modern pollen data.  The doctoral student will quantify these data in order to assess interannual variations in grassland pollen through multivariate statistical analyses.  Outcomes from this research will enable better interpretation of past vegetation cover and facilitate better predictions of grassland response to human-induced shifts in fire and herbivory regimes during a range of current and possible future climatic conditions.",

Yet, the composition of those grasslands over time and the role that biotic and abiotic factors have played in shaping them remains a big question. Pollen from lake sediment cores can reveal how vegetation responded to those drivers. However, to be sufficiently informative, pollen assemblages must be accurately calibrated with the modern drivers of vegetation composition. This project calibrated the relationships between grassland pollen assemblages and grazing, fire and topography and quantified interannual variation in grassland pollen. We analyzed four years of pollen data from a set of 28 traps placed at the Konza Prairie, Kansas, USA. The main results from this project are: (1) significant annual differences in pollen composition and diversity at Konza Prairie, despite the site remaining a grassland throughout the four year study period (2011-2014), and (2) greater similarity in pollen composition from year to year than across the traps among all years. These results suggest that grassland vegetation can have different pollen signatures across finely sampled space and time, and emphasize the need for additional long-term annual monitoring of grassland pollen.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Several educational goals were also achieved with this grant. (1) As a doctoral dissertation improvement grant, this grant supported the training and mentoring of a new female scientist. She successfully conducted her dissertation research, presented it at national conferences, published it in peer-reviewed journals (two of them being open-access), and completed her doctoral degree. (2) We developed and implemented a teaching module at Junction City public schools (Junction City, KS) to over 200 K-6 grade students. The teaching module allowed students to examine pollen under the microscope and was part of a larger collaborative effort with Kansas State University graduate students and Junction City teachers. (3) We created a grassland pollen identification guide using newly-acquired digital images of pollen grains from our samples. This guide will provide a valuable resource for researchers and will help train and teach new investigators about pollen analysis and identification techniques.
