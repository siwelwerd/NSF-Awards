 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cell division is a feature of all life by which each cell duplicates into two daughter cells. Eukaryotic cells (such as yeast and humans) divide by forming a mitotic spindle, which is a bipolar structure composed of microtubules.  The dynamic elongation and antiparallel organization of microtubules segregates each duplicated chromosome towards opposite sides of the cell, eventually leading to the creation of new daughter cells.  Across eukaryotic life, there are variations in how mitotic spindles are assembled.  In yeast, the mitotic spindle assembles inside the nucleus, while in humans and fruit flies, the nucleus is disassembled.  The assembly and organization processes are driven by motor molecules, which are essential for cell division, and are highly similar in eukaryotes.  Among them, Kinesin-5 motors possess a unique dumbbell shape, with two sets of motile regions located at opposite ends, which simultaneously move along two filaments emanating from opposite poles of the mitotic spindle.  Through this activity, the Kinesin-5 motors promote the sliding-apart of microtubules during cell division, leading to elongation of spindles and chromosome segregation.  When Kinesin-5 function is impaired, dividing cells stall and eventually die, because cells cannot segregate duplicated chromosomes. We will investigate the unique mechanisms and adaptations that have evolved in different versions of Kinesin-5 found in eukaryotes and their role in organizing mitotic spindles.  We hypothesize that such unique adaptations specify features of the observed differences in mitotic spindle assembly found among eukaryotes.\r\n\r\nA successful collaboration between US and Israeli research groups revealed the remarkable evolution of Kinesin-5 molecules from organisms with unique forms of cell division. In lower eukaryotes, Kinesin-5 motors move towards the opposite end of mitotic spindles compared to those found in higher eukaryotes such as fruit fly kinesin-5 motors.  Yet the lower eukaryotic kinesin-5 motors reverse direction as they cluster in a unique way near the ends of filaments, once capturing second filaments; while in animals the kinesin-5 molecules do not possess these features. Here, we apply an interdisciplinary approach including biochemical analyses, yeast genetics and single motor fluorescence imaging, to elucidate how these unique adaptations evolved in Kinesin-5 motors to influence the diverse assembly and organization states of mitotic spindles observed in different organisms.  First, we will determine the origin of clustering among kinesin-5 molecules found in both yeast humans and fruit fly versions and how that leads molecules persist at different ends of spindle filaments.  Second, we will determine the features that lead one motor to direction switch (in yeast, but not in the humans and fruit flies). Third, we will determine how the physical organization of the dumbbell-shaped kinesin-5 molecules specifies microtubule sliding. These studies will provide a deep understanding of kinesin-5 generated motility in relation to the evolution of eukaryotes. \r\n\r\nThis research was funded by a joint Israeli and United State program in which the NSF provides funding for the US laboratory, located at UC Davis, while the Israeli BSF provides funds for the Israeli lab located at Ben-Gurion University  in Negev.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe project supported research that explained the mechanism of mechanisms of the tetrameric kinesin-5 motor proteins  which primarily organize microtubules during cell division across the eukaryotic evolutionary tree.    These motors form antiparallel bipolar assemblies in which two sets of motor subunits fold in anti-parallel manner onto each other. The research funding led  to major discoveries about how kinesin-5 motors have evolved differently in yeast compared to those in humans and fruit flies.  Studies during this project have demonstraed that a general feature of kinesin-5 motor proteins is their capacity to form multi-motor clusters along microtubules which are essential for their ability to crosslink and slide two microtubules eminating from opposite spindle poles.  However the manner of clustering for the yeast kinesin-5 motors and human motors are very different and has consequences on the assembly of yeast and human mitotic spindle structures during cell division. The yeast kinesin-5 motors undergo motility directed toward the microtubule minus end as single motors and then undergo directionality reversal towards plus ends upon forming clusters. In contrast, the human motors undergo motility towards plus ends in both single and clustered forms.   Our studies revealed that the tail domains regulate the kinesin-5 motors capacity for ATP hydrolysis and this regulation is critical for  microtubule sliding motility.   We were also able to  study how the length of the central antiparallel bipolar tetrameric filament between the motile motore elements regulate the microtubule sliding process.  We were able to engineer short tetraermic motors that can slide microtubules.  These shortened motors show defects in crosslinking two microtubules but once they are crosslinked they can slide microtubules more efficently than native kinesin-5 motors.   The totality of our studies have related features of the yeast and human kinesin-5 motors to their sliding motility properties in living cells and provide an understanding how assembly of the bipolar microtubule mitotic spindle apperatus occurs in budding yeast compared to human cells. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/16/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jawdat Al-Bassam"
