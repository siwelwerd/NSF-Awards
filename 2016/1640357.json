 "awd_abstract_narration": "This AON project will support a comprehensive observationally-based measurement scheme for the Bering Strait, which will combine in situ observations with traditional knowledge from the Bering Strait communities and results from a 4km resolution ice-ocean model, ECCO2 (Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean phase II).  Temperature, salinity and velocity data from the Bering Strait and data products of oceanic fluxes will be measured to meet the needs of numerous scientific, climate and industrial (e.g., oil/gas exploration, shipping) studies in the region. Via a \"one-stop\" website (with permanent archiving at national archives), the project will provide these data and data products to all interested parties. It will develop a two-way exchange of information with native communities, drawing on results from a separately funded project (led by the native corporation Kawerak, Inc) documenting traditional knowledge of ocean currents and change in the Bering Strait region. Furthermore, bridging the traditional gap between observationalists and modelers, it will undertake a pilot study for future AON observational strategies which must surely combine observations and high quality modeling.  The effort continues and expands upon decades of measurements in the Bering Strait region and constitutes an NSF contribution to the interagency Russian-American Long-term Census of the Arctic (RUSALCA) partnership.",

A yearly average volume transport of about 0.8 Sv (1 Sv = 1 Sverdrup = 10<sup>6</sup> cubic meters per second) of water flows northward through the strait from the Pacific into the Arctic Ocean. For comparison, the water discharged by the Amazon river to the Atlantic Ocean amounts to 0.2 Sv. Superimposed onto the annual mean is a seasonal cycle in water transport ranging from &sim;0.4 to 1.4 Sv and substantial year-to-year fluctuations. The volumetric transport carries with it transport of water properties, in particular heat, salt, and nutrients. Being warmer and fresher, Pacific water is a source of heating and freshening of the Arctic Ocean. Close to the strait, within the Chukchi Sea and possibly the western Arctic Ocean, the inflow of warm Pacific waters influences sea ice retreat. This, in turn, affects light availability in the water column on the Chukchi Shelf, which, in combination with nutrient supply, may modulate regional in-ice and under-ice ecosystem activity. Waters of Pacific origin have a density that is larger than that of the fresh surface layer, but lower than waters of subtropical Atlantic origin. The vertical density structure is reflected in the layering of water masses in the Arctic Ocean. Given the influential role of the Bering Strait throughflow, and its potential societal impacts (e.g., driving changes important for Arctic residents, and industrialization, such as resource exploitation and Arctic shipping/fishing), it is important to quantify the properties of the flow and to understand the mechanisms controlling how those properties change over time.</p>\n<p>An overarching goal of this project was to understand and quantify the processes that give rise to these fluctuations on monthly to interannual time-scales. Our technical approach consisted in the joint use of satellite and in-situ observations, notably moored buoy data across Bering Strait, from which water transport can be inferred, along with advanced numerical simulation techniques. A unique capability used in this project was the use of a so-called adjoint modeling framework which provides an extremely detailed view of the sensitivity of Bering Strait water transport to changes in surface forcings (surface winds, air sea heat and freshwater fluxes) resolved in space and time lag. If these processes can be identified, observational constraints can then be systematically assimilated into ocean general circulation models across a variety of time scales through adjustments of the uncertain surface atmospheric forcings. In addition, the mechanisms can also be used to quantify potential errors or uncertainties in the forcings.</p>\n<p>Our project led to the following findings: (1) fluctuations in Bering Strait water transport is primarily controlled by wind stress at short timescales of the order of 1 month; (2) wind stress variations over the combined Bering Sea and Arctic continental shelves controls 80% of the throughflow variability on time scales matching continental shelf wave propagation; (3) on interannual timescale, knowledge of the annual mean wind stress over the Bering Sea and Arctic continental shelves can be used to predict interannual variations in water transport; (4) variations in wind stress over the Atlantic sector correlates better with Bering Strait volume transport than that those over the Pacific sector.</p>\n<p>An example is illustrated in Fig. 2 on how we can use the sensitivity kernels derived with the adjoint model for dynamical attribution of Bering Strait transport variability on monthly and interannual timescales. Convolving these sensitivities with actual forcing anomalies, either over the Pacific (blue) or Arctic/Atlantic (red) sector on monthly to annual time scales (panel b) enables us to assess how the different sectors contribute to positive/negative transport anomalies on a monthly basis. In turn, low-pass filtering the anomalies (panel c), provides an assessment of the relative contribution of the different sectors to interannual transport anomalies. In particular, we may infer the cause of annual extreme anomalies (e.g., 2004 and 2012) in terms of forcing origin. The relationship between the extreme years and the regional contribution give a nuanced insight into the debate as to whether Bering Strait throughflow variability is forced from the Pacific in the direction of the mean flow through the strait (which is northward) or the Arctic/Atlantic.</p>\n<p>The project was a fruitful collaboration between the University of Washington, Seattle, (PI Rebecca Woodgate) and the University of Texas at Austin (PI?s An T. Nguyen and Patrick Heimbach).
