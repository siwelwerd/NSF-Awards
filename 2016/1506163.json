The GR conference series is the principal international meeting for scientists working in all the areas of relativity and gravitation. Reinforcing existing connections and giving opportunity to the exchange of new ideas and form new connections between GR theorists, experimentalists, data analysts, mathematical and numerical relativists and astrophysicists.\r\n\r\nGR21 will have sessions covering topics such as Mathematical and Numerical Relativity, Relativistic Astrophysics, Quantum Gravity and String Theory, Gravitational Wave Science and Cosmology. The award will support the participation of graduate students.  Temporary child care costs that directly result from travel to the conference will also be considered for support.",
