 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Historically Black Colleges and Universities - Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) funds conferences as a means of discussing and disseminating best practices in science, technology, engineering and mathematics education at HBCUs. The goal of the conference at Virginia State University is to review successful programs at selected HBCUs that help retain students from groups underrepresented in STEM majors with a focus on mathematics preparation. The conference allows for the sharing of information about student skill development programs and to discuss replication by other institutions.\r\n\r\nThe programs to be reviewed at the conferences include: the K-12 Algebra Project pedagogy for college-level mathematics courses;  Project Knowledge which focuses on building academic skills and motivation during the critical first three semesters of college; partnerships of HBCUs with local school districts; and interventions using cognitive skills training that improve the mathematics performance of African American college students. Specific aims are to: disseminate information on effective interventions for improving mathematics performance in African American STEM majors; provide opportunities for participants to share best practices that are having an impact at HBCUs; and provide networking opportunities for future faculty training in these interventions so that they can be applied at other institutions. The project is informed by an on-going evaluation.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Virginia State University Research Foundation (VSURF) sponsored a week-long conference and workshop on \"Innovations in STEM Education at HBCUs\" funded by a grant from the National Science Foundation.\n\nThe week began with a four-day workshop on polynomial calculus which was led by William Crombie of the Algebra Project, Inc.  Polynomial calculus represents an approach to teaching calculus that relies on more elementary concepts from algebra and geometry, without reference to limits or infinitessimals.  The goal is to find methods that will help would-be STEM students navigate the gatekeeper course sequence from College Algebra to Calculus, which forms one of the primary barriers to STEM success, and is where many students drop out or change their majors..\n\nAt the end of the week VSURF held a related conference on other innovations in STEM education, particularly for minority students.  The conference opened with a dialog between Dr. Makola Abdullah, President of VSU, and Dr. Ron Mason, President of the University of the District of Columbia, who talked about the role of HBCUs in addressing the problem of a shrinking STEM workforce, particularly with the changing racial and ethnic make-up in America.  Both talked about the social justice aspects of the issue, such as access to quality education, and how many of the problems faced in urban school districts are remnants of the effects of the Jim Crow era.\n\nDr. David Dennis of the Southern Initiative Algebra Project (SIAP) decribed the implementation of the pre-K-16 model which involves partnerships between SIAP and HBCUs.  The model has three components: teacher professional development using Algebra Project content and pedagogy; college students trained as math mentors to work with the K-12 students; and community organizing to bring support to the school district.\n\nThere was also a presentation on trauma-informed interventions in the classroom given by Dr. Alton Hart, Director of the Crater District Health Department in Central Virginia.  He focussed on the effects of adverse childhood experiences on both development and learning, and how these can be addressed.\n\nDr. Cheryl Talley of VSU described her research-based intervention for college students call Project Knowledge, which focuses on developing emotional regulationskills and resilience in students.  Project Knowledge is now an integral part of the freshman year experience at VSU, and has led to a 20% increase in retention in STEM majors.\n\nAll togetheer, fifty faculty members from ten HBCUs attended the conference.  At the conclusion there was a palpable sense of shared mission, and a desire to find ways for future collaborations among HBCUs to address the seemingly intractable problems of education in America.  Everyone seemed to leave with a renewed sense of optimism that soulutions do exist.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/15/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Oliver Hill"
