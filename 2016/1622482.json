This day-and-a-half-long workshop intended for women and underrepresented minorities in computer security and privacy, will be co-located with the IEEE Computer Society's Security and Privacy Symposium, the premier conference in security.\r\n\r\nThe broad goal of the workshop is to increase the number of women and underrepresented minorities in computer security research. Security is a wide field, encompassing network security, operating system security, language-based security, forensics, privacy, as well as legal and policy issues. The goal of the organizers is to encourage Ph.D. students who are female and from underrepresented groups to choose security as their field of specialization. Their approach is to show the wide range of problems within the field and how women and underrepresented groups are working towards solving those problems.",

Venue and supporting food, beverage and A/V in San Francisco were substantially higher than those of previous GREPSEC workshops held in San Jose CA in 2015 and 2017.\n\nThe formal part of the meeting focused on technical areas. Researchers from academia and industry presented current security and privacy research. The students ranged from first-year graduate students with burgeoning interests in security and privacy to students close to completing their PhDs in the field.\n\n Impact\n\nThe GREPSEC workshops have exposed approximately 140 women and minority students to the researchers and topics that are most exciting in the field.  We have structured the meetings so that the students have ample opportunity for one-on-one and small group discussions with the researchers  during breaks and receptions.  Students discover what kinds of ideas and hard problems are on the horizon.  They get to talk to other students about research projects and common problems that grad students encounter.  About half of those students also attend the Security and Privacy Symposium (S&amp;P) that immediately follows the workshop.  They form groups at breaks, they feel empowered to ask questions, and get to know other students and researchers.\n\n Each of the four meetings of GREPSEC has been met with extremely positive reactions from the students and speakers.  The IEEE Computer Society's Technical Committee on Security and Privacy (TCSP), sponsor of the premier conference in the field, has always cooperated with us generously on sharing costs for students who stay over for that conference.  \n\nNumerically, it is still difficult to measure the impact of GREPSEC on the careers of the student attendees.  In 2018 we counted the publications by attendees in the years following their attendance, and we found that there had been 33 papers published.  Two former students were on the program committees of major security conferences.   One of our previous speakers is a co-program chair of S&amp;P for 2020, which at least shows that our workshop counts as a positive factor in career developments of junior faculty.\n\nWhen we ran the numbers in June 2019, we found that GREPSEC attendees had published a total of 400 papers since the first workshop in 2013.   This included 23 papers in 2019.  The publication venues were largely those concerned with aspects of computer security and privacy (e.g., NDSS, ACM CCS, IEEE Security and Privacy, ASIACCS, etc.).  While this is an overestimate based on parsing lookups in DBLP (undoubtedly with some errors) it shows that GREPSEC students are often quite successful in continuing in their research in security and privacy.  We cannot prove that this is the direct result of GREPSEC, but it is strong circumstantial evidence that the meeting is having an impact.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/23/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Terry V Benzel"
