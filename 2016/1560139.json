 "awd_abstract_narration": "This REU Site award to the University of Kansas (KU), located in Lawrence, KS, will support the training of ten students for ten weeks during the summers of 2017-2018. Housed within the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, the program focuses on the use of models in evolution, ecology and systematics. Students conduct full-time independent research with a faculty mentor on a topic that interests them. Students also participate in workshops covering topics including the responsible conduct of research, career opportunities in industry and academia, the graduate school application process, and professional communication skills. REU students will have access to mentors' labs, field sites, museum collections, and core facilities such as the electron microscopy lab, DNA core laboratory, bioinformatics center, and a genomics facility.   Biology, mathematics and computer science students are encouraged to apply, particularly those who are underrepresented in STEM fields and those from primarily undergraduate institutions or community colleges.  Students will be selected by the director and assistant director in conjunction with the mentors based on academic record, research performance, and potential for research.\r\n\r\nIt is anticipated that a total of 20 students, primarily from schools with limited research opportunities, will be trained in the program.  By engaging in mentored, independent research, students will learn how science is conducted in an ethically responsible manner as well as be able to improve their problem solving and research skills. Students will also gain useful skills in disseminating their research to diverse audiences.  It is expected that many students will present the results of their work at scientific conferences.\r\n\r\nA common web-based assessment tool used by all REU programs funded by the Division of Biological Infrastructure (Directorate for Biological Sciences) will be used to determine the effectiveness of the training program. Students will be tracked after completion of the program in order to determine their career paths. Students will be asked to respond to an automatic email sent via the NSF reporting system. More information about the program is available by visiting http://eebreu.ku.edu, or by contacting the PI (Dr. Jennifer Gleason at eebreu@ku.edu) or the co-PI (Dr. Deborah Smith, eebreu@ku.edu).",

All students participated in mentored, independent research with KU faculty for 10 weeks during the summer. In the last year, two students, because they attended local community colleges, have continued their research during the academic year. The projects were diverse and included field and laboratory testing of models, development of computer modeling tools to examine complex dynamics, and use of bioinformatic approaches to genetic questions. In addition to mentored research, the program provided training for the students in developing research support skills, conducting research responsibly and ethically, communicating science to experts and the lay public, and exploring careers in biology. Students presented their research at a department symposium and a university-wide symposium. In addition, five students have presented their work at national conferences. Participants were not limited to biology majors as mathematics and computer science majors also participated in the program. Enhanced recruitment efforts increased the number of applications for this program compared to the previous grant (2013-2015), with a 57% increase in the mean number of applications per year. The diversity of the students in the program also increased with underrepresented minorities as 31.3% of the previous program and 65.2% of this program. The students were from diverse backgrounds as well with 8.7% from community colleges, 13.0% from tribal colleges and 17.4% first generation college students. Assessment of the program using a common Biology REU tool demonstrated the students overall found the program to be effective in enhancing their development as scientists, which is clear from their continued work: of the five students that have graduated from college, two have started graduate school in STEM fields, one has entered a PREP program, one has started medical school and one is working in a STEM field. The students that were attending a four-year school are all still completing their degrees. Of the two community college students, one has transferred to KU and the other is finishing her associates degree.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 02/18/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Jennifer&nbsp;M&nbsp;Gleason</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"></div>\n</div>",
