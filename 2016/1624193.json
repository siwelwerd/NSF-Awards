 "awd_abstract_narration": "Advances in the effective integration of networked information systems, sensing and communication devices, data sources, decision making, and physical infrastructure are transforming society, allowing cities and communities to surmount deeply interlocking physical, social, behavioral, economic, and infrastructural challenges. These novel socio-technical approaches enable increased understanding of how to intelligently and effectively design, adapt, and manage Smart and Connected Communities (S&CC). Successful S&CC solutions demand demonstration of marked improvement (quantifiable evidence) of the stakeholder experience - whether in personal quality of life, community and environmental health, social well-being, educational achievement, or overall economic growth and stability. Research in S&CC must pursue transformative discoveries through a long-term research agenda that also includes innovation off-ramps along the way. In order to advance research in this area, we are convening a community visioning workshop focused on Smart and Connected Communities. The purpose of the workshop is to engage academic researchers, industry partners, and municipal leaders in detailed discussions on research gaps, practical needs, and priorities for enabling the smart and connected communities of the future. \r\n\r\nThe ultimate goal is to create a research agenda to achieve the S&CC vision. A workshop report will capture major research and implementation challenges, promising approaches, and potential pilot solutions. The report will be made available to all interested parties regardless of their participation.  Workshop topics cover a broad waterfront of challenges faced by communities today spanning large and small cities, metropolitan areas, and rural regions. A key emphasis is the integration of social and technical perspectives to develop long term research agenda that can address the needs of communities that are socially and economically heterogeneous.",
