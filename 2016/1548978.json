 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is a dramatic improvement in the clinical success of spinal fusion surgery, decrease in the risk of catastrophic complications and secondary procedures, improvement in quality of life post-operatively, and reduction in the growing cost of spinal surgery and spine care.  Between 1998 and 2008, the annual number of spinal fusion surgeries increased 137% from 174,223 to 413,171 and the national bill for spinal fusion increased 7.9 times. OsteoVantage?s osteogenic spinal instrumentation has the potential to dramatically improve the rate of posterolateral fusion following surgery.  By inducing focal bone formation in areas critical to spine stability, the novel instrumentation reduces the risk of non-union, and thereby the risk of costly secondary surgeries and procedures.  Preliminary animal model data suggest that OsteoVantage instrumentation can double the rate of fusion, which translates to a more successful fusion in over 95% of cases, and potentially a 4X-8X reduction in the risk of failed fusion.  Subsequently, OsteoVantage?s unique spinal instrumentation is targeted at eliminating >75% of secondary surgical procedures (approximately $50,000 per case) and reducing the need for chronic pain management and palliative care.  In future iterations, OsteoVantage?s technology may provide significant benefit to additional patient populations.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will focus on the development of a novel electroactive pedicle screw capable of facilitating therapeutic DC electrical stimulation of the lateral gutter and zygapophyseal joints and thereby enhancing bone formation and posterolateral fusion of the human spine.  Focal delivery of microelectric impulses into human vertebrae has the unique ability to accelerate focal bone formation and enable intersegmental union. Yet, the design of spinal instrumentation capable of delivering DC electrical stimulation to the spine remains a critical factor to end surgical use and effective clinical translation.   The present project aims to construct and implement a computational electrophysiological model of the human spine and evaluate optimal pedicle screw designs which facilitate focal DC electrical stimulation of the posterior spinal anatomy.  Selectively-anodized pedicle screws will be evaluated as a means of routing and focusing therapeutic electrical stimulation to posterior anatomical regions of the instrumented spine.  Development of a unique electroactive pedicle screw optimized for posterolateral fusion will improve the clinical utility the present system of electroactive instrumentation and significantly de-risk further commercialization of the technology.  The expected outcome will be the identification of an optimal pedicle screw design for use in pre-clinical animal testing.",

Specifically, computational models demonstrated that electroactive pedicle screws effectively deliver osteogenic electrical fields to anatomical regions of the lumbar spine critical to successful spinal fusion.  Furthermore, modeling data demonstrated that energized bone screws are better able to deliver therapeutic stimulation to anatomical regions critical to posterolateral fusion than energized tulips or rods.  Selective anodization along the length of electroactive bones screw was also shown to enable higher amplitude osteogenic fields without the use of larger stimulus amplitude or increased power consumption.  Together, these results provide direct evidence for both the technological and clinical success of OV?s osteogenic instrumentation in spinal fusion surgery, and the potential superiority of OV?s osteogenic instrumentation over existing spinal fusion stimulators.\n\nConfirmation of the therapeutic capability of OV?s osteogenic instrumentation and identification of an optimal design for the osteogenic bone screws allow OV to proceed with design freeze, fabrication of prototype hardware, and pre-clinical safety and efficacy testing in clinically-relevant large animal models.  Collection of positive results in a large animal PLF model will support claims that OV?s osteogenic spinal instrumentation has the potential to dramatically improve the rate of solid fusion following surgery.  By inducing focal bone formation in critical areas of interest, the novel instrumentation reduces the risk of non-union, and thereby the risk of costly secondary surgeries and procedures.  Preliminary animal model data suggest that OV instrumentation can double the rate of fusion, which translates to a more successful fusion in over 95% of cases, and potentially a 4X-8X reduction in the risk of failed fusion.  Improvement in the overall success of spinal fusion surgeries translates to dramatic reductions in post-operative complications and debilitating side effects.  Improved bony fusion is largely anticipated to reduce the incidence of post-operative pain, increase post-operative mobility and function, and improve quality of life.  Subsequently, OV?s unique spinal instrumentation is targeted at eliminating &gt;75% of secondary surgical procedures (approximately $50,000 per case) and reducing the need for chronic pain management and palliative care.\n\nIn future iterations and applications, OV?s technology may provide significant benefit to additional patient populations.  Novel osteogenic instrumentation designed using OV?s proprietary technology can be utilized to accelerate fracture repair of long bones, skull, joint surfaces, and other bony sites.  Additionally, OV technology may lead to applications in dental/root-form end osseous implants, where titanium implants are dependent on successful bone integration.  In total, secondary and tertiary products developed by OV may provide meaningful clinical and economic benefits in the areas of orthopedics, orthodontics, joint repair, and emergency medicine.   OV?s osteogenic system technology has the potential to open new pathways in remodeling and repairing bony tissue, and positively impact clinical care in a number of surgical patient populations. \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/10/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Matthew Macewan"
