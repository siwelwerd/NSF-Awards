The goal is to contribute insights into the broad field of cell transport, and to understand how different physical processes affecting the swimming of cells can regulate a host of diverse biological functions. The results of this research could have an impact on multiple fields, including public health, ecology, engineering and medicine. Phenomena that are important to the treatment of fertility and the mechanisms of spreading of disease will be investigated.\r\n\r\nWhile most prior work in this area has been focused on cases of swimming in Newtonian fluids (aquatic environments mainly), and ideally shaped swimmers, this is a proposal to investigate the swimming of real bacteria cells and in non-Newtonian fluids, like cervical mucus. The development of a novel nano-scale experimental technique, based on high speed imaging, for the monitoring of the motion of each individual cell is also proposed.  In addition to graduate and undergraduate student training, a new outreach program (STOMP) will be developed in collaboration with Tufts Center for Engineering Education and Outreach that will be based on using high-speed imaging.",

Understanding the physical mechanisms that regulate cell dispersal is key to controlling their behavior. In contrast to traditional laboratory experiments, the natural habitats of swimming cells are highly inhomogeneous due to spatial variations in the mechanical properties of fluids, variations in fluid velocity, obstructions in porous environments, and the presence of other cells. Through the application of microfluidic devices and high-speed video microscopy, the aim of this work was to elucidate the cell-scale mechanisms that regulate macro-scale microbial transport properties in realistic natural environments. In addition to applications in ecology, medicine, and industry, our results provide fundamental new insights on cell motility to biologists and critical empirical data for modeling transport in these complex systems.</p>\n<p>Gradients in fluid viscosity characterize many microbiomes ranging from mucus to biofilms and can strongly affect single cell motility. In this work, microfluidic studies of biflagellated microalgae in controlled viscosity gradients revealed that cells turn away from high viscosity regions and accumulate in low viscosity zones. Combined with mathematical models, this behavior is shown to be rooted in a thrust imbalance between the cells&rsquo; flagella in the viscosity gradient. &nbsp;Swimming cells also live in saturated environments with porous microstructure ranging from marine sediments to filtration media. In quiescent porous media, swimming bacteria collide and scatter from solid surfaces, which randomly redirect their swimming direction. &nbsp;This research has shown that effective diffusion of cells can be predicted through relatively simple mathematical models with the knowledge of few measured parameters of the cell motility and medium. Fluid flows are known to inhibit or enhance the transport of active swimmers, and fluid velocity gradients are pervasive in porous media. Microfluidic flows through model porous media illustrate that swimming bacteria accumulate in regions of the flow characterized by strong Lagrangian stretching due to the interaction of their elongated shapes with flow. Many types of cells are known to navigate using external cues including chemical gradients and magnetic fields. In particular, magnetotactic bacteria &ndash; which are guided through porous sediments by Earth&rsquo;s magnetic field &ndash; can become hydrodynamically trapped near constrictions when guided upstream against a fluid flow. Taken together these studies show how the physical environment can impact the distribution of biomass and rate of dispersal in inhomogenous fluid environments. These results inform physical ecology of cell motility in a host of realistic natural environments as well as the design and navigation of microrobots.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The research themes examined under this award were extended to the development of novel microfluidic devices for cell diagnostics, and to fundamental studies of complex fluid flows, which are relevant to the environments of many swimming cells. The microfluidic tools and principles developed here lead directly to new microfluidic devices for quantifying the adhesive properties of yeast cells to solid surfaces and for efficient multiplexed screening of bacterial chemotaxis, both of which are expected to find copious applications in chemical cycles in ecology and disease transmission in medical applications. Finally, viscoelastic fluids, which mechanically behave partly as fluids and solids, are known to become unstable at sufficiently high flow speeds due to the accumulation of elastic stress. In porous media flows, our results show that disordered, random media can suppress instabilities through the formation of preferential fluid pathways. Our results also demonstrate that Lagrangian fluid stretching can inform the topology of stresses in viscoelastic flows. These fundamental studies might give new insights into cell transport in mucus, as well as diverse applications in remediation and polymer processing.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;This work supported the education and training of a total of 23 students and postdocs, including: 3 postdoctoral associates, 5 graduate students, and 15 undergraduate students.

Research under this award has thus far yielded 17 peer-reviewed journal publications including in Physical Review Letters, PNAS, Nature Physics, and Nature Communications, with several additional works in preparation or under review.
