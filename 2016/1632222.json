 "awd_abstract_narration": "Baseball players who are hitting well proclaim that the ball looks as big as a grapefruit.  Tennis players in the zone remark that the ball seems to move in slow motion.  These examples, both of which have been confirmed in experiments as a psychological reality, suggest that what a person sees may not be the true, physical state of the world but rather can be biased by action.  In the case of athletes, such misperceptions may be inherently interesting, but are unlikely to have a major impact on people's lives.  In contrast, similar errors in perception by airplane pilots of runway size, drivers of car distances, or doctors of tumor size are quite concerning.  Given the important role of vision in daily life and especially as it relates to safety, it is critical to understand the processes underlying this fundamental ability of the mind.  The research project is designed to explore when and how people's visual perception is biased by action.  In addition, the research project contributes to the education and training of several graduate students and dozens of undergraduate students.  These students are also being trained on how to work alongside scientists with opposing views through a process known as adversarial collaboration.  Although this kind of work presents its own challenges, the science is likely to benefit from such collaborations.\r\n\r\nThere are many important and nuanced ways that action could give rise to errors in perception.  Airport runways could appear smaller when the airline pilot is not performing well, fatigued, or hungry, or when environmental conditions are poor such as high winds or strong rainfall.  The research project examines the potential impact on vision of action-related effects due to 1) energetic demands of the task, 2) difficulty of the task, and 3) whether or not a task is even possible.  In doing so, the research project will uncover the boundaries for which perception is prone to errors explicitly caused by action.  The scientists conducting the research are considering the extent to which any effects are artifacts of the experimental setting, as opposed to genuine effects on perception that would impact how perceivers see the surrounding environment in the real world.  This is a critical step for ensuring that the studied effects will have implications for daily life.  Indeed, many of the experiments forgo traditional laboratory settings to explore how action influences perception in both real environments and in environments that simulate the real world using virtual reality.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nCan action influence spatial perception?  When seeing the slant of hills, the distance to objects, and the size and speed of targets, are these perceptions influenced by the perceiver\u2019s ability to act?  Research says yes, action can influence spatial perception.  This research assessed perception by measuring participants\u2019 judgments of slant, distance, size, and speed, but these judgments could also reflect any number of post-perceptual processes such as response biases due to being in an experiment for which there can be pressures to respond in a certain way.  The purpose of the funded studies was to disentangle whether perception is prone to action-related biases or whether purported effects are due to non-perceptual influences. \n\nThis question is critical because it speaks to the fundamental nature of the mind.  It speaks to whether various cognitive processes operate independently or work with each other.  It speaks to whether people perceive the environment in a geometrically accurate way or whether people perceive the environment as it relates to the potential for action.  Answering the question is not straightforward, however, because scientists cannot measure perception directly.  Perception is an internal, private experience.  Instead, scientists must measure behaviors and make inferences about perception.  Given that these behaviors can be contaminated by non-perceptual processes, scientists must rely on strategies to disentangle perceptual effects from post-perceptual effects. \n\nThe funded studies used several of these strategies.  The strategies included the use of manipulations such as providing feedback to prompt accurate responding and altering instructions to reduce (or increase) response bias.  Other strategies included the use of post-experiment questionnaires to separate na&iuml;ve from knowledgeable participants or the use of correlations to uncover common underlying mechanisms.\n\nAll these strategies revealed the same pattern: Action influences spatial perception directly.  Action\u2019s effect on perception was documented in a wide range of tasks.  For example, the ease with which a ball can be successfully blocked influences perceived speed of the ball. Distances up a steep hill appear farther away than the same extent on flat ground, presumably because of the increased effort required to walk up the hill. \n\nThe funded studies have further advanced our understanding of the mind by determining novel factors that are influential for perception.  These factors include one\u2019s potential for action, another person\u2019s potential for action, and the threatening nature of the object.  Even though the environment\u2019s spatial layout is the same, and so the optical information specifying this layout is the same, the environment can look different depending on a person\u2019s ability to act. \n\nThe research involved educating 5 graduate students, and 60 undergraduate students on how to conduct theoretically-inspired psychology research.  The findings were disseminated in scientific journals and in popular press media outlets including CNN. The research findings have many implications for everyday life.  Architects should consider how living environments will be viewed by the proposed occupants such as assisted living facilities and rehabilitation centers.  Trainers working with populations that have less ability to act should consider how the task appears to their clients, and take care to not present a task that will look impossible. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/01/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jessica K Witt"
