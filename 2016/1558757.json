 "awd_abstract_narration": "Choices under Uncertainty\r\n\r\nWhen people make decisions under uncertainty, they often choose without knowing the full consequences of their actions. Decisions under uncertainty are a basic feature of life and of the human experience. The PIs seek to understand how such decisions are made in the context of financial markets. Understanding financial decisions will shed light on how individuals make choices under uncertainty and aid our understanding of financial markets and models. This can help us uncover, for example, the causes of financial crisis.\r\n\r\nThe proposed research carries out a set of novel experiments on decisions under uncertainty in financial settings. The most fundamental theory of decisions under uncertainty is subjective expected utility (SEU). Its use is ubiquitous is economics, and other social sciences. The PIs propose a new experimental and empirical approach to testing SEU and its generalizations: state dependent expected utility (SDU), and maxmin expected utility (MEU).\r\n\r\nThe proposed research seeks to elucidate the applicability and scope of the most important theories of choice under uncertainty in a financial market environment. Such environments have been, and continue to be, the focus of academic research in economics, and the general interest of the public. It is crucial to further our understanding of financial market that we understand the applicability of the most commonly-used theories of individual choice in such markets. The new approach contains two key innovations: 1) it provides non-parametric revealed preference tests, allowing for a test of the theory that does not rest on particular parametric assumptions; and 2) it assumes an environment of financial decision making under uncertainty.",

Our main focus is on subjective expected utility theory (SEU). Imagine an agent (i.e., an individual) choosing a portfolio. The theory postulates that the agent behaves as if she assigned subjective probabilities to each possible eventuality and has a \"utility\" evaluating monetary payoffs: that is, the agent has a subjective evaluation of monetary quantities. Then the agent chooses so as to maximize the expected value of her utility, where the expectation is calculated according to her subjective probabilities.</span></p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\" dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">While SEU is the dominant theory of choice under uncertainty, it is well known to face empirical challenges. In an influential paper, Ellsberg (1961) suggested that many agents would not conform to SEU. The phenomenon he uncovered, known as the \"Ellsberg paradox,\" suggests that agents may wish to avoid bets on uncertain events, in ways that cannot be represented with a single subjective probability. This avoidance is termed \"ambiguity aversion.\" The Ellsberg paradox is based on a thought experiment, using the choice of bets based on drawing balls from urns. One of our contributions is to empirically assess SEU in an economic setting that closely resembles the real-world environments (a financial market context in our study) where economists routinely assume that SEU guides agents' choices.</span></p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\" dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">To account for the Ellsberg paradox, researchers have developed generalizations of SEU. Gilboa and Schmeidler (1989) suggest that an agent in Ellsberg's example may have too little information to form a unique subjective belief, and hence entertains multiple subjective probabilities. Being ambiguity averse, the agent maximizes the minimal (worst-case) expected utility over all subjective probabilities she entertains. The resulting theory is called maxmin expected utility (MEU).
