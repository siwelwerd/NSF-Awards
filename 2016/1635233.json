 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research addresses the global grand challenge of water sustainability by contributing to the development of cost-effective, competitive and sustainable desalination and water treatment technologies. The project goal is to use pseudocapacitative materials to increase ion adsorption efficiency and novel nanomanufacturing approaches to fabricate the next-generation filtration membranes. The tunnel membranes are based on manganese oxide nanowires instead of micron-scale particles used previously. The performance of these nanoporous membranes is assessed for capacitative deionization. This knowledge will permit the manufacture of size- and charge-selective membranes. The methodology is easy, cost effective and scalable, making it suitable for industrial scale manufacturing. The research will have a strong impact on water purification and clean water technologies. The membranes, developed in this work, can also find applications in other separation/filtration processes in liquids and gases.  This research involves several disciplines in science and engineering including nanomanufacturing, materials science and electrochemistry. The results will be integrated into a course material and will be disseminated to the larger community via presentations and demonstrations. Outstanding students of diverse backgrounds, especially under-represented minorities will be engaged in the research and education.\r\n\r\nThe project's objective is that advanced water desalination membranes, enabling fast water permeation while maintaining good mechanical integrity and selective ions sorption through micropores with tunable size, can be manufactured from manganese oxide nanowires with tunnel crystal structures. The research will take advantage of unprecedented control over the scale of one-dimensional microporous structural tunnels to provide insights into the design and control of the electrosorption behavior of complex manganese oxides with versatile structural chemistry. One-dimensional nanoscale morphology will enable high contact area with the salt solution and it will be suitable for manufacturing mechanically robust membranes with controlled porosity compatible with high water flux. The project will conduct a systematic investigation of structure-property relations for pseudocapacitive manganese oxides in water desalination processes. The goal is to demonstrate exceptional mechanical and chemical stability of the tunnel manganese oxide-based membranes.",

Demonstration of reversible removal of sodium, potassium and magnesium cations from salty water using hybrid capacitive deionization approach with manganese oxide electrodes representing four different tunnel crystal structures. Two of these phases are square tunnel structured manganese oxides, &alpha;-MnO<sub>2</sub> and todorokite-MnO<sub>2</sub>. The other two phases have novel structures that cross-sectional STEM analysis revealed to have ordered and disordered combinations of structural tunnels with different dimensions. The ion removal performance of the nanowires was evaluated in NaCl, KCl and MgCl<sub>2</sub> solutions, providing better understanding of the behavior of these materials for desalination of brackish water that contains multiple cation species. High ion removal capacities and high ion removal rates were achieved. By comparing ion removal capacity to structural tunnel size, it was found that smaller tunnels do not favor the removal of cations with larger hydrated radii, and more efficient removal of larger hydrated cations can be achieved by utilizing manganese oxides with larger structural tunnels.</p>\n<p>2. Development of the synthesis route leading to the formation of Na-2x3-MnO<sub>2</sub> and Na-2x4-MnO<sub>2</sub> phases with uniform tunnel size. Improved homogeneity of tunnel size was achieved by identifying and controlling critical synthesis parameters. Na-2x3-MnO<sub>2</sub> and Na-2x4-MnO<sub>2</sub> tunnel manganese oxide nanowires were obtained by hydrothermal treatment of Na-birnessite, a layered manganese oxide that undergoes a layer-to-tunnel transition under high pressure and temperature. We show that crystallinity of the Na-birnessite precursor and the chemical composition of the system during hydrothermal treatment are crucial for achieving the targeted size of the structural tunnels with adequate uniformity.</p>\n<p>3. Demonstration of ion-exchange process between stabilizing ions and ions in solution during HCDI cell operation. Two-layered manganese oxides (LMOs), with sodium (Na-birnessite) and magnesium (Mg-buserite) ions stabilizing the interlayer region, were for the first time evaluated as HCDI electrodes for the removal of ions from NaCl and MgCl<sub>2</sub> solutions to understand structural/compositional dynamics and electrochemical stability of LMO electrodes over extended cycling. Both materials demonstrated excellent initial ion removal performance. The performance decay observed over the course of 200 ion adsorption/ion release cycles was attributed to two major phenomena: oxidation of carbon electrode and evolution of the structure/composition of LMO electrodes. The latter involves disorder in stacking of Mn&minus;O layers and changes in the interlayer spacing/interlayer ions reflecting the composition of the solution being desalinated.</p>\n<p>4. Demonstration of the effects of operating conditions and cathode parameters on the salt removal performance of hybrid capacitive deionization systems (HCDI). The effects of half cycle length, flow rate, cathode thickness, and conductive additive loading in the cathode are revealed. Hydrothermally synthesized &alpha;-MnO<sub>2</sub> (K-2x2-MnO<sub>2</sub>) was selected as the active material in the cathode. Desalination results indicate notable dependence of HCDI performance on the investigated parameters. For instance, increasing half cycle length increases the salt adsorption capacity (SAC) by ~58% but decreases the peak salt adsorption rate (PSAR) by ~28%. On the other hand, increasing the flow rate leads to an increase of the SAC and PSAR by ~25% and ~115%, respectively. Increase in the cathode thickness also showed a notable decay in performance with 43% drop in SAC. The amount of conductive additive in the cathode is found to impact electrical conductivity and desalination performance.</p>\n<p>5. Demonstration of the effect of electrode architecture on water desalination using two-dimensional Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub> MXene nanoflakes as redox active electrodes in HCDI cell. Two types of electrode architectures are studied. The first architecture is composed of MXene nanoflakes with large lateral size (L-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub>). The second architecture is composed of two layers: the bottom layer is made of large MXene nanoflakes and the top layer is made of MXene nanoflakes with the small lateral size (bi-stacked Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub>). Initially, bi-stacked Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub> electrodes show higher ion removal capacity when cycled in 10 mM NaCl solution. However, after 25 cycles L-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub> electrodes outperform bi-stacked electrodes. Such behavior is attributed to the entrapment of ions from NaCl solution within the interlayer region during cycling, thereby occupying interlayer sites and decreasing ion removal capacity. This phenomenon is more dominating in case of nanoflakes of smaller lateral size as it opens more interfaces for ions intercalation and trapping as compared to the flakes of larger size.</p>\n<p>6.
