 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project, the PI will work with Dr. Michio Okada?s robotics group at Toyohashi University of Technology (TUT) in Japan to determine if people respond negatively to groups of identical robots (like they do toward cohesive human groups such as rival sports teams). The PI is currently conducting a similar study in the United States and will compare the results of the two studies to identify cross-cultural differences in responses. Comparing responses across cultures will enrich roboticists? understanding of how people from different cultures and backgrounds will view groups of robots. Understanding responses to groups of robots is critical because robots are becoming more prevalent, washing dishes, vacuuming floors, and educating children. Japan is the ideal location to perform the study to contrast results to the USA because Japanese people are more relationship-oriented (rather than independence-oriented) and have more exposure to robots than US Americans. This study will also contribute to developing our capabilities to design robots for both the US national and international markets; Japan is expected to be a significant market for robots. \r\n\r\nTo understand how components of robot group cohesiveness or ?entitativity? affects responses to them, this study manipulates Robot Type (Single, Diverse Group, Entitative Group) in two Distinct Cultures (USA, Japan). In the entitativity manipulation, appearance, behavior, goals, and outcomes will be either diverse or identical (i.e., entitative). Survey and behavioral measures will test for perceived entitativity, perceived threat, and aggression. Future studies will examine how specific situations (e.g., competing versus cooperating with robots) affect responses to entitativity. Findings will enhance understanding of entitativity in social psychology and cross-cultural literatures and enhance robots for future interaction with humans. The researchers will disseminate the findings at Indiana University?s Science Fest to children and families. This travel will also extend collaboration between Indiana University and TUT. \r\n\r\nThis award under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science.",
