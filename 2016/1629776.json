 "awd_abstract_narration": "Collaborative Research: Mesozoic Tethyan paleocommunity dynamics: Modelling complexity and stablity during times of biotic escalation and community restructuring\r\n\r\nThe Mesozoic Era began in the aftermath of Earth's largest mass extinction 251 million years ago, ending 66 million years ago with another mass extinction. The current project focuses on ecosystems of an ancient ocean which covered much of western Europe during the Mesozoic and left behind a rich, well-documented fossil record. The groundwork for modern oceans was laid during this time with increasingly complex ecosystems. The relationship between the complexity and stability of ecosystems is, however, poorly understood. The project will examine that relationship by modeling the complex dynamics of Mesozoic marine ecosystems using food webs, which capture the interactions and energy transfer between species in biological communities. Food web reactions to environmental disturbances are informative of ecosystem resilience. Analyzing ancient food webs will be accomplished with a suite of mathematical and computational models. \r\n\r\nEcosystem responses to changes in biological complexity and environmental disturbance remain poorly understood. Anthropogenically-driven global biological change is currently resulting in catastrophic losses of biodiversity. To anticipate ecosystem responses and effectively manage resources, we must understand how ecosystems respond to extreme changes; yet there are no precedents in human experience to guide us. The fossil record documents extreme ecosystem changes and this project will provide analogs from the past to enable better forecasts for modern marine ecosystems. This information will be distributed to the public, educators and students through a variety of programs at the California Academy of Sciences.",

The importance of interactions, such as predator and prey, or pollinator and plant, stems from the functions that species perform. The importance of species functions to the health of ecological systems, and hence conservation biology, is broadly recognized. For example, one beneficial aspect of biodiversity may be functional redundancy among species, where multiple species perform the same function, thus insuring that the function is still performed even if one of the performing species becomes extinct. Functions, however, are context-dependent, that is, the role of a function in an ecosystem depends on the composition of the community itself. For example, coyotes are top predators in many regions of North America today, but this a historically recent result of the 19th and 20th century extirpation of more powerful predators, such as the grey wolf and brown bear from those regions. Thus, the role of an ecological function is relative to the overall composition of the ecosystem in which it is embedded.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The histories of the functional and species compositions of ecosystems are often decoupled, meaning that they change differently over time. Therefore, it is beneficial to include a historical approach to conservation biology; we term this \"conservatin paleobiology\". For example, mammalian communities over the past 20 million years in Spain and Portugal had functions that persisted over much longer periods of geologic time than did the species performing them.

We reconstructed ecosystems from the western Tethys Ocean, examining the ecologies and interactions of more than 5,000 fossil species. In doing this, we were able to observe ecological changes that coincide with extremes of environmental change that, while relatively uncommon in the geological record, are completely novel in the anthropogenically-driven modern world.
