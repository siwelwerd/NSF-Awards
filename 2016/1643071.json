 "awd_abstract_narration": "Objective: \r\n\r\nThe objective of this project is a compendious cognition infrastructure enabling robust, cross-layer protocol designs under governance policy constraints, so as to maximize the cognitive radio (CR) network performance and end-user satisfaction, notwithstanding the challenges associated with dynamic and opportunistic radio-spectrum access, as well as the incomplete, corrupt and sporadic data reflecting the cost and restrictions in acquiring network state measurements.\r\n\r\nIntellectual merit: \r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit is to transform state-of-the-art learning tools for comprehensive and resource-aware cognition of the \"global\" network state (which includes interference, any-to-any link gains, band occupancies, queue lengths, and path delays), jointly with stochastic, state-cognizant optimization of CR networks with policy implications, to pioneer transformative adaptation approaches to routing, medium-access, and physical-layer designs of wireless CR networks endowed with the much needed robustness to state uncertainty.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts: \r\n\r\nThe broader impacts include tangible implications to mobile ad hoc, smart grid, intelligent transportation networks, as well as medical telemetry, geo-monitoring, and surveillance systems. Advances in the foundations of kernel-based learning, kernel matrix completion, inference on graphs, and sampling-based scenario optimization, will benefit a gamut of research areas including social analytics, bio-informatics, medical imaging, and surveillance using sensor networks. Policy research integrated with technical components will encourage community embracing of novel CR technologies and open up investment and business opportunities yielding greater economic impact.\r\n\r\nUndergraduate Design Projects and Botball Competition, facilitated by the proposed Cognitive Spectrum Operations Testbed, will also benefit student training with hands-on experience in state-of-the-art learning, wireless systems on mobile robots, and network optimization subjects.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe spatial loss field (SLF) or channel gain map is a well-known tool for predicting how radio signals will be attenuated, depending on the locations of the transmitter and receiver.  Such maps are useful in managing interference in wireless networks, which in turn enables high user data rates.   They are especially useful in cognitive radio networks, in which radios are reconfigured dynamically and spectrum is allocated with extreme agility.  This research has focused on how to exploit certain side information, such as might be obtained from ultrawideband (UWB) radio measurements, to enhance the estimation of the SLF.  Prior works assume radio locations are known and the works differ in terms of the number and cost of the parameters measured by the radios, where low-complexity approaches use measurements of only the slow channel fading or path loss between transmitters and receivers, and high-complexity approaches assume arrays of antennas, highly synchronized measurements, and measured angles of arrival of the signals.  The low-complexity approaches do not exploit any knowledge of the locations of blocking objects in the environment.\n\nThis research effort has resulted in a new approach that obtains and exploits knowledge about blocking objects by adding one more parameter to the low-complexity approach, that being the excess delay of the first reflecting path.  For UWB, attaining this parameter requires no extra hardware or synchronization, nor does it require measuring angle of arrival.  The first phase of the research explored a novel approach to locating the plane of reflection from a number of channel excess delay measurements; in simulation and experiment, our approach gave lower errors in the estimates of the rotation and translation of the reflecting plane than the existing method.  The second phase found a novel way to exploit this location information to improve the estimation of the spatial loss field.  The key insight was to adapt or update the initially assumed model for the correlation of spatial loss voxels (SLF in small grid locations) in a linear mean square error estimation framework, by assuming the voxels on either side of the detected reflecting plane are uncorrelated; this gives the estimator the freedom to have a discontinuity in the estimated SLF.   A simple simulation example illustrates the effectiveness of the approach.  Figure 1 shows the true SLF for a single square blocking object in a radio propagation environment.  For the simulation, 100 measurements are made between transmitters and receivers randomly distributed on the left and right peripheries of the propagation environment.  Figure 2 shows the estimate of the SLF without the novel correlation update and Figure 3 shows the estimate of the SLF with the correlation update.  The mean squared error with the correlation update was about 68% lower than without the update.  The edges of the object with correlation update are much sharper than without the update.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/31/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Mary Ann Weitnauer"
