 "awd_abstract_narration": "Despite recent research demonstrating the capacity of young children to engage deeply with science concepts and practices, challenging science curriculum is often lacking in the early grades. This project addresses this gap by developing a technology-supported, physical science curriculum that will facilitate kindergarten students'  conceptual understanding of matter and how matter changes. To accomplish these goals, the curriculum will include opportunities for students to participate in model-based inquiry in conjunction with the use of digital probeware and simulations that enable students to observe dynamic visualizations and make sense of the phenomena. To support the capacity of kindergarten teachers, a continuous model of teacher development will be implemented. \r\n\r\nThroughout development, the project team will collaborate with kindergarten teachers and more than 300 demographically diverse students across eight classrooms in Massachusetts and Indiana. A design based research approach will be used to iteratively design and revise learning activities, technological tools, and assessments that meet the needs and abilities of kindergarten students and teachers. The project team will: 1) work with kindergarten teachers to modify an existing Grade 2 curricular unit for use with their students; 2) design a parallel curricular unit incorporating technology; 3) evaluate both units for feasibility and maturation effects; and 4) iteratively revise and pilot an integrated unit and assess kindergarten student conceptual understanding of matter and its changes. The results of this investigation will contribute important data on the evolving structure and content of children's physical science models as well as demonstrate children's understanding of matter and its changes.  \r\n\r\nThe Discovery Research K-12 program (DRK-12) seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools (RMTs). Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects.",

The major goal of the Sensing Science through Modeling Matter: Kindergarten Students&rsquo; Development of Understanding of Matter and Its Changes (S2M2) project was to develop, research, and document an approach to helping kindergarten students build a conceptual understanding of matter and its changes.</p>\n<p><strong>Tools for student inquiry</strong><br />The S2M2 project integrated sensors, models, and simulations into a discourse-rich, model-centered, inquiry-based curriculum to contribute fundamental understandings to the evolving structure and content of kindergarten children&rsquo;s physical science models. The integration of technology tools into the S2M2 curriculum centered around four apps, including the Thermoscope, the Particle Modeler, the Land of Bump and, the Thermonator that are available for free from the Apple iPad App Store. (See https://concord.org/sensing-science-apps/)&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Curricula</strong></p>\n<p>The S2M2 curriculum unit consists of three discourse-rich, model-based inquiry kindergarten lessons (Models and Modeling, States of Matter, and Phase Changes) that align with core science ideas and skills as outlined in <em>A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas</em> and state academic science content standards. The curriculum includes two written documents (the S2M2 Teacher Curriculum Guide and the S2M2 Student Science Notebook) and four iPad-based apps that children use during instruction to create, revise, and record their particle models of solids, liquids, gases, and phase changes. The Teacher Curriculum Guide was designed as an <em>educative curriculum</em> guide intended to promote teacher learning as well as student learning. In addition to outlining the science content and implementation mechanics of each lesson, the Teacher Curriculum Guide provides information for teachers to not only help them develop general knowledge about implementing the unit, but also to increase their knowledge and skills for making decisions and instructional moves during specific instances in the unit (e.g., sample scripts to model how to frame and enact productive student science discourse). The Student Science Notebooks were designed to prompt students to make predictions, articulate their developing models through words and drawings, make sense of emerging patterns in their observations, and refine their models.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Pedagogical supports</strong></p>\n<p>Teacher professional development (PD) for S2M2 curriculum implementation focused on developing and enhancing teachers&rsquo; abilities to facilitate productive student science discourse during inquiry through scaffolding and the use of inscriptional tools, so that students learn to articulate, elaborate, communicate, evaluate, and revise their models. The PD program consisted of up to four hours of intensive initial training &nbsp;as well as instructional coaching prior to each day of classroom implementation. All intervention teachers were provided with the S2M2 Teacher Curriculum Guide, S2M2 Student Notebook, iPads pre-loaded with all project apps, and inquiry lesson materials. In the initial training sessions, teachers worked through each of the inquiry activities in the role of students while project researchers provided insight, guidance, and advice regarding the teacher&rsquo;s role in instruction. During implementation, teachers and researchers engaged in short coaching PD sessions immediately before each day of classroom implementation. During these sessions, teachers and researchers reviewed the prior day&rsquo;s instruction, discussed students&rsquo; progress, and addressed teachers&rsquo; questions for the upcoming instruction. In addition, researchers highlighted salient aspects of the lesson to emphasize.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Research</strong></p>\n<p>Research was designed to study how kindergarteners understand and use particulate models to explain physical phenomena such as states of matter and phase changes. The project developed an interview protocol and a coding scheme to analyze student responses and student-generated artifacts, including models in their notebooks. Project research suggests that as students progressed through the investigations, their predicted models for states of matter and phase change were increasingly influenced by their previous investigations of particulate models. Our findings suggest that students can make sense of and apply simple particle models to describe material phenomena.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 01/31/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Carolyn&nbsp;J&nbsp;Staudt</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1621299/1621299_10450556_1675097346212_Thermoscope--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1621299/1621299_10450556_1675097346212_Thermoscope--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Thermoscope\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1621299/1621299_10450556_1675097346212_Thermoscope--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Thermoscope\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Students testing change in temperature and particle motion using the Thermoscope and drawing their models in their notebooks.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Concord Consortium</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Carolyn&nbsp;J&nbsp;Staudt</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Thermoscope</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1621299/1621299_10450556_1675096973844_Thermonator--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1621299/1621299_10450556_1675096973844_Thermonator--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Thermonator\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1621299/1621299_10450556_1675096973844_Thermonator--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Thermonator\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Students working on states of matter simulation.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Concord Consortium</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Carolyn&nbsp;J&nbsp;Staudt</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Thermonator</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1621299/1621299_10450556_1675097455212_LOB--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1621299/1621299_10450556_1675097455212_LOB--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Land of Bump\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1621299/1621299_10450556_1675097455212_LOB--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Land of Bump\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Students studying phase change with an interactive story about moving particles.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Concord Consortium</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Carolyn&nbsp;J&nbsp;Staudt</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Land of Bump</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1621299/1621299_10450556_1675101709198_particle_modeler--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1621299/1621299_10450556_1675101709198_particle_modeler--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Particle Modeler\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1621299/1621299_10450556_1675101709198_particle_modeler--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Particle Modeler\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Students experimenting with the building blocks of matter using the Particle Modeler.
