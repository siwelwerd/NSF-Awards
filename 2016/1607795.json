 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-Technical Abstract\r\nWith the support of the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program, this project explores the creation of new classes of hybrid materials by solid-state reactions that partially transform semiconductor nanowires into layered crystals. Such transformations force the integration of structurally dissimilar nanomaterials, which is expected to give rise to novel and unique properties that are distinctly different from those of the constituents. To study this solid-state chemistry, miniature reactor cells are being developed that, when loaded with the component materials and introduced into an electron microscope, provide the possibility to initiate and directly observe complex materials transformation and integration processes down to the atomic level. This novel approach has the potential to become a transformative tool for developing synthesis and processing strategies for high-technology materials. In addition to the targeted technical advances, the project provides far-reaching educational and training opportunities for the involved graduate and undergraduate students. It includes dedicated outreach efforts to high-school students from rural areas and Native American populations that give student-teacher teams the opportunity to participate in hands-on activities related to the research. Under the guidance of the research team the students prepare new science learning materials, which they bring back to their school to share their experience with their peers and to help build excitement for careers in STEM disciplines.\r\n\r\nTechnical Abstract\r\nThis project is dedicated to studying the creation of novel classes of hybrid nanomaterials by integrating crystalline semiconductor nanowires with layered metal chalcogenide crystals via solid-state chemical transformations. Partial conversion of nanowires into a layered structure forces the integration of crystallographically and topologically dissimilar materials, which presents a compatibility challenge that the system needs to overcome by finding the energetically preferred or kinetically most accessible hybrid configuration. Novel membrane reactor cells - miniature analogues of tube furnaces that are widely used for materials synthesis and processing in research and in industry - are developed as platforms for in-situ transmission electron microscopy experiments at the single nanowire level that provide unprecedented insight into the atomistic reaction pathways, mass transport, and phase nucleation and growth kinetics of the targeted solid-state transformations. The primary model systems are chalcogen (S, Se, Te) induced reactions of homogeneous Ge, Si1-xGex alloy, and axially segmented Ge-AuGe nanowires and their transformations into layered Ge-chalcogenides. Generalization of the approach is used to study other hybrid systems, such as those integrating GaAs or GaN nanowires with GaS/Se layered crystals. The structure and morphology of the obtained hybrid materials is correlated with their optoelectronic properties via cathodoluminescence at resolution below the exciton radius, complemented by charge transport and electrochemical measurements, to determine the role of interfaces and defects on bandgaps, exciton binding, as well as carrier, charge and energy transfer between the different components of the hybrids. Overall, the research effort is expected to advance the fundamental understanding of the integration of dissimilar materials into hybrid nanostructures via solid-state reactions, and of the emerging optical and electronic functionalities of these complex systems.",

This project used solid-state reactions to transform nanowires into more complex architectures such as <em>(i)</em> core-shell structures, <em>(ii)</em> hollow nanotubes, <em>(iii)</em> axially segmented nanowires, and (iv) nanowires consisting of two-dimensional crystals, and to gain a fundamental understanding of the integration of dissimilar materials into hybrid nanostructures.</p>\n<p><em>(i)</em> Exposure to sulfur vapor was studied for transforming germanium nanowires into core-shell structures with germanium sulfide shells.

We discovered that reactions with vapor- or gas-phase species offer unique opportunities for the controlled transformation of nanowires into single-crystalline nanotubes. Nanowires of gallium arsenide (GaAs), for example, can be converted into high-quality gallium sulfide (Ga<sub>2</sub>S<sub>3</sub>) nanotubes by exposure to sulfur vapor (Figure 1). Among several possible crystal structures of Ga<sub>2</sub>S<sub>3</sub>, the structure adopted by the hollow tubes is selected to match that of the starting GaAs template. Electron microscopy was used to establish the transformation mechanism, notably the way an initially solid nanowire is converted into a hollow tube, at the atomic scale.

We used electron microscopy movies to follow the formation of metastable (gold-germanium, silver-germanium) alloy segments inserted into germanium nanowires by reactions with gold or silver. Since the formation of the metastable phases requires melting and crystallization, minute containers consisting of carbon shells were developed to contain the liquid and maintain the original nanowire shape (Figure 2).

Screw dislocations - defects along the central axis of nanowires - caused especially intriguing effects, notably a <em>chiral</em> structure in which the crystal axes of the wires twist progressively, as in a helix or screw. In van der Waals nanowires, this rotation causes crystal layers in adjacent turns of the helix to slightly twist against each other, thereby changing the electronic properties and potentially inducing phenomena such as a modified interaction with light or even superconductivity. While such twist-induced properties have so far been studied in planar two-dimensional crystals, painstakingly stacked by hand onto each other with a small rotation, chiral van der Waals nanowires (Figure 3) represent materials in which controllable twist is spontaneously generated during synthesis.</p>\n<p><strong>Broader Impact</strong></p>\n<p>The proposed research project provided far-reaching educational and training opportunities for the involved graduate and undergraduate students.
