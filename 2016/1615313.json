 "awd_abstract_narration": "In recent years, sophisticated computer modeling has enabled scientists to understand and address challenging problems in materials science, engineering, environmental science, and other fields. In order for a computational model to be effective, it must be accurate and efficient. In this project, the research team will evaluate, improve upon, and apply computational models used to study molecular interactions in biological environments. Specifically, they will focus on computational models used to study how interactions between biological molecules are affected by the physical nature of other molecules in their immediate environment. It has been shown that cells are highly crowded environments, and the nature of this \"crowding\" can significantly affect how crucial molecules interact with each other. A robust way to model such environments will allow for better predictions of cellular processes, which can have important impacts on society's collective understanding of biological systems and its ability to develop solutions when things go \"wrong\" in such systems. This research will be conducted at Wellesley College, an all-female undergraduate institution, catalyzing women's contribution to computational science, a discipline in which women have long been very underrepresented. The research team will also conduct outreach activities at a local diverse high school, introducing youth to the field of computational modeling of biological systems. The activities developed as part of this collaborative, outreach effort will be made available online to help excite students across the country about using computers and physical science to address real-world issues in biology.\r\n\r\nIn more technical terms, the goal of the project is to study how macromolecular crowding within the cell affects electrostatic interactions and molecular recognition between biomolecules via a controlled set of computational models that are informed through experimental data. Through computation, the team will first study systems in which the interacting biomolecules and macromolecular crowders are \"virtual\", whose physical properties can be exhaustively and systematically sampled, in order to understand how molecular and crowding agent properties such as shape, size, and charge distribution can affect interaction energies. They will use multiple computational models, including ones that treat the solvent implicitly and explicitly, in order to assess the extent to which the method used to model the system affects the predictions made. The team will also simulate experimentally realizable biological systems, including DNA-protein and protein-protein complexes within crowded environments. Through a tight cycle of comparing simulation predictions with experimental outcomes, they will assess and improve computational models of crowded biological environments. Finally, the team will assess whether macromolecular crowding can affect the outcome of a molecular design application.  Through computationally designing molecules meant to bind with specificity to a partner in either a crowded or uncrowded environment and experimentally testing those designs, they will determine whether accounting for macromolecular crowding in the design process is necessary for ensuring the desired binding properties of the designed molecule. As a whole, this project will increase our understanding of how biological environments can crucially affect biomolecular recognition.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nComputational modeling is a powerful tool to help tackle pressing problems across disciplines.  In this project, we developed, analyzed, and applied multiple computational models to better understand how molecules interact in complicated biological environments.  Specifically, we analylzed and predicted how dynamic, crowded cellular environments might affect interactions between biological molecules.  Predicting properties of biomolecular interactions is crucial to understanding nearly all biological processes and consequently, how to treat \"disease\" situations that result when crucial interactions are disrupted. We focused in particular on how electrostatic interactions -- interactions between positively and/or negatively-charged regions -- between biomolecules are affected by their crowded environment.  Our overarching goal was to understand and predict how the effects of environmental crowding on electrostatic interactions between molecular binding partners depend on the physical properties (e.g., size, shape, charge) of (i) the molecules themselves, (ii) the \"crowding\" molecules in their environment, and (iii) the surrounding solvent.  To explore these questions, we used a range of model systems, ranging from theoretical \"toy\" molecules whose properties can be systematically explored to specific biological binding partners whose interactions can be experimentally tested.  Finally, we also sought to understand how the crowded cell environment may affect the computational design of novel molecules with altered biomolecular interactions toward their targets; addressing this question can help engineer new therapeutics with desired properties in varied environments.  Additionally, we have been carrying out experiments to begin to complement insights provided by the computational models.\n\nIntellectual Merit: Here we mention a subset/sampling of our overall findings.  As a first example, an exploration of theoretical \"toy\" model molecules provided many experimentally-testable predictions about crowding effects on binding as well as a theoretical framework for explaining these effects, including (i) smaller crowders can have bigger impacts than larger crowders, (ii) crowder shape does not have major impacts, (iii)  crowding effects can subtly differ in predictable ways depending on the geometry of the binding interfaces between the partners or on the charges of the crowders, and iv) crowding can ampliify electrostatic interactions between molecules and lower desolvation penalties -- or the energetic cost of removing water molecules around molecules as they bind -- in predictable ways.  As a second example, we comprehensively compared different ways to computationally model crowding effects between a specific peptide -- or short protein -- and DNA to which it is known to bind. We made both theoretical and experimentally-testable predictions about the crowding effects under certain circumstances.  Experiments are underway to better understand how crowding affects this particular system to complement the published modeling work.  As a final example, we designed variants of this peptide that are predicted to bind more tightly to DNA in an uncrowded environment, and these variants have been experimentally tested and indeed show increased binding affinity.  Work is ongoing to understand if and how the designs differ in crowded environments.  This design work also catalyzed new research directions that in part aim to engineer more potent anti-bacterial peptides that could serve as promising therapeutic agents.\n\nBroader Impact: Thus far, this funding helped to yield four peer-reviewed published papers (with more in preparation), 13 conference posters, 11 undergraduate theses, and ~5 oral conference presentations/seminars (including an undergraduate presentation at a national conference).  This work has helped train 20 undergraduate students at a liberal arts college serving women and underrepresented gender identities.  Thus far, 5 of these students are currently in STEM Ph.D. Programs, 1 is in an MD/Ph.D. Program, 2 are in M.D. Programs, 1 completed Dental School, 5 are currently in STEM-related research, consulting, or teaching jobs, and 6 are still undergraduate students.  Given the underrepresentation of women in computational disciplines, this project is helping to promote diversity in the field.  Additionlly, two of the publications, in addition to describing research, involved elements to promote inclusivity and diversity within physical science or computational fields.\n\nFinally, as part of our Broader Impact goals, our team developed, piloted, and began to assess the effectiveness of a series of activities in which high school students engage with interdisciplinary computational modeling activities.  By first understanding the biological basis for chronic myeloid leukemia, then studying the three-dimensional structure of a drug/target complex in this system using molecular visualization software, and finally (in ongoing work) exploring data from molecular dynamics simulations of the complex to hypothesize about mechanisms of drug resistance, students not only are exposed to noncovalent interactions and the three-dimensional, dynamic nature of molecules, but they also hopefully see that science is an interdisciplinary field through explicit engagement with biology, chemistry, physics, math, and computer science.  We plan to make these activities freely available to the broader public via an online website.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/12/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Mala L Radhakrishnan"
