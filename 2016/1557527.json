 "awd_abstract_narration": "Development of the embryonic body plan is a complex process, requiring integration of autonomous cellular activities with both local and long-range intercellular signaling to specify various tissues and organs. This project investigates whether the early embryo uses extracellular microvesicles (exosomes), as tissue-specifying signaling agents. Exosomes are a recently discovered class of small, membrane-bound particles secreted from cells. It is now known that exosomes carry proteins involved with cell-cell recognition and signaling on their surfaces, and also that they contain microRNAs and mRNAs with the potential to alter gene expression patterns of cells receiving them. The ability of exosomes secreted from one cell type to \"reprogram\" other cells at a distance has been demonstrated in tissue culture, but whether this exciting property is utilized during normal embryonic development is not known. The current project investigates this possibility by pursuing the observation that blood formation requires exosomes. The goals of this research are to investigate the cell biology of exosomal exchange in during embryogenesis in frogs.  The project will address whether qualitative or quantitative changes in the exosomal proteins occur during early development? Which tissues secrete exosomes? Are specific tissues in the early frog embryo targeted by exosomes; if so, how do those tissues respond? Can altering the secretion or specificity of exosome uptake alter embryonic blood development? Answering these questions will advance the nascent, rapidly growing field of exosomal cell biology, and expand our understanding of the repertoire of signaling mechanisms used by embryonic cells early in normal development. Many aspects of this research present excellent hands-on opportunities for students and trainees at all levels, and thus can serve as a critical starting point or advancement step for developing careers in biology or biomedicine.\r\n\r\nThis project explores the novel hypothesis that the early Xenopus embryo uses extracellular microvesicles, specifically exosomes, for embryonic tissue patterning. Exosomes have recently been recognized as potent conveyors of membrane-associated signaling ligands and receptors, functional microRNAs and mRNAs, but most such demonstrations have been in limited tissue-culture situations. Recent work demonstrated that an extracellular compartment in the intact early Xenopus embryo is highly enriched with exosomes. Mass spectroscopic proteomic analysis confirms an abundance of exosomal markers, and electron microscopy confirms an abundance of particles in the size range typical of exosomes. Embryos reared deprived of microvesicles develop with a characteristic set of morphological defects, particularly a profound reduction in hematopoiesis, suggesting a fundamental role for exosome-dependent signaling during tissue specification steps of early development. This significant cell-biological activity has not previously been explored in a vertebrate embryo, so the goals of this project are to characterize exosomes, including the time course of their appearance, their cargo and the surface proteins that potentially define their tissue target specificity. This information will be used to develop probes and reagents to investigate their tissue origins and potential tissue targets.",

Exosomes, an important subpopulation of extracellular vesicles (EVs), are small (~100 nm) membrane-bound particles. In the past decade, numerous in vitro systems have been developed to investigate how exosomes transfer proteins, lipids, and transcripts between cells, potentially mediating physiologically relevant cell-cell signaling. Interest in this emerging field revolved largely around how exosomes might function in medically relevant situations, e.g. in interactions between cancer cells and support cells; and whether exosomes might be utilized therapeutically as drug delivery agents. In contrast, there has remained surprisingly little information how exosomes function in normal physiology. In particular, no role had been proposed for exosomes in embryonic development. During embryogenesis, cellular determination and tissue patterning depend critically on a complex suite of short- and long-range signaling between cells. Two preliminary observations supported the hypothesis that exosomes might play a role in mediating such signals in early Xenopus embryogenesis. First, live-embryo microscopy revealed that perivitelline fluid surrounding early Xenopus embryos is abundantly populated with EVs. Second, experimental depletion of EVs resulted in a severe defect in blood formation. The project that developed around these two observations was to investigate embryonic Xenopus EVs: are exosomes in this EV population? where do exosomes go? of what are they composed? and ultimately, what do they do? In addressing these questions, the project accomplished its goal of advancing the cell biology of EVs. The following discoveries were made during the course of this project:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Exosomes are present at high abundance in EVs of both perivitelline space and blastocoel. We developed procedures to mass-isolate and fractionate EVs from the perivitelline space and blastocoel via combinations of differential centrifugation, buoyant density ultracentrifugation, and ultrafiltration. Particle size profiling revealed EVs comprise a broad size range of 35-400 nm, thus encompassing the size range of 30-120 nm expected of nominal exosomes, but also including significantly larger particles. Cryoelectron microscopy confirmed that particles across this broad size range are bounded by conventional lipid bilayers. The EV pool in the perivitelline space undergoes changes in vesicle concentration and size profile during pregastrular development. Much of this change involves a 2.5-fold increase in the number of ~100 nm exosomes, against a static background of larger EVs.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Depletion of perivitelline EVs before gastrulation results in the development of visceral defects and a ~50% reduction in the ventral blood islands responsible for early blood formation. This striking result, which supported our hypothesis that EVs play a developmental role, suggested a bioassay in which application of exogenous EVs, or isolated fractions thereof, might rescue normal hematopoiesis. However, this idea proved impractical, as harvested EVs were never available in sufficient amounts for large-scale rescue experiments. Alternative approaches, including microinjection of EVs into the blastocoel of control or UV-irradiated embryos did not result in detectable phenotypic changes and were therefore inconclusive. The role of EVs in hematopoietic lineage specification therefore remains inconclusive.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. EVs are endocytosed by cells lining the archenteron during late phases of gastrulation. The particular cells engulfing EVs comprise the gastrocoel roof plate, a sensitive signal-transduction center involved with early developmental patterning steps. Experiments to interfere with endocytosis via brief application of dynamin-inhibiting small molecules during pregastrular development produced a strikingly high frequency of left-right patterning defects; surprisingly, however, this treatment did not produce the hematopoietic defect produced by devitellination.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.

Harvested EVs were fractionated by buoyant density ultracentrifugation in an attempt to separate nominal exosomes (of ~100 nm size) from other size classes of particles. However, although mass spectrometry revealed distinct, somewhat non-overlapping proteomic profiles for major vesicle fractions thus separated, most conventional exosomal markers were present at high spectral count in each fraction.
