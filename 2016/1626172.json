 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) and Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF) programs, Professor Frank McDonald from Emory University and colleagues Lanny Liebeskind, Craig Hill, Huw Davies and Christopher Scarborough have acquired a high intensity single crystal X-ray diffractometer. X-ray diffraction is a powerful tool to investigate the arrangement of the atoms, the microscopic structure, of solid materials. An X-ray beam aimed at a small crystal will produce a diffraction pattern which is analyzed to determine this underlying atomic structure. This knowledge is fundamental to understanding their properties and developing improvements. Advances in the intensity and ability to focus the X-rays have made modern diffractometers, such as a high intensity diffractometer, essential for research. The applications of X-ray structural data ranges across fields from chemistry to biology, materials and medicine, to applications such as developing better pharmaceuticals, electronic devices, catalysts for bioremediation processes and understanding the mechanisms of enzymes. The diffractometer is used in student research activities as well as instruction. It is a general tool to prepare the next generation of scientists. \r\n\r\nThis award is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels, especially in areas such as (a) developing catalysts and characterizing catalytic intermediates; (b) developing oxidation catalysts based on first-row transition metals with redox-active ligands; (c) exploring fundamental properties of polyoxometallates (POMs) widely used in applications such as corrosion prevention; (d) preparing catalysts for dehydration reactions; (e) structurally characterizing synthetic materials; (f) determining the stereochemical configuration of biologically active materials; (g) determining conformation and molecular orientation of molecular catalysts on electrode surfaces; (g) studying peptide nanotube orientation and (h) studying charge density of biologically active coordination compounds.",
