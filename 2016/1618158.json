 "awd_abstract_narration": "Society increasingly depends on numerical software, which uses finite\r\nprecision arithmetic to approximate the reals and necessarily\r\nintroduces approximation and error. Cyber-physical systems are\r\nubiquitous and rely on numerical software. Anti-lock breaks and\r\nmedical devices such as haptic control systems for remote surgery are\r\ntwo such examples. Numerical errors in these systems can be\r\ndisastrous.  Toyota suspects such errors contributed to its costly\r\nacceleration problem; the Ariane 5 rocket exploded due to an overflow\r\nin its inertial reference system; and scientists have had to retract\r\npapers from prestigious journals (e.g., Nature). Techniques and tools\r\nfor improving numerical software reliability are critically needed.\r\n\r\nThis project explores practical techniques to test and analyze\r\nnumerical software.  It focuses on the two most fundamental sources of\r\nnumerical errors: uncaught exceptions, and numerical stability and\r\naccuracy. The proposed techniques are centered around symbolic\r\nexecution and guided testing, and domain insights are used to develop\r\nprinciples and heuristics to make the techniques practical.  This\r\nproject considers three main dimensions: (1) problem formulation and\r\nanalysis strategies, (2) constraint solving, and (3) implementation\r\ntechniques. It aims at advancing the state-of-the-art in engineering\r\nrobust numerical software to help avoid costly, dangerous errors.",
