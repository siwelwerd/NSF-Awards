 "awd_abstract_narration": "A wide array of new sensing technologies are being envisioned and developed for modern engineered systems, which provide operators with unique abilities to monitor or estimate the systems' state.  Once sensors are in place, state estimates can be obtained by analyzing data gathered from the deployed sensors together with mathematical models of the system.  However, as systems increase in scale and complexity, the deployment of sensors for high quality state estimation remains a bottleneck in a broad spectrum of applications ranging from microprocessors to power distribution networks and societal-scale Internet-of-Things.   This project supports the creation of new sensor placement (deployment) algorithms with rigorous performance guarantees.  The research will produce a new understanding of the fundamental limitations and achievable performance of sensor placement algorithms, and formulate efficient placement algorithms that perform well in the presence of sensor faults and external attacks.   In addition to the creation of new methods and theories, the research will have broader impact on industrial research-and-development as well as education.  Specifically, the research will directly support design of multi-processor systems and energy-efficient buildings via the transition of research results to industrial partners.  The outcomes will also be used to increase undergraduate participation in research, and will be incorporated into courses to expose students to cutting edge techniques for the complex systems that they will encounter after graduation.\r\n\r\nThe project will be focused on the budget-constrained design-time sensor placement problem.  Motivated by fundamental open problems in this space, this research will establish new algorithms for placing sensors in order to facilitate state estimation with optimality, robustness and resilience guarantees, while meeting sensor budget constraints.   To do this, the sensor placement problem is framed as an optimal resource design problem for a dynamical system subject to disturbances, wherein expensive or constrained discrete sensing resources are deployed to optimize an estimation performance metric. The research agenda is organized around five comprehensive and complementary tasks: (1) sensor placement in systems with stochastic disturbances, (2) sensor placement in systems with deterministic (but unknown) disturbances, (3) fault- and attack-tolerant sensor placement, (4) graph-theoretic rubrics and algorithms for sensor placement and (5) sensor placement for heterogeneous dynamics and sensors.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nNew sensing technologies together with pervasive networking and computing are providing remarkable opportunities for high-fidelity situational awareness of complex physical-world processes.  For example, while building thermal processes were traditionally monitored using few independent thermostats, today they can be monitored using myriad networked fixed and mobile sensors.  These emerging opportunities for networked monitoring of physical-world processes brings into focus the problem of design-time sensor placement &ndash; i.e. the locationing of cost-limited sensing capabilities within a high-dimensional physical world process, to achieve situational awareness and control objectives.  The main objective of this project was to research techniques for design-time sensor placement in physical-world dynamical processes.\n\nThe following intellectual outcomes were obtained in the course of the research project.  First, a number of different metrics or signposts for sensor placement were considered &ndash; including observability, estimation-performance metrics, and channel input-output metrics.  Design-time placement to shape these metrics was in general found to be computationally difficult, in the sense of equivalence to an NP-hard problem.  It was determined however that special structural characteristics of the dynamical model, such as diffusive structures, could be exploited to achieve effective design-time sensor placement.  In a similar vein, interaction graph structures for network dynamical processes could also be exploited for effective sensor placement.  Additionally, number of results were obtained for discrete or hybrid network stochastic processes such as hidden Markov models.  Finally, in the scope of a supplement, research was conducted on self-learning in network dynamical processes for the purpose of coordinated control.\n\nThe project has had tangible broader impacts with respect to technology deployment and transfer, professional development, and education.  Specifically, the developed methods were applied to a case study focusing on occupant-location-catered control of building HVAC processes.  The work on building thermal processes led to a collaboration with a small business which deploys Internet-of-Things technologies in buildings, with initial deployment of algorithms on IoT platforms and testing on field data from a residence.  The project has supported the training of six graduate students at Washington State University, via employment and/or conference travel support.  Finally, course project development and undergraduate research were pursued in the scope of the project.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/19/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Ali Saberi"
