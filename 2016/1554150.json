 "awd_abstract_narration": "Additive biomanufacturing is the process of printing 3D living constructs where stem cells interface with biomaterials. A key manufacturing challenge is establishing control of the printed biomaterial constructs to prevent stem cell differentiation. This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award supports fundamental research to provide needed knowledge for advancing the control of an additive biomanufacturing process (far-field melt electrospin writing). Research results will lead to producing engineered tissue constructs for regenerative medicine and, therefore, impact the health sector and competitiveness of the US biomanufacturing sector. This award also supports engineering education by integrating 3D printing into the undergraduate curriculum, introducing high school students to advanced manufacturing, and broadening participation of underrepresented groups in research.\r\n\r\nIn a far-field melt electrospin writing process, a polymer material is drawn from a needle to a collector plate, and the processed polymer from the needle tip constitutes the charged fiber. The temperature differential between the needle tip and the plate is defined as temperature gradient; and it affects fiber deformation (that determines fiber diameter) and electrostatic repulsion between fibers (that, through relative alignment of multiple fibers, determines pore size in a 3D polymer construct). A construct with microscale fiber diameters and pore sizes can facilitate confinement of stem cells to prevent stem cells from differentiation. The first research objective is to understand effects of temperature gradient on fiber deformation and electrostatic repulsion between fibers. A multi-physics model (coupling polymer rheology and electrostatics) will be developed to predict effects of temperature gradient on fiber deformation and electrostatic repulsion. The second objective is to establish relationships between fiber deformation and fiber diameter, and between electrostatic repulsion and pore size. Scanning electron microscopy will be used to measure mean fiber diameter and pore size in an electrospun construct. The third objective is to understand effects of fiber diameter and pore size on 3D stem cell confinement. A geometrical-based model will be developed to predict effects of confined 3D focal adhesion site distribution (point contacts between electrospun fibers and colonized cells) on stem cell function. Experiments will be conducted to colonize stem cells on the electrospun constructs, and the focal adhesion distribution will be measured using atomic force microscopy and fluorescent confocal microscopy. Immunochemistry of stem cell surface markers will be conducted to confirm stem cell confinement.",

There are a number project outcomes that address the intellectual merits of the proposed work by generating the fundamental manufacturing science needed to engineer 3D biological substrates at small scales. One significant project outcome is advancing a process model-based methodology using dimensional analyses to formulate a \"Printability Number,\" thereby mitigating the reliance on traditional trial and error methods while optimizing interrelated process variables that occupy a large parameter space. Based on this dimensional analysis, steady state equilibrium conditions can be prescribed to produce high-resolution, aligned, uniform fibers at small scales (700 nm to 50um), a range that includes the targeted structural feature sizes of biological substrates for stem cell culture, proliferation, and differentiation. Another major project outcome is the advancement of a mechanistic framework that couples the process variables with the response of biological cells cultured on the produced 3D biological substrates. Specifically, the printed substrate's microscale structural features, including pore size and shape, along with printed fiber dimension and alignment, are observed to influence the downstream stem cell morphological and functional outcomes. In order to create spatially heterogeneous substrates with well-defined, non-uniform pore attributes (e.g. rectangular versus triangular pore geometries), an analytically derived general toolpath design model is advanced to elborate the spatially heterogeneous substrate design space. Based on this experimental methodology, the process-structure-biological performance relationships are elucidated wherein variable 3D porous substrate microarchitecture results in differential stem cell phenotypes or function. Specifically, the printed rectangular pore architectures result in the preservation of the self-renewing stem cell phenotype over a 30-day cell culture time course. In contrast the printed triangular pore architectures yield a monolithic population of differentiated fat cells over the same 30-day cell culture time course. In terms of broader impacts, the project outcomes of this work include a unified methodology that captures the critical multiphysical process dynamics of a melt electrohydrodynamic printing process to fabricate 3D biological substrates at small scales. To capture these phenomena, new knowledge of the process dynamics is modeled for the first time. For example, the PI has observed that the prescribed process temperature can quantitatively delay the ?in-flight? fiber solidification to prolong fiber stretching. This fundamental approach represents a critical step toward the development and future commercialization of melt electrohydrodynamic-based printing as a reliable additive manufacturing process to produce microscale 3D biological substrates with minimal geometric deviations from the intended design. Finally, to address the link between additive manufacturing process variables and and biological process outcomes, the biological relevance of the 3D printed biological substrates is benchmarked to conventional 2D substrates. The impact of the proposed dimensional metrology framework includes a rigorous workflow to certify the reliability of biomanufactured products. From the standpoint of educational outreach, the PI completed development of the online analog for the graduate course entitled Additive Manufacturing for Biotissues.
