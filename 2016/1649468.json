Search-based software engineering is new paradigm for software engineering in which software is developed by searching for components and optimizing for functionality and nonfunctional properties within constraints, with the goal of automating software engineering. The goal is to encourage research in this area while providing important educational/training experiences for the students and helping to build the next generation of global researchers. The grant will  pay attention to underrepresented groups and take into account economic considerations.",
