 "awd_abstract_narration": "Title: Acclimation responses that optimize the photosynthetic apparatus in cyanobacteria: from ecophysiology to biophysics\r\n\r\nModel cyanobacteria have been extensively studied to learn many details of photosynthesis. However, these organisms exhibit more limited physiological responses to light and nutrients than many more complex cyanobacteria, which are often considered to be more difficult to study. The concept behind this project is \"to let nature be the guide\" to study photosynthesis in stressful settings in situ and to understand those photosynthetic processes identified mechanistically by using laboratory model organisms, genetics, biochemistry and biophysics. By learning more about adaptation and acclimation in cyanobacteria, it should be possible to develop strategies to improve photosynthetic efficiency in crop plants. The recently discovered capacity of some cyanobacteria to use far-red light for oxygenic photosynthesis raises questions about how those cyanobacteria are able to expand their usage of the solar spectrum reaching Earth's surface. This project will use genetic systems that have been developed for non-model cyanobacteria that exhibit diverse adaptive and acclimation responses. Genetic methods, together with physiological, biochemical and biophysical approaches will be used to study the photosynthetic apparatus in these organisms. This proposal offers a unique opportunity to expand knowledge of 'real-world' photosynthesis and is likely to provide new insights for engineering photosynthetic organisms intelligently for human needs, including expanding the light-use capabilities of crop plants. This project will provide training for underrepresented minorities in STEM research and education. The developed photobioreactor concept for the classroom will be used to involve K-12 level students in STEM education.   \r\n\r\n\r\nThe defining premise of this project is that terrestrial cyanobacteria have evolved novel adaptive and acclimation responses to optimize light harvesting and energy trapping in environments with strongly filtered (e.g., far-red) light, variable redox states, and the intensive energetic demands of nitrogen fixation. Many cyanobacteria have a cluster of 17 genes encoding core subunits of Photosystem I (PSI), PSII, and phycobilisomes. Combined with the synthesis of chlorophylls (Chls) f and d, the products of these genes confer an acclimation response that permits growth in far-red light (700 to 800 nm), a process known as FaRLiP. This project will use the genetic system developed in Chlorogloeopsis fritschii PCC 9212 to dissect FaRLiP and other postulated acclimation and adaptive responses by determining role of different genes and their variants in acclimation responses of PSI and their roles under anoxic, nitrogen-fixing conditions. This project will also characterize the energy transfer and trapping kinetics in PSI and PSII complexes and study long-wavelength-absorbing phycobiliproteins from cells undergoing FaRLiP and other adaptation/acclimation responses by performing genetic analyses and manipulations, biochemical analyses, mass spectrometry/proteomics, site-specific mutagenesis, biophysical methods (EPR spectroscopy, time-resolved optical spectroscopy). This project is supported by the Molecular Biophysics Cluster of the Molecular and Cellular Biosciences Division in the Directorate for Biological Sciences.",

A detailed understanding of this process could lead to methods to enhance light utilization by crop plants and thereby improve crop yields from agriculture. Results from previous NSF funding had led to the discovery that some cyanobacteria have a conserved cluster of 20 genes that are expressed in far-red light and enable those organisms to survive using only light wavelengths previously unknown to support their growth. The goals of this research program were to discover the mechanisms and structural basis for this ability. We discovered that terrestrial cyanobacterial capable of growth on far-red light synthesize two unique chlorophylls, chlorophyll <em>d</em> and chlorophyll <em>f</em>, which allow them to absorb far-red light. These organisms additionally replace core subunits of Photosystem I and Photosystem II, the essential photooxidoreductases that convert light energy into chemical energy during oxygenic photosynthesis, and these new polypeptides can specifically bind chlorophylls <em>d</em> and <em>f</em>. These cyanobacteria additionally produce unique antenna phycobiliproteins that further expand their capcity to absorb far-red light.

Using the genetic systems developed, we were able to construct and characterize mutant strains lacking specific genes from the 20-gene cluster in otder to discover their funtions. We established methods for isolating and characterizing the three principal protein complexes involved in light-harvesting and light-energy conversion. Spectroscopic methods were employed to study the roles of the modified pigments in light harvesting and electron transfer during light energy conversion in photosynthesis. Importantly, by using cryogenic electron microscopy, we were able to solve the structures of two far-red light Photosystem I complexes from different cyanobacteria; two forms (monomer and dimer) of the far-red light Photosystem II complex from one cyanobacterium; and the structure of a far-red light absorbing phycobiliprotein called allophycocyanin (FRL-AP). These studies revealed (1) that chlorophyll <em>f</em> is only used as an antenna pigment to expand the range of wavelengths that can be used for photosynthesis in these cyanobacteria; (2) that chlorophyll<em> d</em> is only found in Photosystem II acclimated to far-red light, and that a single molecule of chlorophyll d occurs in the electron transfer pigments of Photosystem II where it acts of the primary donor (PsbD1); and (3) the structural basis of far-red light absorbance by FRL-AP, which also forms a helical oligomeric structure not previously described. Our studies on the photosynthetic apparatus of traditional Photosystem I also revealed important new details concerning the mechanism of charge-separation during conversion of light into chemical energy.
