The drainage area to the Bay is approximately 65,000 square miles. There are significant challenges to restoring the water quality to Bay and these workshops are a part of the continuing effort to better understand the very complex path to restoration.\r\n\r\nThis proposal is for two connected workshops; 1) 2016 Biennial Chesapeake Modeling Symposium (ChesMS16), to be held June 1-2, 2016, in Williamsburg, VA, and, 2) Chesapeake Bay Program Modeling Beyond 2018: A Proactive Visioning Workshop, the precise time and location of this workshop is yet to be determined, but it is likely to occur in late 2016 in Annapolis, MD, or Gloucester, VA. The Chesapeake Community Modeling Program seeks to improve modeling tools and related resources specific to the Chesapeake Bay, its watershed, and connected environmental systems by fostering collaborative open source research. Toward this end, the Chesapeake Community Modeling Program is convening the fifth bi-annual Chesapeake Modeling Symposium as a venue to identify and showcase existing modeling efforts as well as communicate how models are used as decision support tools by different developer and user groups. By bringing together modelers, managers, scientists, and stakeholders for a series of plenary talks, panel discussions, and special sessions, the 2016 Chesapeake Modeling Symposium will focus on the challenge of increasing communication and transparency in the model development and application process through open source, community and participatory modeling. The biennial Chesapeake Modeling Symposium has been well established over the past decade. This year there will be special sessions on the following topics: 1. Successes and Strategies for Numerical Models of the Chesapeake, 2. Ecosystem Modeling Approaches for Living Resource Management - from ?Simple? to Complex: An Introduction and Hands-on Learning Workshop, 3. Simulating the Influence of Conowingo Dam Infill on Chesapeake Bay Water Quality, 4. Oysters: Data and modeling for decision-making, 5. Modeling land-estuarine exchanges and interactions: State-of-the-art, challenges, and improved applications through community modeling, 6. Chesapeake Bay Program on-line tools to increase communication, facilitate decision making, and provide transparency, 7. The Missing Link: Connecting Water Quality and Living Resources Models to Support Ecosystem Based Decisions, 8. Simulating Flows and Loadings from the Watershed: Challenges and Solutions with Multiple Models at Multiple Scales, 9. Simulating Climate Change with Airshed, Watershed, and Estuary and Living Resource Models. The 2016 Chesapeake Bay Program, Scientific and Technical Advisory Committee - supported workshop entitled \"Chesapeake Bay Program Modeling Beyond 2018: A Proactive Visioning Workshop\" will be held in late 2016 at a yet to be determined location. This workshop was conceived and planned by a team of investigators and by members of the Chesapeake Bay Program partnerships Scientific and Technical Advisory Committee, and staff scientists working within the Chesapeake Bay Program in Annapolis. The workshop is a three-day ?proactive? workshop through the Chesapeake Bay Research Consortium cooperative agreement with the Chesapeake Bay Program. Selection of workshops for sponsorship is made by the full Scientific and Technical Advisory Committee membership on the basis of proposals from members and regional scientists. The broader impacts of these two activities will derive from the educational benefits and to broader societal impacts through improved ecosystem management. These events are, in fact, specifically aimed at providing an important and otherwise missing interface between academic researchers who are advancing the science of modeling (in multiple disciplines and contexts) with the federal and state managers who are applying such models to management decisions for the largest estuary in the United States. This estuary is an important test-bed for estuaries throughout the world, and the participants have an outstanding record of sharing the findings of their activities thorough peer-reviewed publications.",
