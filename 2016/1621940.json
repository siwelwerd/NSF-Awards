 "awd_abstract_narration": "This SBIR Phase 1 project will improve motivation, learning and self-esteem of children by incorporating well-established principles from behavioral psychology and gaming science.  The innovation disrupts conventional paradigms by advantageously leveraging the exploding screen time trends of digital games and social media, which are commonly a nemesis to learning and attention span.  Children's interactions with this system will provide insights into their ability to delay gratification, a skill that is critically linked to many positive societal and life outcomes.  Initially, the innovation will address a critical need to offer a personalized approach to accelerate compliance with Common Core Standards (Common Core) related to math fluency and mastery. Once the premise is validated, the new system will be used with the Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder population to improve attention span and reduce impulsivity. Ultimately, the platform will integrate with existing learning management systems administered by schools so a variety of subjects including STEM and Common Core can be featured.  This combination will create a revolutionary education platform that is delivered through smart devices, so different types of learning can occur at home, school or on the go, thereby, making state-of-the art learning technologies readily available to diverse social economic groups.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe technical innovation is a tablet and smartphone-based learning system that uses a neuro-cognitive model of a child's mental state to determine the optimal parameters to maximize learning as well as boost attention span.   Underlying the patent-pending platform are adaptive algorithms that merge established behavioral training principles including those from Precision Teaching and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder treatments together with the latest trends in gaming science.  Concurrently, the innovation will create behavioral and reward mechanisms intended to increase the level of dopamine, a key neurotransmitter in both the learning and reward systems.  Tangentially, the innovation will accelerate important neurological pathways that can free up working memory and improve self-esteem. A paramount outcome is to create a comprehensive software exchange that can be delivered through all types of smart devices.  The project goal involves writing new software and algorithms, leveraging established software and evaluating the software and algorithms with controlled experiments. The technical hurdles to be addressed include: 1) creating new algorithms for an adaptive math-fact curriculum that improve math skills and attention span, 2) enhancing existing data stack with state-of-art machine learning that maintains higher learning performance and motivation, and 3) demonstrating consistent trends in classroom, tutoring and home settings.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOverview: eBravium is building a Comprehensive Integrated Education System (CIES) that is powered by a digital contingency software architecture. The CIES leverages the exploding trends of video games and screen time to empower children and advance their learning performance.  Underlying the patent-pending platform are algorithms that merge established principles from Precision Teaching and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) treatments, as well as the latest trends in gamification science.  One can think of it as the world?s first \"smart\" behavior modification platform.  In simple terms, the experience (that can be downloaded from app stores) locks in learning, requiring children to answer interactive and uniquely customized questions correctly so they can earn access to recreational activities.  Not only is this \"learn-to-earn\" philosophy a highly effective platform for motivating children to do academic work, but by tapping into the brain?s reward circuitry it can help increase attention span, reduce impulsivity and improve memory as well build self-esteem.\n\nUltimately, the CIES will create an exchange where the most appropriate third-party academic curriculum can be connected with highly engaging and commercially available games and other apps.  The CIES creates a significant \"benefit\" to stakeholders because it?s a one-stop shop for combining challenging education content and exciting rewards from multiple sources. The average person is reported to look at their phone every seven minutes creating both a distraction and an opportunity. \n\nOutcome #1: Increased math scores by more than 40%. In a sample of 53 children from 3 different second-grade classrooms, we found that our CIES training did increase the children?s scores on standardized tests of mathematical ability.  We measured mathematical ability using the school district standard - a computer-adaptive benchmark assessment in reading and math called Measures of Academic Progress (MAP).  We compared children?s growth in Math MAP scores, a test which included not only arithmetic facts but also other types of problems such as word problems and geometry, before and after using the CIES.  We used the district norms to determine children?s expected growth in Math MAP scores based on their existing ability at the start of the term.  We then calculated children?s differences in growth from the norm, with the hypothesis that if the CIES had an effect above and beyond normal schooling, children?s growth norm differences would be a positive, non-zero value.  This was found to be the case, with a t test showing the growth norm difference to be significantly different from zero, with t (50) = 3.29, p &lt; 0.0019.  Importantly, the same effect was not observed during the semester where the CIES was not used.\n\nOutcome #2: Intensive automaticity training did not increase math anxiety.  Because our CIES creates an association between reward and performing arithmetic operations, we investigated whether its usage would decrease levels of math anxiety in children.  This is particularly relevant given that there is a great degree of rhetoric in educational psychology and the popular media that claims that automaticity training has a negative effect on math anxiety in girls.  We analyzed whether there was any interaction between math anxiety and gender before and after training.  We found an overall trend (but no significant effects) of decreased anxiety for the class&mdash;especially for the girls.  With an increased sample size, we may be able to demonstrate this finding more robustly.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/29/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Patrick Grimes"
