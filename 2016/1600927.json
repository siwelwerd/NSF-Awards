Funding provided by the National Science Foundation - Advanced Technological Education (ATE) program (DUE #1600927) allowed MSAMCOE to develop and enhance sustainable programs and initiatives, which have positively impacted and continue to impact the number of manufacturing graduates, the number of technicians gaining improved manufacturing skills, and the number of rural, female, and underserved youth pursuing manufacturing careers.</p>\n<p>Manufacturing stakeholders identified that improving the perception of manufacturing was vital to manufacturers&rsquo; continued success (Landsverk, 2020). Perception of manufacturing careers is changing, in part due to the Center&rsquo;s focused efforts. The Center widely distributed its Teacher Guide, Robotics Coaching Guide, Manufacturing Career Tool, and other manufacturing-focused resources. MSAMCOE grew the Minnesota Manufactured&trade; Statewide Tour of Manufacturing*. More than 101,000 people toured at least one of 1,426 registered tours, hosted by 776 manufacturers. MSAMCOE developed best practices for hosting face-to-face, hybrid, and virtual tours. A total of 69 MSAMCOE-funded youth events* were held, impacting over 16,000 students at 17 colleges, where females comprised approximately 47% of attendees. MSAMCOE developed the Digital Badging System, consisting of 33 manufacturing career exploration badges. In total, 361 student accounts were created, and 639 badges earned. MSAMCOE developed a female-focused scholarship program, and through its college partners, was able to award scholarships to 11 females in pursuit of manufacturing-related degree programs.</p>\n<p>Curriculum developed in 2009 with ATE project funding (DUE #1002893) continues to see increased usage. Nineteen high schools* participated in the 360 eTECH High School Program, where nine students graduated with a high school diploma and college certificate - four earned the 16-credit Production Technologies certificate and five earned the 30-credit Welding Technology certificate. Of note, a female Native American student graduated with her 16-credit Production Technologies certificate and was the first in her family and at Red Lake HS to earn a college certificate. She attends Bemidji State University and majors in Applied Engineering. Overall, more than 100 HS students have participated in the program. LiveOnline, which provides virtual courses to manufacturers, incarcerated populations, and HS students, expanded its use of CMAE curriculum. Since 2014, this program has served over 3,200 students from more than 550 businesses. During the grant, 567 employees* took at least one CMAE course, from 82 manufacturers (Pittman, 2021).</p>\n<p>MSAMCOE focused efforts on Competency-Based Education (CBE), enhancing 14 CMAE courses and creating six Medical Device Manufacturing courses. MSAMCOE funded a CBE research project, where 69 courses in a Mechatronics AAS program were restructured to competency-based. Students enroll in courses at any point during the semester and take online coursework at their own pace. Once competent in a specific course/skill, students attend &lsquo;Flex Labs&rsquo; to demonstrate mastery of content to program faculty. Manufacturers in Minnesota are utilizing this new program. A northern Minnesota employer donated a facility to house a new Mechatronics Training facility for all northern Minnesota employees (Kennedy, 2021). Expected enrollment for 2022 is estimated at 50 students. Currently, a welding AAS is being restructured to be competency-based. MSAMCOE funded and hosted three faculty professional development workshops, where 140 educators participated (Pittman, 2021). MSAMCOE hosted multiple Train-the-Trainer workshops at colleges in Minnesota, where 51 secondary instructors from across the state enhanced their teaching and technical skills in multiple manufacturing-related disciplines. The Train-the-Trainer workshops became the launch point for the 2022 Minnesota Manufactured&trade; Technical Education Conference (2MTEC). This conference is designed for secondary and post-secondary educators to share best practices and innovative pedagogies, to gain hands-on experience in manufacturing skill areas (i.e. mechatronics, machining, welding, etc.), and to bridge gaps between education and manufacturing, to ensure a skilled future pipeline of manufacturing talent.</p>\n<p>The work of MSAMCOE focuses on changing the perception of manufacturing, providing educational pathways for students, and partnering with manufacturers throughout the state and region. Students, employers, and educators continue to be impacted by the work of MSAMCOE and partnering organizations, which is helping to address the shortage of skilled technicians for the manufacturing workforce.&nbsp;MSAMCOE will continue to positively impact manufacturing for the foreseeable future, by continuing to successfully lead a complex collaborative of workforce, industry, and education partners.</p>\n<p>*The 2020-2021 Global Pandemic (SARS-CoV-2 | COVID-19) negatively impacted in-person attendance at manufacturing tours, Center-sponsored youth outreach events, educator training, and enrollment/graduation in manufacturing programs/initiatives utilizing Center-developed CMAE curriculum.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Resources</strong></p>\n<p>Kennedy, P.
