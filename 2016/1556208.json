 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dramatic 'outbreaks' of organisms - locusts, lemmings, insects - draw public attention to the natural world, in part because scientists do not completely understand the causes for these population surges. This study will investigate midges in Lake M\u00fdvatn, Iceland, and why their abundance fluctuates over 4 orders of magnitude in irregular cycles lasting 4-7 years. Adult midges that emerge from the lake die on shore. During high-midge years, the weight of midges that are deposited in the surrounding heathland is equivalent to 10 humpback whales, providing food for predators and scavengers, nutrients for plants, and the basis for local agriculture. By synthesizing results from field samples and experiments over several population cycles, this project promises new insights into fundamental scientific questions about the causes and consequences of population outbreaks. The project will engage graduate and undergraduate students who will work at M\u00fdvatn each summer, providing them exposure to extreme biology as well as to educational diversity, as they work in both the lake and on the shoreline under the tutelage of an interdisciplinary group of scientists. The public will learn more about midge outbreaks through an ongoing 'Smidge of Midge' blog.\r\n\r\nEcosystems that show huge changes through time can reveal the ecological forces that stabilize or destabilize natural dynamics. This project involves both long-term data collection in aquatic and terrestrial systems and targeted experiments to test specific hypotheses. The aquatic data collection will build and expand on an existing database that dates back to the 1970s. The project has added weekly monitoring of many additional variables, including midge larvae density, benthic primary production, and pelagic nutrients. The collection of terrestrial data has continued with the monitoring of midge infall and arthropod communities along transects around the lake that were established in 2008. A suite of targeted experiments will address a wide range of research questions such as (i) the role that midges play as ecosystem engineers, changing benthic conditions to favor large-bodied epibenthic cladocerans over small-bodied infaunal species, (ii) the mutualistic effect that midge larvae have on algal growth, and (iii) the importance of midge adults for the flowering of carnivorous plants. These experimental projects are led by graduate students as part of their PhD theses, and by undergraduate interns as independent projects. This combination of aquatic and terrestrial experiments together with regular sampling will test hypotheses about how the lake and shoreline ecosystems are linked together. The research will examine whether the instability of the lake ecosystem could drive instability of the surrounding ecosystem on land.",

To address this, we studied the inherently unstable ecosystem of Lake Myvatn (\"midge lake\" in Icelandic). This ecosystem is both simple and productive. It is simple in having far fewer species than most lakes in the world, since it is an Arctic ecosystem isolated on the island of Iceland in the middle of the North Atlantic. It is naturally productive in having high algal growth fertilized by spring water than carries nutrients from surrounding lava fields. And it is unstable. Midges are the dominant herbivores feeding on algae in the lake, and in some years their combined biomass can equal that of 100 humpback whales. In other years, the midge biomass equals that of only a handful of golden retrievers. Not only are the fluctuations in the midge population extreme (5 orders of magnitude), they are also unpredictable, making Myvatn a textbook case of an unstable ecosystem. Our study of unstable Myvatn has shed some light on what makes other ecosystems stable.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Simple ecosystems with tightly interacting actors are more likely to be unstable. This is known for strongly interacting pairs of species such as lynx and snowshoe hares that show unstable population cycles. Our work has extended this idea from pairs of species to coupled functions within ecosystems. For the case of midges and algae, in Myvatn these make up the bulk of the primary producers (plants) and primary consumers (herbivores) in the lake. The interactions involve not only primary producers and primary consumers, but also detritus made up of dead algae and midge feces; when algal growth is not sufficient to support the midge population, the midges turn to detritus which they consume in sufficient quantities to reduce the detritus pool in the lake sediment. The high productivity of Myvatn leads to high algal growth followed by high midge growth, but when the midge population can no longer be sustained by algae and detritus, it crashes. In contrast to Myvatn, in typical ecosystems the coupling of primary producers, primary consumers, and detritus is more diffuse, and this dissipates the fluctuations and stabilizes the ecosystems.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Our research was conducted by six graduate students and 36 undergraduate students and recent matriculates.
