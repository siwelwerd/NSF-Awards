 "awd_abstract_narration": "The \"Science of Security\" (SoS) encompasses research in cybersecurity that emphasizes the means by which researchers and adopters can gain confidence in research results. The SoS approach emphasizes both the activity of scientific knowledge discovery and also the improvements of scientific methods for validating predictions though logic or through potentially repeatable empirical observational and experimental analyses. It also emphasizes gaining of coherency in the scientific activity.  Science of Security emphasizes the methodology of research in cyber-security as much as the results of that research. \r\n\r\nThis grant provides funding for students to participate in the 2016 Annual Symposium and Bootcamp on the Science of Security (HotSoS), held in April 2016 at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh PA.",
