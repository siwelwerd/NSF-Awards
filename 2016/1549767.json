 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) project will be the microbial production by fermentation of a group of natural food colorants, called anthocyanins, which will benefit the environment, the food industry, and society as a whole. The fermentation production process provides a \"green chemistry\" approach to issues usually encountered in traditional chemical synthesis, such as hazardous catalysts, and eliminates a solvent waste problem typically associated with extraction of natural compounds from botanicals. The proposed work will lead to a greater understanding of the anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway, and result in a lower cost of production of these compounds. Innovation and understanding of the biochemical pathways and process optimization will help serve the potentially multi-billion dollar global market for high purity natural food colorants as food ingredients, as health care products, and in therapeutic applications.\r\n\r\nThis STTR Phase I project proposes to engineer microorganisms that are Generally Regarded As Safe (GRAS), and are currently used for the production of several food additives as microbial cell factories for the production of various anthocyanin molecules. Preliminary work on the biosynthesis of the anthocyanins, using metabolically engineered Escherichia coli recombinant strains, has demonstrated feasibility of this bio-economic approach. Initial work will involve the introduction of plant metabolic pathways in microorganisms via various gene-splicing methods. Further process optimization will be undertaken by improving fermentation conditions and by performing an initial scale-up using the recombinant microorganisms. This microbial fermentation strategy will help enhance the production of such beneficial natural food colorants through a biomanufactuing approach utilizing principles of synthetic biology and metabolic engineering and other emerging biotechnologies.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOne of the greatest shifts in consumer preferences over the past decade has been the migration away from \"artificial\" petrochemical-derived ingredients toward more \"natural\" alternatives.  This shift has been driven in large part by concerns about negative health effects of artificial ingredients.  While the shift began in specialty \"health\" markets, consumer pressures more recently have forced large players in the food industry to adopt the new coloring practices.  Anthocyanins, as the source of many colored molecules in nature, will play a big role in this economic expansion.\n\nAnthocyanins are nearly universally present in plants, and are responsible for brilliant colorings across the spectrum.  They find a wide spectrum of applications in industry as health-promoting nutraceuticals, food and beverage colorants, and cosmetic additives.  One of their most rapidly growing applications is as natural colorants, but the greatest challenges to their widespread adoption is to improve their stability to desiccation, heat, and pH changes. There is considerable interest in the conversion to natural colorants in the food industry, and any commercially viable improvements to the process will likely enjoy rapid adoption.  The major outcome is a technology that allows for stable, economical anthocyanins produced via fermentation.\n\nOur Phase I work demonstrated commercially relevant titers of two stable prototypical anthocyanins: magenta cyanidin-3-O-glucoside (C3G), produced via bioconversion from green tea catechin by C. glutamicum, and of red-orange pelargonidin-3-O-glucoside (P3G) produced de novo from simple carbon sources by a revolutionary polyculture of E. coli.  Our Phase II work is aimed at improving titers and productivity, and on scaling the process up from laboratory to production volumes.  What we are learning from the production of these two pigments is laying the groundwork for expanding to more colors produced by anthocyanins: deeper, more vibrant blues, purples, cyans, reds, and yellows.\n\nThe technologies established in our Phase I work, and will be expanded upon in our Phase II proposal, are innovative and should serve as drop-in replacements to artificial colors across many markets.  Our C3G technology is particularly interesting since it is a bioconversion with C. glutamicum, a bacterium generally regarded as safe (GRAS) already in wide use for the production of amino acid supplements.  The C3G technology may even satisfy consumer demand for \"non-GMO\" because its substrate is a natural product itself.  Our innovative technology for the production of P3G via E. coli polyculture allows for access to more economical substrates.  Both products can command different markets and their introduction can be tiered to consumer demand.\n\nConagen is well poised to capitalize upon this opportunity, with its innovative rapid fermentation optimization processes, established scale-up partners, and expanding customer relationships. \n\n  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/31/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Matthew D Mattozzi"
