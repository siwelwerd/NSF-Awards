 "awd_abstract_narration": "Innovations in industrial chemistry contributed significantly to American economic growth through much of the twentieth century. Cities such as Rochester, New York, were bolstered by the success of companies like Eastman-Kodak. While these industries no longer employ tens of thousands of workers as film has been obsolesced by digital imaging, their impact on these communities remains palpable and enduring. This project, which trains a graduate student in how to conduct rigorous empirically-grounded scientific fieldwork, explores how the chemical photography industry transformed these regions socially, economically, and environmentally.  \r\n\r\nAli Feser, under the supervision of Dr. Joseph Masco of the University of Chicago, will investigate how chemical photography has endured in social life, in the memories of workers, and in regional ecology. First, this project will examine how displaced workers discuss Kodak's impact on social life and the local landscape, and how they understand the changes in imaging technology and the global economy that contributed to Kodak's decline. Second, through engagement with workers, public health experts, and environmentalists, this project will explore the practices of industrial chemistry and waste management that transformed the regional ecology. The researcher will undertake twenty-four months of field research in Rochester, employing a variety of social science methodologies, including participant-observation, interviews, oral histories, genealogies, archival research, and collaborations with local scientists and other experts. This research engages with long-standing and emergent concerns in anthropology, such as large-scale economic transformations, the relationship between humans and their environments, and the study of media. The results of this research will contribute to qualitative understandings of deindustrialization in the U.S. By framing accounts of lower-level employees in detailed biographical and political histories, this study will highlight the consequences of market transformation for those individuals most vulnerable to such shifts. By presenting its scientific findings to the public in accessible visual and narrative form, this research will provide tools and data to engage environmental issues.",

The second largest chemical company in the U.S., Eastman Kodak has been based in Rochester since the 1880s, with another sixty-five factories around the world. In the twentieth century, Kodak permeated every aspect of American visual culture, from the production of mass media to technologies of war, surveillance, and space travel, to vernacular photography and the genre of family album. In this sense, Rochester is significant not only as the company town where film was made, but also as a laboratory for an optics that saturated the midcentury, American visual habitus. As recursively imaged in snapshots and mass mediated images, the chemical aesthetics of Kodak film shaped how Americans envisioned the national community, experienced the landscape, imagined family life, and visualized the good life. At the same time, the long-term, mass manufacture of film and other chemicals has saturated and intractably transformed the local ecology in Rochester.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During research, the co-PI conducted participant observation and oral histories with over sixty former Kodak employees from across the company. She also interviewed local photographers, environmental experts, activists, and medical professionals, attended public meetings on toxicology and environmental remediation, and researched state investigations on industrial pollution. She carried out archival research at seven area institutions and conducted participant observation at museums, community darkrooms, and photography clubs. As visual methodologies were central to this project, the co-PI took classes in filmmaking and historical imaging processes and collaborated with local artists and scientists on a series of art projects. Together these methods allowed the co-PI to track the chemistry of Kodak film through its industrial manufacture and developing, its circulation as image, and its transformation over time as image and as ecological and embodied industrial waste.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Structured around the four components of color film&mdash;silver, gelatin, dyes, and &ldquo;dope&rdquo; or film base&mdash;the dissertation focuses on themes of embodiment, memory, and materiality as they emerged during research. First, drawing on retirees&rsquo; characterizations of the corporation as a family, the dissertation elaborates how Kodak epitomized a paternalistic order of industrial capitalism anchored in a rhetoric of kinship. Described explicitly in archival materials as strategies to prevent unionization, Kodak provided workers with excellent benefits, decent wages, and the promise of a job for life, and it comprised a total institution for its employees and their families. Imbricated with the romantic nationalism of its advertisements and its paternalistic role in the community, Kodak curated a sense that photography was essential to American family life and that its employees constituted a family in their own right. As part of this affective ideology of corporate kinship, the company practiced a tacit policy of hiring from within workers&rsquo; families, thus reinscribing the racial homogeneity of Kodak's largely white workforce. This pattern of racial exclusion was written into film itself, as white women models were used as the basis for laboratory tests and photodeveloping standards. Simultaneously, inclusion in the Kodak family often meant that workers were exposed to industrial toxics.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, the dissertation takes up the issue of residents&rsquo; ambivalence regarding Kodak&rsquo;s toxic legacy. While many area residents recognize that proximity to chemical production can have caustic, long-term, and intergenerational effects on bodily health, they still celebrate Kodak for supporting their families and they mourn the collapse of an industry that structured social life for generations. While it is tempting to explain a longing for things that harm us as a case of false consciousness, this research demonstrates that knowledge does not negate desire. As such, the dissertation theorizes nostalgic desire through the molecular transformation of film chemistry over time and the broader, chemical-industrial entanglements that have remade the landscape, the late industrial body, and its sensory apparatus. It considers how chemistry made certain forms of the good life possible for generations, while foreclosing future possibilities of flourishing.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This dissertation is poised to make significant and timely contributions to visual studies, environmental humanities, and the anthropology of chemistry, the senses, and deindustrialization in urban North America. While grounded in scholarly methodologies and rigorous theoretical engagement, the resulting manuscript is composed in an accessible narrative style and draws heavily from visual and performance art collaborations as well as archival images and found photographs.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 01/01/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Alison&nbsp;Feser</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1559245/1559245_10412903_1514840211277_22Hillside_picnic_48--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1559245/1559245_10412903_1514840211277_22Hillside_picnic_48--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Department 51 Picnic, 1948\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1559245/1559245_10412903_1514840211277_22Hillside_picnic_48--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Department 51 Picnic, 1948\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">One of thousands of slides made by an employee at the Kodak Camera Works factory between 1945 and 1980.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Hy Meisel.
