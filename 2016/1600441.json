 "awd_abstract_narration": "Part of our understanding mathematical objects and their behaviors involves knowing the ways by which we specify those objects and the means that we employ to study them. For example, the question of whether there are infinitely many 7's in the decimal expansion of pi asks about a property of the geometric constant pi as expressed in our base-10 representation of it. This research project in the foundations of mathematics investigates the effective, and more generally definable, aspects of Diophantine approximation, the meta-mathematical status of familiar theorems in countable combinatorics, and the pure structure theory of relative definability. \r\n\r\nOne can view classical theorems in Diophantine approximation, such as Borel's almost-every real number is absolutely normal or Roth's every irrational algebraic number has irrationality exponent 2, as asserting properties of real numbers in terms of our descriptions of them. Borel's theorem asserts a property of expansions by integer bases, and Roth's theorem asserts a property of approximation by rational numbers. There is a natural affinity between this tradition in number theory and the study of definability in recursion theory. This research project will investigate the connections between these areas. For example, what is the exact relationship between the irrationality exponent of a real number, or more generally its Mahler transcendence measures, and the Kolmogorov complexity of the initial segments of its binary expansion? Second, a real number is absolutely normal if for every integer base b, each digit appears with asymptotic frequency 1/b. What other patterns of asymptotic frequencies are possible? This last question also touches dynamical systems in the form of Furstenberg's x2 x3 conjecture.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe goal in this project was \"to integrate methods from Mathematical Logic and Diophantine Approximation and investigate questions which appear at the interface of the two areas.\"    This was an open-ended objective, which led to more focused and technical investigations on several fronts.  Aistleitner, Becher,  Scheerer and Slaman exhibited algorithms to compute absolutely normal numbers whose discrepancy functions converge to zero quickly.  Slaman produced an example of a real number which is normal to base 2 but Liouville to base 10.  It is open whether there is a similar example with 10 replaced by 3.  \n\nThere is a metric manifestation of Diophantine Approximation.  In one form, one studies geometric properties of the sets of real numbers that are well approximated by rational numbers, or more general discrete classes.  In turn, this leads to questions about the geometric properties themselves.  \nIn the 1950s Besicovitch, for a simple case, and Davies, in general, showed that analytic sets of reals are capacitable. That is to say that if an analytic set A has Hausdorff dimension s, then for every t&lt;s, there is a compact subset of A of dimension at least t. In the fall of 2020, Slaman showed that within Goedel's universe of sets there is a co-analytic C such that C has Hausdorff dimension 1, the maximum possible, and yet every closed subset of C is countable. In particular, this C is not capacitable. The proof of this result is an application of methods from computability theory to aspects of geometric measure theory.  Subsequently, other applications of the effective descriptive set theoretic structure theory for co-analytic sets have also been found.  Similarly to the previous result, Slaman-Stull and Richter independently showed that Marstrand's projection theorem does not apply to co-analytic sets in Goedel's universe of sets.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/26/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Theodore A Slaman"
