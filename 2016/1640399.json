 "awd_abstract_narration": "There is a national need to attract and retain students in the sciences through the incorporation of inquiry-based or discovery-based research that is based on current research methods. This work will improve the quality of undergraduate education in a transformative way by initiating a large-scale research project in which individual students data points in a low-cost, short duration course-based research module. The overall goal of this project is to provide student access to an authentic research project that can be easily disseminated to other schools. Students will collect data to determine the prevalence of antibiotic resistant bacteria in the environment. The targeted populations are both college transitioning high school students and current undergraduate students. Undergraduate science students will serve as peer mentors to their secondary school partners. This project provides an opportunity to create a network of researchers at a variety of institution types (public, private, 2-year and 4-year post-secondary institutions, and secondary schools). This project is designed to have low demands on the implementing instructors in terms of time, budget, equipment and instructor expertise. The intention is to provide easy access to an authentic inquiry-based activity without compromising curriculum requirements and time constraints. Additionally, this project will provide a low-stakes gateway to transition instructors from using traditional teaching practices to inquiry-based learning in their classrooms. \r\n\r\nThe specific aims of the project are: (1) to develop teaching and learning materials and a research plan accessible to instructors from a variety of institution types serving a broad demographic range of students, (2) to provide a course-based research experience to at least 900 secondary and 900 undergraduate students, (3) to create partnerships that increase access of secondary school students and teachers to undergraduate-level scientists and students and (4) to generate a database of antibiotic resistance through the crowd-sourcing effort of hundreds of high school and college students. All undergraduate participants will be asked to take the Classroom Undergraduate Research Experience (CURE) survey that uses self-assessment to measure a range of course outcomes such as learning gains and science attitude questions. The activities of this project are in alignment with the Common Core standards in mathematics such as creating equations, modeling, and quantitative reasoning. A pre- and post-implementation survey will be administered to the instructor participants to assess their use of and attitudes toward various pedagogical teaching methods.",

Course-based research experiences (CREs) are a useful way to introduce large sets of students to the practices of authentic research. However, CREs often come with high cost, time, and complexity burdens that make them challenging for instructors to implement and institutions to sustain. To increase the reach of CREs, this funding was used to develop the Prevalence of Antibiotic Resistance in the Environment (PARE) project: a short duration and low-cost authentic research module, which allows for a relatively easy transition into authentic research for diverse classroom settings.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>According to the CDC, antimicrobial resistant (AMR) infections account for approximately 23,000 deaths per year in the U.S. The origin of these infections has remained a subject of intense investigation, but significant evidence exists to suggest a link between antibiotics and AMR organisms in the environment, and human health. Better information on the prevalence of AMR organisms in the environment has been suggested as an important step to understand the relationship between environmental and clinical resistance. While there are systematic reporting methods in place for surveillance of clinical AMR infections and contamination of meat products, there is no equivalent in the U.S. for reporting the prevalence of AMR microbes in the environment.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The PARE project is a citizen-science driven monitoring system, with classrooms across the country systematically testing and reporting the prevalence of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria from soil at diverse geographic sites. The project started with a short duration research module that can be integrated into an existing course. The methods are straight-forward and low cost. Students sample soil and subject it to standard microbiological techniques to determine the percent of microbes present that can grow in the presence of tetracycline antibiotic (Fig. 1). Throughout the duration of this project, data were collected by thousands of undergraduates at sites across the U.S.; the goal is to obtain enough data to detect ?hotspots? of resistance and changes over time (Fig. 2). Data have been curated and work is in progress to convert to a Geographic Information System (GIS) database and mapping system. Currently, 123 undergraduate institutions participate (including 29% associate?s dominant and 26% doctoral-granting). Over the course of the funding period, we expanded the opportunities for instructors by creating a library of additional research modules. All modules are related to the original core module and most provide the opportunity for students to collect additional AMR data from their sample site (Fig. 3). For example, while the original module provides culture-based sampling data, other modules provide molecular data on the prevalence of AMR resistance gene markers. For this work, we collaborated with several veteran PARE instructors, other research faculty expert in AMR, and a company.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Assessment data indicate that even this short duration project can have positive outcomes on student confidence, collaboration skills, and attitude and behaviors associated with the identity of a scientist. Students also showed significant learning gains on a pilot version of a pre/post assessment that was collaboratively designed by a sub-set of PARE instructors. Further, undergraduates report that the project confirms interest in their intended field of study; high school students report significant gains in intent to apply to college and in to take another science course.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>While barriers to using CREs have been studied in veteran instructors, little is known about the decision process of novice CRE instructors, or what features of CRE design can mitigate barriers and/or motivate instructors to use CREs.&nbsp;In this project, we analyzed interview data from instructors who had not yet implemented PARE to uncover the motivators and barriers that they perceive prior to implementation of a CRE, and PARE specifically.&nbsp;Instructors viewed CREs as having relative advantages over traditional methods and find them compatible with their teaching values. However, CREs were also viewed as complex, with instructors citing numerous barriers. Instructors were motivated to use PARE because of its potential scientific impact and compatibility with their course structure and resources. Instructors perceived PARE to have few barriers to implementation compared to other CREs. Designing CREs that address common instructor barriers and drivers could increase the rate of diffusion of CREs.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 11/01/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Carol&nbsp;Bascom-Slack</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1640399/1640399_10336798_1572622120461_Fig.1JMBE.ai.MainManuscriptv2.3--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1640399/1640399_10336798_1572622120461_Fig.1JMBE.ai.MainManuscriptv2.3--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Fig. 1.
