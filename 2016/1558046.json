 "awd_abstract_narration": "Plants must have a highly branched root system for efficient moisture and nutrient acquisition. As a result of global climate change, drought is becoming more prevalent world-wide, driving the need for insight into root architecture that maximizes water uptake that may lead to development of drought tolerant crops. This project explores how root architecture is controlled by flavonoids, which are chemicals made by plants that function as antioxidants. Flavonoid antioxidants reduce the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which act as signaling molecules to help plants adapt to stressful growth conditions, but can become toxic at high levels. ROS signals play important roles in the response of plants to changes in light, temperature, and drought. This project examines how ROS-dependent signaling pathways are induced and how flavonoids limit these signals to prevent oxidative damage. The planned experiments will use plants with mutations that alter flavonoid synthesis to demonstrate when and where flavonoids alter ROS levels in roots and how the accumulation of flavonoids alters root architecture. This project will also explore the mechanisms by which ROS modulates activity of proteins and expression of genes. This project will also support the development of a case study exercise targeted to high school students, which teaches plant genetics and how plants respond to drought and the potential of conventional breeding and genetic engineering of plants to lead to drought tolerant crop varieties. The team will bring college students to high school classrooms to lead students through this curriculum to better understand these concepts and how they apply to agriculture. \r\n\r\nThis project will examine the role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) as signaling molecules that control root development and examine how flavonoids scavenge ROS to modulate development. This project applies genetic, molecular biological, and biochemical approaches to examine and manipulate the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway in the model plant species of Arabidopsis thaliana to ask whether flavonoid effects on root architecture are the result of their antioxidant action. We have in hand mutants with defects at most steps in flavonoid biosynthesis, which we will use to determine which flavonoids control root architecture. We will localize and quantify ROS using confocal microscopy with a probes that detect specific reactive oxygen species to determine whether ROS accumulation and distribution are modulated by the different flavonoid accumulation profiles found in these mutants. We will use genetic and chemical approaches to manipulate the levels of ROS and ROS scavengers to demonstrate that flavonoid/ROS interplay is directly linked to root development. Finally, we will identify the mechanisms by which flavonoid-modulated ROS controls root development by exploring changes in transcriptional networks and using an unbiased proteomic approach to identify proteins that are reversibly modified by ROS in a flavonol-dependent mechanism. The function of ROS regulated gene products or ROS oxidized proteins will then be tested using a mutant approach.",

Plants produce chemical signals that can rapidly remodel development. The goal of this project was to understand how a group of these chemical signals, known as reactive oxygen species (ROS), govern aspects of plant development and physiology. ROS are oxygen containing molecules that are highly chemically reactive and can modify cellular components, such as DNA or proteins, to change their function. ROS are produced in response to external stimuli, including hormone signaling, pathogen attack, and temperature changes. If ROS levels are too low, failures in development can occur, however, if they are too high, they can be toxic to the plant. In response to environmental stressors that elevate ROS, plants prevent ROS from reaching these toxic levels. One strategy is the synthesis of flavonol antioxidants, which are plant-specialized compounds that are able to scavenge excess ROS. The production of ROS and antioxidants is a finely tuned process that is required to maintain this balance (Figure 1). This project examined how ROS and flavonols modulate root development, and how hormones induce ROS to drive these root developmental changes or to alter cell signaling in leaves. Understanding how plants protect themselves in the harsh environments that occur due to climate change is key to the development of sustainable crops that can tolerate these conditions.</p>\n<p><strong>The role of ROS and antioxidants in root development</strong></p>\n<p>Root architecture follows a precisely defined pattern that is key to a plant?s survival. In the model plant species, <em>Arabidopsis thaliana</em>, ROS and flavonol antioxidants modulate formation of root developmental processes that maximize water and nutrient uptake and keep plants anchored in the soil<em>. </em>Lateral roots emerge from the primary root from cells that divide deep to form the lateral root primordia, which will continue dividing until the lateral root emerges, while root hairs are single cells that protrude from the root surface (Figure 2). These root structures.</p>\n<p>Root hairs form in alternating patterns so that every root hair forming cell (labelled 1, 3, and 5 in Figure 3) is adjacent to a non-hair forming cell (labelled 2 and 4). Our studies revealed that in plants that do not produce flavonol antioxidants, due to genetic changes, there are increased numbers of root hairs. A dye that becomes fluorescent when it reacts with ROS, had increased signal in root hair cells of flavonol deficient plants compared to wild type (orange signal in Figure 3). Flavonol deficient plants have increased numbers of lateral roots compared to wild type plants, with elevated ROS around the lateral root primordia of flavonol deficient plants compared to wild type plants. These results suggest that ROS may drive both lateral root and root hair formation, while flavonols act as ROS scavengers to inhibit these processes.</p>\n<p><strong>Hormones as drivers of ROS </strong></p>\n<p>Hormones are key regulators of ROS synthesis. We examined how two different hormones, ethylene and abscisic acid (ABA), affected ROS synthesis in roots and leaves, respectively. Ethylene is a gaseous hormone that increases the number and length of root hairs. We hypothesized that ethylene may induce ROS synthesis to drive root hair development. When roots were treated with ethylene for 4 hours, there was an increase in root hair number and ROS accumulation in the root hair forming cells (Figure 4A). In plants that were deficient in ROS producing enzymes, we found that there was a decrease in the amount of ethylene-induced root hair development and ROS accumulation.</p>\n<p>On the surface of leaves there are small pores, called stomata. If water is present, the cells that form the stomata will swell to open the pores. This allows for evaporation of excess water, called transpiration, as well as carbon dioxide intake, which is required for photosynthesis. If water is limited, the cells will shrink to prevent water loss. Therefore, understanding how the opening and closing of stomata is regulated is incredibly important in the context of climate change and drought or flooding stress. The plant drought hormone, ABA, regulates the opening and closing of stomata. We examined the subcellular location of ROS accumulation increases (revealed as green fluorescence in Figure 4B) in response to ABA signaling revealing in several cellular compartments, such as the mitochondria, which then drive stomata closure.</p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion </strong></p>\n<p>Together these experiments reveal new roles for ROS and antioxidants in roots and leaves and provide information on when ROS is a productive signal to allow for proper development and physiological responses, contrasting with previous studies that focused on ROS as damaging molecules.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/21/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Gloria&nbsp;K&nbsp;Muday</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1558046/1558046_10415184_1671658069229_Figure1NSFreportsmall--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1558046/1558046_10415184_1671658069229_Figure1NSFreportsmall--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1558046/1558046_10415184_1671658069229_Figure1NSFreportsmall--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The balance of reactive oxygen species and antioxidants controls plant development</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Emily Martin</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Gloria&nbsp;K&nbsp;Muday</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 1</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1558046/1558046_10415184_1671659949966_Figure2NSFreportsmall--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1558046/1558046_10415184_1671659949966_Figure2NSFreportsmall--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 2\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1558046/1558046_10415184_1671659949966_Figure2NSFreportsmall--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 2\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">mages of seedlings of Arabidopsis thaliana reveal detailed root patterning.
