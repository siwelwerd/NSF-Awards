The vessel is owned by the LUMCON and the mission of the ship is to support funded science research in the Gulf of Mexico.  With this proposal, LUMCON provides technical descriptions and rationale for the acquisition of the following equipment:\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n1)\tHawboldt SPRE-2244/RS Appendix A&B compliant CTD Winch\t$205,800\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\t\r\nThe principal impact of the present proposal is under Merit Review Criterion 2 of the Proposal Guidelines (NSF 13-589). It provides infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF).  The acquisition,  maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.",

Commissioning of the winch was completed by Hawboldt representatives prior to a March 19th cruise aboard the RV PELICAN.  During this March 19thcruise, the winch was extensively tested and was successful.  \n\nCurrently, the winch has been use during each research cruise since it was installed and the R/V Pelican has been at sea for 137 days since March of 2018.  It is estimated that 240 CTD casts have been conducted during this time period.  The winch has performed flawlessly and is an asset to the vessel?s scientific operations and missions.      \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/07/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Joseph D Malbrough"
