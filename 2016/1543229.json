 "awd_abstract_narration": "Brook 1543267\r\n\r\nApproximately half of the human caused carbon dioxide emissions to the atmosphere are absorbed by the ocean, which reduces the amount of global warming associated with these emissions.  Much of this carbon uptake occurs in the Southern Ocean around Antarctica, where water from the deep ocean comes to the surface. How much water \"up-wells,\" and therefore how much carbon is absorbed, is believed to depend on the strength and location of the major westerly winds in the southern hemisphere.  These wind patterns have been shifting southward in recent decades, and future changes could impact the global carbon cycle and promote the circulation of relatively warm water from the deep ocean on to the continental shelf, which contributes to enhanced Antarctic ice melt and sea level rise. Understanding of the westerly winds and their role in controlling atmospheric carbon dioxide levels and the circulation of ocean water is therefore very important.   The work supported by this award will study past movement of the SH westerlies in response to natural climate variations. Of particular interest is the last deglaciation (20,000 to 10,000 years ago), when the global climate made a transition from an ice age climate to the current warm period.  During this period, atmospheric carbon dioxide rose from about 180 ppm to 270 parts per million, and one leading hypothesis is that the rise in carbon dioxide was driven by a southward movement of the southern hemisphere westerlies.  The broader impacts of the work include a perspective on past movement of the southern hemisphere westerlies and their link to atmospheric carbon dioxide, which could guide projections of future oceanic carbon dioxide uptake, with strong societal benefits; international collaboration with German scientists; training of a postdoctoral investigator; and outreach to public schools. \r\n \r\nThis project will investigate whether the abundance of a noble gas, krypton-86, trapped in Antarctic ice cores, records atmospheric pressure variability, and whether or not this pressure variability can be used to infer past movement of the Southern Hemisphere westerly winds. The rationale for the project is that models of air movement in the snow pack (firn) in Antarctica indicate that pressure variations drive air movement that disturbs the normal enrichment in krypton-86 caused by gravitational settling of gases.  Calculations predict that the krypton-86 deviation from gravitational equilibrium reflects the magnitude of pressure variations.  In turn, atmospheric data show that pressure variability over Antarctica is linked to the position of the southern hemisphere westerly winds. Preliminary data from the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) Divide ice core show a large excursion in krypton-86 during the transition from the last ice age to the current warm period.  The investigators will perform krypton-86 analysis on ice core and firn air samples to establish whether the krypton-86 deviation is linked to pressure variability, refine the record of krypton isotopes from the WAIS Divide ice core, investigate the role of pressure variability in firn air transport using firn air models, and investigate how barometric pressure variability in Antarctica is linked to the position/strength of the SH westerlies in past and present climates.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis award supported the development of a new way of telling how stormy the weather was at times in the past, in the polar regions where ice cores permit the study of ancient samples of the atmosphere from trapped air bubbles.  The principle of this method is that storms cause barometric pressure fluctuations, and those fluctuations cause air in the snowpack to move up and down.  This is known as barometric pumping.  This pumping action disturbs the normal settling of heavy gases towards the bottom of the snow layer due to gravity, and therefore certain atmospheric gases like krypton and xenon have less gravitational settling than nitrogen and argon.  The reason is that krypton and xenon diffuse more slowly than nitrogen and argon due to their larger mass. \n\nAn analogy might be a bucket of muddy water, which if left undisturbed for a day will become clear water as the mud particles settle to the bottom.  But if the bucket is disturbed, some mud will be kicked up and the water will once again be slightly muddy.  Slow-sinking particles (like krypton) will take longer to resettle.  Fast-sinking particles (like argon) will resettle more quickly.  So if the bucket is continuously disturbed a little bit, there will be an excess of the fast-moving particles on the bottom of the bucket, relative to the slow-moving particles.  This excess of fast particles will vary with the amount of disturbance, and can be used as an indicator of the amount of disturbance.\n\nIn summary, the measured difference between krypton and argon is sensitive to the amount of barometric pumping.  This chemical signature gets trapped in air bubbles at the bottom of the snow layer and preserved, allowing the reconstruction of past storminess from the krypton-argon difference in ice cores.  This award supported the development and testing of this new proxy indicator of storminess, and one key activity was measuring the krypton-argon difference at as many sites across Antarctica and Greenland as possible, in ice from the last few decades when direct atmospheric pressure measurements have been made.  The krypton-argon difference at each site was then plotted against the barometric pressure fluctuation intensity at that site to see if there was a correlation.  Indeed, there was.  This observation supports the underlying premise of the storminess indicator, which can be extended back into the past before there were direct barometric pressure measurements.  Ice cores go back nearly a million years now, so the potential exists to reconstruct past storminess over this period.  Two graduate students were educated under this award (Benjamin Birner and Sarah Shackleton), constituting a broader impact of the research on the Nation's scientific human resource base.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/20/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jeffrey P Severinghaus"
