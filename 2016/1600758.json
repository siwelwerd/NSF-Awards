The organizers will lead a day of primer lectures and workshops (at an undergraduate level) preparing nonspecialist participants for the plenary lectures and aforementioned mini-courses. The selected topics include geometry of fractal subsets of the real line and of higher dimensional Euclidean spaces, complex dimensions and zeta functions, analytic number theory, and analysis on fractals with connections to geometric measure theory, quasicrystals and noncommutative geometry, stochastic processes, and thermodynamic formalism. The event allows for plenary lectures (90 minutes) from well-known experts, short research communications, poster sessions, and discussion sessions. The summer school will place special emphasis on preparing undergraduate students for further research in mathematics (independently or at later activities, like REUs).",
