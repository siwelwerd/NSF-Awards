 "awd_abstract_narration": "More than 50% of patients with asthma and Chronic Obstructive Lung disease (COPD) fail to use their inhaled medication, which is the most recognized obstacle for controlling the health and economic burden of asthma and COPD. Current methods to improve medication use are ineffective, too cumbersome to use and expensive for widespread adoption. This I-Corps team has developed an inexpensive, yet accurate flow sensor integrated with existing inhaler devices and paired via Bluetooth technology to a smartphone; thereby, providing a monitoring and management tool for asthma and COPD. It provides substantial value for patients and healthcare providers as it streamlines data and disease management and makes COPD treatment more affordable and sustainable for both, individual patients and healthcare providers.\r\n\r\nDuring the I-Corps program, this team will develop a viable business plan and validate market assumptions. To accomplish this goal, the team will conduct market research to understand the spectrum of needs of its primary customers which are disease management entities. The team anticipates conducting 100 interviews in approximately 22 to 30 disease management entities. At the end of the program, the team expects to have a detailed understanding of the needs of potential customers and who would be the most likely first customer segment. The team also expects to have a detailed description of how its minimum viable product should be designed to meet the needs of its customer. With this knowledge the team hopes to expedite the technical and analytical development that will go into an FDA ready device. Further this parallel path of customer development will provide clear evidence for investors to evaluate the addressable market and market size for the proposed product.",
