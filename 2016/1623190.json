 "awd_abstract_narration": "In order to thrive and even survive in the globalized marketplace of ideas and innovation, the U.S. must aggressively meet the challenge of increasing the number of students who complete degrees in computing areas. It is critical for our economic and social health, as well as national security, to maintain a globally competitive computing workforce. The Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts that employment of computer and information technology occupations is projected to grow faster than the average for all occupations (12% from 2014 to 2024). In order to keep our nation on the cutting edge of technology, we must retain more domestic students in computing programs.  A 2012 report on undergraduate STEM education from the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) cites \"uninspiring\" introductory courses and an unwelcoming atmosphere from faculty as major factors contributing to attrition. The project at the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP) aims to address the PCAST findings by re-imagining what it means to learn, whose knowledge counts, and what counts as knowledge in the context of Computer Science (CS).  The UTEP model transforms faculty into change agents and fosters the development of positive student identities early in the curriculum to impact students' trajectories in CS and beyond. As important, the acquired skills and knowledge from the proposed effort are expected to transfer to other subjects in students' studies, decrease students' time to degree, and strengthen their preparedness for entry into the computing workforce. Further, the development of inclusive environments with members who value multiple and diverse experiences and perspectives is needed to address global challenges and opportunities.\r\n\r\nThe overarching goal of the project is to cultivate socially conscious connectedness among students, faculty, and industry. This will be accomplished by expanding a curriculum centered on heightened social interaction driven by an understanding and appreciation for the cultural contributions of diverse students to CS in a globalized world.  The project objectives are to (1) transform the CS curriculum (i.e., content, pedagogical principles, social interaction, and faculty beliefs) to one that builds students' identities as computer scientists and considers societal and global contexts in problem solving; and (2) develop a climate of connectedness through a shared sense of purpose among faculty focused on establishing cultural competence and inclusive environments.  The outcome will be twofold:  (i) a program of study that motivates, connects, and immerses students from diverse backgrounds in the profession throughout their plan of study; and (ii) faculty with deep cultural competence who use professional practice-based learning to foster systemic change. The resulting model transforms CS teaching and learning through deep change to curriculum grounded in social consciousness, cultural competency, and practice informed by the department's unique expertise and experiences as a Hispanic-serving institution and leader of the Computing Alliance of Hispanic-Serving Institutions (CAHSI).  The theoretical underpinnings of the project are framed on theories of learning informed by situated cognition, derived from sociocultural theory. In order to generate new knowledge about a process-oriented approach to deep educational change in CS, the effort includes ethnographic research on the change process and the education process paying particular attention to diversity, inclusion and professional practice.",

UTEP's efforts to support professional practice began in fall 2018 when Google assigned a Googler in Residence to co-teach and mentor students in the introductory sequence each fall. From this effort, the department started a Coding Interview Club that continues to thrive and connect students. Students' preparedness for technical interviews has been enhanced significantly through the club and the problem-solving courses described in Table 1. Another initiative, the Google Tech Exchange Program, allows CS students to take courses co-created by Googlers and CS faculty.</p>\n<p>Instructors of the foundational courses introduced problems that are relevant to the border community. Changes in these courses originated from Google's Faculty in Residence program, which included emphasis on V&amp;V, creating a culture in which students understand the importance of asking questions, collaborating, and understanding that failure is integral to learning.</p>\n<p>A climate of connectedness among the students has been created through an advocacy program in which an advocate involves students in departmental and external opportunities. The Allyship program, which was funded in 2020 by Reboot Representation, pairs upper division CS majors with new CS majors to provide support structures. New student organizations were created during the grant: the Miners Cybersecurity club, Women in Cybersecurity student chapter, and Coding Club. These organizations are student-driven, delivering student-led sessions that ensure connectedness within the discipline, peers, and department, and build students' competencies. Other co-curricular activities include cybersecurity training workshops and competitions.</p>\n<p>A finding from the project was the value and care for students. The emphasis on student support in coursework, hiring staff who communicate values that emphasize student assets, and use of multiple training and supervision mechanisms indicate how UTEP worked towards change that embodies values of student access and excellence through its human resources practices. The department supports students' attendance at conferences, which provides opportunities for professional development, build social networks, and connect with sponsors.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Continuous Improvement became an integral part of change. Workshops were developed to share departmental data collected in the previous semester and engage in data interpretation as a faculty team. The practice created a sense of ownership of the data. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>The department established a culture of dialog and collective problem solving with processes that provide deliberate feedback. A new practice of course-to-course curricular alignment was developed to clarify communication across courses. It elucidates elements of policy regarding continuous improvement, i.e., the use of dialog to make meaning across faculty.</p>\n<p>The project also bolstered structures of support for student learning through tiered mentoring, deliberate practice, and embedded feedback mechanisms. The structure of the curricular model is that there are multiple opportunities for guided practice. The research highlights key factors that drive departmental change for student success. Hiring doctoral graduates to mentor, teach, and advise undergraduate CS majors, and intentionally hiring for student success were found to be highly influential activities. Findings also highlight continuous improvement to engage multiple practices over time to achieve change for greater equity.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/29/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Ann&nbsp;Q&nbsp;Gates</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1623190/1623190_10432350_1667066949100_Miners-WiCyS--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1623190/1623190_10432350_1667066949100_Miners-WiCyS--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Miner Women in CyberSecurity\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1623190/1623190_10432350_1667066949100_Miners-WiCyS--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Miner Women in CyberSecurity\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">UTEP female students attending the WiCyS conference.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">UTEP</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Ann&nbsp;Q&nbsp;Gates</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Miner Women in CyberSecurity</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1623190/1623190_10432350_1667076319016_CSStudentsatGHC--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1623190/1623190_10432350_1667076319016_CSStudentsatGHC--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"2022 GHC\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1623190/1623190_10432350_1667076319016_CSStudentsatGHC--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"2022 GHC\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">UTEP CS Students attending  the 2022 Grace Hooper Conference</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">UTEP</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Salamah&nbsp;Salamah</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">2022 GHC</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1623190/1623190_10432350_1667076410302_UTEPTechExcahngeStudentsatGoogle--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1623190/1623190_10432350_1667076410302_UTEPTechExcahngeStudentsatGoogle--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Tech Excahnge\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1623190/1623190_10432350_1667076410302_UTEPTechExcahngeStudentsatGoogle--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Tech Excahnge\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">UTEP CS Students from the virtual Google Tech Exchange Program celebrating in person at the Google campus.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">UTEP</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Ann&nbsp;Q&nbsp;Gates</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Tech Excahnge</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1623190/1623190_10432350_1667076737176_GIRsatUTEP--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1623190/1623190_10432350_1667076737176_GIRsatUTEP--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"UTEP Vistors\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1623190/1623190_10432350_1667076737176_GIRsatUTEP--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"UTEP Vistors\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">2022 Googlers in Residence Marlon Gamez (first from left) and Tyler Garret (third) along with Google visiting team</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">UTEP</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Salamah&nbsp;Salamah</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">UTEP Vistors</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1623190/1623190_10432350_1667076894052_HSStudentsatUTEPDongon--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1623190/1623190_10432350_1667076894052_HSStudentsatUTEPDongon--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"CS Dungeon\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1623190/1623190_10432350_1667076894052_HSStudentsatUTEPDongon--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"CS Dungeon\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">High School students visit the CS Dungeon room</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">UTEP</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Salamah&nbsp;Salamah</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">CS Dungeon</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
