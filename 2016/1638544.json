The event will address research areas in nanotechnology, nano-optics and nanoelectronics. Academics and industry leaders will be able to interact on the latest issues in nanotechnology and the links with related areas, such as biotechnology, advanced materials development, microsystems and photonics will be explored. The conference will target world regional groups co-operate to implement strategic and beneficial cooperative programs to progress mankind's development through nanotechnology and its associated intellectual merits.",
