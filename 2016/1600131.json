 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research examines the potential for achieving sustainability in coastal systems where natural resources are impacted by both climate change and human responses to climate change.  Chesapeake Bay shorescapes (a shoreline zone which includes riparian, intertidal, and near-shore shallow water areas) are used as a test bed because sea level rise creates risks for shoreline property owners and shoreline marshes.  Property owner perception and response to the risk varies and their choice of a shoreline protection approach (armoring, living shoreline, do nothing) has consequences for the capacity of shoreline marshes to continue to provide ecosystem services. Impacts on marsh services that include supporting fisheries and improving water quality affect the larger estuarine system, with consequences for the many users of that system.  This leads to regulation by government officials, who have their own perception of all these issues. Modeling the decision-making process of shoreline property owners, the ecological consequences of shoreline management decisions, and the perceptions of officials developing or implementing natural resource policies will discover opportunities and options for managing the combined human and natural system to desired outcomes.\r\n\r\nThe goal of the project is to discover the elements of the shorescape social-ecological system  that have the greatest influence on attainment of sustainable outcomes. The research describes the trajectory of Chesapeake Bay shorescapes in terms of changes in amount, distribution, and character of shoreline types.  The primary drivers of these changes are rising sea levels and actions of shoreline property owners to combat erosion.  An analysis of existing information on shoreline conditions, property owner characteristics and property management decisions is used to model future shoreline management choices.  A series of field investigations comparatively quantify multiple ecosystem functions (habitat provision, primary production, nutrient and carbon storage) of living shorelines and natural marshes along a continuum of estuarine shorescape settings and project future shifts in function under varying management scenarios.  This information is compiled in a marsh function model that can use input from the shoreline management model.  Future outcomes then are forecast under scenarios with alternative sea level rise and management conditions.  Surveys of government officials responsible for policy development and implementation document the operative feedbacks from the ecological consequences of property owner decisions.  Synthesis of this information identifies the characteristics of shorescape socio-ecological systems that enhance or detract from their ability to achieve sustainable outcomes.  Formal guidance for coastal managers and policy makers will be developed using the results of this integrative approach to sustainability in Chesapeake Bay shorescapes.",
