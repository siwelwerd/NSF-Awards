 "awd_abstract_narration": "Graphene nanoribbons, epitaxially grown on the sidewall of single crystal silicon carbide, have been shown to have many useful electrical properties including ballistic transport and extremely high carrier mobility, as well as more exotic effects like ferromagnetism.  To probe some of these exotic properties, advanced quantum transport techniques can be used.  In China, the PI will fabricate graphene nanoribbon field-effect-transistors using high-quality samples grown at the Georgia Institute of Technology.  The instruments and infrastructures available at Tianjin University will allow for rapid device fabrication and characterization.  Electronic transport measurements will be carried out in the Tianjin International Center of Nanoparticle and Nanosystem, directed by Professor Walter de Heer, a noted expert on epitaxial graphene.  This program will advance graphene nanoribbons as a new-age electronic interconnect, poised to replace copper wiring in microelectronics and even the electronic devices themselves.\r\n\r\nThe quantum properties of graphene nanoribbons can be probed using normal metal and/or superconducting contacts.  The differential conductance of the ribbon will be measured as a function of gate voltage, source-drain bias, and magnetic field.  Superconducting contacts are expected to lead to proximity effect in graphene nanoribbons, sensitive to the spin polarized excited states.  The comprehensive understanding of the quantum levels in graphene nanoribbons, as well as the corresponding transport behavior, will aid in the use of graphene nanoribbon for several budding device applications such as quantum dots, spintronics, high-frequency electronics, optoelectronics, and plasmonics.\r\n\r\nThis award under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the Ministry of Science and Technology of China.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nTianjin International Center for Nanoparticles and Nanosystems (TICNN) is an up and coming nanotechnology center aimed at nanoclusters and epitaxial graphene  systems.  TICNN in Tianjin, China, will act as a scientific exchange center between the Georgia Institute  of Technology in the United States and Tianjin University.   The collaborations formed around the objective of scientific research  will strengthen the knowledge base and cooperative history of both  countries in addition to its direct contributions to the field of hard  condensed matter physics.  One particular graphene structure of interest to TICNN is the epitaxial graphene nanoribbon,  which has far reaching applications as a high-quality transmission  line.  My efforts under this project were aimed at furthering TICNN as a center that performs graphene research through fabrication and measurement of epitaxial graphene nanoribbon devices.\n\nIn  a short span of time I was introduced to members of the TICNN community  that was building around the center as it was renovated.  I set up a  cryogenic probe station for graphene measurement and coded custom  labview programs to run gate dependent measurements.  The graduate  students there were eager to learn and help such that I was able to  share the programs and the setup that it would be useful for future  experimenters at the center.  I gave lectures with bilingual elements on  transport physics as well as fabricating and measuring epitaxial  graphene nanoribbon devices and electronic measurements in general.  All  these activites benefitted the center, but they also helped me grow  personally and professionally.\n\nWhile there, I was able to work  with key scientists in the field as well as my own thesis advisor.  The  discussions had there were integral to my recent dissertation defense  and the experience vital to my subsequent job search.  The connections I  formed in Tianjin will be useful to me throughout my life, and I will  always be welcome back at TICNN as a PhD in the field.  In total, the  effects of this project will be long reaching as a contribution toward  an international nanotechnology center and a novel scientific effort.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/15/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Owen Vail"
