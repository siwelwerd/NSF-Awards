 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Major Research Instrumentation award will allow a team of astronomers at the University of Arizona to construct a state-of-the-art instrument for use at the 6.5 meter Magellan telescope in Chile.  This instrument will permit direct imaging of faint planets and debris disks around bright stars.  Several postdoctoral fellows and graduate students will play key roles in the design and testing phases.  The instrument will enable a wide range of science for a large number of astronomers at member institutions as well as their collaborators from outside the consortium.   It will push the envelope of adaptive optics capability, which will have a major positive impact for a wide range of scientific and commercial applications.\r\n\r\nThis University of Arizona team will develop world-leading capabilities in high-contrast coronagraphic adaptive optics imaging and spectroscopy through a new instrument to be developed for the 6.5 meter Magellan telescope in Chile.  The instrument will extend adaptive optics capabilities into the visual band, enabling unique science capabilities, especially for imaging exoplanets and proto-planetary disks.  The MagAO-X instrument will build incrementally on the current MagAO system and through three carefully-considered stages, ultimately leading to a new comprehensive instrument. This MRI development effort will enhance infrastructure and provide sorely-needed training opportunities for future instrumentalists.",
