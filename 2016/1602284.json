 "awd_abstract_narration": "As part of its overall strategy to enhance learning in informal environments, the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program funds innovative resources for use in a variety of settings. Using hand-held mobile devices this project would test specialized Signing Glossaries for Science Exhibits (SGSE).  The glossaries are developed from 5000 unique signing terms specific to the science in 6 partner institutions and designed to reach families with at least one member, ages 5-12+, who is deaf or hard of hearing and uses American Sign Language (ASL) for communication. The project would demonstrate the potential effectiveness of the venue-specific signing glossaries to enhance access to STEM learning during visits to informal STEM learning environments such as aquariums, botanical gardens, natural history museums, nature centers, science museums, and zoos.  \r\n\r\nWhile utilizing existing domain specific signing terms, the project will adapt and improve on their use in content specific informal science venues to increase the opportunity for the target audience to both enjoy and benefit from the wide array of informal science learning opportunities available to this group. The research should reveal how this approach might benefit those with other types of disabilities.  The research questions are designed to understand both how family members might interact with a hearing disabled family member as well as how the disabled individual might learn more about a variety of STEM content in a setting that is not domain specific but uses the influence of science exhibits to inform, engage and interest members of the public generally.   \r\n\r\nDomain specific signing dictionaries have been developed, many by this PI, to address access to content specific topics in STEM.  This proposal extends this concept to informal learning environments that are content specific to increase the opportunity for those with hearing disabilities to increase their capability to both enjoy informal science learning venues and to understand more of what these venues provide in terms of science learning.",

Issues with English often mean missing useful information and not getting the full experience. We knew from prior research that museum visitors were using the signing math and science dictionaries that we had developed for classroom use. From examination of their utilization at science museums, we learned that what visitors wanted was a single tool that they can use to look up terms quickly and easily. This project addresses this need.</p>\n<p>Research and development resulted in six separate apps for visitors of different ages, reading abilities, and interests who have some knowledge of ASL to access content and instructions at numerous types of informal science venues. The apps are available free from the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store. They can be used on various mobile devices, including iPhones, iPads, and tablets. The glossaries are as follows: Signing Aquarium Glossary (SAG), Signing Botanical Garden Glossary (SBGG), Signing Nature Center Glossary (SNCG), Signing Natural History Museum Glossary (SNHMG), Signing Science Museum Glossary (SSMG), and Signing Zoo Glossary (SZG).</p>\n<p>Each glossary contains more than 1,000 terms and is designed to allow visitors to access terms in different ways so that they can choose a method that makes sense to them. They can use icons to access terms from an alphabet list, a category list, or a search box. A single click leads to a definition page that includes the term and its definition in English. It also includes icons for listening to the term and its definition, seeing a 3D avatar character sign the term, and viewing an illustration. Controls can be used to start and stop the signing, loop back to the beginning, increase the page size, and go back to the definition page. A Quick Start Guide can be used to walk through the glossary?s interactive features.</p>\n<p>Research into use and effectiveness of the glossaries was conducted at a range of informal science venues. Data were collected using observation and post-use interviews and surveys. Findings provided information about: 1) How do visitor groups that include members who are deaf of hard of hearing integrate and use handheld signing glossaries during visits? 2) What kinds of learning outcomes are made possible with use of the glossaries? With regard to Question 1, we found that members of all family groups used the glossary in ways that met their individual needs to look up terms related to the exhibits they were visiting. Some used them to learn new signs. Others used them to find out about what they were observing or doing. They also used them to talk about what they had noticed. Visitors in all of the groups agreed that the glossaries added tremendous value to the visitor experience. Individuals and entire families found them helpful, fun and easy to use.</p>\n<p>With regard to Question 2, we organized our results around impact categories from the Framework for Evaluating Impacts of Informal Science Education Projects. For the first category?Awareness, Knowledge, or Understanding?children at multiple venues used the glossary to help them observe animals and plants, looking up names and structures as they went. For the second Framework category?Engagement?all the parents told the researcher that their children were more engaged in looking at the exhibits than had been the case during past visits to similar venues. The parents attribute this to their children being able to look up information about what they were seeing. For the third Framework category?Skills?children and parents alike told the researcher that they had learned new signs from using the glossary.</p>\n<p>These words from a parent provide insight into the positive impact of the signing glossaries and point to a tool that will live on well beyond the end of the project. ?We were most impressed at the versatility of the signing glossaries in navigating various types of museums. [Our daughter] loves visiting these museums, but we often avoided them because we were unsure what value they?d have without the rich explanations we were able to give to our boys, who are both hearing. The glossaries enriched not only her experience but ours as well, helping us to feel more connected to her during these visits. Sometimes as a hearing parent of a child who is deaf, you can feel inadequate or ill equipped to provide your child the best educational support?especially in the areas of science and math. Our experiences have all been positive, regardless of the type of museum we are visiting.?</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 09/12/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Judy&nbsp;Vesel</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1602284/1602284_10462105_1566308837659_TermAccessIcons--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1602284/1602284_10462105_1566308837659_TermAccessIcons--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Signing Glossary Home Page\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1602284/1602284_10462105_1566308837659_TermAccessIcons--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Signing Glossary Home Page\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">This image provides an example of the icons that can be used to access terms.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">TERC, Inc.</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Judy&nbsp;Vesel</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Signing Glossary Home Page</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1602284/1602284_10462105_1566309022951_DefinitionPage--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1602284/1602284_10462105_1566309022951_DefinitionPage--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Signing Glossary Definition Page\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1602284/1602284_10462105_1566309022951_DefinitionPage--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Signing Glossary Definition Page\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">This image provides an example of the definition page for a selected term.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">TERC, Inc.</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Judy&nbsp;Vesel</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Signing Glossary Definition Page</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1602284/1602284_10462105_1566309243586_IllustrationPage--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1602284/1602284_10462105_1566309243586_IllustrationPage--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Signing Glossary Illustration Page\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1602284/1602284_10462105_1566309243586_IllustrationPage--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Signing Glossary Illustration Page\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The image provides an example of the illustration for the selected term.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">TERC, Inc.</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Judy&nbsp;Vesel</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Signing Glossary Illustration Page</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1602284/1602284_10462105_1566309352685_SigningPage--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1602284/1602284_10462105_1566309352685_SigningPage--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Signing Glossary Signing Page\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1602284/1602284_10462105_1566309352685_SigningPage--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Signing Glossary Signing Page\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The image provides an example of an avatar character signing the selected term.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">TERC, Inc.</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Judy&nbsp;Vesel</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Signing Glossary Signing Page</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
