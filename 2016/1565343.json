 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the big challenges faced in the Internet today is the ever growing complexity associated with the increasingly diverse usage models and growing user expectations about quality of service.  The core technology used in the Internet, IPv4 and BGP, is based on technology developed in the 1970's and early 1980's, when the focus of the Internet was providing connectivity between unsophisticated edge networks and applications.  In contrast, today's users and service providers want high Quality of Experience, e.g., smooth HD video, responsive e-commerce stores, interactive social networks, etc. Addressing these challenges is hard because both IP and BGP have proven to be very rigid and hard to modify.  While there has been much research on clean slate proposals for the Internet data plane, research in the control plane has mostly focused on specific protocols. This project fills this void by using a holistic approach to the design of the Internet control plane that can adapt to efficiently meet the growing demands placed on the Internet.\r\n\r\nBased on our experience with the XIA future Internet architecture project, we define three separate but related requirements. First, control protocols must be evolvable so they can adapt to future emerging requirements.  Second Internet routing protocols must be resource aware. Finally, the Internet control plane must support coordination with the control planes of increasingly sophisticated edge networks such as content delivery networks (CDNs) and cloud infrastructure.  The project has a broad research agenda that includes research in protocol support for evolvability and resource-awareness in the Internet, the definition of interfaces and techniques for coordination across edge and transit domains, and a control plane architecture that provides support for common control protocol functions such as discovery and control communication.  This research uses several real-world drivers including traffic engineering, cloud computing and a large-scale distributed denial of service (DDoS) defense service.  Finally, the project will includes an end-to-end experimental evaluation effort using large-scale testbeds such CloudLab, GENI, and PEERING.\r\n\r\nIntellectual merit: The main intellectual merit of the project is that it addresses three fundamental challenges in for Internet control protocols (evolvability, resource-awareness, and interfaces for coordination across heterogeneous control planes) in an integrated fashion. The results in these three areas will be integrated in a novel control plane architecture for the Internet.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact: The project will also have significant broader impact.  First, tools to run large scale networking experiments across testbeds such as Cloudlab, GENI and PEERING will be made available to the research community. Second, the project will engage undergrad and MS students in the project and integrate results in courses at CMU and UW-Madison, and will organize a DIMACS workshop to engage the community in discussion on the important topic of control plane design for the future Internet.  Finally, the holistic approach to rethinking the network control plane can have tremendous impact on the networking research community and industry.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOne of the big challenges facing the Internet is the rapid evolution of both the technologies and services that are being deployed, in addition to an increase in user expectations with respect to quality of experience.  The reason is that core data and control protocols, such as IP and BGP, were developed in the 70?s and 80?s and evolving these protocols is challenging since they need to interoperate across the entire Internet.  In addition, optimizing quality of experience requires information about resource availability, which was not considered in the design of the core Internet protocols.\n\nTo meet the rapidly evolution in the Internet infrastructure, services, and user expectation, we identified three requirements for the Internet control plane: First, control protocols must be evolvable so they can adapt to future emerging requirements. Second Internet routing protocols must be resource aware. Finally, the Internet control plane must support coordination with the control planes of increasingly sophisticated edge networks such as CDNs and cloud infrastructures, which is critical for optimizing the quality of service delivered to users.\n\nWe considered the issue of evolvability in three separate projects.  First, we developed techniques that allow the co-existence of multiple routing protocols in the Internet. We also develop tools to verify the correctness of control plane, which is important when control protocols are updated more rapidly.  Finally, we developed a tool that allows us to analyze the interactions of diverse congestion control protocols which have become increasingly diverse.\n\nWe also explored different ways of supporting resource awareness.  A first solution uses resource brokers to establish fixed-bandwidth pipes between content-providers and stub-networks, allowing content providers to coordinate resource allocation in their data centers and across the Internet.  We develop ``data-driven?? networking techniques that use continuous measurements to inform service providers about available network resources.  Finally, developed efficient sketch-based algorithms that collect diverse traffic statistics that can be used by various control planes to optimize resource allocation.\n\nFinally, we explored the issue of coordination across control planes in a several contexts since the solutions depend on the type of resources involved and the application domain.  For example, a challenge in many domain is that resource allocation decisions made by one control plane can impact other control planes both in terms the decision they make and the outcomes.  We developed techniques to explicitly coordinate, e.g., by using a broker for video in an internet context, or by explicit notification messages in hybrid optical-electrical data center networks.  Another approach  is to allow one control plane to delegate control of a set of its resource to another control plane, effectively isolating the decisions made by the two control planes.  We also developed solutions for wireless access networks.  Examples include access point selection, which depends on the service quality different operators can provide, and computational offloading techniques that must adapt to the available bandwidth on the access link.  Finally we studied how to safely delegate control of network functions to a Managed Service Provider (MSP) based on the least privilege principle.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/02/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Peter A Steenkiste"
