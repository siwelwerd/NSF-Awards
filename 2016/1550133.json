 "awd_abstract_narration": "Much attention is focused on the main strands of major strike-slip faults, such as the San Andreas Fault in California, for their potential to generate large devastating earthquakes. However, non-strike slip motion associated with these large faults is often accommodated on secondary faults, which may also be the source of large earthquakes as demonstrated in the 2010 Haiti earthquake. The tectonic conditions that cause slip along these secondary faults are not fully understood. This project uses a combination of physical and computer modeling experiments to better understand why slip takes place on these secondary faults rather than the main fault. The proposed research advances desired societal outcomes through: (1) full participation of women and persons with disabilities in STEM through support of a hearing-impaired female PI and a female graduate student; (2) continued mentoring of deaf and hearing-impaired students; (3) improved STEM education through posting of animations from analog experiments on YouTube and web cam broadcast of experiments Google+ Hangouts transmissions; (4) development of a globally competitive STEM workforce through graduate student training; and (5) a better understanding of earthquake hazards along fault systems such as the San Andreas Fault.\r\n\r\nThis project uses physical and numerical experiments to investigate slip partitioning along strike-slip systems within two types of settings, oblique plate motion and restraining bends. Both of these settings are observed to have slip partitioned faults with strike-slip along vertical fault strands and oblique slip along dipping fault strands, but the loading differs between the models. The physical experiments will test the conditions under which strike-slip faults develop outward verging secondary faults. The experiments explore the controls on and thresholds for slip partitioning and will quantify the nature of slip partitioning within these systems. The analog models utilize wet kaolin to simulate a range of oblique strike-slip boundary conditions that explore the conditions for secondary contractional fault development. The physical experiments data include measurements of the evolving horizontal displacement field using digital image correlation, changes in uplift patterns using stereo imaging, measurements of dilational stress using pressure transducers and estimates of relative water flux along faults using an infrared camera. The data from the analog experiments will be used to track the evolution of kinematic efficiency to test if slip partitioned systems accommodate oblique convergence more efficiently than non-partitioned systems. Numerical simulations of the experiments will assess the work budget of the slip partitioned systems and test if the fault systems evolve to minimize work. 3D numerical simulations of the various experimental setups will provide complete stress and strain fields that facilitate calculation of the complete work budget within the system. This will provide insights, for example, on the tradeoffs between work against gravity and internal deformation as the fault system evolves. The combined physical and numerical investigations in this proposed study will provide a critical bridge between theories of slip partitioning under oblique strike-slip and geologic and experimental observations.",
