 "awd_abstract_narration": "An increasing interest and a strong need exist for technologies that enable highly scalable manufacturing of high-quality, large-area, low-cost substrates for manufacturing semiconductor films to meet the growing markets in a range of applications such as power electronics, optoelectronics, and energy harvesting with benefits of high performance and economies of scale. Examples include substrates to improve overall cost-performance of power transistors that handle a large amount of electrical power, of light-emitting-diodes that replace incandescent and fluorescent light bulbs, and, of solar cells that are affordable yet have exceptional performance. Despite the progress made at various levels for decades, a versatile manufacturing technology that meets a wide range of requirements for such substrates is still lacking. This project will pave the way for future deployment of a substrate manufacturing technology by utilizing materials with microstructures controlled through nanomanufacturing approaches. This research involves multiple disciplines of science and engineering including inorganic film synthesis, semiconductor film deposition, and material characterization. These disciplines will be integrated into curriculum development to provide hands-on research opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students at the home institution and at other local educational institutions that foster a large number of minority and economically disadvantaged students.\r\n\r\nPioneering demonstrations continuously emerge in search of innovative approaches for heteroepitaxy of semiconductor films, which may offer a practical path for heterogeneous integration of dissimilar semiconductors in the future. The concept of employing a buffer layer inserted between a substrate and a film has been established as the most engaging approach from both technological and scientific standpoints. However, it relies upon the availability of single-crystal semiconductor substrates with physical properties not vastly different from those of films to be grown. This project aims at demonstrating a new perception of growing a single-crystal semiconductor film on a non-single-crystal arbitrary substrate using a single-crystal epitaxial template. The key lies in the single-crystal epitaxial template on which crystallographic registry is provided for the subsequent growth of a semiconductor film regardless of the properties of the underlying non-single-crystal arbitrary substrate. Two critical issues to be addressed are the formation of engineered-nanometer-surface structures that promote the formation of a single-crystal epitaxial template and the subsequent growth of a semiconductor film on the template, which provides an opportunity to acquire new knowledge in kinetics and thermodynamics governing the formation of a single-crystal epitaxial template on engineered nanometer surface structures and growth mechanisms of group III-V compound semiconductor films on the template.",

The proposed project aimed at demonstrating a new perception of growing sing-crystal semiconductor thin films on non-single-crystal arbitrary substrates using a single-crystal epitaxial template layer. The epitaxial template layer was made of aluminum oxide (AlOx) prepared by atomic layer deposition (ALD) on copper surfaces (i.e., non-single-crystal arbitrary substrates) on which engineered nanometer structures were produced by sputtering (SPU) deposition. Metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) was used to grow indium phosphide (InP) &ndash; one of the important of class of semiconductors &ndash; on the epitaxial template layer. Since AlOx formed by ALD routinely develops as amorphous on planar surfaces, months 1-24 of the project focused on understanding dynamics of our ALD processes of AlOx on surfaces with engineered nanometer structures that were expected to promote the crystallization of AlOx. We successfully showed that the critical thickness of AlOx for being crystallized was ~5 nm below or above which AlOx remained amorphous as seen in Fig. 1. The 5 nm ALD AlOx profile appeared to contain both alpha-phase and gamma-phase AlOx, having met the first milestone of the project and having extended our understanding of the distinctive characteristics of a unique case of crystallization of AlOx prepared by ALD &ndash; new knowledge of kinetics and thermodynamics governing the crystallization of AlOx when deposited by on surfaces with nanometer structures was obtained <strong>(<em>Intellectual Merit</em>)</strong>. The second half, months 25-36 of the project focused on developing MOCVD processes of InP on the crystallized AlOx template layer. Multiple MOCVD growth runs were performed to grow InP films. The reason for InP, instead of GaAs originally planned in the project, being used as a vehicle was simply that trimethylindium (TMIn) and tertiary-butylphospnie (TBP) were already installed on the MOCVD system allocated for the project and the gas handling system had only one extra station available for another precursor. Given the limited resources on both fund and the MOCVD system, we thought that using the existing TMIn and TBP to grow InP was the best course of action for the project rather than reconfiguring the MOCVD system for the growth of GaAs. The growth of InP was carried on the crystallized AlOx template layer. Multiple MOCVD growth runs were designed with the intention to vary a wide range of key growth parameters (e.g., growth conditions for a low-temperature buffer layers, growth temperatures, group V/III molar flow rate ratio, growth pressure) as well as the used of plasma assisted. All growth runs resulted in the formation of isolated InP domains as seen in a representative plan-view image collected by scanning electron microscope in Fig. 2, indicating that the nucleation of InP on the AlOx template proceeded rather non-uniformly and/or the aggregation of InP nuclei dominated and the formation of isolated InP domains was promoted over the formation of a continuous layer. The unsatisfactory outcomes of the MOCVD growth left us two choices: optimizing the MOCVD growth and optimizing the AlO<sub>x</sub> template at the end of the 36<sup>th</sup> month. While we plan to tackle the former by having our collaborators with a capability of MOCVD try our AlOx template layer <strong><em>(Broader Impact)</em></strong>, we, given the fact that the project approached the end, decided to pursue the latter by building a hybrid system &ndash; sputtering atomic layer augmented deposition (SALAD) &ndash; to prepare the AlOx template as we discovered that the surface morphology of copper prepared by SPU deposition adversely evolved even at room temperature before the deposition of an AlO&shy;<sub>x </sub>layer by ALD, strongly suggesting that the copper surface prepared by sputtering deposition needed to be covered by an AlO&shy;<sub>x </sub>layer by ALD immediately and ideally without breaking vacuum. SPU and ALD &ndash; two prevalent technologies for depositing thin films &ndash; exhibit various shortcomings. While SPU lacks accurate and precise control on delivering a small amount of a chemical element, ALD lacks explicit tunability of chemical composition. The project allowed us to conceive the concept of SALAD and build a prototype of SALAD to suppress undesirable evolution of copper surface prior to the deposition of AlOx, which would benefit industries and research communities currently limited to either SPU or ALD (<strong><em>Broader Impact</em></strong>).
