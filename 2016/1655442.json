 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project addresses a new set of problems that will increasingly\r\narise with a gradual shift to massively open online courses and\r\nlarge classes where new assessments to test active learning of the\r\nconcepts are costly to design. The context of the project is a\r\nprototype cloud-based quiz management system that leads the online\r\nlearners through scaffolded activities, such as creating,\r\nanswering, and improving of student-sourced quiz items. The system\r\nthen automatically evaluates the competence of learners and the\r\nquality of questions from outcomes of these activities. This\r\nproject addresses the key algorithmic issue in such systems of\r\nefficiently determining the quality of the students and the\r\nsubmitted items. Preliminary ideas for new algorithms will be\r\ndeveloped and deployed in the test system to understand their\r\nadvantages and shortcomings. The development and testing of\r\nalgorithms will provide opportunities for training two graduate\r\nstudents. This will also lead to a refinement of the eventual\r\nalgorithmic design of a system for scalable online assessments with\r\nsignificant societal impacts.\r\n\r\nIn particular, the project develops new algorithmic frameworks for\r\nproblems in the joint ranking of students and student-sourced quiz\r\nquestions based on feedback in the form of peer performance and\r\nreview. A key contribution is the formulation of these problems in\r\nterms of abstract problems amenable to both combinatorial and\r\ncontinuous optimization, which in turn allows a completely\r\nunrelated subfield of people (those of optimization) to work on\r\nthese problems in the future. At the same time, the project will\r\nundertake the groundwork of developing the first such algorithms\r\nthat solve these problems with current approaches.",
