 "awd_abstract_narration": "This REU Site award to the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign located in Urbana, IL, and Parkland College, located in Champaign, IL, will support the training of 10 students for 10 weeks during the summers of 2017-2019. Participants will conduct research in the area of phenotypic plasticity, the phenomenon of a single genotype producing multiple phenotypes depending on environment. The program will begin with a two-week \"boot-camp\" on topics ranging from specific laboratory methods to discussions of research ethics. Students will then join a research immersion program within a research lab at the University of Illinois. Possible research projects include the interaction between genotype and ozone pollution on maize growth, the effect of environmental stress on neuroanatomy, and the interactions of genes and environment on fish behavior. Students will present their research at an undergraduate research symposium on the University of Illinois campus as well as their community college. Applications will be accepted beginning in December preceding the summer program and final decisions on admittance made by March 31st. \r\n\r\nIt is anticipated that a total of 30 students over three years will be trained in the program. This REU Site will focus on students from community colleges, which typically have very few research opportunities. Community colleges often have a large percentage of underrepresented groups and this REU Site will encourage applications from these groups. Students will learn how research is conducted, and many will present the results of their work at scientific conferences.\r\n\r\nA common web-based assessment tool used by all REU programs funded by the Division of Biological Infrastructure (Directorate for Biological Sciences) will be used to determine the effectiveness of the training program. Students will be tracked after the program in order to determine their career paths. Students will be asked to respond to an automatic email sent via the NSF reporting system. More information about the program is available by visiting http://dev2.igb.illinois.edu/reu-plasticity/, or by contacting the PI (Dr. Nathan Schroeder at nes@illinois.edu) or the co-PI (Dr. C. Britt Carlson at ccarlson@parkland.edu).",

The participants were recruited from community colleges across the U.S. and included 11 students from underrepresented groups, 15 1<sup>st</sup> generation college students, and 2 U.S. military veterans. Participants began the program at a research boot camp at Parkland where they developed both technical and soft skills necessary for completing research, including discussions on scientific communication and research ethics. Following the boot camp, participants joined research labs at the University of Illinois and conducted research in the area of phenotypic plasticity. Research mentors (graduate students and postdoctoral associates) participated in a mentor-training workshop. Examples of research projects included studying the effect of environmental stress on neuron morphology and the impact of increased ozone levels on agricultural production. Following the completion of their research projects, participants presented their research findings at a multi-institutional research symposium. In addition to the completion and presentation of their research, participants took part in several learning sessions on transferring from a community college and options for graduate school. Participants in 2018 and 2019 conducted a scientific outreach event for children at a local farmers market. They also interacted in social and professional activities with participants from other REU programs. While one participant returned to the U.S. military, all others are either completing their associates degree or have already transferred to a four-year institution. Two of the participants from 2017 have enrolled in graduate programs and several others are in the process of applying to graduate programs.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>More information can be found at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://precs.igb.illinois.edu/\">https://precs.igb.illinois.edu/</a>&nbsp;.
