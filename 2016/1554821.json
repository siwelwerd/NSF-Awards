 "awd_abstract_narration": "New technologies in many scientific sectors have led to data sets of increasing complexity and size, where the ability to measure and store these vast troves of data has far outpaced the ability to analyze the data to make reproducible scientific discoveries. Examples include genomics and proteomics, neuroimaging, and neural recordings data. Analyzing this big biomedical data is critical to discovering disease biomarkers, making advances in personalized medicine, and understanding the basic workings of complex biological systems. In this work, we seek to develop and study novel statistical learning and multivariate analysis techniques that directly address unresolved problems critical for making discoveries from big scientific data.  Additionally, we will use statistical learning techniques to improve introductory statistics education by developing an online personalized learning system for assignment and content delivery.  \r\n\r\nMore specifically, this work will focus on using algorithms for large-scale sparse optimization to inspire and develop a new framework for statistical learning that will prove to have superior empirical and theoretical performance for high-dimensional and highly correlated data.  Such data is common in genomics and neuroimaging; the new techniques will be used to identify potential genomic drug targets, to model genetic and brain networks, and for brain decoding from neuroimaging and neural recordings data. We will also use Kronecker product covariances to develop new multivariate analysis models for coupled matrix and tensor data.  These techniques will be used to find joint patterns in integrative genomics data and find patterns of brain activity indicative of behavioral or clinical covariates.  Overall, this work will develop several critically needed statistical techniques to understand large and complex data, have direct impacts in genomics and brain science where the techniques will be applied in collaboration with scientists, and lead to improvements in introductory statistics education.

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n \n\nEnormous amounts of data are now collected in nearly every scientific discipline.  Uncovering the hidden secrets and making new discoveries from this massive data holds the key to critical scientific and societal challenges.  But as the size and complexity of data grows, we need new specialized statistical and machine learning tools.  In this project, we developed several new statistical machine learning approaches to make discoveries from large, complex and messy scientific data.  As an example, in \"omics\" data, scientists now routinely collect multiple types of genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics data on the same set of subjects.  There are a plethora of techniques to analyze each data type separately, but the key to discovering potential causes and therapies to complex diseases is likely found by putting all of the available data together.  We developed new techniques to allow scientists to integrate huge multi-omics data sets to discover patterns, find groups of subjects with similar omics profiles, and discover key omics relationships that may be disrupted in diseases.  We worked with scientists to apply these techniques to study the genomic basis of clinical heterogeneity in Alzheimer's Disease.  Beyond approaches for data integration, we developed a suite of techniques to speed up computational algorithms used to make scientific discoveries while also maintaining high statistical accuracy.  \n\nOn the educational side, it is critically important to train the next generation of data scientists who can work on big interdisciplinary teams to tackle some of science and society's greatest challenges.  To this end, we founded a new data science center at Rice University and helped to launch new degree programs in data science.  To provide students with real-world experiences working with others to tackle major data science challenges, we developed a novel data science and machine learning capstone program.  Here, interdisciplinary groups of students work together with partners from industry, non-profits and community organizations, healthcare, or other researchers to tackle real-world challenges.  Through this unique type of experiential learning, students gain an understanding of how to work on teams and how to develop and deploy a data science pipeline appropriate for complex, long-term data science projects.  To date, over 100 student teams completed a data science capstone project through this program, directly making an impact in diverse fields such as fintech, biotech, education, medicine, environmental science, operations research, engineering, and beyond.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/28/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Genevera Allen"
