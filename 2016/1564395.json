 "awd_abstract_narration": "The explosive growth in the use of computer simulators in the last fifteen years has helped galvanize a revolution in scientific, engineering, and biological research that includes advances in the aerospace industry, material science, renewable energy, and biomechanics. Researchers can make a detailed exploration of scientific design alternatives under a wide set of operating environments using runs from a simulator of a physical system, possibly coupled with those from a traditional physical system experiment. This research project will advance the statistical modeling, design, and analysis of experiments that use computer simulators. The first research area is Improved Modeling of Simulator Output: The investigators will develop flexible stochastic models that will allow more accurate prediction in settings where the simulator provides related multivariate output of the performance of a physical system. Current prediction models either assume output independence (knowledge of one output gives no information about other outputs) or a linear dependence on a common set of latent drivers. The second research area concerns Advances in Emulation: The investigators aim to devise efficient emulators of simulator output for novel input and output settings such as when gradient information is available or when the output consists of both point and integrated measures. They plan to construct predictors that incorporate natural invariances present in the simulator output. For example, the predicted response should be constant under permutations of the inputs when the output satisfies this condition; the project will quantify the uncertainty in the invariant predictors. The investigators also plan to quantify the uncertainty of a recent, theoretically-justified method of calibrating computer simulators based on physical experimental data. The third research area is the Design of Simulator Experiments: Efficient designs of simulator experiments will be devised to minimize the computational effort required to determine the sensitivity of a simulator output to each of its inputs. \r\n\r\nThis research will build a statistical framework for the modeling, design and analysis of experiments that employ computer simulators. The specific goals are (1) to devise flexible interpolating stochastic models for computer simulators with multivariate output; (2) to invent efficient predictors for novel input and output settings such as when gradient information is available or when the output consists of both point and integrated responses; (3) to develop emulators of simulator output that incorporate the same invariances present in the simulator responses; (4) to quantify the uncertainty of L2 calibrated predictors for expensive computer codes; and (5) to construct new sliced Latin hypercube designs to allow the efficient calculation of global sensitivity indices. The investigators will develop new modes for training statistics graduate students having interests in engineering applications. Opportunities will be created for subject matter specialists to provide critical practical challenges in three areas: aerospace/mechanical engineering, biomechanics, and material science, and to conduct joint applied projects with the researchers.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "This project has developed statistical methodology for analyzing generic computer simulator output and applied such models to perform Interdisciplinary Biomechanics research.  One model development  research thread develops flexible stochastic process models for  computer simulator output of a physical system that can produce stationary or non-stationary \"looking\" output.  These models have been applied for interpolation, extrapolation, bias estimation, and sensitivity analysis of the computer simulator output.  One example of this model development thread is Davis, Hans, and Santner (Computational Statistics and Data Analysis, 2021)  who introduce a flexible Bayesian composite Gaussian Process (BCGP) model.  Another example of such inference methodology is Horiguchi,  Pratola, and  Santner (Reliability Engineering and System Safety, 2021) who develop exact formulas for Sobol\u2019 global sensitivity indices for Bayesian Adaptive Regression Tree (BART) predictors; it compares the Sobol\u2019 indices with count-based sensitivity indices commonly used in the BART literature.  In a related inference project,  Horiguchi, Santner, Sun, and Pratola propose methodology for multi-objective optimization using BART predictors (Technometrics, Industry 4.0, 2021).  A third modeling/application effort is Bachoc,  Barthe,  Santner, and Richet (Nuclear Engineering and Design, 2021) who devised a sequential design for optimizing a computer simulator model for measuring the volatility of a spent nuclear fuel rod over an empirically determined non-rectangular input region. This is important because high volatility in a depleted nuclear rod can result in an accidental nuclear explosions.  Another interdisciplinary project using process modeling of simulator and laboratory data is to determine the effect of several types of partial meniscectomy surgeries on the stresses transmitted to the tibial cartilage compared with the stresses seen in the tibial cartilage of intact menisci.  A partial meniscectomy removes part of a damaged meniscus tissue.  Finite element (FE) modeling of the knee joint has been used to provide a computational simulator of stress (and related) data while laboratory cadaver data provide the information used for calibration of the simulator.  A podium presentation of this research will be given in February at the 2023 Meeting of the Orthopedic Research Society.  A working paper on this topic is being prepared.  A final interdisciplinary research area we mention is to quantify the functioning and stresses experienced by the Anterior Cruciate and other ligaments in the normal knee under dynamic loading.  The ultimate goal it to determine the optimal surgical tensioning when repaired torn ligaments; arguably the most important such repair is of a torn Anterior Cruciate ligament.  Statistically, the essence of this application that of calibrating a simulator of a functionally loaded specific ligament to cadaver data.  A multi-body model has been developed as the basis for a simulator of the loaded knee.  A clinical exam that is highly specific to ACL injury was used to determine the dynamic loading pattern; the load included  anterior tibial translation followed by tibial translation.  The cadavers used to develop the multiple-body model were put through the same load in a laboratory experiment.  The research is reported in a manuscript jointly authored by Razu, Jahandar, Zhu, Berube, Santner and Imhauser (submitted to the Journal of Biomechanical Engineering).\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/02/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Thomas J Santner"
