This is the leading conference in storage systems and includes interested participants from across academia and industry.  This award is to support students to showcase and discuss their research. Particular interest will be given to broadening participation and supporting students who would otherwise be unable to attend the conference. Special emphasis will be made to sponsor students having no other means of support from their academic departments. \r\n\r\nIn addition to meeting leading practitioners of storage systems, attending regular program sessions, this year students will also students receiving assistance will be asked to participate in various ways, including: serving as scribes for the conference sessions to write summaries for a later issue of ;login: magazine. A special event is planned for students to meet informally with senior members of the community.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merits. This conference is the premier forum for advanced professionals from academic and industrial backgrounds to meet and discuss the latest research in systems software.  \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts. Participation in USENIX 2016 provides students with the opportunity to interact with senior researchers in the field, exposes students to cutting edge advances, and is a valuable and important part of the graduate school experience.",
