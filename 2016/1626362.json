 "awd_abstract_narration": "Well designed, laboratory experiences can make engineering concepts come to life, giving students a real-world confirmation of concepts and theory from lectures. However, students rarely have enough time in traditional labs to complete the tasks assigned along with pre- and post-lab exercises. Mobile hands-on learning would remove these restrictions and allow students to do experiments in their own time at any location with the help of web-based resources. The goal of this project is to develop portable hands-on engineering lab experiments for use by students outside of traditional engineering laboratories in classrooms or dorm rooms. Based on previous experiences in electrical and computer engineering, the PIs plan to deploy the portable labs across the curricula in mechanical and aerospace engineering.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of the project is to develop and validate low-cost, highly-flexible, mobile, hands-on experimental platforms in mechanical and aerospace engineering. Technological innovations that enable this paradigm shift in lab instruction include new data acquisition devices, powerful micro-controllers and low cost sensors. The portable hands-on experimental modules to be developed will feature moving parts, fluidic and thermal components that are typically found in mechanical and aerospace engineering systems. It is expected that a new pedagogical model that promotes a more complete integration of theory and practice will be created, one that will open new avenues for inquiry-based learning. Several research questions will be addressed pertaining to the impact of the new modules on student learning, student interest, and on long-term retention of knowledge. Specific studies will be done to examine the impact of the developed modules on students from underrepresented groups and to seek instructor intervention methods that improve that impact. The role of online discussion forums as a support mechanism for mobile hands-on learning will also be examined.  The broader impact of this project includes giving students the ability to perform experiments at their own pace anywhere/anytime while providing educators with innovative and flexible educational technology. Partnering with Georgia Tech are Howard University, Southern Polytechnic State University, National Instruments, Piazza, and Texas Instruments all of whom will work to ensure the validity of the methods developed and ensure their dissemination to a broad audience.",

This project aimed to amplify such hands-on experiences by developing new mobile experimental platforms in mechanics, thermal systems, and electrical/electronic systems for use in core and multidisciplinary courses.&nbsp; The project was also concerned with effective instruction and classroom practices to ensure that diverse student teams function well, with all students feeling comfortable and confident to work together to learn new concepts.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Early accomplishments of this research project were built off successes at Georgia Tech in hands-on learning platforms used in the areas of electric circuits and electronics.

The platform can support a wide range of activities such as prescribing loads using weight sets or prescribing displacements using calibrated thumbscrews. Basic experiments involved measuring bending strains in solid section beams, while more advanced experiments involved measuring the cross-section shear-center in thin-walled beams and measuring the cross-axis deflection ratio in thin-wall beams with unsymmetrical sections.
