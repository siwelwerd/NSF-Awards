 "awd_abstract_narration": "Caries and gum disease are especially prevalent and severe in low-income and rural communities, which often lack access to convenient and affordable dental care. Members of these communities are more likely to visit hospital emergency departments with advanced stages of oral disease that need surgical treatment; this increases the cost of dental care for families and burdens hospital resources. Tooth decay is the most common chronic disease in American children and adolescents age 6-19 despite being a preventable disease. In 2010, untreated tooth decay, or caries, affected 2.4 billion people worldwide. Early childhood caries leads to pain, infection, and discomfort. And in adults, chronic oral infections may increase the risk of preterm birth and diseases like diabetes and atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries). This project will develop a hand-held electric-toothbrush-like device with a user-friendly interface that can be used in the home or by community health workers in schools or rural clinics. The wand, which uses a safe optical scanning method, will send data and images to a dentist, who will be able to monitor how well dental treatments are working. The data and images collected by the device can be analyzed to discover where plaque and bacteria are present, providing a way to predict, and then prevent, disease. The wand will be able to prompt the user to address problem areas. This system, which will connect remote users to a dental provider, has the potential to improve the prevention and treatment of oral disease and the quality of life for people who do not have convenient access to regular, in-person dental care. \r\n\r\nTo enable this vision, this project will develop a smart system that offers screening, surveillance, and prediction for people to improve their oral health and prevent disease. A mature technology of laser-based imaging that is spatially registered with fluorescence spectral analysis will be used to study the complexities of the oral biofilm and dental demineralization. The bacterial measurement is performed with a hand-held single wavelength optical scanning probe that forms images from both reflectance and fluorescence contrast, with the option of taking laser-induced fluorescence spectra for diagnosis of enamel demineralization. To provide a smart interface, the optical information will be analyzed to identify trends, a new modality for the dental field. With analyses of the fluorescence signal from the plaque deposits displayed as a trend, the user, in collaboration with clinician, can monitor variations in oral health and the effectiveness of treatments. The research team will use an iterative process to develop, design, evaluate, and refine the tool. The tool will be tested for three scenarios: (1) a plaque- and caries-screening program for a trained lay user on an untrained \"patient\" (e.g., parent for a child, school nurse for pupils, pediatrician for young children, or staff at a remote rural clinic for patients); (2) a caries surveillance program for trained lay users electronically connected to a dentist who can guide the use of the tool; and (3) a caries prediction program, initially for clinical users. \r\n\r\nThis project brings together a multidisciplinary team from the University of Washington (UW), in Seattle, Washington, with expertise in human centered design, engineering, sensing and machine learning, oral biology, and dentistry: Eric J. Seibel (Principal Investigator, PI), Mechanical Engineering; Sean Munson (co-PI), Human Centered Design & Engineering; Shwetak Patel, Computer Science & Engineering; Zheng Xu, DDS, School of Dentistry, Pediatric Dentistry; Jeff McLean, School of Dentistry, Periodontics. Lead industry partner Water Pik, Inc. (Fort Collins, CO), brings experience and knowledge about building, marketing, and distributing advanced dental devices to consumers: Deborah Lyle, Director of Professional & Clinical Affairs, and Jay McCulloch, Vice President, Global Marketing, Oral Care. Broader context partners are UW CoMotion (Seattle, WA), a technology transfer partner; QualComm Tech, Inc. (San Diego, CA), a wireless technology leader; Open Photonics, Inc. (Winter Park, FL), a business partner; and the Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium (Anchorage, AK), a non-profit community partner interested in the development of an optical diagnosis device for use with its rural beneficiaries.\r\n\r\nThis award is partially supported by funds from the Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE), Division of Computer and Network Systems (CNS).",

The bacterial infection comes from the oral biofilm that covers the exposed hard surfaces of the teeth (enamel), which is commonly referred to as dental plaque. A mature biofilm is one that has not been disturbed for many months from dental clinic cleaning, brushing &amp; flossing, or eating hard fibrous foods. Mature biofilms develop a microenvironment that can maintain acidic conditions at the enamel surface even though the saliva production is normal. &nbsp;When fed by sugars, bacteria in the biofilm rapidly produces more acid that demineralizes the enamel which weakens the protective covering of teeth and can lead to cavities. A deep cavity in the enamel cannot be repaired without surgery which is drilling and filling the cavity. Billions of people are affected by chronic caries or tooth decay. Because there is no accurate measurement that predicts if tooth decay will occur at a specific location, there are no conventional means for managing this chronic disease. For most other common chronic diseases such as atherosclerosis, high blood pressure, diabetes, and cancers, the highest risk patients are identified by measuring leading indicators of disease and managing these indicators so that surgery is held for the last resort of treatment. Currently, tooth decay does not have a leading indicator for site-specific tooth decay that can be easily measured and tracked over time.</p>\n<p>The goals of this research project are to provide the dentist, hygienist, and possibly the parents of children at highest risk of tooth decay the means to quantitatively measure the enamel health. This project identified and created such an early warning measurement which could be the foundation for future non-surgical management of tooth decay. By safely measuring the biofilm acid production that covers the enamel over time using small cameras, dentists can better predict the locations of future tooth decay. This gives the dentist time to manage the acid production for each individual patient, possibly enlisting the patient to treat these high risk locations at home with a prescription and instructions. This new management process is much like a physician who gives her patient a prescription and instructions for healing an infection, such as a sinus or bladder infection. Thus, the surgery of drilling and filling teeth can be avoided in many cases. Interventions at an early stage would be medicinal treatments such as prescription-level fluoride applied to the highest risk location(s) in the mouth. For children, this may be a mobile phone app that the caregiver uses to locate the exact site and instructions on how to apply the treatments according to the schedule prescribed by the dentist.</p>\n<p>To enable this new method of preventing tooth decay, the measurement of oral biofilm acidity was made optically after applying a low concentration of a fluorescence dye (fluorescein) that has been used in children for diagnosing diseases for many decades. Since the oral biofilm acidity was measured optically on the pH scale, we call this new method O-pH (see Figures 1 &amp; 2). In preliminary studies with our multiple prototype instruments, we have found that the O-pH method of measuring oral biofilm pH can be a leading indicator of tooth decay, identifying locations that have the greatest acid production. Once the location that is high risk for a cavity is found, then medicinal treatments can be applied to help reverse the enamel demineralization process that would often lead to a cavity. We have also developed a mobile phone app which can reassure pediatric dentists that the children?s caregivers could be trusted to deliver the prescribed treatment correctly at home (Figures 3 &amp; 4). During this treatment, such as applying prescription-level fluoride to the location according to a weekly schedule, the O-pH or other optical measurements of enamel health can be made to monitor the treatment at home. We are currently working on prototype instruments that are designed for either dental office use or for at home monitoring of future medicinal treatments. &nbsp;In the future, children may be able to fight off caries disease with these new tools and keep their natural teeth intact for their entire lives.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 11/16/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Eric&nbsp;J&nbsp;Seibel</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1631146/1631146_10456359_1668648528646_Fig1_Manuja_O-pH_sensing_device--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1631146/1631146_10456359_1668648528646_Fig1_Manuja_O-pH_sensing_device--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1.
