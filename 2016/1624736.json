 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed project seeks to further develop and field a Micro-pulse DIAL (MPD) Lidar system.  This system will be used by researchers to advance our knowledge in the areas of measuring water vapor concentration and distribution, convective initiation, and land-atmosphere exchange.  This new system will potentially advance our ability to better predict weather, particularly in the area of storm development.  \r\n\r\nThe proposed major research instrumentation (MRI) project seeks to develop and make available to the science community a system of five diode-laser-based, micro-pulse, differential absorption lidar (DIAL) instruments for measuring the spatial and temporal distribution of water vapor in the lower atmosphere.  The Micro-Pulse DIAL (MPD) instruments will build on the proven design developed by the PI and Co-PI, including development of enclosures to make the system more field deployable and network attachable for remote access.  Once the testing phase is complete, the MPD research instrumentation will be made available to the science community through the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Earth Observing Laboratory (EOL) Facilities and Instrument Program.",
