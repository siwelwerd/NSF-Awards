 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigators will observe the nearby Andromeda Galaxy.  They will look for bright regions, which indicate stars are forming.  As generations of stars are born and die, they change the chemical composition of galaxies.  Gas and dust collect in spiral arms of galaxies.  This dust condenses into new stars and planets.   After a time, the stars explode, sending different elements into the space between stars.   The investigator will observe this galaxy in detail.   They will map the chemistry and energy distributions. They will use this map to measure how the birth of new stars change the shape of the galaxy. All galaxies, including our own, change through the process of star formation.  The investigator will involve undergraduate and graduates students in this research, training them for future careers in science and technology.\r\n\r\nCertain types of variable stars, RR Lyrae and Cepheids, are especially useful for measuring the age of star forming regions.  For these stars, the brightness changes over time in a way that depends on the age and chemical compositions.  These stars can then be used as probes to measure the locations of star formation at different times and in different conditions.  This project will combine the three largest sets of observations of the Andromeda Galaxy to study variable stars spanning a huge range of ages, brightness, and variability periods.  The observations of these variable stars will then be used to trace the star formation history in this galaxy.  The results of their study of the Andromeda galaxy will aid in understanding the star formation history of our own Milky Way Galaxy.\r\n\r\nThe investigator has been a part of project making repeated observations of the Andromeda Galaxy, covering time-scales from 15 minutes to as long as 11 years.  With these observations, they will discover variable stars of different types, ranging from faint RR Lyrae to bright Cepheids of all types.  With ages ranging from 10 million to 10 billion years, these different classes of variables will trace different time-scales for star formation as a function of position in the galaxy.  The chemical composition of the stars can also be inferred from the variability signatures, revealing the location of changes of the stellar chemistry.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThe Andromeda Galaxy, also known as Messier 31 or M31, is the closest major galaxy to our own Milky Way and one of the few galaxies visible to the naked eye. Variable stars of several types are known in this galaxy and have been important historically in the development of our understanding of the size of the universe and the nature of galaxies. Since the discovery of Cepheid variable stars in the Andromeda Galaxy by Edwin Hubble in the late 1920s, numerous groups have searched the galaxy for more variable stars of different types. These previous studies have concentrated on data from specific telescopes and have been limited in the depth and time range as a result.\r\n\n\nIn this project, our goal was to combine data from multiple telescopes to improve the range of variable stars known in terms of their brightness and the period on which they vary. We are focused primarily on data from three telescopes: the 1.8m Pan-STARRS 1 telescope, the 3.6m Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT), and the 8.2m Subaru Telescope. All three telescopes have very wide-field cameras. We obtained substantial new data from the Subaru telescope to complement existing Pan-STARRS and CFHT data.\r\n\n\nVariable stars can be used to accurately measure the distance to the Andromeda Galaxy, to trace the concentration of metals in the galaxy, or to trace populations of different ages. We hoped to improve the measurement of the distance to this important galaxy to enable M31 to be used as part of the cosmological distance ladder. We hoped to use Cepheid variables of different periods, which therefore also have different ages, to trace the star formation history in M31. Finally, we hoped to identify faint RR Lyrae stars to map the metal distribution in Andromeda.\r\n\n\nUnfortunately, we encountered significant difficulties in the data analysis, especially in combining the data from the three telescopes in a consistent fashion. We made improvements in our analysis process, but we were unable to achieve the measurement accuracy needed for the goals of this project given the limited resources we had available. In the end, we have made a website to publically release our data and our processing results for others to attempt similar studies. Over the years, through this project, we have trained several students and postdoctoral researchers in observing and data analysis.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/21/2025\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: EugeneMagnier\n"
