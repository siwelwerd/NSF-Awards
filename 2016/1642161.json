 "awd_abstract_narration": "Scientific research requires the free exchange of information and ideas among collaborators worldwide. For this, scientists depend critically on full and open access to the Internet. Yet in today's world, such open access also exposes sites to incessant network attacks like theft of information, parasitic resource consumption, or suffering from (or inadvertently participating in) denial-of-service (DOS) attacks. Some of the most powerful networks today remain particularly hard to defend: the 100G environments and backbones that facilitate modern data-intensive sciences - physics, astronomy, medicine, climate research - prove extremely sensitive to the slightest disturbances. For these networks, traditional enterprise solutions such as firewalls and intrusion detection systems (IDS), remain infeasible as they cannot operate reliably at such high speeds. This project develops a novel, comprehensive framework that integrates software and hardware for the economical protection of critical high-performance science infrastructure.\r\n\r\nThe project increases the performance of network monitoring by offloading low-level operations from software into hardware, such as switches and computer network interface cards. The project enables network monitoring systems to tie into the hardware offloading being developed. Furthermore, the project expands the capabilities of network monitoring systems to create visibility into science networks, for example, by adding support for the protocols used for high-speed scientific data transfers. It also extends support for responding actively to malicious activity like denial-of-service attacks. This project implements these capabilities in the open-source Bro network security monitor utilized by many NSF-supported organizations nationwide to protect their scientific cyberinfrastructure.",
