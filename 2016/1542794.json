 "awd_abstract_narration": "Numerical experiments are  to be used to test probabilistic predictions as to the optimal and sub-optimal siting of surface Automated Weather Station (AWS) observations in Antarctica. Sensor placement is a generic problem across the goesciences, and this project may have far-reaching impact as to fidelity and cost of observational networks. In particular, problems where measurements are difficult to obtain and/or expensive may be prioritized objectively with the approach tested here. If successful, this research provides the basis for an objectively optimized augmentation or re-configuration of the AWS network to meet climate monitoring (such as locating new or paleoclimate proxy records) and weather forecasting goals. \r\n\r\nGridded data from (archived) Antarctic Mesoscale Prediction Systems (AMPS) will be used by University of Washington and NCAR researchers to optimize the spatial correlation length scales for the existing AWS network via ensemble sensitivity theory.  These predictions of optimal station placement will in turn be subject to observing systems experiments, using both data denial and reconfiguration approaches.\r\nA related line of enquiry is to be an evaluation of the current locations of the active Antarctic radiosonde network, as judged by the network?s ability to account for tropospheric variance in archived AMPS forecast temperature data. Sonde measurements also may collocate with validation observations from infrared soundings from satellites, or GPS radio occultation.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe project addressed the determination of the optimal placement of Automatic Weather Stations (AWS) in Antarctica for the use of their observations for specified applications.  AWSs are platforms that measure atmospheric parameters that can be used for many purposes, but here the concerns were numerical weather prediction and climate analysis.  Previous work identified two Antarctic locations for optimal AWS placement for climate monitoring (continental 2-m temperature analyses) and for weather forecasting (2-m air temperature forecasts).  The question was what impact the locations calculated as optimal have on the metrics for the target applications.  Study outcomes were proving the importance of the locations through analysis of error reduction and describing the relative importance of a set of AWSs across the continent.\n\nAnother study outcome was improved understanding of, and configuration guidance for, the data assimilation (DA) procedures used in the generation of the NWP provided to the United States Antarctic Program (USAP).  The study clarified the localization needed in the assimilation of surface AWS observations, which is crucial information in the DA system used for the model forecasts produced for the USAP.  This information also helps optimize the use of the atmospheric measurements, difficult and costly to collect in Antarctica, which means that the investments in observation, data distribution, and data utilization are more effective.  The better use of the observations improves the numerical model analyses, which in turn leads to better forecast output and improved planning and execution by the USAP.\n\nThe key outcomes were the refinement of the process of optimal resource siting in Antarctica and confirmation of the technique.  For this specific context of AWSs and the target applications, the tools provide the basis for optimized augmentations or re-configurations of the network to serve climate monitoring and weather forecasting.  This is critical because of the high expense and risks involved in deploying AWSs.  The methods, however, can be applied to other equipment for environmental measurement.  Thus, the approach here can be extended to the analysis of the placement of other physical assets for the support of scientific and logistical activities across the Ice.  This work provides methods to contribute to the most effective and efficient use of USAP assets in Antarctica.\n\nOutcomes from this work in terms of products include a publication on the methodology and results and another manuscript in progress on additional applications. The outcome in human resources is the development of the technical and professional skills, including in the field of data assimilation, of scientists at the project institutions.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/16/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jordan G Powers"
