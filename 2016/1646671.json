 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project addresses how semiconductor designers can verify the correctness of ICs that they source from possibly untrusted fabricators.  Existing solutions to this problem are either based on legal and contractual obligations, or use post-fabrication IC testing, both of which are unsatisfactory or unsound. As a sound alternative, this project designs and fabricates verifiable hardware: ICs that provide proofs of their correctness for every input-output computation they perform in the field. These proofs must be efficiently verifiable in less time and energy than it takes to re-execute the computation itself.\r\n\r\nBuilding upon exciting recent theoretical and practical advances in verifiable outsourced computation for the cloud, this project develops new techniques that exploit the unique constraints and adversary models that relate to the verifiable hardware problem. In addition, the project also develops new practical approaches to the problem of general verifiable computation. As a broader impact, computing systems security is one of the greatest technological problems faced by society today. Verifiable hardware is an essential foundation for building future computing systems that are reliable and free from catastrophic security failures. The ultimate goal of this project is to make verifiable hardware practical and accessible for use in cryptographic and mission-critical hardware applications through open-source tools. The PIs are strongly committed to education and public outreach by producing widely-used course materials and taking active roles in outreach at minority-serving universities, community colleges, student organizations and high schools.",

The original goal was to eventually build special purpose hardware to illustrate our techniques.  We were specifically studying the unique constraints and adversary models that relate to the hardware model (versus the cloud model). \n\nSince the start, however, the work on this project has grown to include several new directions including developing new cryptographic protocols. The project has explored ways to extend the basic verifiable computation protocols to achieve the zero-knowledge property and security against malicious adversaries using more efficient approaches.\n\nThe major outcomes of this project are:\n\n* Major advancements in threshold cryptographic systems, e.g., for ECDSA, RSA, and the BBS+ signature scheme.  New protocols developed under the funding of this grant have resulted in the state-of-the-art schemes for ECDSA and BBS which have lowest round complexity, fastest computation times, and fastest overall protocol execution times.  The key insight in the design of this family of protocols stems from verifiable computation: namely, one can exploit the verifiability of the original computation (in this case, a signature scheme) to produce a more efficient protocol that is secure against malicious adversaries.\n\n* Advancements in the theoretical and practical understanding of how to design protocols that are verifiable and robust to malicious adversaries even when run concurrently with other protocols.  One area of improvement was the design of protocols in the random oracle model that offer straightline extraction, which is a property that makes it easier to prove that a protocol is secure when concurrently executed with other protocols.  We have also designed protocols that are guaranteed to complete and produce outputs using roughly square-root of the number of rounds of communication versus the prior state of the art.\n\nThe project has funded 3 completed PhDs and several other graduate students.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/14/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Abhi Shelat"
