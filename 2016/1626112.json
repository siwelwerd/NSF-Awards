 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation Program (MRI) and support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program (CRIF), Professor Da Chen from Southern Illinois University Carbondale (SIUC) and colleagues Michael Lydy, Yanna Liang and Dale Hales have acquired an accurate mass LC-QTOF MS (liquid chromatograph quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer). In general, mass spectrometry (MS) is one of the key analytical methods used to identify and characterize small quantities of chemical species embedded in complex mixture (matrix). In a typical experiment, the components flow into a mass spectrometer where they are broken apart into charged species and measured. This is highly sensitive technique allows detection and determination of the structure of molecules. A mass spectromter coupled with a liquid chromatograph provides additional structure identification power by separating mixtures of compounds before they reach the mass spectrometer. This instrument acquisition strengthens the research infrastructure at the University and regional area. The instrument broadens participation by involving diverse students in research using this modern analytical technique. The project also provides training opportunities to a large number of SIUC undergraduate students through a variety of programs, such as the Research Enriched Academic Challenge (REACH) Program, Undergraduate Assistantship Program, McNair Post-baccalaureate Achievement Program, Illinois Louis Strokes Alliance for Minority Participation (ILSAMP), as well as the National Science Foundation Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program.\r\n\r\nThe award is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels, especially in areas such as: (a) studying the environmental presence of chemicals of emerging concern and exposure in wildlife; (b) analyzing environmental transformation of emerging contaminants; (c) looking at the fate and effects of antibiotics on freshwater communities; (d) assessing the ecological impact of neonicotinoid insecticides; (e) searching for chemical signatures of cyanobacterial species and environmental conditions; (f) developing spatially resolved, tissue-specific chemical profiles of emerging contaminants in Great Lakes trout.",
