 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site from the University of Minnesota will support a diverse cohort of undergraduate students to pursue research in the interdisciplinary field of neural systems engineering.  This program will highlight recent developments in neurotechnology for basic science research and healthcare. It is estimated that 100 million U.S. citizens will have a significant brain-related disorder in their lifetime.  There is a need to train scientists and engineers who will research and understand the process for translating neural systems engineering research into human applications. This site will focus on recruiting a diverse group of students with an emphasis on recruiting women, underrepresented minorities, and undergraduates from colleges where opportunities to pursue STEM-based research are opportunities.  \r\n\r\nOver a three year period, this REU program will engage undergraduate students in a 10-week intensive, summer research experience aimed at further developing neurotechnology for brain imaging, decoding and modulation.  Projects will focus on developing technology, running simulations or data analysis.  Many of the projects will integrate multiple modalities of neurotechnology, such as multi-modal imaging, brain-computer interfaces and closed-loop neuromodulation.  Students will have opportunities to investigate neuronal dynamics, plasticity, learning and attention as feedback metrics to optimize neurotechnologies.  Research projects will provide opportunities for REU students to learn about large scale data analysis, computational modeling of the brain, and participate in experiments. The program will have group building projects to develop a cohesion between the students within the program and with their graduate student mentors to create lasting friendships and collaborations. The program will emphasize near-peer mentoring where the REU students will be directly mentored students in their second and third year of graduate school, and in turn will be offered the opportunity to meet and educate high school students about neural engineering.  To broaden their perspective, students will participate in a bi-weekly neuroengineering seminar series hosted in conjunction with a NSF IGERT program and the Center for Neuroengineering.  Multiple mechanisms will help guide students in their professional development and prepare them for graduate school.  To develop communication skills, students will participate in outreach programs and present their research in a small forum at the end of the program.",

Students applied to the program through an umbrella program, the University of Minnesota&rsquo;s LSSURP, that manages around 8 summer programs like ours.

Amongst the cohort, over three quarters continued onto graduate programs. A breakdown of the demographics are shown in Demographics Figure.

Graduate student mentors for selected projects then underwent two one-hour mentor training lectures provided by the Center for Teaching Excellence.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>During the summer program students participated in two weekly meetings, one career development lecture, focusing on soft skills provided by the faculty, and project development focusing on hard skills provided by the graduate assistant. Each participant had a graduate or postdoctoral advisor and a faculty advisor that they met with each week. The REU program also participated in LSSURP sponsored events. Students were housed together with other programs to develop an interdisciplinary cohort of about 80 summer students.&nbsp; LSSURP provided a weekend orientation at the Biological Research Station at Lake Itasca where students travel by bus to the headwaters of the Mississippi to stay in cabins, play games, boat on Lake Itasca, and attend orientation information sessions. Over the 10 weeks, LSSURP also provided a seminar series on responsible conduct of research, writing personal statements, building a professional network, and how to prepare for an interview. They also provided career development opportunities through a job fair, a luncheon for students interested in MD/PhD programs, mock interviews, and a poster presentation session at the end of the program. To build community, LSSURP also organized several events such as bowling, a picnic, a Twins baseball game, and a closing event boat ride on the Mississippi.&nbsp; In addition to these events, our NSE REU program also organized an annual picnic with sailboat rides and a tour of a medical device company, such as Medtronic.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>The program was internally surveyed using Google forms with scaled responses as well as open form responses to provide feedback. The program was also externally surveyed by LSSURP. They provide questionnaires with 102 different questions to assess different aspects of the program.

LSSURP also provided the averages of the other programs for each question, enabling us to identify weaknesses to be addressed in following years.&nbsp; The results from the questionnaires were then reviewed by the Research Methodology Consulting Center in the College of Education and Human Development at the University of Minnesota to provide the executive committee with feedback and suggestions for changes.&nbsp; Based on the extensive feedback and comments, adjustments to the program were made to strengthen the program and to adjust with the students&rsquo; changing needs and environment.&nbsp; Changes have been made in the curriculum and events based on their feedback and to remove overlap with career development advice that they were receiving from other programs during the summer REU.</span></p>\n<br /><br /></span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 11/06/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Theoden&nbsp;I&nbsp;Netoff</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1560247/1560247_10416665_1667231203415_Demographics--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1560247/1560247_10416665_1667231203415_Demographics--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Demographics\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1560247/1560247_10416665_1667231203415_Demographics--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Demographics\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Demographics of student participants.
