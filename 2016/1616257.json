 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project seeks to understand the genetic mechanisms regulating selfish and cooperative behaviors in animals, using honey bees as a model system.  Previous studies showed that, in honey bees, genes inherited from the father promote selfish behavior, while the genes inherited from the mother promote cooperative behavior.  The current project will use advanced genomic tools to unravel the molecular mechanisms that mediate this conflict between the father's and mother's genes, and provide a framework for understanding how the interactions between these genes generate behavior.  The insights gained and methodology developed for these studies can be easily applied to explore these questions in other social animals.  This project will be used as charismatic platform to increase understanding of social behavior in animals, how genes produce behavior, and why genes may be in conflict with each other, in K-12 students and teachers, the public, undergraduate and graduate students. \r\n\r\nThis project evaluates the function and regulation of intragenomic conflict in mediating social behavior, using honey bees as a model system. The kin selection theory of intragenomic conflict predicts that, in honey bees, patrigenes (inherited from the father) favor selfish behavior while matrigenes (inherited from the mother) favor altruistic behavior. Previous studies provided the first empirical support for this prediction.  The current research will expand on these studies by: (1) confirming that patrigene expression mediates selfish behavior by developing new methodology for allele-specific manipulation of transcript abundance; (2) determining if parent-specific gene expression (PSGE) patterns are labile and vary according to tissue and context, while still corresponding to the predictions of kin selection theory; and (3) evaluating the extent of parent-specific DNA methylation (PSDM) across the genome and its role in regulating PSGE.  These studies will integrate genetic crosses, behavior, physiology, RNAi approaches, whole transcriptome sequencing, bisulfite sequencing, bioinformatics, and statistical genomics, and open the door to examining intragenomic conflict as a pervasive force that can shape a myriad of traits related to fitness in social groups.\r\n\r\nThis project is co-funded by the Genetic Mechanisms Program in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences and by the Animal Behavior Program in the Division of Integrative Organismal Systems.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n \nThe molecular mechanisms underlying variation among individuals of a species is a fundamental question in biology.  Intragenomic conflict between the father?s genes (patrigenes) and mother?s genes (matrigenes) is a relatively unexplored mechanism that can create individual variation. Intragenomic conflict is predicted to occur in cases where there are social interactions among the parents and offspring, but the mother?s and father?s genes are not equally distributed among offspring.  In the case of honey bees, the queen lays all the eggs in the colony, and her daughters (workers) care for their siblings and perform all the colony tasks.  Since the queen mates with 15 or more males, all the workers share the same matrigenes (since they have the same mother), but do not share the same patrigenes (since they have different fathers).  Under these conditions, it is predicted that patrigenes favor selfish behavior, where the workers become reproductively active and lay their own eggs, and thus ensure the patrigenes are represented in the next generation.  In contrast, the matrigenes are predicted to favor altruistic behavior, where the workers remain sterile and care for their siblings, who share the same matrigenes.  In this project, we confirmed that patrigenes promote selfish behavior in honey bee workers.  Expression of patrigenes (but not matrigenes) increased in both the brain and reproductive tissues of reproductively-active workers compared to sterile workers.  Interestingly, different sets of genes showed patrigene-biased expression in these two tissues, suggesting that the mechanisms controlling parent-specific gene expression (PSGE) are flexible, allowing different genes to show PSGE in different tissues.  In other systems where PSGE has been found (mammals and plants), DNA methylation is the primary epigenetic mechanism that underlies differential expression of the alleles.  Our studies demonstrated that DNA methylation does not drive PSGE in bees, and thus a different epigenetic process is being used in this system, and likely across insects in general.  Additionally, we found that the genes showing PSGE were not expressed at significantly different levels between sterile and reproductive bees: thus, the differences in allelic expression did not lead to overall differences in RNA levels of these genes.  However, our studies suggest that genes showing PSGE and genes showing differential expression are in the same gene regulatory networks: thus, small changes in allelic expression levels may cascade to larger changes in gene expression levels that drive differences in behavior.  These studies thus provided key insights into how individual variation in social behavior can arise, and demonstrate the diversity of mechanisms that underlie epigenetic variation in gene expression.  The concepts, techniques and outcomes associated with this project were incorporated into education programs developed for families in rural libraries and nature centers, and into general education undergraduate courses, to increase understanding of behavioral variation and the underlying genetic and molecular mechanisms.\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/10/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Christina Grozinger"
