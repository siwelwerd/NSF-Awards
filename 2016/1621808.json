The consortium provide a forum for expert and peer critique of students' doctoral work with the goal of improving their dissertation. Student participants will also have the opportunity to receive networking support and career advice from internationally-recognized experts. Overall, the doctoral consortium brings together people who might not otherwise engage with one another and engage in inter-disciplinary research in fields involving healthcare and pervasive computing. The consortium also exposes participant to different scientific disciplinary approaches and develops the next generation of scholars in pervasive computing in the domain of healthcare. \r\n\r\nThe aim of the Sixth Pervasive Healthcare Doctoral Consortium is to support doctoral students through constructive remarks and feedback on their interdisciplinary research from prominent researchers and through interaction with other students. Student participants from a broad range of disciplines including pervasive computing, biomedical informatics, computer science, information science, engineering, clinical sciences, law, and medical informatics will give short presentations of  their work and receive constructive feedback from five internationally respected experts in pervasive healthcare. The expert panelists will also provide student participants with career guidance and mentoring through presentations and small group advising throughout the day. In addition, the doctoral consortium will be held during pre-conference activities, thus student participants will have the opportunity to see the conference and network with conference attendees.",
