 "awd_abstract_narration": "The most widely used construction material in the world is concrete, due to its durability, economy, and flexible form.  Because concrete is so ubiquitous, it creates a sizable demand on resources.  This means that even modest improvements in the durability and sustainability of concrete would lead to great societal and economic benefit.  New cements are needed with improved performance that also require reduced resources to manufacture.  Calcium sulfoaluminate cements are a good example of this.  These cements have a 50 percent reduction in the carbon dioxide and energy required for their production when compared to traditional cement.  These cements are capable of gaining comparable strengths in only three hours that traditional cements gain in a month.  Furthermore, these materials show less cracking from drying.  However, work is needed to understand and ultimately control the rate of hydration of calcium sulfoaluminate cements.  This project aims to understand this group of cements by characterizing changes in the hydration reactions at nano and micro length scales using 3D in-situ structure and chemistry imaging techniques.  The effects of additives on these hydration reactions modifying can also be examined and modified accordingly.  These findings will be used to produce concretes with improved properties at lower costs and energy consumption. Also, the awareness level of STEM fields will be raised with underrepresented elementary students through the extension of an existing elementary engineering-oriented curriculum with the creation of new lesson plans for both online and in class delivery.\r\n\r\nThe research will use 3D in-situ structure and chemistry imaging techniques at multiple length scales in combination with microstructural modeling to characterize, quantify, and understand the structure, chemistry, and properties of calcium sulfoaluminate cement reactions over the first 12 hours.  These cements can gain service strengths in only a few hours and have the potential to reduce the carbon footprint of concrete by 50 percent. This work aims to understand changes in the structure and chemistry that occur in the dissolution of cement particles and the subsequent formation of early age hydration products by using 3D in-situ imaging techniques at the nanometer and micron scale.  Bulk changes will also be evaluated by using mechanical testing, isothermal calorimetry, and X-ray diffraction.  Next, these same experimental methods will be used to study how additives change the rate, structure, and chemistry of the hydrates.  Finally, efforts will be made to understand the mechanisms by which these reactions occur and collaborate with the National Institute of Science and Technology to develop computational models that are able to guide the design and predict performance of early concrete properties.  This work will improve economy, sustainability, and mechanical properties of concrete.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis research uses advanced X-ray imaging techniques to study the structure and chemistry of two different types of cement  The work will focus on the initial material formed over the first few hours of reaction with water.  This work gives important insights into the structure and chemistry of the material that is formed.  The objectives are to characterize and understand the structure and chemistry of the hydration products and understand the mechanisms by which these reactions occur.  This knowledge will help design and predict the performance of concrete using different cements. \n\n \n\nCements are needed that can reduce the carbon footprint of concrete while also improving performance.  Calcium sulfoaluminate (CSA) cements are one example of this.  These cements have a 50% reduction in the CO2 required for their production when compared to typical portland cement or OPC.    This is due to their decreased temperatures required for production and lower calcium content.  These cements are capable of gaining strength rapidly.  Strengths as high as 28 MPa have been observed in as little as three hours and as high as 70 MPa in three days.  Furthermore, these materials will swell if cured adequately and will offset shrinkage during drying and reduce cracking.  In summary, these cements are more sustainable, stronger, and have less cracking propensity than OPC. \n\n \n\nThis work contributes to the understanding the very first seconds that water starts to react with CSA and OPC through 12 h of reaction.  These insights will then be used to try and better control the working time of the material in order to make it more widely used.  These efforts are important steps to predict the setting time, strength, stiffness, and durability of concrete.  This information will help engineers to better use these binders to design materials for different applications and in different environments. \n\nSome of the key findings of this work include quantitative information about how OPC and CSA particles first react.  The testing found that these particles have certain areas that react rapidly while others react more slowly.  These highly reactive areas are studies at many different length scales with several different experimental methods.  Detailed measurements give quantitative data about the rate at which these areas change.  Also, some important data was obtained about the formation of air filled voids that occur.  These voids appear without warning and end up in the hardened concrete.  This work shows that the voids are caused by dissolved air within the water used to make the concrete.  As the cement grains react then the voids will form. \n\n \n\nFive different papers were prepared that are either published or under review.  The CSA research was challenging because there was so little reported in the literature and so there was little to compare the results to.  Despite this, there were several important findings from this work. \n\n \n\nThe educational objective is to increase the number of underrepresented students pursuing careers in STEM fields through outreach activities where a successful elementary engineering-oriented curriculum is expanded with a new teacher workshop and scaled to a larger number of schools.  A STEM curriculum was placed in 11 different elementary schools and an online training was developed.  The website for the work can be found at www.engineeringiseverywhere.com.  Three videos and the curriculum guide is available on YouTube and have been viewed over 117,000 times!  A refereed journal paper was published in 2017 in the Journal of Engineering Education. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/11/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: M. Tyler Ley"
