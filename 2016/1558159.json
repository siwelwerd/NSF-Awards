 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the Sierra Nevada mountain ranges, like many high altitude environments, snow cover is extremely variable from year to year. Many high altitude animals survive through winter underneath snow that buffers them from extremes of temperature. Many unique and ecologically important animals live in mountainous environments, making it vital to understand and predict impacts of annual differences in snow cover on their population abundances, but as yet we have limited understanding of how snow impacts survival and reproduction of insects and other animals. This project proposes to study physiological and genetic responses to variation in snow cover in a high altitude beetle in the laboratory and the natural environment to understand how snow alters reproductive success during the winter and subsequent summer.  This work will develop a partnership between UC-Berkeley and two Primarily Undergraduate Institutions. Undergraduates at the Primarily Undergraduate Institutions will work with researchers from Berkeley, and Berkeley PhD students will supervise undergraduates from a wide variety of backgrounds and experiences. Thus both groups of students will be exposed to the culture of different educational institutions and will have access to professional contacts outside their usual network. A curriculum module developed from the project for K-12 students will be used to contribute towards their understanding of challenges that organisms face in snowy climates, and this module will be distributed to K-12 teachers through a UC Berkeley-based website.\r\n\r\nFor high altitude animals, summer is a time of energy gain, while energy conservation is key during winter because resources are scarce and animals rely on energy stores. To resist winter cold, high altitude insects use energy stores to synthesize metabolically expensive cryoprotectants. This may generate a trade-off between cold hardiness and energy conservation. Snow buffers thermal fluctuations, decreasing cold mortality and need for cold hardiness.  However, since temperatures are greater beneath snow than in a snow-free, exposed habitat, there may be increased overall energy demand associated with living under snow.  Due to the energetic trade-off, inter-annual fluctuations in winter snowpack and air temperature will alter selective pressures on overwintering organisms, and may significantly affect growth and reproduction in summer. The central hypothesis is that variation in snow cover alters selective pressures on cold hardiness and energy conservation, influencing physiological performance of overwintering individuals and genetic composition of survivors. The investigators further hypothesize that cold hardiness trades off against future reproduction by depleting winter energy reserves due to energetic costs of cold hardiness. The research will: 1) Measure how variation in snow alters selective gradients on winter-relevant genetic variation in a high altitude beetle, and isolate causal drivers of winter selective gradients. 2) Gain a predictive and quantitative understanding of how cold and energy stressors interact to shape physiological performance during winter and the subsequent summer. 3) Uncover mechanisms underlying interactions between cold and energy stress by asking how single or combined stressors alter reaction norms for energy reserves and cryoprotectants.",

Beetle populations inhabit the Sierra Nevada mountains, where snow cover is highly variable and declining. Snow is important for the beetles, which spend the winter under the soil, because snow insulates the soil from cold air temperatures, decreasing winter cold stress and altering energy use for organisms like the beetles that overwinter in the soil. Although high elevations are colder, they are also more snowy, which may mean that the soil temperatures are actually warmer at higher elevations due to the buffering effects of snow. This would mean that as snow cover declines, we get the counter-intuitive prediction of colder soils in a warmer world.</p>\n<p>The willow leaf beetles are an ideal system in which to address the effects of snow cover on montane organisms, because of the long history of study of populations of these beetles in the Eastern Sierra Nevada mountains. Using funds from this grant, we were able to continue and add to two decades of research on the population abundance, microclimate measurements, and physiological and genetic studies on this species. This is now the best developed study system for understanding responses to changes in winter climate for montane organisms.</p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">As a result of this research, we discovered that snow cover alters elevational gradients in cold exposure. Along five mountain drainages in the Eastern Sierras, we found that snow changes elevational and interannual patterns in soil temperature (Fig. 1). This suggests that loss of snow cover will increase cold stress for overwintering beetles, providing an explanation for previous observations that beetle populations decline and contract to high elevations during droughts in the Sierras.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p>We carried out a series of snow manipulation experiments, wherein beetles were buried in cages beneath the soil in either snowy or dry conditions and survival, energy reserves and gene expression was measured at defined timepoints throughout winter and after emergence. We discovered that beetles need time after emergence to switch their metabolism between relying on stored lipid reserves to being ready to digest plant material and initiate reproduction in spring (Fig. 2). This process takes place over a week, and the timing is impacted by snow cover. This illustrates that variation in snow cover alters not only winter performance but can also impact the timing of growth and reproduction in later life stages.</p>\n<p>In addition to differences in gene expression, the beetles in snowy plots used more energy over winter and apparently died from energy depletion, while the beetles in cold plots had high levels of cryoprotectants to resist the cold (Fig. 3). This supports our hypothesis that snow cover modulates selective gradients on cold stress and energy use.</p>\n<p>We next looked at how the genetic make-up of beetle populations varied across the broader landscape, discovering many genes that were associated with variation in snow cover (Fig 4). This is the first demonstration that snow cover variation across a landscape can cause local adaptation in genes associated with cold stress resistance. To accomplish this work, we first assembled a high quality chromosome-level genome that will facilitate future genetic analyses.</p>\n<p>Together, this work supports the hypothesis that snow is a powerful agent of natural selection, acting to reduce cold exposure when present and changing the conditions for organisms that spend winter below the soil significantly. Our research has illustrated that soils in snowy regions will actually get colder in a warming world due to the buffering effects of snow on the soil, and that these changes will impact the survival, energetics, seasonal timing, and genetic diversity in organisms that overwinter beneath the soil. Understanding the responses of montane organisms to changing climate therefore must take into account changes in snowpack dynamics.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Broader Impacts</span></p>\n<p>All together, this grant supported the research of 39 undergraduate students; 4 PhD students; 3 laboratory technicians, and 3 Masters students.
