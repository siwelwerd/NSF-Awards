The major objective of the workshop is to provide a readily accessible venue for young scientists (graduate students and postdoctoral fellows) to present the results of their research efforts, and formally and informally discuss their work with leading members of the community. The Workshop will provide support for the attendance of young scientists, with an emphasis on increasing the participation of women and minorities under-represented in the field; the diversity of topics and technical approaches presented at the Workshop will provide a stimulating multidisciplinary environment for junior and senior scientists alike. \r\n\r\nCyanobacteria are major contributors to the global oxygen, carbon, and nitrogen cycles and are increasingly used as platforms for biotechnological innovation for the development of \"green\" biofuels, chemical feedstocks, and high value products. The Cyanobacterial Workshop is enriched by the intersection of disciplines ranging from metabolic engineering to microbial ecology, and themes include Molecular Responses to Stress; Photosynthesis; Physiology and Metabolism; Biotechnology and Synthetic Biology; Differentiation; Environment and Ecology; Regulation; Phylogeny and Evolution.\r\n\r\nThis award is supported jointly by programs in Cellular Dynamics and Function, and Systems and Synthetic Biology.",
