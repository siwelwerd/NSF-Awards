 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Queens College, City University of New York, Noyce STEM Academy is a five-year project dedicated and designed to motivate and encourage both talented students majoring in the STEM disciplines and STEM professionals to become successful science teachers in high-needs public schools in New York City. This project aims to recruit 24 STEM majors and 24 STEM professionals in order to produce 48 new, highly qualified STEM teachers.  The significance of the STEM Academy is founded on its commitment to promoting science progress through the advancement of science awareness and a more scientifically informed public. This project resonates with the Noyce Program's mission, which seeks to improve the lives of students by strengthening science instruction provided within K-12 educational systems. The STEM Academy will respond to the well-documented need of preparing highly qualified science teachers who will serve in disadvantaged, high-needs schools. The significance of this project is its commitment to attract STEM majors and professionals from culturally diverse backgrounds, to retain them as outstanding teachers, and ultimately to improve student achievement by recognizing the link between out-of-school science experiences and those in formal classroom settings. \r\n\r\nThe goal and scope of the STEM Academy will be to support 48 STEM individuals in the greater New York City metropolitan area to serve in high-needs schools. The STEM Academy will include two tracks: one designed for talented undergraduate students (N=24) to receive scholarships for two years as they complete requirements for their dual science and education majors, and another designed for candidates who are STEM professionals (N=24) seeking initial teacher certification in science. The STEM Academy will accomplish its goals through the following methods and approaches: 1) providing prospective, talented science educators with a carefully crafted year-long, clinically-rich induction and mentoring program that integrates learning experiences in community-based science learning centers with preparation in formal high-need partner schools; 2) increasing capacity of STEM teaching majors from culturally diverse communities; 3) providing a career transition for STEM majors and STEM professionals; 4) providing a well-developed curriculum that enhances students' science content knowledge, teaching pedagogies, and research experience; 5) studying effective teaching practices and behaviors through apprenticeships with master teachers in host schools; and 6) providing sustainable, integrated support during the candidates' first two years of teaching. In addition to producing 48 outstanding science teachers, the STEM Academy anticipates the following potential benefits and contributions: (1) building of knowledge regarding the importance of mentor relationships on the training and retention of talented STEM professionals from culturally diverse backgrounds in the field of science education; (2) developing greater understanding of the context in which science learning occurs in both informal and formal settings; and (3) increasing the capacity of highly qualified science educators for high-needs schools who will advance scientific literacy in their classrooms.  The results of this work have the potential to assist other like-minded teacher preparation programs across the country.",

The project team addressed national calls for reconsideration of traditional approaches to science teacher preparation. The purpose of the program was to engage Noyce science candidates in well-planned learning experiences with our partner schools, our pure science departments at the college and community-based organizations. These varied experiences enabled us to develop performance assessments that represent and provide opportunities for science teacher candidates to learn how to create meaningful, content-rich curriculum that integrate science content, pedagogical content knowledge, and learning theories that all reflect state and national standards.</p>\n<p>We work with our partner schools and project collaborators to develop and offer alternative structures and formats that are typically found in institutions of higher education. The distinct goal of the project was met and we increased the capacity of <em>highly qualified STEM teachers</em> while reinforcing the professional development of in-service teachers and informal educators who work with students from urban and suburban high needs schools. As indicated by the title of the grant we prepared <em>STEM majors and recruited STEM graduates to increase the number of highly qualified STEM teachers. </em>Moreover, we added to the research base on recruiting, preparing, and retaining STEM educators by researching and implementing the following strategies: the effectiveness of scholars paired with accomplished teacher mentors on pedagogical content knowledge development; the influence of professional learning communities on peer networking; and the relationship between intensive summer community-based internships and content knowledge application.</p>\n<p>Queens College is one of the most culturally diverse institutions of higher education in the U.S., and has demonstrated the capacity to attract, prepare, and retain students who are traditionally underrepresented in STEM fields. In this respect, the Robert Noyce STEM educator program has been a transformational project to the Queens College Science Education program and the Queens College community. It has provided an opportunity for a number of underrepresented candidates to enter the STEM teacher workforce. This is an extremely important consideration as it is the focus of our program?s goal of increasing the diversity and capacity of a highly qualified STEM teacher workforce. The Noyce Project Team recognizes that the opportunities that have integrated formal and informal learning experiences, extended clinical residencies, incorporated peer-peer mentorship, and embraced the incorporation of full-time science and science education faculty involvement, have led to positive outcomes for our STEM candidates. Evidence of our comments can be supported by the successful recruitment and preparation of approximately 50 certified STEM candidates.</p>\n<p>The consensus of science educators, scientists, researchers, school administrators, and assessment and measurement specialists involved in this project agree that the ethos of sustainable practice is vital to all human activity. The project stakeholders share the belief that our locus on community-based sustainable educational practices provided the opportunity to create a culturally responsive curricula and pedagogies that integrate the teaching and learning of science in both formal and informal settings. Additionally, our highly qualified STEM educators offered opportunities for making an impact on the STEM learning of students throughout the New York City greater metropolitan area. Moreover, the majority of our clinical placements were in schools and classrooms that are highly diverse ethnically, racially, socioeconomically, and especially, in classrooms where significant numbers of students had special needs. Based upon the evidence, from science education chairpersons, cooperating science teachers, field supervisors, outside evaluators, and state licensing requirements we conclude with confidence that Queens College Noyce candidates had a positive impact on the learning of all students they encountered both inside and outside the formal classroom. Therefore, our program of integrated instruction for informal-formal learning provided the opportunities to learn pedagogy, pedagogical content knowledge, science content, and leadership strengths that focus on the principles of ethics, equity, and excellence.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 08/31/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Stephen&nbsp;Farenga</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1557384/1557384_10412073_1630446783459_FlyerforApr302021NoyceScitechConferencep.2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1557384/1557384_10412073_1630446783459_FlyerforApr302021NoyceScitechConferencep.2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"NSF Noyce SciTech Conference\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1557384/1557384_10412073_1630446783459_FlyerforApr302021NoyceScitechConferencep.2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"NSF Noyce SciTech Conference\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">We have collaborated with all grant stakeholders to host a conference that highlights the achievements and outcomes of the grant.
