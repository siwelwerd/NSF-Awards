 "awd_abstract_narration": "The National Science Foundation uses the Early-concept Grants for Exploratory Research (EAGER) funding mechanism to support exploratory work in its early stages on untested, but potentially transformative, research ideas or approaches. This EAGER project was awarded as a result of the invitation in the Dear Colleague Letter NSF 16-080 to proposers from Historically Black Colleges and Universities to submit proposals that would strengthen research capacity of faculty at the institution. The project at Hampton University aims to study the merits of using monofiliment carbon wires in drift chambers, and to develop a low recoil proton detector. If this project succeeds, the resulting knowledge can be used to develop future carbon nanotube wire chambers, which would be a possibly transformative development in experimental nuclear and particle physics. The project involves training of the next generation of physicists at Hampton University.\r\n\r\nAs part of the project, the investigation into the usage of carbon mono\flament wires for construction of the cathode layer and/or an additional inner wire chamber for the BONuS12 detector will be carried out in parallel with development work on the currently planned, but lower risk, design. The current project is one of the first to investigate usage of such wires in an cylindrical detector. More generally, the usage of carbon mono\flaments could be a boon for experiments requiring detection and tracking of low momentum protons and nuclei due to the potentially significant reduction in energy lost over traditional metal wires. The technology for producing carbon nanotube wires offering conductivity surpassing that of copper wires has just now become available, with mass production likely available over the next few years.\r\n\r\nThis EAGER is co-funded by the Directorates for Education & Human Resources and Mathematical & Physical Sciences.",

Historically, information on the quark structure of the neutron has been determined from scattering on deuteron nuclei (weakly bound proton and neutron).&nbsp; However, the uncertainties introduced in inferring the free neutron quark structure are quite large when utilizing such a target.&nbsp; To avoid these issues, the BONuS12 experiment was proposed to measure the scattering from nearly free neutrons.&nbsp; This is accomplished by tagging slow, backward protons that recoil from the struck neutron.&nbsp;
