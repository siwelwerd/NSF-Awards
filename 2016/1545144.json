It will bring together the leading authorities in the field to discuss a broad spectrum of topics, including the following: the formation, rigidity, and stability of black holes; the stability of Kerr-Cauchy horizons; the relationship between geometry and general relativity; the dynamics of self-gravitating matter. The highlight of the trimester will be a workshop that will be held November 16-20, 2015, and that will constitute the event's primary celebration of general relativity's hundredth anniversary.  The program for the trimester provides ample opportunity for graduate students, postdocs, and other young scientists to present their work.",
