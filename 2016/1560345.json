 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Advances of MAchine Learning in THEory and Applications (AMALTHEA) Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site aims to provide top quality educational experiences to a diverse community of undergraduate students through research participation in the area of Machine Learning (ML). The relevance and importance of ML is not limited to specialized technological innovations, as it was in the past. Nowadays, it also increasingly influences everyday life through its contributions to applications such as voice/face recognition, credit fraud detection, intelligent recommendation systems and many others. Furthermore, ML is inherently multi-disciplinary as it draws from advances in multiple disciplines such as engineering, computing, statistics, mathematics, physics and biology, to name a few major ones. Since its start in 2009, AMALTHEA, one of the first ML-focused REU sites, involves 10 undergraduate students per year from a broad spectrum of disciplines, and the educational experience spans 10 weeks in the summer. The participants are exposed to cutting-edge ML research, as well as professional development activities, such as technical seminars and career-related workshops. Moreover, these participants perform closely-mentored research, whose results are going to impact the field of ML itself, as well as how ML is applied in other scientific disciplines. Over the 2016-2019 time span, the project will directly impact a diverse group of 30 motivated students, the majority of which may not have access to such research participation opportunities otherwise.\r\n\r\nThe project's thrust area is the theory of ML and how it can be integrated and applied to important real-life problems, hence exposing participants to both theory and applications. Past projects include applications such as automated anuran recognition from frog calls, uncovering criminal networks from crime locations, human-object interaction recognition, modelling of group dynamics in virtual worlds, speaker-independent speech recognition and license plate recognition among others. On the other hand, past contributions to the theory of ML have been steered towards topics such as functional data analysis, wavelet-based density estimation, non-linear dimensionality reduction, kernel methods and anomaly detection to name a few. Short video highlights of such projects can be found on AMALTHEA's YouTube channel located at https://goo.gl/2JhYoF. Finally, additional information about these topics and their outcomes can be found on the project's web site located at http://www.amalthea-reu.org.",

The present grant (No. 1560345) supported the Program from early 2016 through early 2020. AMALTHEA's research focus was Machine Learning (ML), its theory and applications in multifarious domains. Nowadays, applications of ML permeate our daily lives, while it is confidently projected that ML's role in business, technology and the sciences will become even more prominent in the future.</p>\n<p><br />The project's two main objectives were as follows:<br /><br />1. To recruit a diverse, talented undergraduate students from around the nation. In particular, to attract 10 undergraduate students every year from a variety of engineering and science disciplines. This REU effort was supported by a geographically-broad, national network of affiliate universities, some of which serve significant numbers of under-represented minorities and others offer only BS/BA degrees.<br />2. To actively engage the recruited students into cutting-edge ML research and form a community of learners, which will foster and provide a valuable experience for undergraduate students through participation in research programs and high-quality student/faculty interaction.</p>\n<p><br />During the years 2016 through 2018, the Program hosted three 10-week long summer experiences, which immersed 10 undergraduates per year into ML research. Each year, the Program recruited its cohort from a diverse and talented pool of applicants from a wide spectrum of engineering and science disciplines at an average rate of acceptance of 3%. During this period, AMALTHEA recruited a total of 30 undergraduates. Of those, 17 (~56%) were female and 13 (~43%) were male, while 5 (~17%) belonged to ethnic/racial minorities. Overall, 19 (~63%) stemmed from groups that are traditionally under-represented in the engineering and computing disciplines. Furthermore, 17 (~57%) came from institutions that offer limited research opportunities to undergraduates. Finally, at the time of their participation, 7 (~23%) had completed their third year of schooling, 14 (~47%) their second year and 9 (30%) their first year.</p>\n<p><br />In each summer experience, after being educated in the rudiments of ML via a week-long primer course, these REU participants formed five research teams, each consisting of two undergraduates, a graduate student mentor (typically, a doctoral student) and a faculty mentor. Each such team pursued a research topic of their collective interest for eight weeks. During the Program's last week, each team spent their time compiling and polishing their research outcomes and, eventually, prepared a technical report, a 20-minute slide presentation, a poster and a 3-minute video highlight of their work. Video highlights of these topics can be found in our YouTube channel (http://tinyurl.com/y5h8boww). Apart from these activities, AMALTHEA students participated in several ML-themed talks, as well as professional development workshops on ethics in research, technical writing and graduate fellowship opportunities. On the last day of its summer experiences, AMALTHEA held its annual symposium, in which the teams showcased their research outcomes to an audience consisting of the Program's Advisory Board (AB) -- whose function was to provide feedback to the Program -- as well as other FIT students, faculty and administrators. AMALTHEA's AB comprised primarily of senior scientists or engineers and managers from FIT's local industry, such as Alstom USA, the Northrop Grumman Corporation, Harris Corporation among a constellation of smaller companies.</p>\n<p><br />In line with the national priority of helping to prepare the next generation of a globally-competitive STEM workforce, AMALTHEA educated and trained its undergraduate participants on a variety of approaches, technologies and tools that are applicable to real-world ML problems. Moreover, as witnessed from the Program's yearly evaluations and assessments, REU students learned what research is about, how to technically/ethically conduct it, how to successfully present it to a broader audience and appreciate its potentially positive impact to scientific communities and society at large. They also experienced first-hand the importance of a diverse, inclusive research and working environment in achieving personal, as well as team excellence. Additionally, they acquired skills, such as effectively communicating their ideas to others and the ability of partaking constructively in teamwork, traits which are highly valued in today's professional environments. Beyond their participation in AMALTHEA, so far, 10 (~33%) ended up pursuing graduate studies and one former participant became a 2019 McNair Scholar.</p>\n<p><br />Finally, through this grant, 15 research topics (5 per year) were pursued during the 2016-2018 timeframe. This research was facilitated by 2 MS students, 10 doctoral students and 5 faculty that mentored the corresponding teams. These efforts yielded 15 (non-peer-reviewed) technical reports (one per team), 12 peer-reviewed conference papers or book chapters and 5 journal publications. Ten of the peer-reviewed publications featured REU students as co-authors. Overall, the Program directly or indirectly supported 2 Master's thesis, 8 doctoral dissertations, as well as 2 US non-provisional patents. And, lastly, the grant allowed FIT to maintain existing and develop new, mutually-beneficial ties with its local industry and government.<br /><br /><br /><br /></p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 01/17/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Georgios&nbsp;C&nbsp;Anagnostopoulos</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1560345/1560345_10413844_1610938595665_Photo1-2017AMALTHEACohort--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1560345/1560345_10413844_1610938595665_Photo1-2017AMALTHEACohort--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"2017 AMALTHEA REU Cohort\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1560345/1560345_10413844_1610938595665_Photo1-2017AMALTHEACohort--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"2017 AMALTHEA REU Cohort\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Our 10 REU students on the day of our 2017 Symposium at Florida Institute of Technology, in Melbourne, Florida.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Georgios C.
