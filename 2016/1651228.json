 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a Future Internet Architecture (FIA) principal investigator (PI) meeting in September, 2016. This meeting will focus on strategies, methods, tools, and opportunities to advance and support FIA-related and FIA-derived research with the sponsorship and support of a) other US Government agencies, and b) Industry structures such as research consortia. Effective exploration of this topic serves as a key strategic requirement for further developing the intellectual lines of research initiated by NSF within the FIA program, as well as achieving the full broader impact potential of this research. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: The topics to be addressed represent a critical element needed to sustain future FIA program-related research. The presentations, discussions, and participatory exercises are intended to inform and assist FIA researchers in a) developing ongoing intellectual agendas for their research; b) learning about the technical, cultural, and procedural requirements that underpin research funding opportunities within the US Government and Industry communities, and c) develop skills and abilities in framing and presenting their research to these communities in ways that are effective with respect to community specific norms and objectives. Cross-fertilization and knowledge transfer between the FIA community and these potential research sponsors is a critical objective at this stage of the FIA program. This workshop provides a focused agenda to advance that objective. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: The broader goal of the NSF FIA program is enhancing the relevance and impact of the NSF program of network research, intellectual enrichment of the network research community, and the contribution of new concepts and thought leadership to the future of the Internet. The program provides a means to train a cohort of academic network researchers in the practice of long-range architectural thinking. The program has the potential to contribute to a future Internet that is materially more secure, robust, economically viable, and fit for the needs of society than the Internet of today. Results and outputs of this workshop will contribute to the ongoing broader impact of the FIA program by substantially expanding the potential support and sponsorship base for FIA research. The summary of this workshop, which will be posted on the FIA website for public dissemination, will be an additional contribution to this broader goal.",
