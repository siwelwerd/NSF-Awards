 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project aims to achieve breakthrough advances in the understanding of space weather. Space weather involves the dynamical processes of the Sun-Earth system that affect human life and technology. The most destructive forms of space weather, ranging from electrical power disruptions to radiation hazards for astronauts, are due to major solar eruptions: fast coronalmass ejections (CMEs) and eruptive X-class flares. These destructive events originate with magnetic fields emerging from the solar interior, forming the active regions from where CMEs erupt into the heliosphere. Upon impacting the Earth, interplanetary CMEs impact the magnetosphere nd produce geomagnetic storms. This process is controlled by the microphysics of magnetic reconnection. The project's goal is to answer the most salient questions of space weather: how the buildup of magnetic energy results in solar eruptions and how magnetic reconnection results in geomagnetic storms. Improving the predictive capabilities of space weather models will  have major societal benefits. Moreover, there will be extensive student involvement in the project.\r\n\r\nThe project will use a sophisticated multi-scale model, the Space Weather Modeling Framework(SWMF) that can represent detailed small-scale physics in a global system. The SWMF contains more than a dozen different models that can simulate various physics domains of the Sun-Earth system starting from the solar convection zone coupled to the solar corona, the heliosphere, the global and inner magnetosphere, and the ionosphere and upper atmosphere of the Earth. The flux emergence and CME initiation simulations will be carried out with our high-resolution magnetohydrodynamic code BATS-R-US. The simulation domain extends from the convection zone into the corona.  To model the reconnection process, the project will use the extended magnetohydrodynamics with embedded particle-in-cell (MHD-EPIC) method.  MHD-EPIC uses the efficient MHD code for most of the global system.\r\n\r\nThe Geospace models of the SWMF will eventually be transferred to operation at the Space Weather Prediction Center of the National Weather Service. Also, the SWMF is publicly available to other researchers.",

These simulations applied realistic radiative cooling to reproduce super-adiabatic temperature gradients that drive convective flows and reproduce photospheric granular convection. The computational domain extends to a depth of 30 Mm, sufficient to capture super granular convective cells, and spans 24 x 16 degrees (300 x 200 Mm) enough to describe large-scale solar active regions. With this numerical model, we performed the largest ever simulations of magnetic flux emergence and active region formation. We simulated the buoyant rise of magnetic flux ropes from deep in the convection zone, and passing through the convection zone into the corona, forming an active region. The simulations demonstrate rapid and evolutionary sequence of events where magnetic flux buoyantly rises through the convection zone and first fragments and then later coalesces to form large concentrations of opposite polarity. We find organized horizontal flows driven by the Lorentz force take the form of shearing motions, which transport free energy from the convection zone into the corona magnetic field. We have demonstrated that this is the mechanism by which non-potential magnetic fields evolve in the solar corona.<br /><br />We used the Blue Waters resources to study how the global and local plasma scales arerelated and how the numerical simulations can be sped up. Our findings based on manytwo-dimensional simulations suggest that one can artificially increase the kinetic scalesand still retain the correct solution: while the local kinetic processes are scaled uplinearly both spatially and temporally, the global dynamics remains unchanged as long asthere is sufficient separation between the local and global scales.This study plays a crucial role in allowing global magnetospheric simulationswith an embedded kinetic model describing the localized magnetic reconnection process.For example, using a factor of 16 scaling, which is quite reasonable for the Earthmagnetosphere, the simulation can run 65000 times faster.
