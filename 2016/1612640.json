 "awd_abstract_narration": "Informal Science, Techology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) institutions seek to contribute to a scientifically literate culture, which includes new and innovative learning opportunities, a diverse community of scientists and science educators, equitable treatment for all, and the development of a well-trained workforce. In order to achieve these goals, informal STEM institutions must provide learning experiences that are welcoming and productive for all learners. The iPAGE model is a comprehensive program that prepares teams within informal STEM institutions to work with their colleagues to make their institutions more inclusive learning environments in which to learn, engage in, and identify with STEM. The project incorporates learning modules, workshops, site visits, and institution-specific activities all geared to build knowledge, awareness, and capacity related to creating inclusive environments at informal STEM institutions.\r\n\r\nThe core iPAGE model is based on the US Department of Agriculture's agricultural extension service. It includes a Knowledge-to-Action approach, in which individuals adapt what they learn to local contexts by assessing barriers to knowledge use, selecting and implementing interventions, evaluating outcomes, and sustaining ongoing efforts. Through cycles of design-based iteration, the project will improve its practice, learning modules, and theory of action. Through surveys, interviews, and case studies, the research team will document learning, barriers to implementation, and culture change as teams and institutions seek to become more welcoming, diverse, and inclusive institutions.\r\n\r\nThis project is being funded by the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program, which seeks to advance new approaches to, and evidence-based understanding of, the design and development of STEM learning in informal environments.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n \niPAGE was an AISL Innovations in Development effort conducted by the IDEAL Center at the Science Museum of Minnesota. The key strategic impact goal was development of an extension service model addressing the following needs: inclusion in Informal STEM Institutions (ISIs) and its relationship to broader participation in STEM; professional development (PD) for ISI professionals with respect to inclusion, diversity, equity, and access (IDEA); and a Knowledge-to-Action (KTA) model that works across a diversity of institutional sizes and structures. The model grew out of prior work in the K-12 sector (NSF award #1102903). The iPAGE model takes teams of strategically placed individuals within ISIs and prepares them to work with their colleagues to enact social change with respect to IDEA at their ISI.\nBroader Impacts: iPAGE delivered an iteratively field-tested extension service model focused on promoting institutional change through KTA diffusion strategies, including (1) a set of robust PD modules designed for ISI professionals  organized around the iPAGE Framework for Equity, which encompasesses three lenses for synthesizing research: Intersecting Systems of Oppression; Belief Systems in STEM and Education; and Leadership in Complex Systems; (2) methods for facilitating novel, intense, and sustained PD with ISI-based leadership teams resulting in paradigm shifts and associated changes in behavior at varying levels; (3) insight into preparing these leaders to use their knowledge in highly creative, non-linear ways within their ISIs; and (4) the means to establish a networked leadership community to support leaders as they promote institutional change. The strengths of the model are evidenced by the range of ISIs involved, variety of positions of participants, high retention rates, and research findings. From 2016-2021, iPAGE developed over 30 PD modules and worked with a total of 93 individuals from 18 ISIs. 17 sites participated across multiple years. \nIntellectual Merit:  iPAGE research created greater understanding of: (1) how and in what ways the iPAGE theory of action translated from K-12 formal education to a wide range of ISIs and the diverse roles of staff within these institutions; (2) the extent to which individuals' attitudes, knowledge, perceptions, and actions changed as a result of experiencing the iPAGE professional development; and (3) the kinds of institutional outcomes the theory of action produced or didn't produce at ISIs with respect to inclusive structures, policies, and practices.\nParticipant Impacts: Pre-post iPAGE PD data evidenced substantial changes in Individuals' attitudes, knowledge, and perceptions concerning equity-oriented behaviors with colleagues. Participants also reported greatly valuing this experience and being seen as leaders in IDEA. There is evidence that iPAGE built a network of ISE professionals working collectively on IDEA issues that had not existed for participants prior to iPAGE.  Interview data indicated that iPAGE PD empowered individuals by focusing on internal culture, providing tools and techniques, creating a community of practice, and normalizing an extended learning trajectory. There is also considerable evidence of mindset shifts and the perception of clear charges for action around all three of the Framework lenses. Case study findings found many instances of action for two of the three lenses -- systems of oppression and leadership for complex systems. However, for NoSTEM, the reported instances of action were far more isolated. Two challenges related to taking more action around NoSTEM are (1) there are limited models or tools for change concerning these IDEA and STEM challenges, and (2) change agents' positions and their individual and collective spheres of influence constrain their perception of agency and authority to take action. \nISI Impacts: The iPAGE  5-site case study focused on institutional outcomes with respect to inclusive structures, policies, and practices. The study uncovered a pattern of small successes overwhelmed by a number of persistent tensions that acted as impediments to IDEA implementation. These findings can be organized into two overarching themes.  The first theme is museums as dominant culture normative organizations. Examples of this theme are a reliance on staff training, existing organizational mission statements that do not explicitly emphasize IDEA, and discomfort with pushing beyond culturally dominant knowledge systems in STEM. The second theme is lived experiences of change. Examples of this theme include risk aversion, hierarchical power dynamics, and harm to and additional emotional labor for marginalized staff. \n\nImplications: Several areas have been identified for further development and/or research: (1) developing the model to be increasingly sector-specific; (2) critically examining the Nature and Culture of STEM as an essential part of realizing IDEA within the ISE sector; (3) preparing change agents for highly varied contexts and for making change in dominant culture normative organizations with many lived experiences of change; and (4) bringing about epistemological alignment of research, evaluation, and programs through consistent application of systems thinking and principles of adaptive change.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/02/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: E.
