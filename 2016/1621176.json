 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Discovery Research K-12 program (DRK-12) seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools (RMTs). Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects. This project will contribute to the Earth science education community's understanding of how engaging students with dynamic computer-based systems models supports their learning of complex Earth science concepts regarding Earth's surface phenomena and sub-surface processes. It will also extend the field's understandings of how students develop modeling practices and how models are used to support scientific endeavors. This research will shed light on the role uncertainty plays when students use models to develop scientific arguments with model-based evidence. The GEODE project will directly involve over 4,000 students and 22 teachers from diverse school systems serving students from families with a variety of socioeconomic, cultural, and racial backgrounds. These students will engage with important geoscience concepts that underlie some of the most critical socio-scientific challenges facing humanity at this time. The GEODE project research will also seek to understand how teachers' practices need to change in order to take advantage of these sophisticated geodynamic modeling tools. The materials generated through design and development will be made available for free to all future learners, teachers, and researchers beyond the participants outlined in the project. \r\n\r\nThe GEODE project will develop and research the transformational potential of geodynamic models embedded in learning progression-informed online curricula modules for middle school teaching and learning of Earth science. The primary goal of the project is to conduct design-based research to study the development of model-based curriculum modules, assessment instruments, and professional development materials for supporting student learning of (1) plate tectonics and related Earth processes, (2) modeling practices, and (3) uncertainty-infused argumentation practices. The GEODE software will permit students to \"program\" a series of geologic events into the model, gather evidence from the emergent phenomena that result from the model, revise the model, and use their models to explain the dynamic mechanisms related to plate motion and associated geologic phenomena such as sedimentation, volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, and deformation of strata. The project will also study the types of teacher practices necessary for supporting the use of dynamic computer models of complex phenomena and the use of curriculum that include an explicit focus on uncertainty-infused argumentation.",

While scientific knowledge of geoscience continues to expand and become more sophisticated, formal secondary education in geoscience is minimal for a majority of students. Despite the calls for engaging students actively in Earth science education, teaching geoscience poses significant challenges. Experiments with Earth&rsquo;s geology are impossible and the natural processes that shape the Earth take place out of sight, over unimaginably long times. As a result of these challenges, geoscience education is taught largely in a descriptive manner, with a heavy focus on naming and classifying eras and periods, rocks and minerals, the Earth&rsquo;s structure, landforms, and archaic landmasses and oceans.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>GEODE&rsquo;s guiding principle is that technology holds huge potential for revolutionizing geology education in grades 6-12. Geodynamic models make it possible for students to experiment with otherwise inaccessible concepts and help students gain insight into the causal mechanisms responsible for changes in Earth&rsquo;s surface. The goal of the GEODE project was to design transformational geodynamic modeling software and embed it into a curriculum module for middle and high school Earth science classes.&nbsp;GEODE focused on two areas: 1) helping students develop a causal, model-based, and scientific understanding of plate tectonics, and 2) transforming how teachers approach the topic, moving away from a &ldquo;bottom-up&rdquo; approach starting with rock and minerals, earthquakes, and volcanoes, to a model-based approach beginning with plate movement as the initial puzzling phenomena. Plate tectonics is, therefore, used to explain the formation of a variety of landforms such as the location of mountains, volcanoes, and deep ocean trenches as well as geologic phenomena such as where earthquakes and volcanic eruptions occur.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>The GEODE project developed the Seismic Explorer, a data visualization tool that shows real-world earthquake epicenters, volcanic eruptions, and plate motion data. With Seismic Explorer, students can explore seismic and volcanic eruption distribution patterns, compare these to landform distributions, and investigate earthquake depth patterns using cross-sections of Earth&rsquo;s crust. The project also developed Tectonic Explorer, a dynamic model of plate interactions on an Earth-like planet. In this web-based three-dimensional simulation, students can set up plate tectonic scenarios and witness plate interactions unfold. To support student thinking around sequences of events both at and below the surface, Tectonic Explorer includes a cross-section feature that makes previously invisible processes visible. Both tools are embedded in an online curriculum module that scaffolds investigations of real-world tectonic phenomena.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>The project developed a research instrument to measure students&rsquo; mechanistic reasoning about Earth&rsquo;s plate system. During three years of data collection over 1000&nbsp; teachers implemented the modules with over 64,000 students both within&nbsp; the United States and across the globe. Students significantly improved their mechanistic reasoning after engaging with the GEODE module. Using students&rsquo; images and written responses embedded in the module, the project developed a novel sequential reasoning framework to characterize how students use Tectonic Explorer to consider temporal reasoning.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>A Teacher Edition of the module allows teachers to preview the curriculum that their students will use, and access an additional layer of science content, pedagogical strategies, exemplar student answers, and discussion points to aid teachers during class time. The project collected log data from a group of teachers who implemented the module without formal teacher professional development and found that certain teacher characteristics and use patterns of these educative materials were correlated with higher student pre-to-post assessment gains.
