 "awd_abstract_narration": "Arctic terrestrial ecosystems exchange greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide and methane), water vapor, and energy with the atmosphere.  The balance between uptake and release of these quantities influences both the Arctic region and the global climate system.  The terrestrial cycling of carbon, water, and energy are strongly linked, and therefore need to be studied at the same time and in the same place. This project continues long-term measurements of carbon, water, and energy balance in terrestrial and freshwater systems in the Alaskan Arctic, extending measurements that began in 2007.  Carbon loss over the winter has recently increased dramatically at one of our study sites, as winter air and soil temperatures have warmed. This study will determine whether these losses continue and seek to understand the underlying causes. Broader impacts of this project include contributions to teaching and learning, including underrepresented groups, support of undergraduate summer research, participation in the Marine Biology Laboratory Logan Science Journalism program and the Arctic LTER Schoolyard program, and outreach to K-12 schools in Fairbanks, Alaska, and to Native Alaskan communities. This project will support career development of two female Principal Investigators at UAF.\r\n\r\nThe proposed research will extend continuous measurements of carbon, water, and energy balance in three tundra ecosystems near Imnavait Creek, Alaska. Ecosystem/atmosphere flux measurements have been collected at these sites via eddy covariance since 2007. Long-term monitoring of hydrology and stream chemistry of Imnavait Creek and depth of thaw in its catchment area will be maintained. Additional measurements to help interpret these data will include water table depth, plant community composition, and vegetation greenness via reflectivity, which is related to leaf area and biomass. Long-term measurements of stream chemistry and discharge are available at Imnavait, enabling comprehensive assessment of carbon budgets.  All data will be made publicly available and archived at the Arctic Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) web site, the International Arctic Research Center Data Archive, and the Advanced Cooperative Arctic Data and Information Service (ACADIS).\r\n",

The elements C and N are important because nitrogen is a key limiting nutrient for plant growth, and carbon in soils and surface waters is a source of greenhouse gases that are warming our planet. Knowing the controls on how these elements behave will allow us to better predict how a warming arctic system will feedback and impact the climate on Earth. For example, as currently frozen soils thaw, more carbon deeper in soils can be converted to greenhouse gases, and these gases are released to the atmosphere and increase temperatures on Earth. This increase in temperature in turn drives more thaw of frozen soils, more greenhouse gas release, and creates a positive feedback loop known as <em>Arctic Amplification</em>. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The first step in gauging the potential strength of an arctic amplification of global climate change is to measure how fast frozen soils are thawing. This project continued long-term data collection on the thawing of permafrost (permanently frozen) soils. Each summer in this part of the Alaskan tundra the surface soils thaw down to 50-100 cm depth, and then they refreeze in the fall. From 2003 to 2018 the average thaw depth in late summer increased almost 30% from 38 cm to 53 cm. In other measurements near this site, the temperature of the deeper permafrost has been rising, suggesting that this area is vulnerable and may be close to crossing a tipping point of even deeper and faster permafrost thaw.</p>\n<p>The second step in understanding the global impacts of a warming Arctic is to determine what controls the delivery of C and N from land to surface waters. This delivery is a major component of the global C and N cycles, fuels large releases of greenhouse gases from lakes and streams to the atmosphere, and moves substantial amounts of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nitrogen (DON) to the world&rsquo;s oceans. A critical nexus in this delivery is at the land-water interface, where small, headwater streams are dominant contributors of DOC and DON to larger watersheds. The unknowns in this debate on how and when the arctic C cycle will amplify global climate change are due in part to our limited understanding of how hydrology controls C and N transport. In this project we found that the delivery of DOC and DON from land to streams was controlled by how water moved in and out of surface soils. Specifically, we found that the humps and hollows created by tundra vegetation forced water at the soil surface flowing downslope back into the soil, causing a rapid exchange of C and N with deeper, more C and N-rich soil waters. In other words, the water <em>porpoises</em> from just above to just below the land surface and back again as it moves downslope.
