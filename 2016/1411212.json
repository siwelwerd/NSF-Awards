 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recently discovered topological phases in materials such as topological insulators have potential use in (quantum) computational devices that can out-perform standard microchip based computers. The most commonly encountered model for quantum computation, the quantum circuit model, requires challenging, if not impossible, accuracy on the hardware to be of practical value, due to local interactions of the system with the surrounding environment. The topological model based on exotic states of matter, while mathematically more complicated, has a built-in tolerance for such interactions. This research project studies mathematically the application of topological phases of matter to new computational paradigms with potentially significant benefit in quantum computation.\r\n\r\nIn this project the investigators study mathematical models for topological phases, focusing on their applications to topological quantum computation.  Topological phases of matter in two spatial dimensions are well-described in the framework of modular categories, but relatively little is known in three spatial dimensions.  A large part of this project is devoted to developing appropriate mathematical models in three spatial dimensions and analyzing the corresponding computational paradigms.  Specifically, the project will study (3+1)-dimensional topological quantum field theories and representations of the loop braid group, and symmetry enriched topological order and gauging symmetry.  In addition, because locality and universality are two desirable properties for quantum computation that are manifested in the representations of the braid group, this project also aims to formulate conjectures characterizing when these properties hold and to verify and adapt these conjectures where appropriate to better characterize physical and computational aspects.  To compare the computational power of topological quantum computers to that of classical computers, the project investigates the complexity of the most natural computation in this setting: topological invariants.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nFor the last year from 2018 to 2019, our research has produced 6 papers on fractons, leakage-free fibonacci gates, 2+1 quantum gravity as extended topological phases, and statistics of extended objects.  The central theme is topological phases beyond anyons such as fractons, black holes, and extended in three spacial dimensions.  Most of the papers are collaborations with students and postdocs.\n\nOn the topic of fractons, we first extended the famous Haah codes from the three torus to all three manifolds.  Then we constructed generalizations of the Haah B codes from two qubits local Hilbert space to any eveb number.\n\nIn the leakage free paper, we found a new algorithm to construct approximately entangling gates for the Fibonacci anyons.  We also provide evidence that no exact such gates would exist.\n\nIn the 2+1 gravity paper, we provide a proof that the Ising conformal field theory could be dual to quantum gravity with negative cosomological constant using all genus parition functions in the strongly coupled regime.  The argument assumes standard facts and based on new topological quantum field theory (TQFT) understanding of the Ising TQFT.\n\nIn the motion group paper, we sutdy the representations motion groups of links in the three sphere from the Dijkgraaf-Witten TQFTs.  In anyon theory, statistics of anyons are described by representations of the braid groups, which are motion groups of points in the disk.  The generelaization to loop excitations is the motion groups of liinks in the three sphere.  We provide evidence for a conejctural descritpion of such representations based on dimension reduction of TQFTs.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/02/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Zhenghan Wang"
