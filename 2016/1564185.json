 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project seeks to challenge the conventional abstract model of a high-speed network link as a single, logical point of attachment.  Instead, the proposed approach exposes the inherent parallelism that exists within the end host, network links, and the network fabric as a whole, to applications and the network control plane. The result is a network fabric consisting of a number of distinct physical networks that coexist within a single physical topology. By decoupling the channels making up network links, the project radically redesigns the network fabric to address today's requirements and challenges. A key hypothesis of this work is that composing multiple, potentially heterogeneous networks provides for greater scaling, performance, service quality, and manageability than maintaining the legacy fat-pipe link abstraction.\r\n\r\nThe proposed research will impact the broader community in four ways: (1) by addressing the societal need of large-scale networking infrastructure to support next-generation clusters and data centers, by (2) engaging with industry to help inform the design and construction of new devices, by (3) interacting with other scientific communities through interdisciplinary research, and by (4) engaging with graduate and undergraduate students to translate the resulting research into structured courses and hands-on learning experiences for traditionally under-represented\r\nstudent groups.",

While scaling individual servers and storage devices is simple, interconnecting them is increasingly hard, placing new challenges on the underlying network fabric. Housed in large-scale Internet ?datacenters?, these large networks push the limits of commercial packet switches. Because of limitations in the ability of these packet switches to scale to increasing fast link rates, operators have had to construct multi-chip <em>chassis</em> which serve to deliver what is in effect a high-radix, high-bandwidth switch platform, albeit at high cost and power demands. The goal of this project has been to dramatically reduce the cost, energy, and complexity of high-speed datacenter networks by instead restructuring the network fabrics as entirely parallel designs. Rather than relying on multi-chip chassis to implement the abstraction of a single link, instead we expose the inherent parallelism of the underlying packet switch chips, much like modern PCs expose the inherent parallelism of multi-core CPUs to the operating system and application programs. Furthermore, by scaling network bandwidth through parallelism, we permit novel designs that compose entirely homogeneous parallel networks, entirely heterogeneous parallel networks, or interestingly a combination of networks into a single logical, though physically parallel, network interconnect. The end result is a network capable of higher bandwidth than existing networks at lower power and cost, due primarily to requiring fewer merchant silicon packet switch chips per endhost.</p>\n<p>The goal of this project is to support parallel endhost network stacks, network interfaces, and transport protocols that support disjoint parallel dataplanes. We began by evaluating the performance of Intel?s DPDK userlevel network stack for injecting packets into each of the dataplanes, acting as a software NIC device. In particular, we focused on the effect of the memory hierarchy on software NIC performance. Focusing on the BESS[1] software NIC framework, we found that up to 10 or 40-Gb/s it performed well, but past then the packet rate was too high to entirely control in software. Our next major investigation looked at the applicability of FPGA-based NICs to precise control over packet injection into parallel dataplanes. Here we found that the FPGA was capable, however careful attention has to be paid to where the source (or destination) data resides in the memory hierarchy. We have shown that careful use of Intel?s ISA-level cache control instructions are necessary to ensure that data is accessible at next-generation network speeds.</p>\n<p>We next evaluated the choice of transport/routing protocol for selecting paths through the dataplanes, and placing packets onto each of those paths. What we found was that the standard ECMP-based path selection approach, common to folded-Clos topologies, resulted in lower-than-expected performance when considering parallel homogeneous folded-Clos networks. The reason for the low performance was the explosion of paths.
