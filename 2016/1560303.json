 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site program at the University of South Florida (USF), offers state-of-the-art, inter-disciplinary research experiences in functional materials, especially, nanomaterials and hybrid composite materials, to diverse and talented cohorts of undergraduates, from institutions with limited or no research opportunities. Functional materials and structures with novel properties and functionalities continue to be developed, however much engineering innovation is required to translate them into products useful to society. The goal of this project is to provide research opportunities to allow exploration of reproducible, scalable and economically viable processes using interdisciplinary engineering approaches within the facilities available at the Functional Materials Research Institute (FMRI), the location of this project at USF. Examples of research topics are the areas of 2D nanomaterials, which have potential for large-scale revolutions in optoelectronics, photocatalysis and photovoltaics, and hybrid composite materials for additive manufacturing, and potential for the fabrication of a variety of structures, shapes and sizes from the nano to macro worlds.  The anticipated outcome of this project is a new generation of materials science and engineering researchers who can put together the interdisciplinary skills and approaches necessary to translate the large national investments made in the development of nano and hybrid materials over the past two decades into products.  It is expected that the participants will be motivated towards graduate school and will develop skills common to methodologies involved in the process of engineering innovation. Beyond the research opportunities planned for the participants, activities are planned to promote improved communication and mentoring skills for the  students and faculty. \r\n\r\nThis REU Site offers undergraduates, in collaboration with USF FMRI faculty and graduate students, opportunities to conduct research during a 10-week summer program, on state-of-the-art technologies and advanced research projects on functional materials. In addition to their research, students will participate in research seminars, research meetings, and professional development seminars. The seminars will include topics such as improving written and oral communication skills, technical presentations, graduate education, career paths, and ethics in science and engineering. The 10-week program will be co-located with the on-going NSF Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) Site and the Research Experiences for High School Students (REHSS) which will leverage synergies between the programs. The discoveries made during these collaborations will be communicated to the broader scientific community via publications and presentations.",
