Political science is one of the most male and Anglo dominated fields of study in the social sciences. Descriptive representation within the academic profession is important to perceptions of legitimacy, service to students, and development of knowledge. The goal of the conference is to provide attendees the necessary skills and networks to enter the academy, successfully achieve tenure and sustain their careers thereafter. This workshop brings together scholars from different universities, at different stages in their careers, to deepen intellectual engagement and to build coalitions that support excellence in diversifying the political science profession. \r\n\r\nTechnical Summary\r\n\r\nDescriptive representation within the academic profession is important to perceptions of legitimacy, service to students, and development of knowledge.

This workshop brings together scholars from different universities, at different stages in their careers, to deepen intellectual engagement and to build coalitions that support excellence in diversifying the political science profession. The workshop includes an opening plenary session that focuses on the development of intersectionality work in the discipline and a discussion of the discipline and the role of women of color therein. It also includes a series of breakout sessions that focus on various aspects of academic development. The workshop will facilitate deep mentoring by pairing graduate students, junior, and mid-career participants by interest, with structured one-on-one mentoring time embedded into the schedule.",

The goal of WCPS15 was to provide attendees the necessary knowledge, skills and networks to enter the academy, successfully achieve tenure and sustain their careers thereafter. It brought together scholars from different universities, at different stages in their careers, to deepen intellectual engagement and to build coalitions that support excellence in diversifying the political science profession. WCPS15 hosted 78 women of color in political science and consisted of 12 panel sessions, a plenary, a mentoring lunch, and a keynote address.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The 21 women faculty presenters contacted about WCPS15 almost unanimously gave their immediate and enthusiastic support. They recognized the importance and value of the networking and mentoring themes of the workshop, and helped encourage the junior women from their universities to attend. During the workshop two surveys were administered to all in attendance, and all were invited to participate in focus groups the following morning. On September 3, 2015 several focus groups were held and data was collected.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>One significant outcome of the workshop was that&nbsp;<strong>participants overwhelmingly reported that the workshop stimulated important dialogue surrounding critical issues related to their experience</strong>. Specifically they indicated that WCPS15 content provided strategies for success in academia. Many junior and graduate student women were able to identify both peer and senior mentors at the workshop, and received helpful advice from the administrators, panelists, and other participants.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>Several important themes for the retention of junior women faculty emerged at WCPS15. Based on our pre- and post- workshop survey results, participants learned essential skills for advancement in academia and beyond. The response category for each question included a Likert scale: 1: Not at all confident, 2: A little confident 3: Somewhat confident, 4: Fairly confident, and 5: Very confident. The survey findings in the table below demonstrate growth across all areas covered by content in the workshop, and significant (more than 1 unit increase) in seven categories including: post-tenure strategies for advancement, getting tenure, becoming an administrator, negotiating a job offer, public intellectualism, navigating the job market, and careers outside academia.
