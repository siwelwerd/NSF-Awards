 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests partial support for an international symposium on Insect Effects on Ecosystem Services, to be held in conjunction with the International Congress of Entomology in Orlando, FL, September 25-30, 2016. Most (82%) of the support requested here would be used to recruit and support the participation of graduate students and early career scientists from under-represented groups at U.S. institutions, with a small amount of funds also requested for immediate follow-up activities. All of the participants in this symposium would also be able to attend the larger Congress. The balance of anticipated support for the symposium is being sought from other sources. The topic of the symposium is of major societal interest and has broad potential for impacting land management decisions. This award will ensure that graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and/or other early career scientists can attend and/or give talks or present posters at the meeting. Specific attention will be placed on the recruitment of individuals from underrepresented groups in science in the U.S. Funds may also be used to support travel for a speaker from an underdeveloped country that would also enhance diversity. The co-organizer is from Germany, although no support is sought here for his participation.\r\n\r\nThis symposium is designed to allow for intensive interaction among participants and to facilitate new interdisciplinary interactions and collaborations. The topics chosen are especially ripe for such collaborations and also represent topics of much current interest. The organizing committee and selected speakers include an early career female from the U.S. and other U.S. participants some supported on other related projects by NSF, along with a suitably wide range of international scientists.",
