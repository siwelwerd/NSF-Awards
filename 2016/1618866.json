 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many data sets can profitably be viewed as points in a\r\nhigh-dimensional space: think of employee salary and seniority,\r\nweather stations' hourly reports of temperature, humidity, wind speed,\r\nand direction, or even the images from your cellphone camera as color\r\nvalues per pixel.  Geometric retrieval problems seek to preprocess\r\nmulti-dimensional geometric data for rapid access; for two examples,\r\n\"nearest neighbor queries\" could find images similar to a query image,\r\nand \"range queries\" could find all times with temperature and humidity\r\nabove given thresholds.  These queries are of fundamental importance throughout\r\nengineering and science, and have applications in knowledge discovery\r\nand data mining, pattern recognition and classification, machine\r\nlearning, data compression, multimedia databases, document retrieval,\r\nand statistics.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe high computational complexity of nearest neighbor and range queries in high dimensions has\r\ninspired research into approximate solutions. The work of this project\r\ndeepens and broadens our understanding of the computational\r\ncomplexity of these two problems. It studies new, more efficient solutions to\r\nkey special cases, including\r\nlow-complexity approximations to convex bodies, faster algorithms for\r\npolytope membership queries, applications to approximate nearest\r\nneighbor searching, efficient approximation algorithms for Euclidean\r\nminimum spanning trees, and range searching with structural queries.\r\nThese improved algorithms will lead to more efficient solutions in the\r\napplications described above.\r\n\r\n\r\nSoftware systems and libraries developed as part of this project will be\r\nmade freely available over the Web to help scientists and engineers in\r\nother disciplines. The algorithms developed as a part of this project\r\nwill be incorporated into graduate and undergraduate courses at the\r\nUniversity of Maryland. Course materials will be made available over the\r\nWeb as a resource for researchers interested in learning more about this\r\narea.",
