 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this program is to build a large array of low frequency radio antennas to study neutral hydrogen emission emitted at a frequency of 1420 MHz. This emission originated during the \"epoch of reionization,\" when the universe transitioned from being predominantly neutral gas to being highly ionized. HERA, the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array, will consist of 240 14-m parabolic dishes operating at observing frequencies from 50 to 250 MHz at the South African Square Kilometer Array site. HERA will be sensitive to hydrogen at great distances, shifted downward in radio frequency by the expansion of the universe. Broader impacts of the work include training of undergraduate and graduate students, and increased participation of underrepresented minorities in STEM research.  The program for underrepresented minorities has two elements: an annual 10-week summer research program involving undergraduates and graduate students from the US and South Africa working on HERA science, and a series of training workshops for high school teachers with the involvement of the undergraduates.\r\n\r\nThe HERA project will attempt to make the first detection of the distribution of the neutral Intergalactic Medium (IGM) between redshifts z=6-12 at the end of the epoch of reionization, possibly extending to z=30 if the required sensitivity at a frequency of 50 MHz is achieved. This will enable the three dimensional power-spectrum of the 21cm hydrogen line from the primordial IGM to be established. Eventually HERA is expected to image the bubbles of ionized gas expanding out from newly formed galaxies and quasars.",

Cosmic Dawn marks the formation of the first stars and galaxies roughly 100 Million years after the Big Bang, when the Universe was only a small fraction of its current age and culminates in the Epoch of Reionization when the intergalactic medium is fully reionized. By measuring how these stars interacted with their enveloped hydrogen clouds, HERA will tell us when the first stars formed, what they may have looked like, and will reveal how these sources grew over cosmic time. HERA construction is nearly complete, with full-science operations slated to commence in 2022. However, data taken by a partially-completed HERA in 2018 is already shedding new light on the cosmos. A recent analysis of this HERA data in its partial configuration has set new, world-leading constraints on the radio signals from Cosmic Dawn. These constraints go further than any other telescope in constraining the high-energy X-ray properties of the first black holes formed during Cosmic Dawn, telling us that primordial hydrogen must have been heated by these black holes. This analysis is promising as HERA nears its full deployment, which will dramatically improve its sensitivity with the hope of revolutionizing our understanding of how the first stars and black holes formed and grew in the early Universe.<br />Partner institutions are: University of California Berkeley, Arizona State University, University of California Los Angeles, University of Cambridge (UK), Massachusetts Institute of Technology, McGill University (Canada), National Radio Astronomy Observatory, Queen Mary University of London (UK), University of Pennsylvania, Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa (Italy), South African Radio Astronomy Observatory (South Africa), University of Washington.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 01/18/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Aaron&nbsp;R&nbsp;Parsons</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1636646/1636646_10460659_1642537043089_hera_aerial--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1636646/1636646_10460659_1642537043089_hera_aerial--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"HERA\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1636646/1636646_10460659_1642537043089_hera_aerial--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"HERA\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A satellite view of the HERA telescope in the Karoo Desert, South Africa.
