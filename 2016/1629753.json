 "awd_abstract_narration": "A request is made to fund new and replacement instrumentation on the R/V Endeavor, a 185? general purpose research vessel operated by the University of Rhode Island as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) research fleet.\r\n\r\nThe R/V Endeavor is a well-equipped, intermediate sized research vessel that is owned by NSF and operated under a Charter Party Agreement by the University of Rhode Island. The vessel was built in 1976 and refit in 1993 and can carry up to 17 scientists on cruises up to 30 days in duration. The vessel supports projects from all disciplines of oceanography.  In 2015, R/V Endurance completed 251 days at sea. NSF funded projects accounted for 73 days or 29% of the total sailing schedule. In 2016, R/V Endeavor is scheduled for 197 days with NSF days accounting for 45% (89 days) of the total sailing schedule.\r\n\r\nShipboard Scientific Support Equipment (SSSE)  requested in this proposal includes\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\nViking Life Rafts\t         $19,482\r\nImperial Immersion Suits\t$11,650\r\n\t\t         $31,132\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\t\r\nThe principal impact of the present proposal is under Merit Review Criterion 2 of the Proposal Guidelines (NSF 13-589). It provides infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF).  The acquisition,  maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.",
