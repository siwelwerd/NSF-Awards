Its usefulness makes its generation, manipulation and detection a critical task faced by the photonics community. There has not been any research on the guided wave approach to the generation, manipulation and detection of radiation in the long wavelength range of 20-60 micrometers, and therefore we feel that the proposed research will help to start this new and exciting field.  To achieve the overarching goal on creating long wavelength radiation, its manipulation and detection on a chip, we aim to identify materials and construct optical difference-frequency generating devices, develop compact laser sources for difference-frequency generation, and construct integrated long wavelength signal processors on a chip.  The ability to generate, manipulate and detect long wavelength radiation on a chip will have a significant impact on numerous applications including absorption spectroscopy, imaging and optical communications. The proposed research will not only advance the basic science and technology of chip-scale integrated far infrared radiation systems, but will also enable exploration of novel applications in biology, chemistry, security, physics, and astronomy. The project will provide scientific training for students at graduate and undergraduate levels as well as contribute to outreach, education and collaborative efforts with San Diego middle and high schools. Through our relationships with the Sweetwater, Preuss, and High Tech High Schools, we will continue to successfully engage students of diverse ethnicity, gender and economic backgrounds in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM). \r\n(Technical) \r\nRadiation with wavelengths ranging from 20 to 60 micrometers has a wide range of applications in such fields as biology, chemistry, security, physics, and astronomy. Its usefulness makes its generation, manipulation and detection a critical task faced by the photonics community. The state of the art of the technology in this spectral range of optical radiation is in embryonic state with the current research focused on free space realizations.  The generation of long wavelength  radiation typically exploits frequency mixing using near-infrared laser sources and produces power levels of about tens of nanowatts, limited by phase matching and corresponding interaction length for free space implementations.  Moreover, efficient detection of long wavelength radiation also imposes a critical challenge. It is evident that guided wave realizations on a chip will have a huge impact on advancing photonics in long wavelength spectral range because it allows engineering hybrid material structures with large nonlinearities and transparency, which together with engineering phase matching will enable efficient generation, transmission and detection of long wavelength radiation.  The overall goal of this proposal is to establish chip-scale integrated technology for  generation, manipulation and detection of optical radiation in the wavelength range of 20-60 micrometers. Specifically, our objectives aim to comprehensively understand and experimentally demonstrate: (1) various material platforms with properties necessary for transmission and efficient difference-frequency generation compatible with chip-scale realizations, (2) characteristics of the down-selected materials, including their nonlinear damage thresholds, (3) compact laser sources for difference-frequency generation in selected materials, and (4) designs and fabrication methodology of guided wave configurations with engineered phase matching for efficient generation and detection of the long wavelength radiation.  The proposed chip-scale integrated long wavelength processors will have a significant impact on numerous applications including absorption spectroscopy, imaging and optical communications. The proposed research will not only advance the basic science and technology of chip-scale integrated far infrared systems, but will also enable exploration of novel applications in biology, chemistry, security, physics, and astronomy.",
