 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigators outline a summer seminar (workshop), specifically for HBCU engineering faculty (i.e., tenured associate professors) and undergraduate students (i.e., rising juniors). The overall intent of the seminar is to increase the number of underrepresented faculty in engineering; amplify collaborative opportunities between HBCU engineering faculty and National Science Foundation (NSF)-funded Engineering Research Centers (ERCs) faculty; and expose HBCU students to tips and strategies for preparing and applying to engineering graduate programs, particularly at ERC-funded institutions. Generally speaking, the seminar project offers an abundance of opportunities, where HBCU engineering faculty and students are able to network with each other as well as their ERC peers. Further, the project presents immense potential to establish strong collaborations between HBCU engineering faculty and engineering faculty at NSF-funded ERCs. It also offers great broadening participation opportunities for HBCU students to be exposed to ERC engineering faculty and the different opportunities available at the ERC institutions. This workshop is timely because of its potential to broadening participation in engineering, particularly at NSF-funded ERC institutions.\r\n\r\nIn regard to HBCU engineering faculty, the seminar will provide critical information that will help associate professors to continue to make successful progress towards promotion to the rank of professor. Further, faculty participants will be provided coaching and assistance with portfolio development and will be exposed to various research and grant opportunities at the NSF and other potential grant and research collaborative opportunities at NSF-funded ERCs, and, specifically to HBCU undergraduate students, the seminar will offer specific strategies and tips for applying for engineering graduate programs, particularly at NSF-funded ERC institutions. It will also provide these students with information on preparing for the GRE, applying for financial support, and completing a competitive graduate application.",

The HBCU Summer Engineering Faculty and Student Seminar engaged in targeted activities to help:  1) increase the number of African American professors or faculty of color in engineering; 2) enhance collaborative opportunities (i.e. competitive research funding) between HBCU engineering faculty and the National Science Foundation?s Engineering Research Centers (ERCs); and 3) provide African American or  engineering students of color with exposure to creative and diverse approaches to enhance their application for graduate school (i.e. research programs, internships).  The HBCU Summer Engineering Faculty and Student Seminar integrated professional expertise from three faculty mentors, three ERCs, and two field experts to support the preparedness of engineering faculty of color to become Professor-Ready and engineering students of color to become Graduate-School Ready.\n\nThe intellectual merit of the HBCU Summer Engineering Faculty and Student Seminar was convened to address the underrepresentation of black and African American professors and undergraduate  students in the engineering discipline. According to the American  Society for Engineering Education (2014), black and African American professors comprise 1.6 percent at four-year institutions  (12,659-total) and 2.5% of Associate Professors (7,337-total).

The underrepresentation of engineering faculty of color who have achieved the rank of professor and engineering students of color in the graduate school pipeline require targeted efforts toward advancing the diversification of career pathways in engineering.   \n\nA survey shows that HBCU Summer Engineering Faculty and Student Seminar succeeded in providing tenured HBCU engineering faculty who are Associate Professors with an informative seminar to ensure they would be Professor-Ready and that undergraduate students would be Graduate-School Ready. A total of 10 faculty and six students completed the pre- and post-seminar surveys and using frequency of responses, key highlights include:\n\nNine of the 10 faculty and five of the six students indicated the seminar was extremely or somewhat valuable.  \nEight of the 10 faculty indicated they were prepared to go up for promotion to professor within the next two academic years compared to four of the 10 faculty who indicated they were prepared to do so in the pre-seminar survey. Faculty believed the seminar provided the tools and knowledge they needed to pursue advancement to the rank of professor.\nFive of the six students strongly agreed they will apply to graduate school within one academic year following completion of their undergraduate engineering programs compared to the four of the six students who strongly agreed in the pre-seminar survey.\n\n\nThe broader impact of the HBCU Summer Engineering Faculty and Student Seminar will be the likelihood that more associate proessors fromt his group will move to the professorial rank and that more of this group of undergraduates will be successful and apply to graduate school in engineering.  The broader impact of the seminar, too, will be the increased possibility that additional students from underrepresented groups will have an opportunity to study with a college professor who looks like them.  The experience and findings will also better prepare the principal investigator and the Office of Access and Success at the Association of Public and Land-grant Universities to guide future similar projects. \n\nUsing frequency of responses from the 10 faculty and six students, other key highlights from the seminar include:\n\nEight of the 10 faculty strongly agreed or agreed they understood the elements needed to construct a strong dossier for advancement to the rank of professor compared to four of the 10 faculty in the pre-seminar survey.  Faculty believed the seminar provided the tools and knowledge they needed to better pursue professorships. \nSix of the six students stated they understood the graduate school search process  compared to four of the six students who strongly disagreed or disagreed in the pre-seminar  survey. \n10 of the 10 faculty indicated they strongly agreed or agreed in understanding the benefit of networking in the engineering field to strengthen their professional activities and advance to the rank of Professor compared to four of the 10 faculty who strongly agreed or agreed in the pre-seminar survey.\n\n\nThe HBCU Summer Engineering Faculty and Student Seminar provided important opportunities to learn more about the advancement to professor and graduate school in the field of engineering.  Both faculty and students must have the appropriate knowledge and transferable experiences to be successful in these areas. Having access to these forms of social and cultural capital contribute to practical efforts to diversify the academic pipeline.   \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/29/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Rosusan D Bartee"
