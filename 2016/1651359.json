The goal of this project is to understand if patches that contain small nozzles (known as \"microneedles\") can detect infection by Zika virus. This technology may allow healthcare providers to improve management and treatment of patients who present with Zika-like symptoms. \r\n\r\nThis project involves creating electrodes that can detect components of the Zika virus. These electrodes will be combined with microneedles to create inexpensive, painless, and portable patches. The program will examine the functionality of the microneedle-containing patches with Zika component-containing blood and skin.",
