 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-technical: \r\nThis CAREER award made by the Biomaterials program in the Division of Materials Research to Clemson University will study the development of artificial implant materials with modified surfaces. These coatings are expected to resist deterioration and failure of implant materials by actively decreasing the circulating oxygen-induced material damage. The human immune system reacts to an artificial implant, such as a replacement hip or knee joint, by attacking it and degrading it chemically. Eventually, this implant could fail and then need to be repaired or replaced, and involves surgeries that could be too risky for many elderly and infirm patients. The immune system could still attack an artificial implant even under rigorously sterile conditions and even with \"inert\" materials, such as stainless steel. The studies carried out with this NSF CAREER award would lead to development of artificial implants with novel coatings that resist failure by actively preventing their chemical degradation. The proposed research would benefit society significantly by: (1) extending the functional lifetimes of artificial implants; (2) reducing morbidity and mortality risks, particularly among elderly and infirm patients; and (3) decreasing pain and inflammation that occur after implantation. This investigator plans to integrate the research activities of college students into this research. Additionally, K-12 teachers will be offered a summer course designed to help them incorporate biomaterial topics into their K-12 science classes. This award will address the current shortfall in science, technology, engineering and mathematics degrees by fostering interest in and successful completion of these degrees by underserved and underrepresented students. This award is co-funded by the Physiology, Mechanisms & Biomechanics program in the Division of Integrative Organismal Systems, and Emerging Frontiers program, both in the Directorate for Biological Sciences. \r\n\r\nTechnical: \r\nHuman implantation of an artificial material into a human triggers the foreign body reaction (FBR), which leads to adhering of macrophages to the artificial implant materials (AIM) and damaging them via the release of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Eventually, ROS-induced AIM damage could cause the implant to fail, necessitating additional surgical procedures that could result in high morbidity and mortality risks. These hazards are currently unavoidable, as the FBR occurs under even rigorously sterile conditions and the accompanying ROS damages in chemically-inert implant materials such as stainless steel and fluoropolymer plastics. This CAREER award would enable the development of biocompatible AIMs that resist deterioration and failure of implants by actively decreasing ROS-induced material damage. The first aim of the project is to covalently link self-regenerating catalyst coatings based on N-heterocyclic carbine-ruthenium complexes to artificial implant materials such as polymers [poly(methyl methacrylate), polyethylene, polypropylene, etc.] and inorganic materials (hydroxyapatite, titanium, titania, stainless steel, etc.). In addition to the preparation of large number of substrates with catalyst coatings, linker systems and surface loadings, these modified implant materials will be tested against different cell cultures/media to establish the ability of these immobilized catalysts to reduce reactive oxygen before and after exposure to cells for up to two weeks. The second aim of this award is: a) to study damage to implant materials under simulated FBR conditions in vitro; and b) to visualize and quantify the production of ROS and inflammatory cytokines of macrophages reacting to catalytically active substrates. Additionally, this CAREER award would also contribute in reducing the STEM degree shortfall facing the U.S., particularly among underserved and underrepresented minority students, by integrating technical college students into biomaterials research, and teaching biomaterial concepts and topics to K-12 science teachers.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nHuman medical implants can be damaged by the immune system, in some instances featuring immune cells attacking the implant materials with oxidants that disrupt the chemical bonds within those materials.  Antioxidants can react with and eliminate these oxidants before they can damage implant materials, however, at the onset of the proposed work, all reported examples of antioxidant-functionalized materials employed antioxidants that were consumed through irreversible reactions.  As a result, the protection from these antioxidants was transient and eventually exhausted by a prolonged immune response.  To achieve the necessary sustained protection against oxidants, a new strategy was required to enable an antioxidant to be regenerated after each reaction with an oxidant. \n\n \n\nThis award enabled the development of antioxidant catalysts that can consume thousands of oxidant molecules per molecule of catalyst, thereby affording substantially greater protection against oxidants.  Mechanistic studies revealed that these catalysts could be readily regenerated using natural biomolecules ubiquitous in living systems, without the need for any additional synthetic drugs.  Impressively, these catalysts could react with and consume one oxidant molecule, and subsequent reaction with a second oxidant molecule would then regenerate the active catalysts.  In this manner, these antioxidant catalysts could protect against a wide variety of oxidants in a wide variety of environments in biological systems.  Modifying the peripheral structure of these catalysts endowed them with the functionality to bind to the surfaces of materials commonly found in human medical implants.  The best-performing antioxidant catalyst developed during the course of this award exhibited catalytic activity, stability, and selectivity orders of magnitude superior to the best-performing analogs reported in the literature. \n\n \n\nThe results of the work performed under this award have been disseminated via publications in high-impact, peer-reviewed scientific journals, presentations at national and international scientific conferences, and invited seminars at academic institutions in the US and worldwide.  Education and training opportunities have also provided for undergraduate students, graduate students, and K-12 science teachers, both through traditional lecture course format, as well as through hands-on research and lab activities.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/29/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Andrew G Tennyson"
