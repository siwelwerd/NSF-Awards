 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research project will be in availability of high performance, affordable structures made from manufactured concrete block.  These structures include roofs, such as domes, arches, cylinders, spheres, and more.  The high efficiency of concrete block manufacturing will be used to create an entirely new range of products from concrete block.  This novel technology will help grow the block manufacturing industry, the construction industry, and will provide the end user with a high performing, affordable, low maintenance, and attractive and efficient construction system suitable for multiple applications.  The applications for this construction method include significant public infrastructure works, such as bridges, tunnels, levees, breakwaters, and sea walls.  This technology is expected to benefit homeowners, businesses, and local, state and federal government agencies.  The innovation will enhance the use of manufactured block by optimizing the strength of articulated interlocking features created during production.  This system will optimize the high compressive strength of manufactured concrete block in robust and easy to install applications.  The introduction of vaulted arches, domes, spheres and cylinders made from concrete block will provide great economic value for society and economic growth for the country.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will research manufacturing of the interlocking block design on a standard block machine, using a baseline standard mix.  The mix design will be changed along 3 variables: (1) amount of cement used; (2) amount of pozzolanic material used ;(3) and size and amounts of aggregate used.  These variables will be used to provide high and low settings for a Taguchi array, for analysis of properties measured, including any combined effects. These variables will have the effects of their high and low settings on evaluation of microstructure; examination of the effects of aggregate segregation within the Concrete Manufacturing Unit (CMU) at critical locations; and evaluation of how microstructure varies with cement type and cement content. This will be achieved by taking a critical piece of the interlocking key and keyway features mechanical testing rig. The results of this testing will allow a statistical analysis of stress concentration as a function of 3 variables on mold-filling. This data will determine the properties of bend strength and crack growth at the critical location within the CMU's.  This information will allow the block-maker to implement any slight adjustment to their concrete mix design to ensure optimum block strength.",
