 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supports the 8th international Gordon Research Conference titled \"Biogenic Hydrocarbons and the Atmosphere.\"  Biogenic hydrocarbons are volatile compounds that are released naturally by vegetation and play an important role in ecosystems and atmospheric chemistry across a variety of scales. The interdisciplinary conference program will be of interest to a broad suite of scientific communities, including (1) biologists, (2) ecosystem ecologists, and (3) atmospheric scientists.  The conference will impact society by improving the understanding of biosphere-atmosphere trace gas exchange and the role of human activities in global environmental change.\r\n\r\nDuring the conference, participants will explore newly emerging research topics including root emissions, communication between plants and fungi, airborne investigations of hydrocarbon and related fluxes, surfactant chemistry of isoprene, and the influence of biogenic hydrocarbons on aerosol formation processes. The main uncertainties that the meeting will address include the biological formation and function of biogenic hydrocarbons, the ecological consequences of biogenic hydrocarbons, and the impact of biogenic hydrocarbons on atmospheric chemistry and climate. The conference is scheduled to take place at the PGA Catalunya Business and Convention Centre in Girona-Costa Brava Spain from June 26 - July 1, 2016.",
