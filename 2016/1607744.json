 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broad goal of this research project is to use the tools of topology and geometry to help molecular biologists and chemists better understand the structure and behavior of DNA, proteins, and complex synthetic molecules. The topological model under study would help molecular biologists by simplifying the analysis of the site-specific recombination mechanism for closed circular DNA molecules. The investigator also aims to identify the forms of knots, links, and non-planar graphs that arise in proteins, and to model how these complex structures may have occurred. This information may offer valuable insights into protein folding mechanisms and degradation pathways. Synthetic organic molecules are normally too small to see with an electron microscope; when chemists synthesize a complex structure they use data from nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to provide evidence that the molecular structure has a particular form. Since these structures are large enough to be somewhat flexible, both topology and geometry have to be taken into account when comparing the symmetry properties of the NMR data to those of a physical model. The investigator is working with organic chemists to identify different types of symmetries exhibited by complex structures and to design new structures with interesting symmetry properties. \r\n\r\nIn contrast with knots and links, whose topology depends exclusively on their embedding in the three dimensional sphere, the intrinsic structure of some graphs can affect the topological properties of every embedding of the graph in a given three dimensional manifold. For example, some graphs have the property that for any embedding G of the graph in a three-manifold M, there is no orientation reversing homeomorphism of the pair (M,G). Such a graph is said to be intrinsically chiral in M. The investigator will work on characterizing which graphs are intrinsically chiral in the three-sphere and in other three-dimensional manifolds, as well as determining other properties of embedded graphs which are independent of the particular embedding of the graph. The project draws on three-manifold results including Jaco-Shalen and Johannson characteristic decompositions, Mostow's rigidity theorem, Thurstons' hyperbolization theorem, and the classification of Seifert manifolds, as well as techniques from knot theory and the theory of tangles.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual merit\n\nThis project was largely focused on a topological analysis of proteins.  Misfolded proteins can lead to aggregation and have been implicated in numerous diseases, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and other prion-based diseases. Even though there are many in silico and in vitro ways to investigate protein folding, details about why some proteins misfold are still not known. It has been suggested that entangled proteins take longer to fold and are more likely to misfold, leading to increased degradation.  A deep understanding of the folding process for such proteins could produce insights into why and how misfolding occurs more generally.  \n\n \n\nA major outcome of the project was the development a new model for how protein knots fold.  The only previously developed model of knot folding predicts that all protein knots are twist knots. However, the PI's new model describes a more general mechanism that could produce a much larger class of knots.  In fact, the new protein structure database AlphaFold indicates that there do exist knotted proteins containing non-twist knots, which this new model could apply to.\n\n \n\nThe PI also considered metalloprotein structures, many of which are non-planar because they contain either a K_3,3 or K_5 subgraph.   Metalloproteins as diverse as nitrogenase, cyclotides, and nerve growth factor all contain a K_3,3 in the form of a 3-rung Mobius Ladder.  The question is whether we should expect all metalloproteins containing a K_3,3 to have this form.  The PI modeled embeddings of K_3,3 in metalloproteins by random linear embeddings of K_3,3 in a cube and found that the probability of the embedding having the form of a Mobius Ladder is more than 97%.  This could explain why all known K_3,3's contained in metalloproteins have this form.\n\n \n\nBroader Impact\n\nThe PI led a group of seven faculty in a REUF (Research for Undergraduate Faculty) project.  Two of the participants are on the faculty of HBCUs, two others are Black, and one is Latinx.  The project is in an area of research that can be pursued by undergraduates, with the goal that these seven participants will supervise related projects with undergraduates at their home institution.  The PI has continued to work with this group since 2018, and plans to submit a paper based on the project this year.\n\n \n\nIn addition, the PI supervised seven undergraduates at Pomona College in research projects that have led to publications.  She also was part of a group of six knot theorists who created a 954 page Encyclopedia of Knot Theory whose goal is to help undergraduates gain the necessary background to do research in knot theory.  She also guest edited a special issue of the interdisciplinary journal Symmetry on ``Topological Methods in Chemistry and Molecular Biology'' and wrote an article entitled ``The concept of chirality from a mathematical perspective'' that will be published by the Royal Society of Chemistry as part of a book entitled  Physical Principles of Chirality in NMR.\n\n \n\n \n\nThe PI gave 41 talks based on the project, including 10 talks targeted at undergraduates, and 6 talks targeted at biologists and/or chemists.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/29/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Erica L Flapan"
