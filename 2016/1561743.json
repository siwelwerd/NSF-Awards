 "awd_abstract_narration": "CSBR: Natural History: Development of the Arkansas Center for Biodiversity Collections to advance biodiversity research and education\r\n\r\nNatural history collections have played a central role in research, education, and outreach at Arkansas State University (A-State) for nearly 70 years. Housing more than 500,000 specimens, the combined collections at A-State represent an important record of regional biodiversity from the Interior Highlands, Mississippi Alluvial Plain, and Crowley's Ridge ecoregions of the southeastern United States. These collections are threatened by overcrowding, resulting in inefficient and limited use, and specimen degradation in some cases. This project unifies the eight collections at A-State into common spaces with new shelving, cabinetry, and a singular database under the newly formed Arkansas Center for Biodiversity Collections (ACBC). Improved access to the ACBC will increase opportunities to engage students in understanding the importance and utility of natural history collections, as well as enhance research opportunities for A-State students and the broader scientific community. Additionally, students of the A-State Natural History Collections Curation Club (NHC3) will work with curators to develop natural history displays and K-12 class field trip tours including biodiversity and specimen workshops to educate the underserved student populations in the region. Through active undergraduate and graduate student involvement, the ACBC will link research-grade natural history collections to the general public, particularly K-12 students.\r\n\r\nThe ACBC mission is to provide a unified, accessible specimen repository and research center for the State of Arkansas, including the Interior Highlands, Upper Mississippi Alluvial Plain, and Crowley's Ridge ecoregions. This geographical region is a major center of endemism for numerous taxonomic groups in eastern North America, and one that has seen drastic landscape modifications over the past 100 years. A large proportion of the collections at A-State cover these unique and diverse ecosystems and represent long-term records that pre-date or document biota during habitat transforming activities or disease spread (e.g., white-nose syndrome in bats) in the region. These collections, therefore, serve as base-line data points for ongoing and future changing conditions. Additionally, this project will preserve and curate voucher specimens and make available important data to the scientific community for small- and large-scale research (e.g., ecological, taxonomic, biogeographic, or applied global change research). Specific project goals are to: 1) alleviate overcrowding and increase room for growth through installation of high-density storage systems and new cabinetry; 2) secure collections through improved storage media and labeling; 3) complete the digitization of specimen data and provide public access to all collection data; and 4) develop a significant outreach program by providing collections-based workshops and tours of ACBC displays and collections. Development of a website for the ACBC (acbc.astate.edu) will highlight collection activities and the current Specify web portal (specify.astate.edu) will be expanded to include ASUMZ specimen data in addition to updated herbarium specimen data. Finally, the complete ACBC database will be interfaced with iDigBio (www.idigbio.org) and other publicly accessible data portals (i.e., VertNet, SERNEC, and GBIF).",

These collections represent a significant record of biodiversity for the State of Arkansas, including the Interior Highlands, Mississippi Alluvial Plain, and Crowley?s Ridge ecoregions of the southeastern United States. Prior to this project, these collections were threatened by overcrowding, resulting in inefficient and limited use, and in some cases, specimen degradation. In addition, much of this rich data source was hidden from the scientific community and general public.</p>\n<p>In 2015, curatorial faculty and staff initiated the vision to unify all eight natural history specimen collections at A-State into common spaces and a singular database under the newly formed Arkansas Center for Biodiversity Collections (ACBC). For the ACBC to reach its full potential, the collections had several immediate needs for improvement and organization, which exceeded the normal operating budget. Thus, the goals of this project were to (1) alleviate overcrowding and increase room for growth through installation of high-density storage systems and new cabinetry; (2) secure collections through improved storage media and labeling; (3) complete the digitization of specimen data and provide public access to all collection data; and (4) develop a significant outreach program by providing collections-based workshops and tours of ACBC displays and collections.</p>\n<p>One major achievement of this project was the installation of high-density shelving and cabinetry for the fishes, bivalves, reptiles, amphibians, and plant specimens (see attached images). This alleviated overcrowding in those collections and created more space for of our other ACBC collections. In addition, the reorganization of specimens in new spaces was accompanied by improvements to storage containers, conditions, and label media for specimens in immediate need. Based on the success of the project during early stages, the A-State Department of Biological Sciences allocated additional space for collections to the ACBC and provided renovation of those spaces to accommodate collection cabinets, a large outreach space, freezer room, specimen preparation areas, office, and additional storage spaces. In all, this newly acquired space adds 7 highly functional rooms (1,632 sq. ft.) to the ACBC.</p>\n<p>Natural history collections have long played an important role in the education of A-State students majoring in the Department of Biological Sciences and the Environmental Sciences Program. This project improved access and organization of research collections, enhanced research capability and products, including 10 scientific publications over the granting period. As a result of improved access to ACBC collections, students in the A-State Molecular Biosciences PhD program are making use of specimens in their research. Additionally, teaching collection specimens have been used in 20 different classes at A-State and, in part, led to the development of two new collections-focused courses. In total, 14 students (three graduate and 11 undergraduate) worked directly on this project, gaining training and skills in natural history collection specimen curation, maintenance, and digitization. In addition, eight of these students had collections-based research projects and presented results of these projects at scientific conferences, some of which resulted in publications in scientific journals.</p>\n<p>At the onset of this project, many of our collections did not have accessible, digital databases. Specimen data from original paper catalogs were transcribed to digital format, and are being made publically accessible in our online databases (Arctos Database and SERNEC Portal). By improving access to collection data, opportunities for research associated with ACBC specimens and their data are enhanced for faculty and students on the A-State campus, in addition to other researchers world-wide.</p>\n<p>When the ACBC was created, a key goal was to develop a significant outreach program that would have educational impacts for A-State students and members of the regional community. A major accomplishment of this project was the development of the Annual ACBC BioBlitz. The ACBC BioBlitz is held annually at one of our biological field stations, and the blitzes include graduate and undergraduate students from A-State, in addition to members of the regional community. The BioBlitz is a hands-on educational experience for all attendees, and is led by ACBC faculty and staff with expertise in biodiversity and collections. In conjunction with our annual BioBlitz, the ACBC regularly participates in WeDigBio data transcription blitzes (now semi-annually), which engages students, faculty/staff, and members of the community. Other community outreach events were developed under this project, including visits to local public school districts for biodiversity and natural history educational events. The success of this project has improved the ACBC collection and outreach spaces, which will continue to host on-campus visitors for educational and outreach activities.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/16/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Brook&nbsp;Fluker</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1561743/1561743_10455689_1639677061998_IMG_4590--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1561743/1561743_10455689_1639677061998_IMG_4590--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Aquatic Collection Shelving\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1561743/1561743_10455689_1639677061998_IMG_4590--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Aquatic Collection Shelving\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Newly installed high-density shelving for the ASUMZ aquatic collections (fishes, aquatic macroinvertebrates, wet bivalves) located in Ecotox room 123.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Brook L.
