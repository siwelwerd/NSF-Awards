 "awd_abstract_narration": "This REU Site award to The University of Iowa, located in Iowa City, IA, will support the training of 8 students for 10 weeks during the summers of 2016-2018.  The scientific focus of the research program is microbiology.  Each student will conduct an independent laboratory research project under the guidance of a faculty and a graduate student co-mentor from the Department of Microbiology. Lectures, workshops and cohort-building activities will promote professional development, familiarize students with graduate school and career options, and provide training in responsible conduct of research. Students will present their findings at a University-wide symposium and at regional and national meetings. The program is open to undergraduates who are interested in scientific research and are U.S. citizens or permanent residents. Recruitment will use both traditional mailings and various forms of electronic outreach. Special emphasis will be given to recruitment of students from demographic groups that are underrepresented in the sciences and/or students from small colleges (including community colleges) where opportunities for research are lacking. Students will be selected based on academic record, letters of recommendation and potential for outstanding research in the biological sciences. Post-program mentoring will promote retention of students in the sciences, while tracking will assess the lasting influences of the research experience.\r\n\r\nIt is anticipated that a total of 24 students, primarily from schools with limited research opportunities, will be trained in the program. Students will learn how research is conducted, and many will present the results of their work at scientific conferences.\r\n\r\nA common web-based assessment tool used by all REU programs funded by the Division of Biological Infrastructure (Directorate for Biological Sciences) will be used to determine the effectiveness of the training program. Students will be tracked after the program in order to determine student career paths. Students will be asked to respond to an automatic email sent via the NSF reporting system. More information about the program is available by visiting http://www.medicine.uiowa.edu/microbiology/summer/, or by contacting the PI (Dr. David Weiss at david-weiss@uiowa.edu) or the co-PI (Dr. Linda McCarter at linda-mccarter@uiowa.edu).",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe REU in Microbiology at The University of Iowa supported 8 undergraduates from across the nation for ten-week research experiences during the summers of 2016, 2017, and 2018 (for a total of 24 participants).  The goals of the program were: (a) to encourage students to pursue a career in basic science, (b) to provide those students with the skills to succeed in that path, and (c) to contribute to a diverse and well-educated STEM workforce.  To achieve these ends, students were placed in research labs, where they carried out independent projects under the supervision of faculty mentors.  Graduate students and postdoctoral fellows generally served as co-mentors.  Student participants were engaged not only in the daily tasks of conducting experiments, but also in the process of formulating hypotheses, designing experiments, and interpreting the results.  To foster communication skills, participants were required to present their projects in the form of a short talk, a short written report and, at the end of the summer, a poster session.  Twice a week all participants gathered with the REU Co-Directors to engage in seminars and workshops.  The subject matter varied from week to week, but included research presentations by Department faculty, instruction in Responsible Conduct of Research, and workshops on career opportunities and the graduate school admissions process. Social functions brought together students, their mentors, and additional members of the department in settings that fostered interactions outside the walls of the laboratory.\n\nOverall, the program was successful in achieving its three goals. Of the 24 participants, 15 are accepted to or enrolled in graduate programs (12 PhD, 1 MS, 1 Post Bac, 1 Medical School), 4 have entered the work force, 4 are still in school with projected graduation dates of 2020-2021, and we have lost contact with one.  Educational benefits were measured at the end of each summer using a BIO REU common assessment tool available online (Student Assessment of Learning Gains, \"SALG\"). These data revealed about 90% of the participants reported \"good to great\" gains in a variety of important skills, such as their ability to analyze data, solve problems, work in the lab independently, and prepare and present a poster.  About 85% reported that participation in the REU program increased the likelihood they would pursue graduate school.  Over 80% of the participants were from small colleges, and for nearly all of the participants, including those from larger institutions, the REU was their first real research experience.  In keeping with the goal of developing a diverse STEM workforce, 15 of the 24 participants were female, 15 were underrepresented minorities, 1 was a military veteran, and 1 had a significant disability.\n\nWe are particularly proud of the contributions our REU participants have made towards pushing back the frontiers of knowledge.  Despite the constraint of only having 10 weeks to work in the lab, nearly half of the students made enough progress that they were able to present their findings at national or regional scientific meetings, and one student won an award for outstanding oral presentation at ABRCMS.  In addition, one student was a co-author on a peer-reviewed publication [Faris R, Merling M (2018), Andersen SE, Dooley CA, Hackstadt T, Weber MM. Chlamydia trachomatis CT229 Subverts Rab GTPase-Dependent CCV Trafficking Pathways to Promote Chlamydial Infection. Cell Rep. 2019 Mar 19;26(12):3380-3390.e5. doi: 10.1016/j.celrep.2019.02.079. PubMed PMID: 30893609].  Overall, the data clearly indicate the REU in Microbiology at The University of Iowa achieved its goals during the 2016-2019 funding period.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/24/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: David S Weiss"
