 "awd_abstract_narration": "It has been over 100 years since the discovery of the energetic particles from space known as \"cosmic rays.\" Comprised of a variety of particle types, cosmic rays arrive at Earth with a wide range of energies. High energy cosmic rays are composed of atomic nuclei, ranging in mass from protons up to iron. Just what percentage of the population is light, and what percentage is heavy, is still under active study. Because cosmic rays are charged and their trajectories bend in magnetic fields, they do not point back to their origin; determining the origin of these particles is an unsolved problem with a 100-year heritage. Features in the energy spectrum (such as kinks, bumps, or changes in slope) are important clues, thought to be related to changes in composition and origin. The goal of this project is to measure the composition and energy spectrum of cosmic rays by using data from IceTop, the surface component of the IceCube Observatory located at the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station in Antarctica, in coincidence with IceCube data. \r\n\r\nThe project has been designed to include self-contained projects appropriate for undergraduates, a unique training and learning opportunity for UAA undergraduates not only to participate in active research and discovery, but also to be an important part of a large international effort. In addition, the construction of a muon telescope and small-scale air shower array using scintillators is planned as a tool for outreach, education, and training in the field of particle astrophysics.\r\n\r\nIceTop is an 81-element extensive air-shower array located on the surface, above IceCube. This project first focuses on improving the reconstruction of cosmic ray air showers with IceTop, especially at high energies where current reconstruction techniques are underperforming. It will study snow attenuation, the curvature and fluctuations of the shower front, and the separate treatment of coincident and isolated signals in the detector. The project includes simulations to study how different hadronic interaction models impact the signals seen in IceTop. With plentiful data statistics and advanced data analysis techniques available, IceTop is capable of delivering results of relevance to the field of cosmic ray astrophysics: a detailed cosmic ray energy spectrum, and the mass composition of cosmic rays as a function of energy.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nCosmic rays are charged particles that arrive here at Earth from faraway sources, with astounding energy.  But where exactly are they from?  To answer this question, the deeply-buried IceCube detector and its surface detector IceTop collect signals from cosmic rays, using the natural ice of Antarctica.  In order to do its work, a computer algorithm must take the raw signals from IceTop (which detectors were hit, by how many particles, and at what time) and reverse-engineer the track of the cosmic ray that made them, as well as the energy of the event.  This project focused on that algorithm, and how it could be taught to do better at its job.\n\nThe particles that hit IceTop arrive with a curved \"front\", like the first wave of a tsunami expanding outwards from its epicenter.  One effort of the project was to teach the algorithm to treat this \"curvature\" not as a fixed number but as an adjustable parameter, and to actually measure which showers are a little flatter and which are more tightly-curved.  Measuring this makes the algorithm more accurate, and in the future may allow us to more accurately estimate which cosmic rays are heavy and which are light.\n\nAnother effort studied the effect of the wind-blown snow that accumulates on top of each of IceTop's detectors at the South Pole.  Just as x-rays can be shielded by lead, the layer of snow shields the detectors below from some of the particles from above.  The thicker the snow, the fewer particles \"make it\" to the detector.  In order for the algorithm to measure the size of the event, it needs to understand how the snow attenuates particles, so that it can estimate how many particles were present above the snow, before some of them disappeared from its shielding properties.  There are several ways of studying this, including looking at simulated cosmic rays, and by looking at IceTop's own data and sifting through it for snow-related patterns.  This work will allow us to more accurately estimate the energies of the cosmic rays that hit IceTop.\n\nThe whole project spanned an interval of time in which one analysis was coming to a close, while newer (fancier) analyses were being explored for the future.  So there was effort to conclude an analysis to estimate not only the energy of each cosmic ray that came in, but also whether it was lightweight (like a proton) or heavy (like an iron nucleus).  The analysis reveals an energy spectrum with bumps and wiggles in it, suggesting that the underlying population of cosmic rays out in the universe is different at lower energies than at higher energies.  This analysis used three years' worth of data.  But during the project itself, several more years of data have become available, and part of the project was preparing this sample for the next \"spectrum and composition\" analysis to come.\n\nAlong the way, the P.I. had the opportunity to present the discoveries of IceCube, as well as this work specifically, to a variety of broader audiences both in Alaska and in the Lower 48.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/01/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Katherine Rawlins"
