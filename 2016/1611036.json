 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-technical abstract\r\nModern electronic devices contain millions of transistors generating waste heat.  Removing this heat has become an increasing challenge.  This is particularly important as the trend for both more and smaller transistors on a chip continues.  The Principal Investigator has developed a new thermometry technique that allows the temperature of these nanoscale devices to be measured.  Fahrenheit's original mercury-in-glass thermometer inferred temperature from the density changes of mercury.  This technique does essentially the same thing at the nanoscale.  It infers temperature changes from the density of the materials on the chip.  The research team will use this new technique to study how heat flows in wires and at interfaces.  The students involved in this project will receive training in state-of-the-art nanofabrication and microcopy techniques.\r\n \r\nTechnical abstract\r\nIn this project a new thermometry technique will be applied to the study of heat transport at very small length scales, which is both poorly understood and extremely relevant to modern electronics.   The technique, plasmon energy expansion thermometry (PEET), involves measuring a material's density very accurately, and then inferring the corresponding temperature using knowledge of the material's thermal expansion.  This approach is based on the same principle as Fahrenheit's original mercury-in-glass thermometer, which also infers temperature from density changes.   The key advance is that here the density can be mapped with nanoscale spatial resolution, which allows the technique to produce temperature maps with unprecedented resolution.  The density is determined by measuring the material's bulk plasmon energy using electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) in a scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM).  As part of their training, students will fabricate simple microelectronic devices.  Then, using the electron microscope, they will map the temperatures that result from electrically activating the devices. By imaging the thermal gradients that result from the electrical currents, it will be possible to directly connect atomic-scale structures and interfaces to the effect they have on heat generation and transport.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe physical laws governing the transport of heat are well understood at macroscopic length scales, but these laws are expected to break down at the nanoscale.  Modern society depends on nanoscale devices that are limited by the heat they generate.  Every smart phone contains billions of transistors that manage computation, storage, and data display.  As they function, these transistors dissipate electrical power and get hot.  This heating limits their performance.  Current design rules for microprocessors are mostly based on extrapolations of the macroscopic laws of heat transport, and thus represent, at best, educated guesses.  If the laws of nanoscale thermal transport were better understood, rational microelectronic device design might enable huge performance advances.\n\nThis project's intellectual merit is based on its contributions to the understanding of thermal and electrical transport in nanoscale microelectronic devices.  The primary approach has involved developing improved imaging techniques.  One of the most important advances involves measuring temperature with nanoscale spatial resolution.\n\nTransmission electron microscopes can be fitted with a spectrometer that measures the energy of the microscope's electron beam after it has passed through the sample. As it passes through the sample, the electron beam will generally lose energy to the sample material in the form of quantum plasma oscillations known as plasmons.

Also important are the broader impacts on workforce development.  This project has supported the training of undergraduate student, graduate student, and post-doctoral research scientists.  It has also provided opportunities to demographic groups that are traditionally unrepresented in the field of physics.  The thermoelectric device project is ongoing, and has blossomed into further collaborations with scientists at the minority-serving institutions of Norfolk State University and Fort Lewis College.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/28/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Bc Regan"
