 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a study of persistent anomalies (PAs) in atmospheric circulation, defined as unusual states of the atmospheric flow that remain approximately fixed over periods longer than a few days.  PAs addressed here occur in middle latitudes when the normal eastward progression of weather systems over a given location is disrupted. They are generally associated with splitting or meridional shifting of jet streams and are loosely synonymous with atmospheric blocking, although blocking has a more restrictive definition.  Interest in PAs comes largely from their association with high-impact weather events including cold air outbreaks, droughts, pluvials, and heat waves.  The project seeks to understand the fundamental dynamics which determine the frequency, intensity, and duration of persistent anomalies (PAs), as well as the changes in PA behavior that are likely to occur as a result of warming due to greenhouse gas increases.\r\n\r\nPAs are broader in spatial scale than the weather fronts and cyclones that are collectively referred to as synoptic systems.  Studies of blocking show that synoptic systems play a large role in the onset and maintenance of blocks, a finding that holds true for PAs as well.  The PIs hypothesize that the initiation and maintenance of PAs depends on smaller-scale processes that occur inside the synoptic systems, including the organization of rain-bearing clouds (where condensational heating occurs) into mesoscale features (rain bands and squall lines, for example).  The hypothesis is motivated in part by studies showing that global weather and climate models with higher resolution do a better job in simulating blocks, despite the large size of blocks compared to grid spacing even in low resolution models. The PIs propose that higher resolution is better because it allows a more accurate representation of the much smaller mesoscale features where the condensational heating takes place.  Better representation of condensational heating leads to more vigorous systems, which can more effectively move low vorticity air across the jet stream from the tropics to high latitudes as required for PA formation.  One implication of this hypothesis is that models or climate states which are more conducive to high intensity synoptic systems will produce more strong PAs.  This argument suggests that PAs could become stronger or more prominent as climate warms, as the greater moisture content of warmer air allows for more intense rainfall and condensational heating.\r\n\r\nThe project examines PAs in present-day climate by identifying a set of cases and performing \"hindcast\" simulations of those cases using a global atmospheric model (the Weather Research and Forecasting model, or the Model for Prediction Across Scales if it becomes available).  Model configurations which produce the best simulations of these cases will be identified, and a number of diagnostics will be performed to identify the key ingredients which lead to PA initiation and persistence. Additional experiments are performed using a technique in which the initial atmospheric state for the simulation is modified to remove particular synoptic features, in order to assess the role of these features in PA formation.  The impact of climate change on PAs is studied by repeating the hindcasts but with the background state modified to approximate the effects of greenhouse warming as simulated by climate models.  Long model integrations are used to consider PA behavior in a statistical sense, and simple single-layer models are used to further examine the basic dynamics of PAs.\r\n\r\nThe behavior of PAs is a topic of practical as well as scientific interest, given the close association of PAs with high-impact weather events that affect human activities.  The work addresses questions which are directly relevant to improving the ability of weather models to forecast PA-related extreme weather, and the ability of climate models to anticipate future changes in PA behavior.  In addition, the project provides undergraduate research opportunities through two new courses emphasizing collaborative research, one on data analysis and the other on numerical simulations.  An undergraduate internship is also supported in each summer of the project, and the position is advertised at minority-serving institutions.  In addition, the project will employ and train two graduate students and a postdoctoral fellow, thereby providing future workforce development in this area of research.",

The goal of this project was to improve our ability to project how persistent anomalies will change, in their strength and distribution, in a warmer climate. This is a challenging problem, because our current climate models struggle to reproduce how these features appear in even the present-day climate.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\" dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Our approach, therefore, was to build understanding by analyzing observations and using models that span a range of complexity and realism. The hypothesis underlying our work is implied by the project subtitle: &ldquo;connections to extratropical storms and storm tracks,&rdquo; namely that future changes in persistent anomalies will be driven by their interactions with the transient weather systems, highs and lows, that determine day-to-day weather in temperate latitudes. Our work supports this hypothesis, albeit in a way that is actually simpler than we anticipated at its outset..

There is, therefore, a strong correspondence, across space, season, and climate state, between activity in transient weather systems and in persistent anomalies, such that places and climates with more active weather systems generally have stronger and more frequent persistent anomalies.</span><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\" dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">The specific results that support this statement include the following:</span></p>\n<ul style=\"margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; padding-inline-start: 48px;\">\n<li style=\"list-style-type: disc; font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre;\" dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">In his PhD dissertation research using a highly idealized model, Dr. Chen Yuan found that a high sensitivity of persistent anomaly activity to the strength of excitation by transient weather systems (represented as &ldquo;noise&rdquo; in his model) is intrinsic to how persistent anomalies are defined, which in turn is dictated by their association with weather and climate impacts.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul style=\"margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; padding-inline-start: 48px;\">\n<li style=\"list-style-type: disc; font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre;\" dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Dr. Greg Tierney, a postdoctoral fellow supported by this project, carried out a unique set of 16 model simulations of an ocean covered Earth in which the temperature and the strength of the Equator-pole temperature contrast are varied independently (global warming incurs an increase in the former but a decrease in the latter). The strength of weather activity increases with both temperature and temperature contrast in these simulations, and the amplitude and frequency of persistent anomalies closely tracks these changes.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul style=\"margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; padding-inline-start: 48px;\">\n<li style=\"list-style-type: disc; font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre;\" dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">In her master&rsquo;s degree studies, Ms. Rebecca Miller found, in multi-year simulations under current and future climate conditions with a realistic atmospheric model, that there are no projected global increases in persistent anomaly activity in the future, but that projected regional increases roughly correspond to places, notably downwind from the Atlantic and Pacific storm tracks, where day-to-day variability is projected to increase. This correspondence is seen in the first image, which shows the simulated future minus present changes in the frequency of persistent anomalies (left) and the future minus present changes in the day-to-day variability of 500 hPa heights (right).</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\" dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Consistent with the above, we do not find major differences in the structure of persistent anomaly events between present day and future simulations. The impacts of these events may, however, be substantially amplified in a warmer climate. Higher temperatures strengthen rainfall effects, because a warmer atmosphere &ldquo;holds&rdquo; more water vapor. Similarly, higher background temperatures amplify the impacts of persistent anomalies on surface conditions, by accelerating the rate of surface desiccation during dry spells. An example of the latter effect is shown in the second figure, which depicts atmospheric flow patterns associated with eastern European heat waves simulated under current climate (left) and future climate (right) conditions.&nbsp; The heat waves are more severe in the future, even relative to the baseline warmer climate, but the disturbance to the flow - the strength of the &ldquo;blocking ridge&rdquo; is actually greater in the present case.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.38;

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nMany impacts of weather are cumulative. A single hot dry day may be unpleasant, but weeks of hot dry weather lead to droughts that damage crops and threaten water supplies. Similarly, heavy rains cause more damaging floods when they are embedded in extended wet periods, so that rain falls on sodden ground and water runs off into swollen rivers and lakes. Such cumulative impacts are caused by weather patterns that persist. Society is often unprepared for impacts that are unusual, or anomalous. Taken together persistent anomalies in weather patterns have the potential for significant impacts. The goal of this project was to improve our ability to project how persistent anomalies will change, in their strength and distribution, in a warmer climate. This is a challenging problem, because our current climate models struggle to reproduce how these features appear in even the present-day climate.\n\n\n\n\n\nOur approach, therefore, was to build understanding by analyzing observations and using models that span a range of complexity and realism. The hypothesis underlying our work is implied by the project subtitle: connections to extratropical storms and storm tracks, namely that future changes in persistent anomalies will be driven by their interactions with the transient weather systems, highs and lows, that determine day-to-day weather in temperate latitudes. Our work supports this hypothesis, albeit in a way that is actually simpler than we anticipated at its outset.. A concise statement of our findings is:\n\n\n\n\n\nTransient weather systems release energy from the climate system; some of that energy is transferred to persistent anomalies. There is, therefore, a strong correspondence, across space, season, and climate state, between activity in transient weather systems and in persistent anomalies, such that places and climates with more active weather systems generally have stronger and more frequent persistent anomalies.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe specific results that support this statement include the following:\n\nIn his PhD dissertation research using a highly idealized model, Dr. Chen Yuan found that a high sensitivity of persistent anomaly activity to the strength of excitation by transient weather systems (represented as noise in his model) is intrinsic to how persistent anomalies are defined, which in turn is dictated by their association with weather and climate impacts.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Greg Tierney, a postdoctoral fellow supported by this project, carried out a unique set of 16 model simulations of an ocean covered Earth in which the temperature and the strength of the Equator-pole temperature contrast are varied independently (global warming incurs an increase in the former but a decrease in the latter). The strength of weather activity increases with both temperature and temperature contrast in these simulations, and the amplitude and frequency of persistent anomalies closely tracks these changes.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn her masters degree studies, Ms. Rebecca Miller found, in multi-year simulations under current and future climate conditions with a realistic atmospheric model, that there are no projected global increases in persistent anomaly activity in the future, but that projected regional increases roughly correspond to places, notably downwind from the Atlantic and Pacific storm tracks, where day-to-day variability is projected to increase. This correspondence is seen in the first image, which shows the simulated future minus present changes in the frequency of persistent anomalies (left) and the future minus present changes in the day-to-day variability of 500 hPa heights (right).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsistent with the above, we do not find major differences in the structure of persistent anomaly events between present day and future simulations. The impacts of these events may, however, be substantially amplified in a warmer climate. Higher temperatures strengthen rainfall effects, because a warmer atmosphere holds more water vapor. Similarly, higher background temperatures amplify the impacts of persistent anomalies on surface conditions, by accelerating the rate of surface desiccation during dry spells. An example of the latter effect is shown in the second figure, which depicts atmospheric flow patterns associated with eastern European heat waves simulated under current climate (left) and future climate (right) conditions. The heat waves are more severe in the future, even relative to the baseline warmer climate, but the disturbance to the flow - the strength of the blocking ridge is actually greater in the present case.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis project supported the professional development of the following people:\n\nMr. Roger Turnau, 2021 MS, currently pursuing his PhD at NC State \nMs. Morgan Bell, partial support in 2021, continuing PhD student at NC State \nDr. Yuan Chen, 2023 PhD, currently employed by the China Meteorological Administration \nDr. Gregory Tierney, 2016-2022 postdoctoral scholar, currently a research scientist with the US Environmental Protection Agency \nMs. Gabrielle Keaton, PhD student 2020-present \nMs. Rebecca Miller, 2018 MS, currently a research scientist with the US Environmental Protection Agency \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMr. Turnau has completed his preliminary examinations, Ms. Bell and Ms. Keaton (both are Black) have completed their written preliminary exams.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/16/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: WalterARobinson\n"
