It will build on previous intercomparison efforts by addressing key outstanding issues in global atmospheric models, incorporate international participation, and provide a unique training experience for the future generation of climate scientists. Special attention is paid to the role of simplified physical parameterizations, physics-dynamics coupling, non-hydrostatic atmospheric modeling and variable-resolution global modeling. The summer school and model intercomparison project promote active learning, innovation, discovery, mentorship and the integration of science and education.\r\n\r\nThe workshop will advance our knowledge of (a) the relative behaviors exhibited by atmospheric dynamical cores, (b) differences that arise among mechanisms for coupling the physical parameterizations and dynamical core, and (c) the impacts of variable-resolution refinement regions and transition zones in global atmospheric simulations. Notably, the use of idealized test cases isolating specific phenomena gives us a unique opportunity to assess specific differences that arise due to the choice of dynamical core. A key outcome of the workshop will be the development of a standard test case suite and benchmark set of simulations that can be used for assessment of any future dynamical core.\r\n\r\nThe NSF funding is primarily for the attendance of graduate and/or postdoctoral students.",
