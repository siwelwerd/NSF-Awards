 "awd_abstract_narration": "Given the tremendous burden of polymer production on natural resources and the vast amount of the US economy derived as a result of manufacturing and selling these materials, the development of efficient processes for polymer synthesis is of great societal importance.  In this research supported by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the Division of Chemistry, Prof. Kiesewetter of the Rhode Island University conducts aims to develop more efficient catalysts that function under mild reaction conditions and enable better control of the polymer structures.  Graduate and undergraduate students who conduct this research receive training in catalyst development as well as polymer synthesis and characterization.  In addition, a series of polymer science based workshops are being established for Rhode Island educators, including high school teachers, post-secondary lecturers, and community college professors.  \r\n\r\nThis research aims to develop rate enhanced catalysts and stereoselective catalysts for ring-opening polymerization.  For these aims, the Kiesewetter group investigates the catalytic properties of dual H-bond donors, a largely unexplored class of catalysts.  Specifically, his group designs and synthesizes achiral and chiral bisthioureas, as well as develops a mechanistic understanding of their catalytic properties through a multifaceted approach involving spectroscopic studies, chemical kinetics and thermodynamic studies.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe goals of the project include the development of rate enhanced catalysts for ring-opening polymerization (ROP) and the development of stereoselective catalysts for ROP.  These objectives were addressed through the identification, design and synthesis of new catalysts and evaluation of these catalysts through polymer synthesis and mechanistic investigations employing spectroscopy, chemical kinetics and thermodynamic studies.\n\nThe research has exposed a new class of H-bond donors for ROP.  Members of this class, ureas, are much more active than their corresponding thioureas, yet they remain highly controlled.  So far, only a handful of urea H-bond donors have been applied to ROP, and other research groups have adopted their use.  We have developed an extensive understanding of the structure-activity space of this catalyst class upon which new catalysts can be developed.  We made progress towards our goal of developing a single catalyst platform that can be applied for the ROP of an ester or carbonate monomer under any conditions desired, and we explored an extensive substrate scope with suggests a far wider potential for the practical implementation of these catalysts versus when we began our work.\n\nThe increased activity of urea H-bond donors for ROP allows for lower catalyst loading, providing more efficient chemical transformations and reducing the burden of polymer purification.  In total, this will facilitate the wider adaption of these catalysts by the polymer community.  Further, new applications can be envisaged in the areas of melt polymerizations, two-component adhesives, direct polymerization 3D printing, polymer recycling, catalytic degradation, etc. The adoption by other groups of our catalysts and methods is a promising sign that our research is applicable in the wider community.\n\nThe new abilities of our catalyst systems, especially the addition of rapid catalysis with organic molecules, is broadening the scope of abilities in our own research group. Readily available catalysts further facilitate their adoption.  For example, one can envision using our catalysts for post polymer transformations, including the catalytic degradation of plastic.  This potential to mitigate the impacts of plastic waste is potentially large translational benefit of our work.  We envisage a catalytic platform through which polymers in a host of compositions and architectures can be easily accessed in a variety of polymerization conditions and by which the polymers can be catalytically returned to starting material at the end of their useable lifecycle with minimal energy input. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/02/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Matthew K Kiesewetter"
