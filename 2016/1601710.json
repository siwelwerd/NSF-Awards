 "awd_abstract_narration": "The MakerTEC Coordination Network addresses technician preparation activities for a variety of technology careers by seeking cross-cutting threads which improve workplace readiness and employee retention that are recognized and accepted in today's high performance manufacturing industries.  By coordinating work ethics standards, level of preparation assessments and curriculum development support that aligns technician education with skills credentialing programs, employee suitability will be addressed early in the employee recruitment cycle, ultimately resulting in lower employer costs through reduced applicant screening and better-prepared employees resulting in less employee turnover.  MakerTEC is applicable to a host of STEM organizations and industries by providing collaborative technician preparation strategies as options for public and private entities struggling to meet industry's employer skill needs.  \r\n\r\nThe MakerTEC project enhances recruitment actions underway by workforce and placement agencies with candidate action plans assessing/highlighting existing skills gaps, assisting educators with hybrid/virtual education and distance learning strategies reaching beyond traditional classrooms and identifying credentialing options for employability skills needed at entry level and beyond.  These activities focus on joint efforts to catalog and cross-reference related programs and activities for participating organizations to maximize available resources. Through databases created by region, industry-defined performance standards and credentialing options, employers will have access to tools for evidence-based hiring decisions. In this way, MakerTEC will establish a network to foster broad acceptance by participants and reward those seeking living-wage jobs with opportunities for employment in key industries.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "MakerTEC (Manufacturing Alliance Keeping Education Relevant to Technical Employee Competence), a trusted NSF ATE Coordination Network (CN), funded September 2016 to August 2022. The goal of MakerTEC is to connect and provide workforce training and development and overall preparedness for today?s high-demand fields that help keep the US globally competitive. MakerTEC directly addresses and coordinates skilled technician workforce preparation and readiness activities for a variety of STEM and Advanced Manufacturing occupations, including those for Aviation, Aerospace, Marine and Defense industries. MakerTEC networks and partners with national, state and local government agencies, educational institutions and employers to help improve workplace readiness and employee retention in today's high-performance industries. MakerTEC plays a pivotal role in linking job creators with STEM technician education and career pathway development activities applicable to STEM organizations across many technical career fields. MakerTEC and the Aerospace Technology curriculum have become the go-to national resources facilitating how industry works with community and technical colleges to prepare the highly-skilled technicians who are increasingly in demand across the country and internationally. MakerTEC?s vibrant network of connections, resources, and solutions developed and proven successful over its six-year span, is the main product of the grant. \nThe MakerTEC model is applicable across STEM education programs, disciplines, and industries by providing collaborative and coordinated technician preparation strategies as options for public and private entities struggling to meet industry's skilled technician needs. MakerTEC fosters broad acceptance by partners and helps connect those seeking high-wage and high-demand jobs with opportunities for employment in key Aviation, Aerospace, and Advanced Manufacturing industries. MakerTEC?s national and international reach has connected education, industry, and public sector partners to increase communication and collaboration throughout the US, including FL, GA, KS, AL, LA, TX, CA, AZ, WA, UT, MS, MA, and TN, as well as  Puerto Rico, British Columbia and Ontario, Canada, and Singapore. Responding to local labor needs, the MakerTEC CN has coordinated and delivered industry-driven programming and curricula; groundbreaking apprenticeships; work ethic standards frameworks; level-of-preparation assessments; and curriculum development/adaptation support that aligns technician education with skills credentialing programs. When employee work-readiness and suitability are addressed early in the employee recruitment cycle, this leads to lower employer costs through reduced applicant screening and better prepared skilled technicians/employees resulting in reduced employee turnover. All MakerTEC?s initiatives, including targeted curriculum, outreach to underserved populations, consultation on apprenticeship programs, faculty workshops, and industry partnerships, impact the advancement and development of human resources in the rapidly expanding fields of Aerospace, Aviation, and Advanced Manufacturing. Starting at the high school pre-apprenticeship level and continuing through programs for long-time incumbent workers, MakerTEC is at the forefront of Industry 4.0 workforce development tools, resources, and expertise.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/07/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Steven Kane"
