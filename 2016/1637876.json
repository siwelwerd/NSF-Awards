 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project develops robotic assistive technologies to improve mapping capabilities of underwater caves. The project enables the practical construction of accurate volumetric models for water-filled caves. The technology of this robotic system can also be deployed on underwater vehicles enabling the autonomous exploration of caves and other underwater structures. The developed techniques can also be used in some applications of aerial and ground vehicles. Collected data from field deployments of the developed sensor are made available to the wider robotic, geological, and speleological research community through public-domain releases in order to further innovation. Furthermore, the data and software, released under an open-source license, enable researchers to test algorithms on computer vision, state estimation, and sensor fusion, in challenging environments. The project integrates research and education through training graduate and undergraduate students and enhancing several graduate and undergraduate courses at the University of South Carolina. The project also engages undergraduate students from Benedict College, a Historically Black College or University (HBCU). The collected data are used in outreach activities to recruit high-school students of the greater Columbia area in STEM education, engaging students and educators, particularly in underserved communities.\r\n\r\nThis research develops 3D reconstruction algorithms utilizing the environmental characteristic of a cave system. The research team studies robotic technologies for sensor fusion of multiple data streams in a single unit and validates experimentally the developed system via extensive testing in underwater cave explorations in collaboration with expert cave divers. The project introduces robotic technology to the underwater cave explorer community by capitalizing on existing practices in three steps: (a) deploying stereo cameras to be used in conjunction with structured light carried by the divers, (b) developing a bearing-only Cooperative Localization system for accurately recording the skeleton of explored caves; (c) developing a sensor suite that seamlessly integrates inertial measurement unit, sonar, depth, and visual data with state estimation algorithms for the volumetric mapping of the cave. The project enhances underwater cave mapping abilities by increasing: 1) the scale of the area mapped, 2) the safety of the divers by reducing their cognitive load during exploration and 3) the quality of the produced maps.",

Mapping the structure of underwater caves is crucial in monitoring and tracking groundwater flows in karstic aquifers. Underwater cave mapping is challenging due to the harsh lighting conditions, and the complexity of the cave. A new approach was developed that fused information from a stereo camera, an acoustic range sensor (SONAR), an inertial sensor (IMU), and a sensor measuring the water depth. The position of the sensor together with the position of the cave walls, floor, and ceiling was estimated robustly. As part of this project a sensor suite combining the above sensors was created and deployed in different underwater caves in Florida and Mexico. The developed methodology produced accurate results in several datasets where traditional Visual Inertial state estimation packages failed. Loop closure and robust initialization capabilities incorporated in the developed algorithm addressed drift and eventual loss of tracking, one of the main problems affecting other packages in underwater domain. Finally, a mapping technique of underwater caves was introduced using the shadows and the lighting variations generated by the artificial light illuminating the cave. More specifically, low lighting conditions, or even complete absence of natural light inside caves, results in strong lighting variations, e.g., the cone of the artificial video light intersecting underwater structures, and the shadow contours. Several students were trained on underwater state estimation and the results were reported in the top international conferences of Robotics.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 02/17/2020<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Ioannis&nbsp;Rekleitis</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1637876/1637876_10454752_1574749845851_SpeedoCave1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1637876/1637876_10454752_1574749845851_SpeedoCave1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Aqua2 AUV inside a cave\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1637876/1637876_10454752_1574749845851_SpeedoCave1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Aqua2 AUV inside a cave\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Aqua2 Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) deployed inside the Ballroom, Ginnie Springs, FL.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Ioannis Rekleitis</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Ioannis&nbsp;Rekleitis</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Aqua2 AUV inside a cave</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1637876/1637876_10454752_1574749310565_vlcsnap-2018-02-18-16h26m10s885--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1637876/1637876_10454752_1574749310565_vlcsnap-2018-02-18-16h26m10s885--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Underwater Cooperative Localization\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1637876/1637876_10454752_1574749310565_vlcsnap-2018-02-18-16h26m10s885--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Underwater Cooperative Localization\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Testing a hand-held underwater cooperative localization sensor outside Ginnie Springs.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Ioannis Rekleitis</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Ioannis&nbsp;Rekleitis</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Underwater Cooperative Localization</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1637876/1637876_10454752_1574749738489_RigOnDPVS--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1637876/1637876_10454752_1574749738489_RigOnDPVS--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Sensor suite mounted on a DPV\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1637876/1637876_10454752_1574749738489_RigOnDPVS--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Sensor suite mounted on a DPV\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The sensor suite mounted on a Diver Propulsion Vehicle during data collection inside a dark cave.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Ioannis Rekleitis</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Ioannis&nbsp;Rekleitis</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Sensor suite mounted on a DPV</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1637876/1637876_10454752_1574749123421_RigDualDPV_S--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1637876/1637876_10454752_1574749123421_RigDualDPV_S--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Sensor suite mounted on a dual DPV\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1637876/1637876_10454752_1574749123421_RigDualDPV_S--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Sensor suite mounted on a dual DPV\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The stereo camera, sonar, IMU, and depth sensor suite mounted on a dual Diver Propulsion Vehicle (DPV) outside the Blue Grotto cavern.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Ioannis Rekleitis</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Ioannis&nbsp;Rekleitis</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Sensor suite mounted on a dual DPV</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1637876/1637876_10454752_1574750173372_vlcsnap-2018-02-18-16h24m27s469--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1637876/1637876_10454752_1574750173372_vlcsnap-2018-02-18-16h24m27s469--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Sensor suite hand-held just before entering Ginnie Spring's Ballroom\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1637876/1637876_10454752_1574750173372_vlcsnap-2018-02-18-16h24m27s469--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Sensor suite hand-held just before entering Ginnie Spring's Ballroom\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Deployment of the sensor suite at Ginnie Spring's Ballroom.
