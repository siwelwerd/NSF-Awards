 "awd_abstract_narration": "A request is made to fund additional and back-up instrumentation on R/V Atlantis, a 274? general purpose Global vessel operated by Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System research fleet. The vessel is owned by the U.S. Navy, has state-of-the-art instrumentation and supports all disciplines of oceanographic research. The Global vessel and can accommodate a scientific party of up to 32 persons for as many as 60 days. The vessel works in all the world?s oceans supporting science funded primarily by U.S government agencies. R/V Atlantis is specifically outfitted for launching and servicing Alvin, the human occupied submersible as well as other vehicles of the National Deep Submergence Facility (NDSF). In addition, the proposal requests funds for instrumentation of R/V Neil Armstrong, a new, state-of-the-art, Ocean Class vessel. Armstrong has not begun her science career yet but is scheduled to make her maiden science voyage in 2016.\r\n\r\nIn 2015, R/V Atlantis completed 286 days at sea. NSF funded projects accounted for 90% of the total sailing schedule (259 days). In 2016, Atlantis is scheduled for 273 days with NSF accounting for 172 of those or 63%. R/V Armstrong is scheduled for 200 days, 60% of which (119 days) are for NSF.\r\n\r\nOceanographic Instrumentation requested in this proposal includes:\r\n\t\r\nUSBL Software\t$52,884\r\npCO2 Analysis System\t$108,795\r\nVideo Plankton Recorder\t$112,650\r\n\t$274,329\r\n\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\nThe principal impact of the present proposal is under Merit Review Criterion 2 of the Proposal Guidelines (NSF 13-589). It provides infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF).  The acquisition,  maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis National Science Foundation funded award was an instrumentation grant given to the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution with a one year period of performance of 4/15/16 - 4/15/17. This was for the  purchase of a Digital Autonomous Video Plankton Recorder (DAVPR) which is an additional instrument for the instrument pool at WHOI to be used by scientists on all UNOLS vessels.\n\nThis WHOI shared use instrument has offered access to a technologically advanced asset to a wider range of the oceanographic community than would be possible for a more expensive and complicated plankton imaging system.  A new DAVPR for the shared use equipment pool insures the availability of this type of technology to a range of scientists in the US oceanographic community that otherwise would not have the technical expertise or the budget to support the use of more complicated imaging systems.\n\nThe purchase of a PCo2 system was also purchased for installation on the R/V Armstrong.  Installation of this system will enable science personnel on the R/V Armstrong to monitor the Co2 in the Earth's atmosphere and assists in analyzing climate data. \n\nHaving the capability to accurately measure pCO2 by installing a system aboard R/V Armstrong not only increases her capability as a research platform, but allows her to provide the same type of deliverable data as other recently introduced research vessels in the UNOLS fleet such as R/V Sally Ride and R/V Sikuliaq.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/04/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: David C Fisichella"
