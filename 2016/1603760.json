 "awd_abstract_narration": "Small mammals graze on the vegetation of the Arctic tundra. Although this grazing may influence many aspects of tundra ecosystems, current models do not include grazing by small mammals. In this project, the abundance of voles and lemmings will be varied experimentally using fenced plots.  The investigators will observe the responses in the plots, especially focusing on changes in the cycling of carbon and nitrogen. To understand how the current climate controls the importance of grazing by small mammals, the investigators will conduct their studies at three sites in Alaska located in the Seward Peninsula, the foothills of the Brooks Range, and on the Arctic coastal plain. The natural abundance of voles and lemmings will be studied at these sites to provide background for applying the experimental results throughout the Arctic. The results will be used to expand a mathematical model of tundra ecosystems to include grazing by small mammals, which will improve the predictions that can be made about how the Arctic may change in the future. The research will involve a number of undergraduate students and investigators will integrate their research into classes and other educational programs. In addition, they will present a radio program in Barrow, AK. \r\n\r\nThe investigators will investigate the importance of herbivory by small mammals in controlling the cycling of carbon and nutrients in the rapidly changing Arctic tundra. Through studies at three sites along a latitudinal gradient, the investigators will employ both observations and experiments to quantify the role of grazing by rodents (voles and lemmings) in the functioning of tundra ecosystems. The observations of rodent population dynamics along with ecosystem function will provide key new information relevant to understanding the feedbacks of the Arctic tundra to the global climate. The manipulation of rodent density through exclosures and enclosures will show how potential changes in rodent populations may influence the tundra ecosystem response. In corporation of the observational and experimental results into a quantitative ecosystem model will enhance predictions of future changes and feedbacks with climate. \r\n",

The presence of animals that consume, trample, excrete, and build structures on the tundra can alter carbon and nutrient (nitrogen and phosphorous) cycling among vegetation, soils, and the atmosphere. By studying how mammal herbivores (e.g., rodents such as voles and lemmings; ungulates such as moose, caribou, and muskox) influence carbon and nutrient cycling in tundra vegetation, leaf litter, and soil in three distinct regions of northern Alaska, our study contributes new insights into the possible roles that animals play in exacerbating or mitigating global warming. To date, the main findings of our study are that:</p>\r\n<p>(1)&nbsp;&nbsp; Rodents build physical structures &ndash; hay piles for storing food, latrines, and runways to facilitate movement under the snow &ndash; that alter the carbon and nutrient cycling to different degrees, in different directions, and that are regionally-specific.</p>\r\n<p>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp; By both selectively consuming certain plant species and changing micro-environmental conditions through various activities, mammalian herbivory can alter the relative proportions of different plant species and nutrient cycling in ways that eventually cause some tundra types to switch from being a sink to a source of atmospheric carbon during mid-summer.</p>\r\n<p>(3)&nbsp;&nbsp; Compared to vegetation not exposed to herbivory, the presence of herbivores creates vegetation canopies with higher 3D complexity in which foliage is more often shaded thus receiving significantly less light and leading to lower estimated photosynthetic rates over the course of the day, especially during morning and evening hours.</p>\r\n<p>(4)&nbsp;&nbsp; Relative to nearby unburned tundra, locations recovering from wildfires that occurred seven to twelve years ago had ten times as many rodents because of fire-induced increases in habitat suitability, which in turn led to two orders of magnitude higher mortality in the most regionally dominant plants (i.e. bunchgrass-like sedge species), suggesting that post-fire increases in herbivore abundance might lead to shifts in relative plant dominance towards previously non-dominant plants (i.e. woody shrubs).</p>\r\n<p>(5)&nbsp;&nbsp; Lush, green tundra vegetation switches from being a sink to a source of carbon at higher temperatures and under low light conditions than does less lush vegetation (resulting from greater mammalian herbivore activity), although the ability of lush vegetation to sequester more carbon under increasingly warm conditions levels out once temperatures reach 25-30&deg;C and light levels are high, suggesting that continued warming and &lsquo;greening&rsquo; of the tundra might eventually have a negative effect on the tundra&rsquo;s net carbon uptake.</p>\r\n<p>(6)&nbsp;&nbsp; When tundra voles consume leaves of their preferred plant species, the plant has difficulty regrowing for several years. However, when soil nutrient availability is greater, such as is occurring with climate warming in the tundra, the plant is more likely to be able to recover, assuming herbivory does not occur each year. These results highlight how animal activity is interacting with climate warming to affect carbon cycling.</p>\r\n<p>(7)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Our numerical modeling study indicates that in future climate scenarios of elevated CO2 concentrations and warming, rodent activity might stimulate nutrient cycling by amplifying the transfer of nitrogen from soil to vegetation thereby increasing carbon uptake via photosynthesis.</p>\r\n<p>During this project, we contributed to efforts to broaden participation in the scientific enterprise by engaging many personnel in the research. We trained 17 undergraduates and partially or fully supported 9 graduate students (4 M.S. and 5 Ph.D.) in field research, engaging them in multiple disciplines pertinent to this project. In addition, we engaged 22 research assistants who sampled plants, soils, gases, and rodents.

Multiple papers (many with student co-authors) have been published in a variety of journals, datasets have been made publicly available, and both oral and poster presentations have been given by many project participants at regional and national conferences. Several presentations and workshops have been given at K-12 schools near home institutions and at Hopson Middle School in Utquiagvik. Also in Utqiagvik, graduate students participated in the Barrow Arctic Research Center&rsquo;s Science Fair in multiple years as well as the Fourth of July parade in 2019.
