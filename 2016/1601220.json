 "awd_abstract_narration": "A new industrial revolution driven by design, innovation, and digital technology is currently underway in the U.S. The manufacturing industry now requires sophisticated computing and thinking skills that are challenging the U.S. workforce, and as a result educators face a major responsibility to prepare students with the 21st century skills needed to innovate and thrive in this new manufacturing environment. The CT Pathways to Innovation Advanced Manufacturing Technologies & Entrepreneurship (CPI-AMTE) project uses a research validated challenge-based learning model to transform instruction in Connecticut High School Manufacturing Technology programs to strengthen college and career readiness.  The CPI-AMTE instructional approach inspires and prepares students to become innovators and entrepreneurs who are ready to thrive in 21st century advanced manufacturing careers.\r\n\r\nCPI-AMTE is a novel instructional model designed to engage predominantly underrepresented students from both technical and comprehensive high schools in challenge-based Advanced Manufacturing Technologies (AMT) projects that align with an advanced manufacturing initiative underway in the CT State Colleges and University system. The curricula engages students in innovative project design, research, refinement, and launching, to advance 21st century AMT core competencies, workforce readiness, and entrepreneurial skills. This multifaceted project responds to four ATE activity categories, including:  1) program development and improvement, 2) curriculum and educational materials development, 3) professional development for educators, and 4) business and entrepreneurial skills development for students. The project advances replicable instructional models that develop students' entrepreneurship, 21st century skills, and STEM technical education and career interests. Research results and tested curricula will be made publically available under an Open Educational Resources license.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n \nIn alignment with the goals stated in the narrative for Connecticut Pathways to Innovation in Advanced Manufacturing Technologies and Entrepreneurship (CPI-AMTE), Skills21 implemented a three year project to grow the manufacturing and entrepreneurial intentions of Connecticut students in technical and comprehensive high schools.  Three advanced manufacturing challenges were introduced for high school teams along with curricula to support the development of their challenge projects and entrepreneurial skills over the course of one year.  The Skills21 Launchpad platform was redesigned and refined to support students with resources, videos, and documentation of their projects.  \n\nEach year a comprehensive challenge document and custom scoring criteria rubric was written for teams to use throughout project development and execution of their final products.  The challenges required students in the precision machining trade to work across trades and collaborate with peers in mechanical design and engineering, electronics, plumbing, mechatronics, marketing and digital media.  For example, the Year 3 Challenge asked students to build a human powered water filtration pump.  Students were given the specified goal of pumping and purifying five gallons of water in under five minutes.  \n\nDuring the grant period five technical high schools from the Connecticut Technical Education and Career System (CTECS) participated in the challenge along with students from three comprehensive public high schools.  Teams were made of students in precision machining and mechanical design from the CTECS schools, and students in different Career and Technical Education classes participated from the comprehensive high schools.  \n\nTeachers increased their pedagogical teaching skills using challenge based learning and content knowledge of advanced manufacturing and design each year by attending the mandatory Skills21 Summer Learn21 Institute.  This annual event was refined each year of the grant period.  Teachers were given ongoing support through in person coaching sessions at school with a Skills21 Coach, professional development meetings with Skills21 staff during the school year and online, on demand support with Skills21 team members.  Teachers reported high levels of satisfaction with this program and showed interest in continuing to compete in an Advanced Manufacturing Challenge at Expo Fest.  \n\nLaunchpad, the student and teacher learning and project hub, was designed and implemented during the first year of the grant and refined in each of the following years.  The hub housed all documents related to the challenge and scoring criteria, a series of short video webisodes walking students through all the phases of a team project of such magnitude, and helpful resources for project creation.  Students also created a Launchpad Profile for their project that served as a place to document the steps of the project, their logo and business work, and links to their social media to advertise their project.  Expo Fest judges were also able to access project Launchpad Profiles to use in the judging process.  \n\n \nStudents increased their business and entrepreneurial skills through project development and execution.  Beyond designing a working physical prototype that responded to the challenge, teams were required to create a business plan, a marketing strategy, and an engaging trade show style booth at Expo Fest. Each team also gave an engaging live pitch to a panel of judges with expertise in engineering and manufacturing. Students had multiple opportunities throughout each school year to interact with experts in their field. Annual Kick Off and Expo Fest Prep meetings with other schools allowed students to learn about other projects and hear from adult mentors from IBM and Basement Systems.

Students also had the opportunity to tour Arthur G. Russell Company, a mechatronics manufacturing company.  These grant supported initiatives allowed students to connect their challenge based learning experiences to real world manufacturing opportunities.  \n\nData was collected via surveys at the beginning of the school year, mid-year and at the end of each project year.  Data was analyzed along metrics including growth in STEM interest, entrepreneurial skills and interest, 21st Century inquiry skills, and STEM engagement.  However, an analysis of the data was inconclusive.
