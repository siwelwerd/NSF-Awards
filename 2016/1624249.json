 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intermediate (70-300 km depth) and deep (300-700 km depth) focus earthquakes of great magnitudes are common in subduction zones. Though many ideas have been advanced, the cause of earthquakes at these depths remains as one of the most significant unresolved problems in the earth sciences. Researchers from University of Akron, Texas A&M University, and Brown University are exploring a new mechanism that might explain these enigmatic events: magnesite, a magnesium carbonate commonly observed in altered basalts and peridotite (primary constituents of the subducting plates), could initiate deep focus earthquakes. In this project, the research team is carrying out laboratory experiments in which magnesite is deformed under very high pressure and temperature conditions. Their recent experimental work demonstrated that magnesite is considerably weaker than peridotite, which indicates that veins of magnesite could act as nucleation points for earthquakes. In this project, they will experimentally investigate how two fundamental parameters, grain size and pressure, affect the strength of magnesite and incorporate the results in a computational model of earthquake nucleation. The project would advance desired societal outcomes by potentially shedding light on the causes of earthquakes and providing research experiences for undergraduate and graduate students.\r\n\r\nThe grain-size sensitivity of diffusion creep and the pressure sensitivity of magnesite deformation mechanisms in all three creep regimes (diffusion, dislocation and low-temperature plasticity) need to be quantified in order to apply experimental flow laws to models of creep and shear instability. These parameters are critical considering that diffusion creep is the dominant deformation mechanism in magnesite at many natural conditions and may cause strain localization and possibly seismicity at high pressure in subducting slabs. In this project, the research team will: (1) quantify the grain-size sensitivity of magnesite strength when deforming by diffusion creep and limited plasticity mechanisms; (2) determine the pressure sensitivity of magnesite deformation mechanisms; and (3) model dynamic slip by ductile instabilities in magnesite, applying the shear-heating model. Hydrostatic experiments will be performed to investigate the grain growth kinetics of magnesite. Deformation experiments with different grain sizes over a wide range of pressures will be carried out to determine the grain size and pressure sensitivities of magnesite deformation mechanisms, as identified by scanning and transmission electron microscopy. This will be achieved using state-of-the-art high-pressure deformation apparatuses, such as the D-DIA coupled with X-ray synchrotron radiation for in-situ strain and stress measurements. The results will allow accurate determination of the rheology of magnesite, evaluation of its effects on the bulk rheology of subducting slabs, and prediction of conditions for shear instability where carbonates are subducted.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual Merits\n\nIntermediate and deep earthquakes at convergent plate boundaries are generally thought to be caused by phase transitions such as serpentine dehydration at intermediate depths and transformations of olivine to wadsleyite and ringwoodite at greater depths.  However, magnesian carbonates such as magnesite and dolomite are also common alteration products of peridotites.  In comparison to olivine and other mantle silicates, carbonates are weak, and our determinations of magnesite and dolomite flow laws indicate that the mechanical properties of altered downgoing lithosphere slabs at subduction zones may to governed by deformation of weak carbonate horizons.\n\nThis project has addressed two deficiencies in the flow laws of magnesite and dolomite deformed by crystal plasticity, dislocation creep, and diffusion creep: the grain size and pressure dependencies of these deformation mechanisms.  Our deformation mechanism maps of the two magnesian carbonates have been refined by measuring the effects of grain size and pressure on flow laws that describe mechanical response of these minerals to tectonic stresses.  We determined these dependencies by deforming magnesite samples of different grain sizes at a given temperature and strain rate at pressures (~1 to 8 GPa) encountered by subducting lithosphere to 220 km.  In a separate series of experiments, we measured the rates of grain growth of both magnesite and dolomite at a pressure of 1.5 GPa and discovered that growth rates are higher than measured at 0.3 GPa.  Increases in magnesite grain sizes are well described by models of normal grain growth at short experimental times while grain boundaries become pinned by impurities at longer times.  Growth rates of dolomite remain very slow at all pressures tested.  The pressure dependencies of magnesite crystal plasticity, dislocation creep, and diffusion creep have been measured and compared with the pressure dependence of olivine deformation allowing us to evaluate the relative viscosities of carbonate horizons and mantle host rocks as the subducting lithosphere reaches greater depths and mantle pressures.\n\nWe evaluated the strain localization and stability of carbonate horizons in downgoing altered slabs at subduction zones, based on a thermal shear instability model, our deformation experiment results, and field observations of magnesian carbonates in weathered mantle rocks.  Unstable shear events are predicted when model temperatures rise quickly and carbonate horizons soften thermally.  Magnesite strain rates reach 10+1 s-1, high enough to initiate deep earthquakes in the absence of brittle frictional processes.\n\nOur model predicts the conditions of stable and unstable shear for magnesite and dolomite horizons within an ultramafic host, with accelerating shear rates and sudden stress drops that correspond well to seismic events  of the Tonga Trench at depths of 100 to 400 km and the lower seismic zone (at depths of 100 - 300 km) of the double Wadati-Benioff zone of the NE Japan Trench.\n\nBroader Impacts\n\nBroader impacts of this research include applications to deep and intermediate focus earthquakes of subduction zones of the Pacific rim, where they represent significant geohazards to the populations of many nations.  Given the flow laws of magnesian carbonates, olivine and other mantle phases, strain localization is predicted for carbonate horizons of downgoing slabs at subduction zones wherever alteration of lithosphere has been significant.  This research helps to explain the occurrence of intermediate depth earthquakes and the lower seismic zones of double Wadati-Benioff zones, and the conditions required for thermal shear instabilities that lead to earthquakes.\n\nThis project has supported the research of Dr. Caleb Holyoke, two of his MS students and a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Akron, the research of Andreas Kronenberg and his PhD student at Texas A&amp;M University, as well as research of Dr. Reid Cooper and his PhD student at Brown University.  The results were presented at eight national and international meetings and in two papers published in two peer-reviewed journals.  Two more manuscripts are in preparation.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/11/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Andreas K Kronenberg"
