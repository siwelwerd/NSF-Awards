 "awd_abstract_narration": "This SBIR Phase I project will develop anatomical models that can be dissected to reveal internal structure and to achieve specified learning objectives. Correlated digital media will guide the user through the dissection. This innovation is in response to an international trend to reduce anatomy education at medical and dental schools, and in response to increasing facility costs and increasing awareness of the hazards of using cadaveric material. Dissectable models are tangible learning assets that replace cadaveric specimens and can offset the reduction in anatomy education in medical institutions; ensuring that medical students receive a solid grounding in the anatomical sciences. The models and adjunct materials can be adapted to other student populations including K-12, post-secondary, graduate education, and continuing medical education. The models are created using additive manufacturing to reduce costs and to allow the accurate representation of internal structure. The models are constructed of materials that mimic the tactile characteristics of the actual tissue and can be dissected, similar to the real specimens, to reveal this internal structure. The efficacy of all of these materials in learning will be assessed to improve the models and media design. The models, when paired with animations, interactive media, dissection guides, and self-assessment materials, will benefit students by maintaining tactile learning experiences in anatomy education. \r\n\r\nThis SBIR Phase I project plans to supplement or replace the tactile experience of gross anatomy dissection with the use of simulated specimens. Success will require technical advances in digital 3D model production using low-cost multihead 3D printing to achieve a scalable production of anatomical and biological models. Custom, low-cost multihead printers will be constructed that can print a specimen in multiple materials that differ in texture or color or are used as support material for the print. Achieving these technical advances will generate strong early branding and distribution advantages as market barriers to possible competitors. Technical challenges will also include the integration of specific learning objectives into the models, achieving a comparable appearance and texture of actual specimens, and maintaining sufficient low-cost for student and institutional use. The proposed models, when paired with animations, interactive media, dissection guides, and self-assessment materials, will benefit students who prefer tactile learning experiences, and will benefit institutions that are turning away from specimen dissection or cannot provide those resources. Pilot studies will help determine best practices in printing, scale of production, the structure of adjunct digital materials, curricular implementation, and marketing in Phase II. This Phase I project is an initial step in the creation of sophisticated and accurate alternatives or supplement to the use of cadaveric specimens.",
