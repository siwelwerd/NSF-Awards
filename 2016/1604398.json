They are used in a variety of technological applications, including drug delivery, tissue engineering, and food preservation.  Water colloidosomes in air are used in gas sensing and as ball bearings.  The goal of this project is to develop a new experimental technique to determine how the contact angles between the surfaces of the particles and the interface influence the dynamics of the interface and the overall behavior of the colloidosomes.  The results will be useful to practitioners to design better and more robust colloidsomes for use in biomedical, sensing, and consumer products.  The project will provide opportunities for students, especially those from underrepresented groups, to participate in the research, and the researchers will develop a class in soft matter for a summer camp for grade five through eleven girls.\r\n\r\nThree-dimensional particle locating Bessel Beam microscopy will be built into an interfacial rheometer to allow real-time monitoring of the three-dimensional position of colloidal particles at an interface under highly controlled interfacial deformations including steady and oscillatory shear.  Images obtained from the microscope will be analyzed to determine the position and orientation of nonspherical particles with twenty nanometer resolution.  The effects of particle shape, interfacial microstructure, and interfacial flow on the contact angle distribution and particle dynamics will be determined.  This method represents a significant improvement over current contact angle measurement techniques, because it will provide real-time data on the locations and orientations of densely packed particles under well-controlled interface deformations.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe goal of this project was to develop a new type of microscope system capable of simultaneously locating fluorescent micron and nano meter sized particles trapped at liquid interfaces.  This allows measurement of the contact angle between the liquids and the particles.  The contact angle is very important for creating stable emulsions using particles, which are found in a wide range of commercial cosmetic and food products.\n\nIn the first phase of the work, a great deal of effort was placed in creating the microscopy system.  The basic concept of the imaging system had been developed for single particles previously.  To expand its use to multiple particles required designing a complex system of lenses, creating software to control multiple cameras simultaneously, and fine tuning the setup to avoid optical aberrations that occur then light passes through lenses.  After this, a number of complex computer algorithms were written and tested to increase the accuracy and ability to resolve particle locations.  Eventually, the microscope was capable of imaging both micro and nano sized particles at a precision of 50 nanometers simultaneously.  \n\nThe completion of the microscope allowed the imaging of the particle contact angles at the interface. Testing on simple round particles as well as ellipsoidal particles was done using the microscope.  The advantage of the microscope system in this experiments was the capability to see both the larger particles of interest and use the smaller particles to see where the liquid interface was.  The analysis of these locations will allow us to measure hundreds of particles at once, and provide new detail on the distribution of contact angles for ellipsoidal particles.\n\nThe computer algorithms developed for this work can be applied to a wide range of microscopy systems.  Therefore, the outcomes of this work have potential in improving microscopy of small fluorescent objects for a vast number of applications beyond the ones studied here.  In particular, there is likely a great benefit to biological imaging to understand how cells work.  The measurements of contact angles provide an interesting result for general science and understanding of what particles do at interfaces, and provide insight in how to better design commercial products.  The results of this work have been published in several articles and at conferences, which will allow the techniques used to be applied in other fields.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/04/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Gordon F Christopher"
