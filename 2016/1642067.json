 "awd_abstract_narration": "Heegaard Floer homology is family of invariants of objects studied in low-dimensional topology, including closed 3-manifolds,  4-dimensional cobordisms, knots and links in 3-manifolds, and contact structures on 3-manifolds.  Bordered Heegaard Floer homology is an extension of Heegaard Floer homology to 3-manifolds with boundary, with good gluing properties.  (Roughly, Heegaard Floer homology forms a (3+1)-dimensional topological field theory, and bordered Heegaard Floer homology is a (2+1+1)-dimensional extension of this field theory.)  This project seeks to further develop bordered Heegaard Floer homology. The ultimate goals are to find practical ways of computing Heegaard Floer homology (and the Seiberg-Witten invariant); an axiomatic characterization of Heegaard Floer theory; and variants on Heegaard Floer theory capable of answering other topological questions.\r\n\r\nAs is taught in high-school geometry (and was known to the ancient Greeks), three-dimensional space -- the space we live in -- can be sliced into a family of non-intersecting (parallel) planes. It can also be sliced into a family of disks with boundary on the standard, unkotted circle (except that one disk will have a point missing): think of the disks as soap bubbles on a bubble-wand, and the family as coming from blowing on the soap harder or less hard.  If you start with a knotted circle K, it may or may not be possible to slice space into a family of surfaces with boundary on K.  So, it is natural to ask:  for which knots K is there such a family of surfaces?  Knots for which there is such a family are called \"fibered knots\", and finding ways to tell if a knot is fibered turns out to be both interesting and hard.  Surprisingly, some of the most effective tools for answering this kind of question are closely related to ideas from modern mathematical physics, quantum field theory, and string theory, and have applications not just to 3-dimensional questions but also to 4-dimensional ones.  A family of invariants called Heegaard Floer homology is one such tool.  This project seeks to further understand the structure of Heegaard Floer homology, with the goals of developing ways to compute it more efficiently and finding other related tools adapted to different problems.",

The main goal is to develop techniques to answer topological questions about spaces that are, currently, hard to answer.</p>\n<p>For example, just like a plane cuts 3-space in half, 3-space itself cuts 4-space in half. A circle in a plane is the boundary of a disk in 3-space (Figure 2, left). By contrast, a knot in 3-space might or might not be the boundary of a disk in 4-space.

The PI and coauthors answered this question, for example, for the class of knots shown in Figure 3. (The answer for the knot shown is 5=(5-1)(3-1)/2+1.) The paper uses ideas from Morse theory and symplectic geometry to turn the question into a problem about high-dimensional spaces and then use techniques from algebraic topology to answer that question.</p>\n<p>Another question is when a piece of a tangle is parallel to the boundary. For example, one of the two strands in Figure 4 (left) is parallel to the boundary, but the other two are not. The PI and coauthor gave an algorithm, using a tool called bordered-sutured Floer homology, for answering this question.
