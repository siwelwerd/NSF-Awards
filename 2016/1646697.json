The purpose of this workshop is to increase practitioner awareness of relevant scholarship to better inform policy, influence program design and refine evaluation practices, and engage researchers and practitioners in a dialogue to help influence the design of new research questions and methodologies.  Held in concert with the State Science and Technology Institute(SSTI)'s 2016 Annual Conference, a gathering of more than 300 federal, state, local and private-sector technology based economic development practitioners this workshop provides a unique opportunity to cross-fertilize the interests and needs of practitioners who make policies and develop programs supporting capital access, entrepreneurial assistance, industry/university partnerships and cluster development with SciSIP researchers. The objective of this workshop is to learn each other's perspectives in order to develop new directions and datasets for future research and to better inform policy and practice.",
