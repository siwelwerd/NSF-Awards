This meeting brings together principal investigators from across the Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace (SaTC) program. The investigators identify topics and establish a workshop agenda, including speakers and panelists. Specific objectives of the PI meeting include:\r\n\r\n- to stimulate coordination and collaboration amongst SaTC PIs working on different projects;\r\n- to foster new collaborations between SaTC researchers and researchers in other disciplines;\r\n- to share experiences and learn from others' experiences in transitioning research into practice; and\r\n- to develop ideas and share methods for improving education, recruitment, and career development in cybersecurity.\r\n\r\nBuilding a strong community among SaTC researchers helps identify new research topics, avoid duplication of existing research, and improve educational opportunities for graduate students.",

The primary objectives for the meeting were (1) to stimulate coordination and collaboration amongst SaTC PIs working on different projects, (2) disseminate key results and highlight interesting new focus areas for SaTC researchers, (3) to share experiences and learn from others? experiences in transitioning research into practice, and (4) to develop ideas and share methods for improving education, recruitment, and career development in cybersecurity. In addition, the PIs meeting also served to expose research by the SaTC program PIs to a wider community, including government and industry.\n\nThe event was held on January 9-11, 2017 at the Crystal Gateway Marriott Hotel located in the Crystal City Community in Arlington, Virginia.  There were 538 registered participants.  The program consisted of four kinds of activities:\n\nKeynotes &ndash; the event had three keynote speakers appearing one per day over the entire event.  The speakers were selected by the public sector, academic, and researcher leadership.  The speakers included Ed Felton (Deputy U.S. Chief Technology Officer, Office of Science and Technology Policy, The White House, and Professor, Princeton University), Farnam Jahanian (Provost, Carnegie Mellon University), and Alessandro Acquisti (Professor, Carnegie Mellon).\n\nPoster sessions &ndash; poster sessions were run for 2 hours on the first and second days of the event.

We aimed to select panelists from a variety of backgrounds, institutions, and research areas. This included panels on creating and running center scale projects, adversarial machine learning, and federal priorities for funding by government agencies.\n\nBreakouts &ndash; A novel element of this year?s program was the focus on breakout sessions.  These breakouts were 1.5 hour events covering a broad array of areas relevant to SaTC.  During these sessions 10 parallel breakouts would be run with a moderator and no specific agenda. The topic areas were solicited from the PI community. We received 46 suggested topics, which were organized in 20 breakout sessions.\n\nA post-event survey measure the degree to which we achieved the goals and served the community.  Of the 538 registered participants, 111 responded (22%).  Over 90% of the attendees rated the event as very good (the highest possible rating, 54%) or good (the second highest rating, 36%).  The attendees generally rated the keynotes as valuable, and the panels and NSF talks as moderately valuable.  As has been noted in past events, the poster sessions were viewed as being highly valuable.  As to the new breakout format, 65% of the respondents felt that they were moderately to extremely valuable.  Lastly, 80% of the respondents stated that they had met someone who they would or may collaborate with in the future.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/02/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Patrick D Mcdaniel"
