 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hurricanes are one of the most devastating natural hazards that affect our society.  Understanding their detailed mechanism, especially when it is at a mature stage, is quite important for hazard mitigation. Progress in the atmospheric sciences has been remarkable in the last few decades because of multi-faceted observations from aircraft, radar, and satellite observations. However, monitoring the intensity changes of these hurricanes while they are still in warm oceans has been quite difficult from these observations alone. This study will explore the use of seismic data for monitoring sudden changes in hurricane strength. Hurricanes generate ground motions in the Earth and a sudden intensification naturally leads to the excitation of larger seismic waves. The key to developing such a seismic monitoring scheme is in the basic understanding of the seismic-wave excitation by hurricanes. This seems to be a reachable goal within a few years, aided with data from the USArray network.\r\n\r\nTechnically, the generation of strong ground motions by hurricanes is one of the strongest examples of mechanical couplings between the atmosphere and the solid earth. The USArray network unexpectedly recorded hurricane data that are unique because of dual installation of barometers and seismometers. These data are the cause and effect of the atmosphere-land interactions because barometers provide the information on the excitation source (surface pressure) and seismometers provide the resultant seismic wavefields. Our investigation on Hurricane Isaac (2012) has shown that these data can give us fresh new insights into the seismic-wave excitation process. The primary goal of this project is to extend our current approach to other hurricanes in the USArray data and test the stochastic, seismic-wave excitation theory that has been developed. This knowledge will then be applied to monitoring the intensity changes of hurricanes while they are still in the oceans. If such a monitoring becomes possible, it can be a useful tool for hurricane-hazard mitigation in combination with atmospheric and satellite-based data.",
