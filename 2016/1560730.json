 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award funds efforts by Michigan State University and Western Michigan University in hosting the American Economic Association Summer Training Program. The goal of the AEASTP is to help talented undergraduate students advance their technical skills and conduct research in economics in preparation for studies at the doctoral level. The program is open to all qualified students regardless of race, ethnicity, or gender. Organizers make special efforts to recruit students from groups under-represented in the economics profession. The program combines research experience with intensive coursework and career mentoring in a residential experience.  Instructors in the program include both leading economists and a cohort of Summer Fellows, graduate students in economics who serve as mentors for the students. Fellows get training in inclusive teaching methods and benefit from access to the faculty instructors, who work with both students and fellows as research mentors. The award will also fund a program evaluation effort that includes both ongoing efforts and long term outcomes.\r\n\r\nThe road to successful Ph.D. study in economics can be a rocky one, especially for students coming from minority-serving institutions and institutions that do not have a strong research focus. Obstacles include undergraduate economics curricula that are often oriented towards the most popular student career goal - business - than Ph.D. study, a lack of familiarity with the application process, and financial limitations. One consequence is that several important demographic groups are under-represented on economics faculties in the U.S.. Over the course of this award, hundreds of students will be able to successfully advance to become mature researchers in economics and related social sciences. Their experiences will be instrumental in their later careers in allowing them to use a strong professional network to help them foster a more inclusive environment in their own teaching and research efforts. By broadening participation in the economics profession, the program will have a positive and lasting impact on shaping professional research agendas in economics and related fields to the benefit of the United States.",

However, in many dimensions economics lags behind these fields in current levels of participation and also in terms of trends in participation over time. Since 1974, the AEA Summer Program has prepared talented undergraduates for doctoral programs in economics. The program has been exceptionally successful, and one study suggests that around 20 percent of PhDs awarded to minorities in economics over the previous 20 years can be attributed directly to the Program. The American Economic Association Summer Program (AEASP) was hosted by Michigan State University from 2016 to 2020. Western Michigan University (WMU) collaborated with Michigan State University on the AEASP. Over the five summers, the program welcomed 177 students.</p>\n<p><strong>I. Overview of the program</strong></p>\n<p>The summer program was the outcome of discussions of how to address the low numbers of minorities in the profession that began in 1969 between the Caucus of Black Economists and the Executive Committee of the American Economic Association (Alexis, 1975). The first Summer Program for Minority Students was hosted by the University of California-Berkeley in 1974. The original program contained many of the elements that still exist today: a residential program, an intensive curriculum of courses, seminar speakers, counseling related to graduate programs, and mentoring and support post-program. Since the first host school, there have been more than a dozen host institutions.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The basic structure of the program at MSU was similar to previous programs?offering a full load of four courses in a summer session. Following programs at Duke University and Stanford University, among others, MSU provided instruction at two levels. The Foundations level was designed for students who had not yet had advanced math or econometrics and aimed to encourage them to undertake further study at their home institutions after their AEASP experience. The courses were taught at an advanced undergraduate level. The goal of the Advanced level was to further prepare students with some training in economics to pursue it further, including graduate study. These courses were taught at the equivalent of master?s level.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>II. Applications and admissions</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;Applications were reviewed and scored by members of the leadership team and then applications were discussed and ranked. &nbsp;To keep class sizes small, we aimed to have roughly 20 students per level, or 40 students per cohort. Figure 1 shows the number of applicants and participants by year.&nbsp; Applications increased dramatically after the first year and the cohort size increased from 27 in the first year to 41 in the final year.&nbsp; Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the 2020 program was virtual.</p>\n<p><strong>III. Outcomes</strong></p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>A total of 177 students participated in the program over course of 5 years. Table 1 reproduces the numbers in previous programs in Becker et al. 2016 and adds the numbers from Michigan State. The program at Michigan State served the largest total number of students and had the highest average number per year.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The students in the Michigan State program came from 115 different institutions in 33 states plus the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. Around 58 percent of these institutions were public and six were HBCUs. Table 1 summarizes the student demographic characteristics. Between 2016 and 2020, 177 students went through the program, 52% of them female. Slightly more than half of students were Black and 36% were Latino. Two students (1%) identified as Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander and six (3.4%) as American Indian.</p>\n<p>Due to its track record of mentoring and its historical ties to the program, the AEASP worked closely with the Federal Reserve System, especially the Federal Reserve Board of Governors and the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston and Chicago. The Chicago Fed hosted students for a half-day event each year. &nbsp;Eighteen (or roughly 10 percent of) summer program participants were later hired by the Board, and 24 were hired by regional Federal Reserve banks in their prestigious two-year research assistants program.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Because of low response rates to post-program surveys, we do not know the exact number of former students that have started PhD programs. Anecdotally, we see that many of the students have gone on to graduate programs in economics, applied economics and policy.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;Alexis, M.. ?Summer Program in Economics for Minority Students.?&nbsp;<em>The American Economic Review</em>&nbsp;65, no. 2 (1975): 502?5.</p>\n<p>Becker, C., C.
