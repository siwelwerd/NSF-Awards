 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fundamental to understanding information processing in the brain are methods that can systematically characterize the structure and dynamics of neural circuits that underlie perception and cognition. Micro- electrocorticography (\u00b5ECoG) is the practice of using microelectrodes placed directly on the exposed surface of the brain to record electrical activity from the cerebral cortex. Recent advances in \u00b5ECoG provide unique opportunities to observe large regions of the neural cortex at unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution. However, uncovering the structure of complex neural circuits is challenging. This interdisciplinary project develops methods for learning high-dimensional nonlinear systems with a particular focus on these systems as they arise in cortical networks and validates these techniques on state-of-the-art \u00b5ECoG systems.\r\n\r\nThree thrusts are considered: The first considers the general problem of state estimation in high-dimensional dynamical systems using decomposition methods including distributed Kalman and particle filtering and graphical models. The main goal is to provide computationally scalable and flexible approaches with provable guarantees. The second combines these state estimation methods with Bayesian parameter estimation and compressed sensing techniques to identify connectivity and nonlinear dynamics in the networks. The third validates these methods on identification of neural models from \u00b5ECoG arrays. Applications to neural mapping, auditory and visual stimuli decoding are explored. In particular, the project seeks to demonstrate the method on using recordings from rat primary auditory cortex and cat visual cortex using a novel, flexible, high-resolution electrode array.",

This interdisciplinary project developed methods for learning high-dimensional nonlinear systems with a particular focus on these systems as they arise in cortical networks and validates these techniques on state-of-the-art &micro;ECoG systems.\n\nThe work developed fundamental theory for learning complex models for nonlinear systems.  The results included foundational theory in dynamical systems (particularly recurrent neural networks), generalization error of nonlinear models, and complex inverse problems.  A focus was on the analysis of high-dimensional systems, a key challenge of large neural systems.  This work leveraged and advances tools from approximate message passing, a powerful technique for analyzing complex learning algorithms.\n\nFor neural systems specifically, the project led to new low-rank models and dynamic models.  The work was illsutrated on data from a high-dimensional ECoG array implanted in the rat auditory cortex.  The work was also applied in calcium imaging.\n\nThe broader work included developing open source teaching material and data sets for ML classes.  Data science elements were introduced in teaching modules given to high school teachers.  The AI/ML results were also discussed heavily with the industrial affiliates of NYU Wireless, a large industry sponsored centered at NYU.  AI/ML and its applications were also discussed prominently in the annual Brooklyn 6G Summit, organized by NYU.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/08/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Sundeep Rangan"
