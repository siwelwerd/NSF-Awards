 "awd_abstract_narration": "Building heating, ventilation, and air conditioning accounted for 14 percent of primary energy consumption in the United States in 2013 according to the U.S. Department of Energy. Windows take a large fraction of the building surface and are a major source of heat energy loss. The current technologies rely upon double-panes with an insulating gas in between to reduce energy consumption. The single-pane windows are more desirable for reasons including lighter weight, straightforward manufacturing, easy installation and maintenance, and less materials needed. The objective of this research aims to reduce heat transfer through single panes by lowering the temperature difference between the glass inner surface and inside of the room. This is achieved by applying a thin coating of iron oxide nanoparticles onto the glass surface to generate heat through sunlight or artificial light. The single-pane window coated with nanoparticle would greatly lower the energy consumption in buildings and homes, and revolutionize the current window technology. The research team will recruit underrepresented students to participate in this multidisciplinary project. \r\n\r\nThe goal of the project is to understand the photonic physics that dictates the photothermal effect of nanoparticles under a wide spectrum of light and its effects on thermal performance for energy efficient window technology. This study will provide a fundamental base on light to heat conversion for optimization of the photothermal effect. Factors governing the photothermal effect will be investigated in terms of the nanoparticle size, concentration and dispersion, morphology, and surface properties. The relationship between photothermal heating on the optical and thermal properties of windowpanes coated with nanoparticles will be established through both computational simulation and physical experiments by varying the air temperature, wavelength of irradiation, irradiation power, and nanoparticle concentrations for optimum building energy efficiency.",

The window thermal insulation relies on double- or triple- panes in order to control thermal energy loss. The key challenge lies on achieving the same level of thermal insulation of the conventional glazing technologies by using single panes without any thermal intervention medium, such as air or argon. A novel concept of optical thermal insulation is developed in this project by solar heating of the window surface through a nano-scale thin film coating. Thermal loss can be significantly reduced if the window surface temperature is raised to the level approaching that of the room interior (Fig. 1). In this way, double-panes will not be needed to reduce the heat loss, therefore saving tremendous energy and insulation materials.</p>\n<p>The optical thermal insulation is achieved by developing a photothermal nano film deposited on the window surface which can rapidly heat up under solar light irradiation. The thin film is designed, synthesized, and tailored to selectively absorbing solar light in the ultraviolet (UV) and near-infrared (NIR) regions for converting these photon energies to thermal heat, leading to window surface temperature increase. For window applications, the film is also rendered highly transparent.</p>\n<p>These thin films contain iron oxide nanoparticles and bio-inspired porphyrin compounds such as chlorophyll and chlorophyllin that exhibit strong ultraviolet and near-infrared absorptions for solar-mediated photothermal heating. Fig. 2 shows the solutions of these photothermal materials that are synthesized and readily available in the laboratories of University of Cincinnati. Chlorophyll and chlorophyllin share very similar structures of porphyrin rings with the only difference in the metal atom at the ring center. Chlorophyll has a center magnesium atom; replacing it with a copper atom results in chlorophyllin. Both are highly abundant in nature and environmentally green. The Fe3O4 nanoparticles are uniformly dispersed in the solutions with only 10 nanometer diameter. After the Fe3O4&nbsp;nanoparticles are coated with CuS, a core-shell nanostructure is thus formed in Fe3O4@Cu2-xS that exhibits much stronger near-infrared absorptions. These thin films are spin-coated on glass substrates and appear transparent with the average visible transmittance above 90% (Fig. 3). Upon irradiation with simulated solar light, the surface temperature can rapidly increase as shown in Fig. 4, which contributes to the optical thermal insulation by reducing the temperature difference between the window surface and room interior (Fig. 1).</p>\n<p>This project has addressed the critical issue of window thermal insulation by introducing a new dimension of nano science to the glazing technologies. The fundamental research on the optical thermal insulation has fundamentally changed the conventional approach in medium-based thermal insulation and pioneered a new path towards making well thermally insulated single-panes for buildings in cold climates. The optical thermal insulation concept provides the general principles which underlie the future development of building envelops by incorporating the <em>smart materials</em> into architecture designs and civil engineering.</p>\n<p>The project has established a network of multiple university faculty members from diversified fields of nanomaterials, architecture, urban planning, civil engineering, and environmental science to jointly tackle key frontier issues in energy, environment, and public health through frequent discussions, seminars, collaborations, joint publications, and group proposals.
