 "awd_abstract_narration": "The recent boom in shale oil and gas extraction has been one of the most important developments in the U.S. energy market in the past decade. While many researchers are studying the impact and functioning of shale oil and gas markets, the proposed research aims at studying a new and important aspect regarding the leases on private as well as publicly-owned land which exploration firms acquire for their shale gas extraction activity. Given that the regulatory infrastructure in many states is not well developed for this new industry, individually negotiated lease agreements become de facto regulatory tool in this industry, but little is known about how they perform in terms of standard economic criteria. By analyzing the interplay between private negotiations of lease clauses, government regulation, and market power, the proposed research will inform ongoing legislative debates about the best way to regulate drilling activity. Moreover, it will contribute to a more general economic discussion about the value of individual negotiations versus top-down regulation in mitigating potential negative externalities of business activity. \r\n\r\nThe investigators will use novel datasets to analyze questions central to the increased interaction between residential populations and oil and gas extraction activity due to recently developed horizontal drilling techniques. Three of the proposed projects will provide an integrated picture of the development of various activities surrounding affected properties. These projects are focused on measuring the value landowners and exploration companies place on various lease clauses, their respective abilities to bargain for such clauses when negotiating leases, the roles that regulation and competition for access to minerals play in such negotiations, and the impact of leasing and drilling on housing markets. The fourth and final project will focus on the interplay between firm competition and regulation in oil and gas lease auctions held by the federal and state governments. It will make use of competitive auction data to infer the implied costs of recent, and hotly-debated, changes in the regulation of drilling and exploratory activity. The project will also provide a guide to governments holding such auctions about better ways to design these sales.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe projects supported by this grant examine a set of questions associated with the rapid rise of shale gas as an energy source in the United States.  The topics we consider range from the way in which the mechanisms used to allocate drilling rights affect drilling activities and responses to oil price shocks, to measuring the size and distribution of the impacts of that drilling activity on nearby homeowners, to the role of disclosure regulation -- designed to mitigate those impacts -- on innovation and productivity in the shale gas industry.  Our work has produced four completed research papers on these topics that are in various stages of the peer review process. \n\n \n\nThe first paper, \"Analysis of Contingent Payment Auctions,\" proposes a model of contingent payment auctions that explicitly links auction design to post-auction economic activity, in the context of Permian Basin oil auctions.  Auctions are often used to sell assets whose future cash flows require the winner to make post-auction investments. When a winner's payment is contingent on the asset's cash flows, auction design can influence both bidding and incentives to exert effort after the auction.  The estimated model is used to demonstrate that auction design can materially impact both revenue and post-auction drilling activity, as well as mitigate or amplify the effects of oil price shocks.\n\n \n\nThe second paper, \"Environmental Justice and Coasian Bargaining: The role of race and income in lease negotiations for shale gas,\" models negotiations over mineral rights leases used to extract oil and natural gas.  Using a unique combination of datasets and estimation techniques, the paper tests whether private lease negotiations exhibit Coasian bargaining efficiency.  If they do, they will reduce the need for strict regulatory oversight over the negotiation process, and private bargains can be counted upon to ensure health and safety.
