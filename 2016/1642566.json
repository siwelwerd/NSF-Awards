 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will provide participant support for graduate and undergraduate students to participate in one of the world's leading annual conferences on plasma science and engineering, the 43nd IEEE International Conference on Plasma Science (ICOPS), to be held in Banff, Alberta, Canada on June 19-23, 2016. This conference expects about 600 participants from around the world, including many of the leaders in plasma science and engineering research. There will be presentations in most of the major topics in plasma science and engineering, including basic plasma physics, computational plasma physics, as well as applications to accelerator science, geospace, radiation sources, inertial and magnetic confinement fusion, and plasma aided bio-medical and environmental research. In addition, to help enhance interactions among young professionals and potential employers, a new event \"IEEE NPSS Young Professionals Symposium\" will be organized as a part of the conference.\r\n\r\nThe award will be used to provide partial travel support for students to attend the conference. The students will be making presentations and participating in the symposium for young professionals. The recipients of the student travel stipends will be selected using a merit-based selection process led by the Student Travel Award Committee. This program will be an excellent opportunity for young scientists to interact with and to learn from the more experienced researchers in plasma science and engineering.",
