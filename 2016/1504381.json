 "awd_abstract_narration": "Arctic ecosystems are changing in response to arctic warming, which is proceeding more than twice as fast as the global average. The International Tundra Experiment (ITEX) was established in the early 1990s to understand the effects of warming and environmental variability on tundra vegetation properties and ecosystem function.  The ITEX program has been extremely valuable for detection of changes in tundra plant and ecosystem responses to experimental warming and to background climate change across sites that span the major ecosystems of the Arctic.  In 2007, the Alaskan and Greenland ITEX sites were combined into an Arctic Observatory Network (AON).  The current ITEX AON project will continue to document and understand Arctic terrestrial vegetation change and its ecosystem consequences by maintaining the long-term datasets of the ITEX-AON.  The warming experiment of ITEX-AON allows us to assign the cause for observed changes in response to warming instead of relying on simple correlations.  This project provides urgently needed data on changes in vegetation and the importance of these changes for ecosystem services from a variety of Arctic ecosystems.  This project will provide training for postdoctoral, graduate and undergraduate students in the emerging fields of remote sensing, cybertechnology and big-data analysis. The project will include outreach activities through strong relationships with the CLEO Institute in Miami; the Grand Valley State University Regional Math and Science Center; and K-12 school systems in Miami, Anchorage, Grand Rapids and El Paso. All data from this project are and will be freely available at the NSF Arctic Data Center.\r\n\r\nThe core datasets of the proposed research include manual observations of phenology, vegetation structure and composition, and ecosystem function (carbon flux and nutrient cycling) on long-term ITEX control and experimental warming plots, repeat measurement of vegetation plots on the long-term 1 km2 vegetation grids, and a multifactor warming/moisture experiment in Greenland. In 2009, the sampling scheme was expanded to include a larger spatial component to amplify the value of the measurements collected. This expansion included the addition of phenocams, automated mobile sensor platforms, and medium-scale aerial imagery. The automated platforms measure a suite of vegetation surface properties with minimal effort across focal transects spanning strong moisture and microtopographic gradients at a near-daily frequency. These measurements capture the fine-scale changes in vegetation over the growing season that are missed by lower frequency manual measurements and provide a bridge between manual measurements and aerial imagery. Medium-scale aerial imagery, using Kite Aerial or Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, is acquired throughout the growing season for scaling of manual and automated measurements; satellite imagery is referenced to medium-scale aerial imagery to aid scaling of responses to the regional level. In the newest phase of AON ITEX, we are particularly focused on understanding the relationship between landscape subsidence as a result of permafrost thaw and vegetation structure and function because of the potential for significant positive feedbacks to climate change.",

Because arctic ecosystems and their components are strongly limited by the low ambient temperatures, this rapid increase in temperature is having enormous effects on arctic water bodies, soils, plants, wildlife, and their interactions, such as ecosystem processes.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Arctic Observing Network (AON) program was established to track these changes and to understand their mechanisms and consequences.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This project represents part of the terrestrial (non-marine) AON program.&nbsp;&nbsp;The project has four components: 1) precise monitoring (regular, not yearly) of the vegetation on 100 long-term vegetation plots established in the late 1980s and early 1990s at each of four sites spanning a latitudinal gradient in northern Alaska; 2) a warming experiment started in the mid 1990s in which passive open-top greenhouse chambers have experimentally warmed tundra plots of different vegetation types at the four sites noted above. The plots are manually measured once or twice weekly for phenology (timing of events such as leaf out, flowering, fruit formation etc. as well as plant size and growth.&nbsp;&nbsp;These plots, similar to the plots in #1, are measured for precise vegetation properties at regular but not yearly intervals;&nbsp;&nbsp;3).&nbsp;&nbsp;A 50 m transect that spans the dominant vegetation types at each site that is measured daily (weather permitting) with a mobile instrumented sensor platform suspended on cables that documents vegetation health, surface temperatures, and albedo, as well as 3D video using remote sensing instrumentation and cameras similar to those on satellites. This system provides daily measurements, without cloud effects and with very high spatial resolution (1 cm or less) not possible with current satellites. 4) A scaling component whereby images taken by aerial platforms (e.g. drones) are linked to the surface measurements and scaled to satellite level. Surface topography is also tracked using Lidar and aerial photography, as all&nbsp;our sites are in areas with persistent frozen soil. As the Arctic warms, the frozen soil is thawing causing slumping and subsidence that directly affects the vegetation and how water flows.</p>\n<p>We used the infrastructure mentioned above to address the following questions: Q1. Are short-term phenological, physiological, and growth responses to warming sustained over time?;&nbsp;&nbsp;Q2. Do species or plant growth form responsiveness or lack thereof relate to specific suites of plant traits (e.g. leaf lifespan, resistance to herbivores, nutrient content, etc.)?; Q3. Are vegetation types growing under different moisture and temperature conditions changing differently; what species and ecosystem types are driving arctic greening?; Q4. How can responses of individual species and specific ecosystem types monitored with high frequency ground level measurements be related to information taken from aerial and satellite platforms recorded at biweekly and seasonal intervals?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Our daily measurements have found that single weather events (warm or cold days) have measurable and predictable effects on rate of green up in spring and browning in fall. Generally warming effects are sustained over time and include lengthening of growing season with both earlier growth and flowering and later senescence. Our analysis of plant traits over time and across temperature and moisture gradients revealed that plant height is generally increasing across the Arctic. Otherwise, within plant&nbsp;communities, traits have been largely stable over time. Some increases in plant cover at northern sites point to increased availability of nitrogen (the dominant limiting nutrient) over time. Within a growth form, plant traits may differ, i.e. evergreen shrubs traits are not consistent across species. Many key traits change with temperature suggesting that as climate warms, large changes in traits (species with those traits) will occur. Some traits correlate to summer temperatures and others only to winter temperatures, suggesting size-related traits such has height and leaf area are tied to summer resource acquisition summer while others to cold tolerance. Trends in traits across temperature gradients may differ in wet sites versus dry sites, implying that as climate warms, trajectories of sites will difference depending on moisture status.&nbsp;Species not previously present or abundant are invading&nbsp;our&nbsp;long-term plots. Deciduous shrubs and forbs are spreading and growing taller. We have seen significant changes in a relatively short time, ~ 10 years, in surface topography and features.
