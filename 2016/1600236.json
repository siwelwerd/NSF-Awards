 "awd_abstract_narration": "Sepsis is a whole-body inflammatory response to an infection, which affects more than 1 million Americans per year and results in about 258,000 deaths. It is one of the top four most costly conditions occurring in US hospitals, costing the healthcare system more than $20 B annually. Sepsis is treated using broad spectrum antibiotics. However, during treatment the heart's ability to pump blood throughout the body is reduced which can lead to organ failure. Therefore, intravenous fluids are used to maintain the volume of blood pumped per heart beat. While initially, providing fluids is essential, it can be harmful when the circulatory system cannot respond to additional fluid. Studies have shown that the early identification of when patients no longer need fluids can reduce the risk of death, speed recovery and decrease days spent on a ventilator. It is therefore critical to know when to stop giving the patient fluids and switch strategies to support blood flow. Current methods to perform these measurements, are inaccurate, invasive, and are not conducive to the care of septic patients. The proposed technology overcomes the limitations of current methods and can provide the continuous assessment of a patient?s fluid responsiveness. This system will empower emergency department and intensive care unit providers to collect fluid responsiveness data, which physicians can use to optimize patient care. The team envisions that optimizing sepsis care would decrease recovery times and reduce the number of deaths associated with sepsis. In addition, the proposed system will help hospitals achieve compliance with recently instituted sepsis quality regulations.\r\n\r\nThe team plans to develop a physiologic measurement system for the accurate assessment of fluid volume responsiveness. The proposed  technology could be incorporated into a product in numerous ways. For example, an automated, a low-profile ultrasound-based smart sensor patch could be developed. Alternately, the technology could be integrated with the software of existing ultrasound machines, or even a software package could be realized that integrates data from various hospital-based information sources. To determine the ideal solution the team intends to understand the user-buyer-payer interaction, as well as the regulatory and reimbursement landscape. The I-Corps program will help this team achieve this goal by enhancing its ability to develop a sound value proposition, business model, and commercialization strategy for our technology. Though an intensive customer discovery process the team will discover the best way to package our technology to meet the needs of customers.",

The primary problem faced by physicians is that current solutions to evaluate optimal fluid therapy are limited. At the outset of the I-Corps program we hypothesized that a system that nurses could place on the side of a patient&rsquo;s neck to provide real-time, continuous volume responsiveness (VR) measurements to emergency and acute care physicians would fulfill this unmet need. To evaluate the potential of our solution through the NSF I-Corp program we competed over 80 interviews and were able to identify who our potential customers were and what value our proposed system would provide them. We learned that our initial customers were emergency medicine physicians involved in the care of sepsis patients. They confirmed that there were no solutions available that met their needs when determining when to terminate fluid resuscitation to avoid causing additional complications. We found that the VR system would provide significant value to these physicians primarily because it provides continuous measurements based on a trusted methodology, does not require extra physician time to perform measurements and does not require specialized training. This enables other general clinical staff to apply the VR sensor and perform the measurements for the physicians (similar to the way current ECGs are performed). Nurses (or other ED/ICU) staff will be the users of the device, with the physicians only using the resulting data to guide their treatment decisions. However, once we have obtained a sufficiently large user base we expect operational data to begin to become available on improvements related to the use of our technology, such as reduced ICU stays/days patients spent on ventilators, or reduced mortality. Once data is available for our VR system, we expect our customer archetype to change from physicians wanting to improve the care of their patients, to hospital or ICU administrators seeking improvements for the hospital. Using such a system may also make financial incentives available to hospitals under the future pay-for-performance healthcare model, and help achieve compliance with recently instituted sepsis quality regulations mandating the assessment of VR.</p>\n<p class=\"Default\">During the I-Corps program we also learned that there are several competing invasive and non-invasive methods and technologies our customers must consider. We were able to categorized these into 4 groups: Basic clinical techniques (e.g. passive leg raise, urine output or blood pressure monitoring), invasive methods (e.g. Swan Gantz, central venous catheters), conventional US (e.g. Doppler measurements of CO, IVC Collapsibility Index) and bio-impedance/reactance. We also compared characteristics of these groups with the top 6 criteria physicians told us were important to meet their needs during our interviews, which included the: 1. ability to perform non-invasive measurements, 2. continuous monitoring and trending, 3. Non-specialist skill level required, enabling other clinicians to perform measurements, 4. The physician (MD) should be able to quickly prepare to take a measurement, 5. Performing the measurement should be fast, and 6. The measurement should be accurate and reliable so physicians feel confident using it to make treatment decisions. A summary is provided in Table 1, illustrating how the proposed VR measurement technology provides commercial value over competing solutions. Specifically, it is well known that basic clinical monitoring (CM) lacks sensitivity and provides aperiodic measurements with long intervals, resulting in limited data for trending. In many cases the onset of pulmonary edema is used as the signal to end fluid resuscitation. Clinical studies suggest that our non-invasive US-based VR index should outperform routinely used invasive and non-invasive &ldquo;basic&rdquo; measurement methods. Invasive monitoring (IM) that measure surrogates of VR such as stroke volume variation with arterial catheters are limited in patients who are mechanically ventilated with large tidal volumes. IM methods are also generally avoided due to their potential for additional safety complications. Bio-impedance/reactance (BI) is limited in that measurements can be corrupted by a number of factors and clinical trials have shown mixed results [6-8]. Through our interviews, it became clear that many physicians lacked confidence in BI. The value of point-of-care US for assessing VR is well known, however, we also discovered that its complexity, learning curve and the clinical time required to perform measurements place it in a similar category to BI, making it inferior to competing methods. However, a benefit of US is that it is familiar to physicians and the user can visually confirm the measurement.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"Default\">At the conclusion of the I-Corp program we submitted another invention disclosure to the University of Michigan Office to Technology Transfer detailing refinements of our technology based on the lessons we learned through the I-Corps program.
