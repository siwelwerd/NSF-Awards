 "awd_abstract_narration": "Odor is the most frequent and chemically diverse carrier of biological information. Volatile compounds released by plants serve multiple functions, including cell to cell signaling, plant-plant communication, attraction of beneficial organisms such as pollinators, and defense against pathogens. In the human perception, plant volatile compounds are the odors, aromas or flavors of flowers, fruits or spices, the ingredients of perfumes and aromatizing products, or the active components of essential oils and other plant-based applications in traditional and alternative medicine. \r\n\r\nIn spite of intensive research efforts over the last three decades, many central questions in the young research field of plant volatile organic compounds (VOCs) remain to be answered. The Gordon Research Conference 'Plant Volatiles' (GRC-PV) (Jan 31 to Feb 5, 2016, Ventura, CA) has been designed to initiate a transformation of plant VOC science by boosting the exchange of knowledge and research philosophies among multiple disciplines with the goal to understand the molecular mechanisms that underlie the incredible diversity of VOC-mediated interactions of plants with their environment and to enhance our awareness of the potential of plant VOCs in an array of applications. The conference will focus on four major areas of knowledge:\r\n   -VOC biosynthetic diversity, molecular regulation, and mechanisms of emission at the single cell and plant systems level\r\n   -The diverse roles of plant VOCs in intra- and interspecific interactions\r\n   -Molecular mechanisms of the organismal perception of VOCs \r\n   -Technologies and concepts for applying VOCs as bio-based products and biocontrol agents in sustainable agriculture\r\n\r\nThe 2016 GRC-PV will host speakers from 16 countries ranging from postdocs to senior scientists in 9 sessions. Both the GRC-PV and the associated Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) for junior scientists will foster the participation of students and early career scientists and enhance the proportion of underrepresented groups among the attendees. GRS participants will have the opportunity throughout the conference for informal discussions with mentors from academia, science publishing, and industry about future directions in plant volatile science and career developments. This initiative will engage and retain the next generation of talented junior scientists in the multidisciplinary field of plant volatile research. The conference aims at enhancing the presence of representatives of the industry to facilitate the search for putative applications of VOCs. Social media and press releases will promote the awareness among future scientists and the general public of the importance of the 'silent language of plants'.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe goal of the 2016 Plant Volatiles was to enhance the understanding of the incredible diversity of VOC-mediated interactions of plants with their environment and our awareness of their underused potential in a diverse array of applications: from agronomy and food quality to renewable bioproducts and medicine.\n\nTopics at the GRC Plant Volatiles 2016 covered an amazing array of disciplines and range from pollination and VOC-mediated resistance in plants to pests and pathogens, bacterial VOC's that promote plant growth and resistance, to the genetic and enzymatic control of the synthesis of VOC's or their perception and effects in plants, insects and humans.  Methods cover the entire range from molecular genetics and next-generation analytical tools to field ecology and evolution.\n\nThe attendees experienced a highly interdisciplinary meeting and productive atmosphere for lively interdisciplinary discussions, creating new ideas and the establishment of new collaborations.\n\nThe 2nd Plant Volatiles Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) brought together young international scientists from a diverse array of scientific disciplines such as plant biology, entomology, microbiology, pharmacology, agronomy, food science, biochemistry, genetics, and ecology.  The attendees represented a new generation of biologists, which had the unique opportunity to participate in highly interdisciplinary, interactive and constructive discussions of current research and emerging areas in the field of plant volatiles with their direct peers.  Through poster and oral presentations, the 2016 GRS featured new, unpublished progress on the following topics of plant volatile research:\n\n1.  The role of volaties in interactions of plants with the biotic environment\n\n2. The interplay of abiotic factors and plant volatile formation and function\n\n3. Plant volatile biosynthesis, engineering and applications in agriculture and pharmacology\n\n4. Perception of volatiles by plants, animals and humans, and resulting responses\n\nDr. Nicole van Dam, a key scientific leader and experienced educator (Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research iDiv, Germany, and Dr. Philipp Zerbe, representing early career faculty (UC Davis, USA), provided keynote addresses and served as mentors.  Dr. Susanne Brink (Editor, Trends in Plant Science) served as additional mentor and shared her experience in alternative science careers and science communication.  The program of the Plant Volatiles GRS provided ample time to discuss science and career choices with peers and members of the mentoring team.\n\nPower Hour\n\nFor the first time, the GRC 'Plant Volatiles' hosted a power hour, an event at which female scientists at all career levels discussed openly the specific problems that are faced by women in science.  The very balanced representation of females at the GRC and the GRS (including each one female chair of the GRC and the GRS) was identified as 'a positive sign'.  Most female scientists reported that the acceptance of manuscripts, the numbers of citations and even the chances during job hiring were NOT perceived as major obstacles (the hiring exception that several colleagues  reported the impression that problems persist 'from a certain hierarchical level onwards').  The main obstacle that was identified by most participants remains the work-life balance, particularly having a family that includes children.  Although several female scientists did not agree that this balance represents a bigger obstacle for female than for male scientists, the majority of the female scientists expressed the feeling that the question 'children or success in science' remains more difficult for female than for male scientists.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/07/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Dorothea B Tholl"
