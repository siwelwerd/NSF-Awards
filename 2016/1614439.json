Furthermore, this award supports three paid undergraduate summer internships, which will be filled either by the pre-MAP students or astronomy majors at the University of Washington.\r\n\r\nThis research will improve modeling of fluctuating ionizing backgrounds and the Ly-alpha forest around the epoch of reionization to better understand the process and sources of reionization. In addition, the program plans to provide a flexible, publicly available ionizing background computer code.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project developed models for ionizing radiation across cosmic time as well as for the effect of this radiation on the statistics of intergalactic absorption from neutral hydrogen.  This work is important for understanding cosmological sources across cosmic time and for interpreting intergalactic and circumgalactic metal absorption systems.\n\nThis award supported the Ph.D. work of a graduate student, Phoebe Upton Sanderbeck (who graduated in Aug. 2018).  One published effort led by Dr. Upton Sanderbeck was a study of the importance of all known major sources that contribute ionizing radiation (surveying quasars, X-ray binaries, super soft sources, hot gas in groups and clusters and cooling gas in the circumgalactic media of galaxies).  This work went beyond previous studies that had primarily focused on the importance of quasars, and this work is applicable to many topics in extragalactic astronomy.  A second effort led by Dr. Upton Sanderbeck was to understand whether fluctuations in the ionizing background could have an appreciable effect on the statistics of galaxy surveys, a potential systematic for cosmology surveys that had not been seriously explored. We found that certain surveys (21cm intensity mapping surveys and galaxy surveys sensitive to the largest scales) could be affected at an appreciable level, potentially biasing cosmological parameter estimates unless this new source of fluctuations is modeled.\n\nA parallel focus of this project was on the statistics of intergalactic hydrogen absorption from when the Universe was a billion years old.  Excitingly, current observations of this absorption may be indicating large fluctuations in the ionizing background or temperature that are a signature of the end of cosmological reionization.   Cosmological reionization is one of the least understood epochs in our cosmic history, being the time when the first galaxies produced enough ionizing photons to ionize almost all of the cosmic hydrogen.  This award supported work, which was published in a series of papers, that attempted to model these sources of fluctuations and make inferences about the implications of the hydrogen absorption observations.  These papers have helped lead to the emerging consensus that cosmological reionization ended later than previously anticipated, likely even after the Universe was a billion years old.  We were also able to place constraints on the duration of reionization by comparing detailed models for the hydrogen absorption to the observations.  Much of this work was led by a postdoc Anson D'Aloisio, supported by this award, who advanced to a faculty job at University of California, Riverside.\n\nThe broader impacts of this award included mentoring PreMap groups in research.  PreMap is a program in the University of Washington astronomy department that engages freshmen from underrepresented groups in STEM in research projects during their fall quarter.  It also supported three undergraduates in research.  These undergraduates were drawn from our PreMap students or another underrepresented undergraduate population, community college transfer students.
