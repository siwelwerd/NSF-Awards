 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) through Targeted Infusion Projects supports the development, implementation, and study of evidence-based innovative models and approaches for improving the preparation and success of HBCU undergraduate students so that they may pursue science, technology, engineering or mathematics (STEM) graduate programs and/or careers. The project at North Carolina Agricultural & Technical State University (NCA&T) seeks to transform course delivery in the physics gatekeeper courses by adapting and implementing the Student-Centered Active Learning Environment with Upside down Pedagogies (SCALE-UP) model. The activities and strategies are evidence-based and a strong plan for formative and summative evaluation is part of the project.\r\n\r\nThis project has the specific goals to: build and implement the SCALE-UP model for the four Introductory Physics gateway courses; build a community of practice for student centered learning; and build a strategic pipeline for high-achieving STEM students by attracting and retaining talented students in STEM majors. Each year, the four targeted courses will enroll approximately 1,300 students from the STEM disciplines.  Based on results from a pilot project with this approach, it is expected that this approach will increase students' conceptual understanding, reduce failure rates, improve performance in subsequent courses, develop faculty teaching expertise, and increase the retention rate of physics majors.",
