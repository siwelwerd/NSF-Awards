 "awd_abstract_narration": "Articular cartilage serves as a low-friction surface for the body's joints, withstanding millions of cycles of loads of several times body weight per year for decades of life. The cells in cartilage -  chondrocytes - perceive and respond to mechanical loading, which provide crucial signals for the normal development and maintenance of cartilage.  However, abnormal loading can lead to cartilage breakdown and osteoarthritis.  In this regard, an understanding of the mechanisms by which cells sense loading can provide important insights into the regulation of cartilage development, maintenance, and regeneration.  This EArly Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) award supports fundamental research to examine several new and specific pathways by which cells can sense mechanical signals, particularly the fluid pressure that occurs in cartilage as it is compressed.  This project will examine the role of various ion channels on the cell membrane as sensors of fluid pressure.  An improved understanding of these sensors could allow a means of manipulating the biological response of chondrocytes to prevent degeneration or to enhance tissue repair.  \r\n\r\nChondrocytes in articular cartilage respond to biophysical signals engendered in their extracellular matrix secondary to mechanical loading.  Due to the complex properties of the charged and hydrated cartilage matrix, physiological loading of cartilage exposes the chondrocytes to a variety of biophysical stimuli, including hydrostatic pressure.  Hydrostatic pressure has been clearly shown to enhance both chondrocyte matrix production and the transition of stem cells into chondrocytes.  Specifically, hydrostatic pressure, as opposed to other loading regimes, has been shown to drive chondrogenesis within the developing skeleton. However, the mechanism by which chondrocytes and stem cells transduce a hydrostatic pressure signal into a biological response is not understood. The goal of this study is to elucidate the mechanism of hydrostatic pressure signal transduction in chondrocytes and in chondrogenesis. Recent work has shown that chondrocytes transduce mechanical loading via a variety of mechanosensitive calcium channels in the transient receptor potential and PIEZO families.  Therefore, the goal of this study is to determine if hydrostatic pressure is transduced through these classes of mechanosensitive ion channels on the cell membrane.  The identification of the specific cellular and molecular transduction mechanisms in chondrocytes and chondrogenic stem cells that are activated by hydrostatic pressure could allow a means of manipulating the biological response of chondrocytes or stem cells to prevent osteoarthritis or enhance cartilage regeneration.",

Although cavitation-induced calcium responses are believed to be important for modulating downstream bioeffects such as cell injury and mechanotransduction in ultrasound therapy, the fundamental mechanisms of these responses have not been elucidated. In this study, we investigated mechanistically the ICWs elicited in single cells by the tandem bubble-induced jetting flow in a microfluidic system (Figure 1). We identified two distinct (fast and slow) types of ICWs at varying degrees of flow shear stress-induced membrane deformation, as determined by different bubble standoff distances. We showed that ICWs were initiated by an extracellular calcium influx across the cell membrane nearest to the jetting flow, either primarily through poration sites for fast ICWs or opening of mechanosensitive ion channels for slow ICWs, which then propagated in the cytosol via a diffusion-reaction process from the endoplasmic reticulum (Figure 2). The speed of ICW (<em>C</em><em>ICW</em>) was found to correlate strongly with the severity of cell injury, with <em>C</em><em>ICW </em>in the range of 33-93 &mu;m/s for fast ICWs and 1.4-12 &mu;m/s for slow ICWs. Finally, we demonstrated that micron-sized beads attached to the cell membrane integrin could trigger ICWs under mild cavitation conditions without collateral injury. The relation between the characteristics of ICW and cell injury, and potential strategies to mitigate cavitation-induced injury while evoking an intracellular calcium response may be particularly useful for exploiting ultrasound-stimulated mechanotransduction applications in the future.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/06/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Farshid&nbsp;Guilak</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1638442/1638442_10308719_1512585384318_Screenshot2017-12-0612.33.38--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1638442/1638442_10308719_1512585384318_Screenshot2017-12-0612.33.38--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1638442/1638442_10308719_1512585384318_Screenshot2017-12-0612.33.38--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Fig.1 Schematic diagrams of experimental design and data analysis for spatiotemporal measurements of intracellular Ca2+ transients stimulated by TB interactions.
