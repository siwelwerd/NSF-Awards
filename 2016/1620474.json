This project is an experimental and theoretical investigation of the material behavior of the deep earth in response to large earthquakes.  The results can be implemented in computer simulations for better understanding of the earthquake cycle and its role in the spatial and temporal distribution of the earthquake hazard.\r\n\r\nThe material behavior of the earth's mantle when it is subjected to a sudden change of stress by a large earthquake will be examined through laboratory rock deformation experiments. The theoretical model extrapolates from the laboratory to the earth in numerical simulations.  This research will enhance understanding of post-seismic relaxation and postglacial rebound.  More generally it will enhance understanding of the earthquake cycle, one of the most important problems in geophysics. The research also has potential applications in materials science.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nAward Title: Transient Creep in Peridotite with Application to Postseismic Mantle Flow\n\nFederal Award ID: 1620474\n\nIntrinsic (Scientific) Merit\n\nTransient flow in the upper mantle of Earth (at significant finite strain, exceeding 0.50), as revealed in observational studies of postseismic relaxation at the surface, is poorly characterized through stepwise application of steady-state rheologies.  This research examined closely one aspect of transient flow: the structural evolution with deformation of polyphase olivine (Ol)-clinopyroxene (Cpx) rock (rock name wehrlite) in diffusion creep.  Deformation in the mantle, because of the mechanical anisotropy of the minerals, requires a significant portion of strain be accumulated through ?sliding? on grain boundaries and heterophase boundaries; studies of diffusion creep isolate for characterization the dynamics of such sliding.  Our work demonstrates that deformation stress-mediated reactions between the minerals at heterophase boundaries lower the effective viscosity of the two-phase Ol-Cpx aggregates by an order of magnitude compared to single-phase Ol or Cpx aggregates (Figure 1). Consequently, deformation transients in the polyphase aggregates have, as a significant component of the dynamics, spatial ordering of the phases so as to increase (or optimize) the density of heterophase boundaries (equivalently, lower the density of grain boundaries) so as to lower viscosity.  The dynamic is an example of a non-equilibrium, energy-dissipative texture, one wrought by deformation (i.e., the response to a persistent deviatoric stress).\n\nAtom probe tomography (APT) has been applied successfully to understand the sliding dynamics in deformed Ol-Cpx aggregates.  Ol-Cpx heterophase boundaries have chemical widths that are up to a factor of two greater (depending on the ionic species used for their characterization) than those of Ol-Ol and Cpx-Cpx grain boundaries: the ionic transport coefficients along heterophase boundaries, thus, are inferred to be larger than those of grain boundaries.  Nanometer-scale chemical gradients perpendicular to the heterophase boundaries (i.e., into the minerals sharing a boundary) support a diffusion-creep rheological model whereby the slowest-moving ionic species (Si4+) need not diffuse long distances to effect strain: here is the chemical physics of the lower effective viscosity of heterophase boundaries (Figures 1(b) and 2).\n\nBroader Impact\n\nThere are three broader impacts of this research.\n\n(1) Engineering structural materials?their manufacturing as well as their performance?depend on an understanding of plasticity and the potential to develop mechanical instability. The problem addressed in this research?rheology of polyphase rock?has straightforward intellectual applicability to the manufacturing and performance of, e.g., superalloys for use in energy conversion and transportation technologies.\n\n(2) Atom probe tomography of semiconductors and insulators is distinctly challenging, compared to application to metals: the latter experiences field evaporation of individual atoms; not so the former.  By scrutinizing and documenting imaging conditions and the approach to data analysis, the research performed here is pioneering with regard to application of APT to ceramics and semiconductors.\n\n(3) Two doctoral students were trained, in part, in pursuit of this research.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/03/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Reid F Cooper"
