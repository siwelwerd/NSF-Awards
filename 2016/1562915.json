 "awd_abstract_narration": "There is an urgent need to reduce the use of noxious chemicals as photoresists and developing solvents during lithographic processes in conventional nanofabrication. This collaborative research award addresses this fundamental issue in nano-manufacturing by using bio-compatible protein as the photoresist, eliminating the need of hazardous chemicals during micro/nano-lithography and reducing the associated safety costs. It will also facilitate the understanding of the fundamental mechanism of the interaction between biopolymer proteins and incident radiation, that is, changes in proteins upon exposure to light. The knowledge obtained of the physical and chemical properties of protein-based biopolymers is expected to be widely applicable to protein-photon, protein-electron and protein-ion lithography processes, paving the way for the next generation \"green\" nanomanufacturing. The collaboration between the two institutions combines their strengths in nano-fabrication and nano-characterization, respectively, and provides unique educational opportunities to a diverse group of undergraduate and graduate students. This includes educational activities comprising curriculum development, recruitment and retention of under-represented students, and outreach to schools. The collaborative research results will be broadly disseminated through technical publications, conferences and workshops, regular and short courses.\r\n\r\nA set of protein-based biopolymers - including regenerated natural and recombinant proteins - will be analyzed in thin-film form to evaluate their suitability as the resist materials for nanolithography with only water as the developing solvent. Comprehensive studies of the physical and chemical properties of these biopolymers will be conducted at the nanoscale using scanning electron microscopy and scanning near-field optical microscopy to assess their resist performance under different lithographic conditions. The uses of protein-based biopolymers as resist and template materials for large-scale nanomanufacturing (e.g. roll-to-roll nanoimprinting) will be investigated as well. The research will also provide a new, cost-effective and eco-friendly methodology not only for pattern transferring but also for fabricating nanostructures that can serve as biointerfaces with the same or better resolution than conventional lithographic methods. This research, when implemented with high resolution characterization and lithography procedures, will find numerous applications including but not limited to biosensors, biophotonics, and biostructures for tissue engineering owing to the inherently superior biocompatibility compared to synthetic counterparts.",
