Giving presentations to a general audience requires skills that are different from those required to give a scientific presentation. Three workshops will be organized each year at scientific conferences in 2017 and 2018 to provide scientists with the opportunity to learn how to communicate with the public and other general audiences. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe following workshops will be organized at the February 2017 Aquatic Sciences Meeting run by the Association for the Science of Limnology and Oceanography (ASLO) and the February 2018 Ocean Sciences Meeting run by ASLO and two other oceanographic societies:\r\n\r\n1. Video workshop that provides guidance in making short videos explaining science to lay public audiences. \r\n\r\n2. Science communication workshop that provides small-group, hands-on sessions where participants will be given guidance in improved communication skills to use during presentations to the public, elected officials, and members of the media.\r\n\r\n3. Interdisciplinary presentation workshop where a few selected oral presentations will be critiqued in front of an audience that includes the presenters.\r\n\r\nMembers of the aquatic sciences community are increasing interested in learning how to improve their communication skills, create effective videos and present their work to the public.  This effort will encourage the wider dissemination of information about NSF-supported research to the public and other audiences.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nHow Can Scientists Improve the Climate Change Message?\n\n \n\nIs it ridiculous to think that Hollywood, the land of make-believe, could provide guidance to research scientists? Shouldn?t the media just report our gems of brilliance rather than try to guide how we present our results? With negative answers to both these queries, we have been working over the past decade to improve communication by aquatic scientists to the public and to audiences broader than just specialty peers. The subject area is climate change but is probably better described with the broader term of global change.\n\n \n\nWhat we have done is not unique; there are some excellent books by members of the media, entertainment industry, and social sciences aimed at guiding research scientists with public communication. Our major contribution is getting the involvement of a scientific community that had not been heavily engaged earlier and did not know what to do.  We have created workshops and panel discussions at aquatic sciences meetings.  They were supported at first through meeting funds, but for the past five years, I have received grants from the Ocean Sciences Division of the National Science Foundation.\n\n \n\n            There are several reasons for the poor outreach success by aquatic scientists: 1. Limited interest by the scientists to participate in outreach activities due to lack of recognition of the need to communicate and/or lack of experience, 2. Inadequate valuation for outreach activities by administrative supervisors and peers, 3. Ignorance on how to communicate effectively with the public. In addition, most scientists do not have accurate comprehension of public attitudes and do not understand why the public is not more interested in learning from the scientists? wisdom about solutions. We have tried to address these issues in panel discussions at recent meetings.\n\n \n\nPanel Discussions\n\n \n\nSince 2008, we have organized panel discussions at these meetings using some members of the ocean and aquatic sciences communities and some outside public policy and media experts.  The purpose of the panel discussions is to get the scientific community to recognize and think about the importance of outreach to the public and the attitude of much of the public toward scientific \"evidence\".  We also explored the disconnect between scientists? view of their messages and the public?s lack of \"appropriate\" interest and response. In addition, there were discussions of examples of successful outreach with caution to not be too negative (\"doom and gloom\") about environmental problems. We discriminate between the already committed pubic and the \"disinterested\" public, because there is need to get more of the public interested and committed to being involved.   \n\n \n\nSince most of the workshops have been moderated by media professionals and since the panels have often included non-scientists, there is some resistance by aquatic scientists to \"learn\" from experts outside the scientific community.  Therefore, further efforts in this area are appropriate.  \n\n \n\nCommunications Workshops\n\n \n\n            Increasing numbers of scientists had been making short videos to explain their science to lay audiences and placing them on their websites. Recognizing the lack of knowledge on how to make interesting videos, Dr. Randy Olson, gave up a tenured marine biology faculty position and enrolled in film school at the University of Southern California. For the past 20 years, he has worked as an independent filmmaker and communications consultant in Hollywood. I have worked with him and others from Hollywood that I met through him.\n\n \n\n            Our initial workshop efforts addressed the short videos of research scientists. In addition to improved videos, we felt that scientists could benefit from better communication skills in all aspects of their work. We have added a workshop that used hands-on activity with small groups. In these workshops, an important element of the 3-6 hour session is for the participants to learn and practice improvisation exercises (improv).  The improv helps one to be less stiff and imposing in dealing with a public audience, develops greater self-confidence in one?s interactions, and uses devices to make the audience more receptive (like a bit of humor). The participants also learn about the value of narrative structure for presenting information that is more interesting and compelling for the audience. \n\n \n\nAnother workshop is aimed at the presentations given by scientists to each other.  Since oceanography and limnology are multi-disciplinary sciences, it is desirable to make presentations that are interpretable by audiences larger than the small group of experts of the presenter. These \"Hollywood workshops\" have been well received and it is rewarding to find growing enthusiasm and interest in them. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/16/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jonathan H Sharp"
