 "awd_abstract_narration": "Bone is a complex tissue composed of mineral and collagen. Bone fragility represents a significant societal burden, and is commonly, but incompletely diagnosed through changes in bone mass and structure. Understanding the contributions and interactions of collagen and mineral at the nanostructural level is critical for understanding how factors beyond bone mass govern bone fragility. Collagen formation and incorporation into bone is highly regulated, and changes in collagen or collagen-related proteins leads to the bone disease osteogenesis imperfecta (OI), exemplified by extremely high bone brittleness and fragility. Understanding how changes in collagen and mineral interactions lead to bone brittleness will provide a greater understanding of how bone content, structure, and mechanical properties interact at multiple length scales. This project introduces a novel use of atomic force microscopy-based infrared spectroscopy (AFMIR) and positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy (PALS) to detect changes in collagen-mineral interactions in bone. By understanding how these processes break down in models of OI, this research will have a broader impact by identifying key factors that are most closely correlated with bone brittleness and fragility in more common diseases such as osteoporosis.\r\n\r\nThis research will determine how collagen governs bone material properties across multiple size scales. We hypothesize that bone brittleness is regulated through changes across the hierarchical organization of bone originating at the level of the collagen-mineral interaction. To test the hypothesis, mice with defects in collagen helical structure, pro-collagen processing, or post-translational hydroxylation will be studied by AFM-IR and PALS imaging. Hierarchical phenotype analysis will be performed across multiple length scales and will identity factors most closely correlated with the mild, moderate, and severe bone brittleness found in these mice. Collagen fibril structure will be directly visualized in the context of its surrounding matrix chemistry, tissue stiffness, and local fibril organization by AFM-IR. PALS will describe void size and distribution at this same size scale. Together, these techniques will be integrated with higher order contextual information including tissue organization (woven-lamellar patterns), porosity (of vascular and cellular  origin), tissue mineral, and stiffness through histologic, nanoCT, and nanoindentation techniques. The intellectual significance of this project arises from understanding how collagen governs bone material properties across multiple size scales and will provide foundational understanding regarding the basic biological principles behind bone formation, growth, and maturation.",

The formation and organization of mineral and collagen within bone is a highly regulated process, and understanding how collagen and mineral interact at the nanostructure level is crucial to understanding how bone functions as a material.&nbsp; A specific understanding of the biomechanical regulation of bone at scales ranging from nanometer to millimeter have not yet been realized, but profound implications for deviations from normal are seen in nature, where diseases arising from genetic mutations can result in severe phenotypes.&nbsp; Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is one such disease, where mutations in collagen or collagen-associated proteins lead to severe bone brittleness, highlighting key, but undiscovered roles of collagen in the regulation of bone mineralization and mechanics.&nbsp; This project sought to develop foundational information regarding bone content and structure as a function of hierarchical scale, using a variety of innovative imaging and characterization tools.&nbsp; By varying skeletal composition through a controlled modulation of collagen genetics and animal age, we have developed a novel, multiscale characterization of bone structure which can now be applied to diseases such as osteogenesis imperfecta and osteoporosis, as well as generating novel insight into the fundamental biology behind bone matrix formation and organization.<br /><br />At its most fundamental scale, bone is a complex nanocomposite consisting of collagen fibrils, polycrystalline mineral, and water.&nbsp; Using a pore characterization technique, positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy (PALS), that has been used extensively in non-biologic materials, we first presented a hierarchy in pore size of voids in hydrated bone. We identified pores with diameters of 0.6 nm, 1.1, 1.9, and 4.0 ? sizes that suggest porosity within the collagen molecule itself, between collagen molecules, at collagen terminal spaces (D-spacing) and at the interface between collagen and mineral structure, respectively (Figure 1, Ahn et al, 2021 ACS Nano 15,4321).&nbsp; Next, we evaluated the influence that collagen mutation has on this nanoscale porosity.&nbsp; Specifically, we observed that common amino acid substitutions (in this case, cysteine for glycine) result in alterations in collagen D-spacing and collagen-mineral interface spacing.&nbsp; In contrast, splice site mutations resulting in truncated collagen chains suggest a greater disruption of collagen nanostructure, with larger voids present in D-spacing locations, corresponding to more plentiful and smaller voids at the collagen-mineral interface.&nbsp; Lastly, we observed that collagen insufficiency results in a milder disruption of collagen microstructure. &nbsp;<br /><br />Once formed, the combination of collagen and mineral produces gradients of tissue material properties which require in situ testing to evaluate patterns of matrix quality.&nbsp; We evaluated two complementary in situ testing tools to quantify natural patterns in matrix/mineral changes in mice of varying age and maturity.&nbsp; Through Atomic Force Microscopy-infrared spectroscopy (AFM-IR) and optical photothermal infrared spectroscopy (O-PTIR), we demonstrated that matrix/mineral ratio values decrease with increasing bone tissue maturity.&nbsp; Furthermore, we showed variation in matrix/mineral ratio-generating micron-scale bands that run parallel to the direction of bone growth, as well as smaller domains within these bands of approximately 50-700 nm in size (Figure 2, Ahn et al, 2022 J Structural Biol 214(3)107878). Lastly, both techniques reveal greater variation in matrix/mineral ratios in young bone tissue compared to old.&nbsp; These data both establish AFM-IR and O-PTIR as techniques for visualizing bulk spectroscopic data consistent with previously described higher order imaging techniques, and reveal new organizational patterns that likely reflect focal changes in biomechanical integrity in bone.<br /><br />Lastly, we evaluated how collagen mutation can influence intracortical porosity at the level of osteocytic lacunae and vascular channels.&nbsp; Using high resolution nanoCT imaging, we demonstrated that some, but not all collagen mutations can modulate osteocyte cell density within the bone matrix, resulting in variable intracortical porosity.&nbsp; Lacunar volume fraction and vascular volume fraction were highly correlated, suggesting a strong link between intracortical vascular innervation and mechanisms of osteocyte entrapment during bone formation (Figure 3). <br /><br />The broader impacts of this work reflect a greater understanding of collagen-mineral organization in bone tissue through the use of advanced techniques (PALS, O-PTIR, AFM-IR, nanoCT) that can now be applied to a variety of biologic studies.&nbsp; These findings have provided a better understanding of bone tissue, its porosity, content, and organization across multiple hierarchical levels, and provide new avenues for exploring how these features impact bone fragility, particularly in a disease such as osteogenesis imperfecta.&nbsp; Lastly, this project provided unique multi-disciplinary training opportunities for students interested in musculoskeletal biology, imaging, and biomechanics.
