 "awd_abstract_narration": "Entrepreneurship is both an important source of employment and, especially within science and engineering, a powerful force for social and economic renewal.  Despite this importance, however, entrepreneurship research has only recently expanded beyond studying precursor conditions (such as entrepreneurial personality traits and untapped market opportunities) to address the process of starting a business--developing a business model, incorporating, registering intellectual property, making first hires, and so on.  The present project seeks to map the field of start-up activities and to identify the common pathways that nascent entrepreneurial ventures follow in transiting that field.  The PI hypothesizes (a) that start-up trajectories cluster into distinct archetypes; (b) that the choice of archetype depends on identifiable attributes of the founding team, the new firm, and the social context; and (c) that different start-up sequences will yield different outcomes, depending on these team, firm, and context contingencies.  If confirmed, these predictions would represent a significant advance over current \"one size fits all\" models of the start-up process. Such a shift would have a transformative impact on science, teaching, practice and policy in the field of entrepreneurship.\r\n\r\nThis project advances the entrepreneurship literature's recent turn toward \"process studies\" that explore the contingent, unfolding nature of new firm emergence.  Applying a set of under-utilized statistical techniques to data on the timing of 36 start-up activities recorded by the Panel Study of Entrepreneurial Dynamics (PSED I and II), the investigation seeks to identify temporal patterns in the early trajectories of nascent entrepreneurial ventures.  First, the project will adapt multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) techniques from psychometry to map the set of start-up activities onto a multi-dimensional activity space, based on various measures of the activities' temporal similarity to one another.  Second, the project will adapt sequence analysis (SA) techniques from genomics to cluster the observed start-up sequences into a limited number of archetypal trajectories through the activity space.  Third, the project will assess the impact of exogenous conditions such as founder attributes, organization type, and environmental context in determining a new venture's particular trajectory.  Fourth, the project will evaluate the interactive impact of these exogenous contingencies and archetypal trajectories in shaping the new venture's survival and performance outcomes.  In furtherance of these analyses, the project will refine MDS and SA methodologies to better accommodate the unique features of social-scientific data such as the activity sequences in the PSED.  The project will also supplement the existing PSED data sets with new measures of socio-political and economic conditions in respondents' environments. These new methods and variables will enhance the PSED's usefulness as a data infrastructure for exploring social vs. economic, local vs. global, and objective vs. subjective environmental influences on the start-up process, both for the current investigation and for other investigations in years to come.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n \nThis project explored temporal patterns ? sequences, stages and phase transitions ? in the start-up trajectories of nascent business firms.  Specifically, the research sought to map the field of start-up activities and to identify the common pathways that entrepreneurial ventures follow in moving from initial inspiration to sustained profitability.\nEntrepreneurship is both an important source of employment and, especially within science and engineering, a powerful force for social and economic renewal.  Despite this importance, however, entrepreneurship research has only recently expanded beyond studying precursor conditions (such as personality traits and market opportunities) to address the process of starting a business -- developing a product, incorporating, hiring employees, etc.  Although advice about timing and sequencing abounds in the practitioner-oriented literature on entrepreneurship, prior empirical research has yielded only inconclusive results, leading many researchers to question whether any reliable temporal regularities can be found. \nThis project aimed to overcome the limitations of previous studies by applying a set of under-utilized statistical techniques to data on the timing of 36 start-up activities recorded by the Panel Study of Entrepreneurial Dynamics (PSED), the most sophisticated available data on early-stage venture creation.  The research proceeded in three parts, described in further detail below:  (1) mapping the ?start-up activity space?; (2) identifying ?archetypal start-up trajectories?; and (3) compiling supplemental data to assess the impact of contextual factors such as founder attributes, organization type, and environmental context on start-up trajectories and outcomes.\nThe first component of the project mapped the PSED?s 36 start-up activities onto a two-dimensional ?activity space.?  For this analysis, we computed various measures of the activities? temporal similarity to one another, tapping the degree to which each pair of activities tended to appear together, at similar times, and in a specific order.  We then adapted multidimensional scaling (MDS) techniques from psychometry, in order to create a map in which the proximity of each pair of activities corresponds to their overall level of temporal similarity, as measured across the 965 PSED cases.  This map, depicted in Figure 1, has several noteworthy features:\n\n In addition to the expected Early/Late dimension represented by the horizontal axis, the map reveals an unexpected ?Operational/Constitutive? dimension represented by the vertical axis:  Activities located toward the top of the map focus on ?starting a business? (i.e., operating a new commercial venture), whereas activities located toward the bottom focus on ?forming a company? (i.e., constituting a new organizational entity).\n\n\nThe 36 start-up activities are not spread evenly across this space.  In particular, a sizable gap separates the ?gestational? activities on the left and middle of the map from the ?live-birth? activities on the right.  Another sizable gap separates early activities into an operational cluster toward the top of the map and a constitutive cluster toward the bottom, although this gap narrows as gestation progresses.\n\n\nThe configuration of the activity space is remarkably similar across industries and across founding-team types, although solo founders, minority founders, manufacturing firms, and companies in distress show some distinctive patterns.\n\n\n\nThe second component of the project sought to identify a set of archetypal trajectories that new ventures follow in traversing the activity space.  For this analysis, we adapted path-distance techniques from computational geometry, to cluster the PSED II start-up sequences into archetypal trajectories.  Figure 2 depicts four common archetypes, for startups that either went out of business or achieved sustained profitability during the PSED?s 5-year observation period.\nIn the third component of the project, we collected supplemental data to contextualize the start-up process within particular geographic (and, hence, socio-economic) locales.  Specifically, we identified a wide range of contextual variables available outside the PSED data set, including data on legal climate, economic conditions, and demography.  We then compiled and geo-coded each of these variables, to permit them to be matched to the PSED cases.  In the coming months, we plan to merge our contextual variables with the results of our trajectory analysis.  We will then use this combined data set both to assess the impact of background conditions on a new venture?s trajectory through the activity space, and also to examine the joint impact of background conditions and trajectory choices on start-up survival and performance.  (This final stage of work will be completed after the expiration of the NSF Award, without additional NSF funding.)\nBeyond its substantive findings, this project has also contributed to the infrastructure for entrepreneurship studies by both (a) refining MDS and sequence-analysis methodology to better accommodate the unique features of the PSED, and (b) supplementing the PSED with new measures of local socio-political and economic conditions.  These novel methods and variables significantly enhance the PSED?s usefulness for exploring contextual influences on the start-up process, opening fresh vistas for inquiry into the contingent, unfolding nature of new firm emergence.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/22/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Mark C Suchman"
