 "awd_abstract_narration": "CAMPARE (California-Arizona Minority Partnership for Astronomy Research and Education) is a program established to advance undergraduate astronomy research and education among groups that are traditionally underrepresented in astronomy.  It has been supported by the Partnerships in Astronomy and Astrophysics Research and Education (PAARE) program. This renewal proposal includes plans to expand CAMPARE and to integrate it with the Cal-Bridge program, which helps undergraduate students from California State University campuses make the transition to one of the University of California graduate programs.  In addition to recruiting and placement of underrepresented minorities, they provide mentoring, professional development, and administrative services to assist and track students making their way through these programs.  \r\n\r\nThe program does this by actively recruiting undergraduates from among the California State University campuses, promoting their participation in astronomical research at University of California campuses and at Research Experiences for Undergraduates programs across the country.  The proposal team has established close connections with many minority-serving, primarily undergraduate institutions located in a region of explosive growth in Hispanic population, and with twelve research institutions that have strong track records of involving undergraduates in research. The goal is to increase the numbers of students from underrepresented minorities that enter and complete PhD programs in astronomy and related fields.",

One of the top strategies recommended to overcome this underrepresentation is \"Partnerships of community colleges and minority-serving institutions with research universities and with national centers and laboratories.\" Cal-Bridge and CAMPARE are two such programs. The President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST), in their February 2012 report state, \"Federal agencies should encourage projects that establish collaborations between research universities and community colleges or other institutions that do not have research programs,\" suggesting that programs like Cal-Bridge and CAMPARE are a national priority in STEM education.</p>\n<p>Cal-Bridge (<a title=\"Cal-Bridge program\" href=\"https://www.calbridge.org\" target=\"_blank\">www.calbridge.org</a>) is a partnership between 9 University of California (UC), 16 California State University (CSU), with over 140 physics and astronomy faculty from the two systems participating.&nbsp;Scholars are recruited from the 16 CSU and over 40 California community college campuses in our network, with the help of local faculty and/or staff liaisons at each campus.

Once selected, Cal-Bridge Scholars benefit from two (2) years of financial support, intensive, joint mentoring by CSU and UC faculty, professional development workshops, and exposure to a wide variety of research opportunities, including at the participating UC campuses.</p>\n<p>Since its inception in 2014, the Cal-Bridge program has selected 99 scholars in six cohorts, including 54 Latinx, 12 Black/African American, and 44 women scholars (21 of the 44 women are from underrepresented minority groups). Sixty-seven (67) of the 99 Cal-Bridge Scholars are first-generation college students and 18 identify as LGBTQ+. A total of 48 Cal-Bridge Scholars have graduated with a BS and 38 (79%) of them are enrolled in PhD programs in physics, astronomy, or other STEM fields at top PhD programs nationally.&nbsp;Nine (9) of these scholars have won NSF Graduate Research Fellowships and five received an Honorable Mention.</p>\n<p>Videos about the Cal-Bridge program and individual scholar interviews can be found on the&nbsp;<a title=\"Cal-Bridge YouTube channel\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvJthEDdGI2L4UIz5gFt_3w\" target=\"_blank\">Cal-Bridge YouTube channel</a>.</p>\n<p>CAMPARE (the California Minority Partnership for Astronomy Research and Education) is a summer research program in which students are selected from a network of over 50 California State University and community college campuses in California to spend 8-10 weeks conducting research in physics, astronomy, planetary science, and astrobiology at one of 10 major research institutions in California and across the country. In ten summers 198 CAMPARE scholars have participated in the program: 60% are URM students, and more than 80% of are URM, female, or both. The graduation rate among CAMPARE scholars is 98%, and of the CAMPARE scholars who have graduated with a Bachelor?s degree, almost two-thirds (65%) have completed or are pursuing graduate education in physics, astronomy, or a related field.
