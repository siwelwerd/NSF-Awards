Dr. Michael Krauss has focused much of his career working with the remaining speakers of Eyak recording their language in great detail. Krauss' work is, as one reviewer described it, of the highest quality. Eyak is an important language because it occupies the space between Athapaskan and Tlingit and a full analysis of Eyak will contribute to an understanding of the linguistic relationships between North America and Asia. The project focuses on archiving existing materials and completing the dictionary, translation and transcription of texts and grammar for the future access and use of scholars and the Eyak community alike.",

  "por_cntn": "<div class=\"porColContainerWBG\">\n<div class=\"porContentCol\"><p>This project, initiated by the late Professor Michael Krauss, contributes to the enduring documentation of Eyak, an Alaska Native language whose last speaker passed away in 2009. Eyak holds a unique place in the history of the world's Indigenous languages. Nearly forgotten by science until its \"rediscovery\" in 1938, the language had only six remaining fluent speakers when linguist Krauss first began to document the language in the early 1960s. Krauss soon came to see the Eyak situation as a harbinger for the growing threat to small languages across Alaska and the world, famously noting in 1991 that not only Eyak but much of the world's linguistic diversity was at risk of disappearing without an adequate scientific record. Thus Eyak helped to trigger a sea change in linguistic methodology leading to a global campaign to document endangered languages.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Squeezed between the Chugach peoples to the west and the Tlingit to the east, Eyak is a language without any close linguistic relatives. It is instead a kind of linguistic \"uncle\" to the vast Dene family of languages, being no more closely related to neighboring Ahtna than to distant Navajo. The sound system includes a unique set of vowel modifications which contrasts nasalization, length and a feature known as \"constriction.\" These modifications can be shown to relate in predictable ways to tone (voice pitch) in the Dene languages and also in Tlingit; thus Eyak provides a \"missing link\" confirming a genetic relationship between Dene and Tlingit. This fact alone demonstrates the enormous value that a single language can have to linguistic science, provided that language is adequately documented.</p>\n<p>Over a period of several decades Krauss collected field notes and recordings documenting Eyak, yet the amount of published material was limited to a technical monograph (1965) and a collection of stories by Eyak speaker Anna Nelson Harry (1982). This project set out with the goal of compiling this vast but unpublished documentary record of Eyak into a set of three reference volumes in the classic tradition of language description: Grammar, Dictionary and Texts.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shortly after the project began, Krauss became ill, and co-PI Holton assumed a greater role in the project. Fortunately, in spite of his illness, Krauss was able to retain intellectual leadership up until his passing in August 2019. This had the fortuitous effect of providing mentorship in Eyak linguistics to a core group of researchers who were able to continue the project, following Krauss' intellectual guidance. The 1200-page reference grammar is currently in the final stages of publication with Mouton press in the Mouton Grammar Library series, ensuring that it will be available to a wide audience in libraries across the world. The lexical database has been edited and is currently being formatted for publication both electronically (allowing full-text search) and in print form. The volume of texts is still being edited and will include transcriptions of all extant Eyak narrative recordings, with the words linked to the original audio.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This project has benefited enormously and synergistically from the growing Eyak language revitalization movement, ensuring that the documentation produced by this project is not a mere linguistic curiosity but instead contributes to the maintenance of an Alaska Native community and Alaska Native languages more broadly. Community members have had access to project materials as they have been produced, and most notably, community members have actively contributed to the documentation process itself. This broader impact may well be the most important and enduring contribution of the project, ensuring a long future for the Eyak language.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 07/19/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Gary&nbsp;Holton</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1642783/1642783_10078338_1689804315254_Pagesfromeyakgrammar--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1642783/1642783_10078338_1689804315254_Pagesfromeyakgrammar--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Eyak grammar sampel page\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1642783/1642783_10078338_1689804315254_Pagesfromeyakgrammar--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Eyak grammar sampel page\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Page sample from Eyak Grammar</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Gary Holton</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Gary&nbsp;Holton</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Eyak grammar sampel page</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1003160/1003160_10078338_1465363666272_GuillaumeLedueyteachingEyak--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1003160/1003160_10078338_1465363666272_GuillaumeLedueyteachingEyak--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Teaching Eyak language\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1003160/1003160_10078338_1465363666272_GuillaumeLedueyteachingEyak--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Teaching Eyak language\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Guillaume Leduey teaching at an Eyak Language Workshop, drawing on archival materials from the Alaska Native Language Archive</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Gary Holton</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Gary&nbsp;Holton</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Teaching Eyak language</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1003160/1003160_10078338_1465363872800_eyak_tshwanelex--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1003160/1003160_10078338_1465363872800_eyak_tshwanelex--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Eyak dictionary database\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1003160/1003160_10078338_1465363872800_eyak_tshwanelex--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Eyak dictionary database\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Sample image from the Eyak dictionary database</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Gary Holton</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Gary&nbsp;Holton</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Eyak dictionary database</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1003160/1003160_10078338_1465363550695_CordovatoYakutat--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1003160/1003160_10078338_1465363550695_CordovatoYakutat--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Locations of Eyak place names\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1003160/1003160_10078338_1465363550695_CordovatoYakutat--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Locations of Eyak place names\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Distribution of Eyak place names identified using archival data and Eyak field notes from the Alaska Native Language Archive.
