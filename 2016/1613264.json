 "awd_abstract_narration": "Choices made between outcomes available at different points in the future\r\n(intertemporal choices) constitute an important and common set of decisions\r\nencountered in everyday life. How people respond to such choices is also known\r\nto be predictive of a number of important life outcomes, and can be summarized\r\nusing laboratory measures of delay discounting. Understanding the cognitive\r\nbrain processes that underlie delay discounting, and particularly our ability to\r\nresist immediate temptations, is an important area of research in cognitive\r\nneuroscience. Significant progress has been made in this area over the past\r\ndecade. It is now well established that brain reward areas, including the\r\nventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), encode the subjective value of\r\nprospective rewards. It is also established that a network of regions in lateral\r\nprefrontal (lPFC), dorsomedial frontal (dmFC), and posterior parietal cortex (pPC)\r\nare engaged when making intertemporal choices. However, the role of this\r\nfronto-parietal cortical network (FPN) remains debated and less understood. The\r\ncurrent research project builds on recent computational modeling work done by\r\nMcClure and his colleagues to test and unify competing theories of FPN function\r\nin delay discounting. This work promises to further our understanding of the brain\r\nbasis of important cognitive processes related to the exertion of willpower and\r\nself-control.\r\n\r\nWe will conduct three studies that employ both fMRI and EEG to investigate the\r\nrole of different frontal and parietal regions in intertemporal decision-making. In\r\npreliminary work, we have used our computation model framework to\r\ndemonstrate that (1) the pPC interacts with the vmPFC during the valuing of\r\nchoice options, and (2) value information is accumulated in the dmFC during\r\naction selection. This project will further test how the FPN functions under\r\nconditions of temptation and cognitive load and how these manipulations\r\ninfluence choice outcomes. A number of disorders, including attention deficit\r\nhyperactivity disorder and drug addiction, have been directly associated with\r\ndelay discounting. The proposed studies of delay discounting therefore represent\r\na clear example in which cognitive neuroscience approaches promise to directly\r\nimpact and improve our understanding of normal and aberrant behavior. Finally,\r\ndecision neuroscience is a highly interdisciplinary field that combines elements of\r\neconomics, psychology, and neuroscience. It offers an exciting training\r\nopportunity for the students at various levels of training who will be directly\r\ninvolved in the project.",
