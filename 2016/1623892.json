 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Indo-US Workshop on Multiscale, Multiphysics Analysis of Energy Conversion in Li-ion Batteries will be held on June 15-17, 2016 at the Indian Institute of Technology in Bombay, India.  The workshop will bring together experts with diverse scientific and engineering backgrounds from the United States and India to discuss sustainable battery materials for electric transportation and renewable energy storage applications.   The topics will focus on lithium ion and sodium ion battery materials with properties enabled through nanotechnology, and the development of advanced mathematical modeling tools to better understand the performance of these battery materials, particularly with regards to safe operation of lithium ion batteries.   The workshop will support the travel of ten US-based university faculty members and graduate students to join a delegation supported by the Indo-US Science and Technology Forum.\r\n\r\nThe participants from the US and India will divide the workshop presentation topics equally to provide a comprehensive and interdisciplinary overview of lithium and sodium ion battery technology.  The US participants will present topics on multifunctional materials, future battery chemistries, sustainable energy conversion, thermal transport, and thermal-electrochemical coupling.  The participants from India will present topics on nanostructured material synthesis, Na-ion and Na-S batteries, multiphysics properties of nanostructures for energy storage, and molecular modeling.  The participant interactions are expected to lead to US-India collaborations in nanostructured energy conversion materials, high-rate electrochemistry, measurement of thermal-electrochemical coupling parameters, and multiscale modeling of simulation of Li-ion cells, with particular focus on thermal-electrochemical processes underlying battery safety.  Future collaborative research efforts will seek to establish multiscale structure-property-function relationships for lithium ion batteries, leading to models for electrochemical energy conversion need to develop safe and sustainable electric transportation systems.  A workshop report will be published as an invited article to the ASME Journal of Electrochemical Energy Storage and Conversion.",
