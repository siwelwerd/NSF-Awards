 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project concerns the field of algebraic geometry, a branch of mathematics studying the geometric structure of solutions of polynomial equations. Many of the questions under study in this project are motivated by string theory, a branch of theoretical physics connected with the structure of elementary particles. This project aims to significantly enhance the intensive and fruitful interaction between cutting edge research in enumerative algebraic geometry and theoretical physics. The research aims to extend mathematical developments that verify and generalize conjectures originating from physics, and the work is expected to significantly impact development of the physical theory as well. Through conferences, a summer school, seminars, and research involvement, this project provides unique opportunities for a new generation of mathematicians to obtain the interdisciplinary knowledge and skills needed to work in this exciting research area.\r\n\r\nThe aim of the project is to study enumerative invariants in the broad sense and their dependence on various stability conditions, as well as dualities relating different enumerative invariants. The investigators plan to further develop the theory of Gauged Linear Sigma Models (GLSM) and will study the epsilon-wall-crossing conjecture and zeta-wall-crossing conjecture at all genera; Gromov-Witten (GW) and quasimap invariants are related by a sequence of epsilon-wall-crossing, whereas the Calabi-Yau/Landau-Ginzburg correspondence (relating GW invariants and FJRW invariants) and Pfaffian/Grassmannian correspondence are examples of zeta-wall-crossing. The investigators are developing the theory of Mixed-Spin-P (MSP) fields, to interpolate GW theory of quintic threefolds and FJRW theory of Fermat quintic polynomials, and to study algebraic structures of higher genus GW and FJRW invariants. The new theories of GLSM and MSP fields will provide new tools to attack the central and longstanding problem of computing higher genus GW invariants of compact Calabi-Yau threefolds. The investigators have been investigating K-theoretic Donaldson-Thomas invariants of threefolds, as well as GW and quasimap invariants of Nakajima quiver varieties. Because some of conjectures motivated by theoretical physics can only be properly formulated in terms of K-theoretic enumerative invariants, they plan to study dualities relating K-theoretic enumerative invariants of different geometries, and to lift results on traditional enumerative invariants to the K-theoretic setting.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "This grant began under the PI Jun Li, and continued under the PI Ravi Vakil.  \nOften when asking questions in the mathematical sciences, there is a kind of parameter space or moduli space that corresponds to the objects you are interested in.    When trying to understand problems dealing with geometry of some sort (as happens in much of mathematics, as well as in parts of high energy physics), the resulting space most often also is \"geometric\", with notions of shape and size.    \nAs the question under consideration varies, one normally expects the moduli space to also vary in some nice way.  But occasionally, something abrupt happens --- some sort of \"phase transition\".    The question itself often has parameters in it that can be varied, and the space of those parameters is often divided into regions or \"rooms\" where the moduli space looks basically the same, but when you go through a wall, the moduli space suddenly changes, sometimes subtly, sometimes quite drastically.     This change is what is meant by \"wall-crossing phenomena\".\nThere are a number of reasons why we are led to the study of such phenomena.  One is that if you want to answer a question, but the answer surprisingly depends on which room you are in, then you want to know what the different answers are in each room, and how to change your answer as you move from room to room.\nA powerful related trick is if you seek the answer in a certain regime (in a certain \"room\"), and you know the answer in another room is zero (because the moduli space in that room is \"nothing\", the empty set), then you just need to walk form the \"zero\" room to the destination room, picking up contributions from each wall as you go.\nThe research funded by this grant dealt with this programme in enumerative geometry --- the \"numbers\" (or invariants) which carry information about the spaces.   The invariants in question were often variants or refinements of ones that came up in theoretical physics, but which turn out to be tightly linked to a number of important mathematical questions in algebraic geometry, symplectic geometry, hyperbolic geometry, and differential geometry.  \nThe proximate results of this grant are a number of theorems and theories, in published research papers, which were also made public through invited lecture in many places.  The work was done with younger researchers, and served as part of their apprenticeship as Ph.D. students or postdoctoral researchers, bringing them to the forefront of mathematical research.  One key contribution is the introduction of new kinds of \"intermediate moduli spaces\" that correspond to the following kind of question:  we know of two \"rooms\", and we realize they are in the same \"building\", and we figure out how to describe other rooms in the building, and how to walk from the first room to the second, through these newly-understood rooms, thereby connecting the theories in the two original rooms.  This metaphor reasonably describes a number of the papers produced under this grant, in broad brush strokes.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/04/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Ravi Vakil"
