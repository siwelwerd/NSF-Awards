 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Noyce Teacher Scholarship and Stipend project will prepare 15 undergraduates with interest and ability in mathematics to teach in high-needs rural or urban-centered school districts. Each student who completes the program, will graduate with a bachelor's degree in mathematics as well as with a bachelor's degree in secondary education (mathematics) or a master's degree in mathematics education.  The scholars will be provided with opportunities to (a) tutor students in an Upward Bound or a second-language learning program, (b) design and teach lessons, (c) do a variety of field placements, and (d) participate in seminars that focus on place-based teaching in high-needs schools.  The project will be conducted in partnership with a variety of Pennsylvania schools in Bald Eagle, McKeesport Area, Moshannon Valley, Penns Valley, West Branch, West Mifflin Area, Woodland Hills, and in Pittsburgh City Schools.\r\n\r\nThe key features of the project (multiple field placements, place-based pedagogy, and high school to college connections) are grounded on emerging research in the training of pre-service teachers. Throughout the project, students will be given the opportunity to participate in field experiences such as the Philadelphia Urban Seminar, a placement during which students, will be immersed in an urban high-needs community.  The coursework related to linking high school and college mathematics should enable the new teachers to help their students become college-ready.  Formative and summative evaluation will address the success of the program in reaching its retention, graduation, placement, and educational goals.  Assessment will be performed through a series of interviews, focus groups, and classroom observations.  Project results will be presented at meetings of the Association of Mathematics Teacher Educators and the Mathematics Association of America group on Research in Undergraduate Mathematics Education. Manuscripts will be submitted to the Journal of Teacher Education, the Journal of Mathematics Teacher Education, and the Mathematics Teacher Educator.",

The Penn State University Secondary Mathematics Noyce Scholars Program focused on preparing secondary mathematics teachers with strong mathematics and pedagogical background who would assume positions in high need rural and urban-centered schools. In addition to completing a major in mathematics, prospective teachers in this program experienced teaching in high need schools through a range of mentored experiences: an immersive two-week experience in urban schools, multiple day-long experiences in high need rural schools, an eight-week pre-student teaching experience in high need rural schools, and a fifteen-week student-teaching experience in a high need urban-centered or rural school. In addition to two methods courses on the teaching and learning of mathematics, program participants completed a course that engaged them in examining and experiencing teaching and learning with mathematics-specific technology. This focus on mathematics-specific technology is maintained throughout the program as well as is application of pedagogical principles. The experiences built into the program prepare the Noyce Scholars to develop their students' mathematical experiences that capitalizes on the mathematics-specific technology available in the school setting and that draws on students' experiences in their communities.    \n\n \n\nSupplementing the strong pedagogical and mathematical background and the extensive field experience in high need schools, the program develops place-based education (instruction that builds on features of the place in which the instruction occurs) as it applies to the education of students in high need urban-centered and rural schools. One approach to developing an understanding of place-based education was to engage participants in seminar sessions that drew on features of urban-centered and rural schools (e.g., the effects of poverty, the impact of opioid addiction, history of treatment in schools for Native Americans, the impact of practices such as redlining, the effects of fracking on Pennsylvania rural communities, the importance of understanding student backgrounds and of building curricula that is based in their experiences, and using mathematical modeling to explore social justice).

These courses were developed as permanent offerings.\n\nThe intellectual merit of the Penn State program is that it provides an example of the promise and difficulties involved in the recruitment and implementation of a teacher preparation program that couples teaching experience in high need settings and significant mathematics background with scholarly seminars related to place-based education in high need rural and urban-centered.\n\nObjectives for the program were to: (a) Increase the number of math majors who become certified to teach secondary mathematics; (b) Enhance the understanding of teaching mathematics in high-need rural and urban schools by prospective secondary mathematics students; (c) Identify and address factors that may lead to mathematics majors in this Noyce grant program accepting or not accepting positions teaching mathematics in high-need rural and urban schools; and (d) Identify and address factors that may lead to the retention or lack of retention of mathematics majors.\n\nMuch of the program described above developed participants? understanding of teaching mathematics in high need schools (objective b).  Regarding achievement of objective a, the program resulted in a small increase in the number of math majors at Penn State who were certified to teach secondary mathematics and an increase in the percent of teachers in the Penn State secondary mathematics teacher preparation program who completed Mathematics majors.
