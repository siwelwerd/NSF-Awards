Currently, researchers using proteins as biological tools in their experiments expend significant time, effort and money to design and manually build these proteins &ndash; and too often that cost is so high that researchers settle for using a tool that is less than optimal for their experimental purposes. Ensuring broad biological applicability of an experiment requires correct controls, both positive and negative, as well as multiple interrogation strategies that must each be validated. Without satisfying these requirements, an experiment?s applicability may be narrower than desired. In today?s experimental landscape where proteins are used as biological tools, there are technical hurdles that make broad applicability difficult to achieve. This proposal aimed to reduce these technical barriers by enabling scientists to design and economically obtain a logically complete set of protein tools in a way that allows them to logically optimize their experiments.  Further, by functionally annotating these designs scientists are able to rapidly disseminate those details to other scientists.\nThis SBIR Phase I project proposed to develop software for scientists to design and curate combinatorial libraries of novel proteins who?s DNA can be directly ordered from DNA synthesis companies. The purpose of this software is to enable a scientist to design and purchase a logically complete set of proteins that promote the broad biological applicability of their experiment.
