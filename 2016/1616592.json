 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project prepares an orientation determination and control system for spacecraft, aircraft and other vehicles for commercial development and use.  This technology is important because it allows these craft to determine their orientation and take corrective actions after an anomaly (such as unanticipated reorientation or sensor or movement hardware failure) has occurred.  Perhaps more importantly, this technology would enable an intelligent response to changes (whether gradual over time or abrupt) to facilitate keeping the system operating across a variety of real world circumstances that might otherwise significantly impair or disable the craft (or leave it needing controller input that cannot be received due to it being unable to regain the control required to point its antenna at controllers). This I-Corps team believes that this could have a significant positive effect on a number of application areas ranging from commercial spacecraft operators to national defense contractors.\r\n\r\nThe work seeks to achieve several goals.  First, the team aims to further advance the technology towards a point where it is ready to be commercialized.  Second, the team plans to build several conceptual demonstration units to facilitate explaining the technology to prospective licensees or users. Specifically, the team intends to conduct over 100 interviews with prospective users of/customers for the technology to aid in the team's assessment of its commercial potential. The team also plans to develop additional simulations and physical demonstrations to aid in prospective customer/user understanding of the technology.",
