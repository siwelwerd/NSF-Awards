Only where faults break the Earth's surface can we study the zones of active faulting directly; the rest, and often more complex part of the fault is buried deep underground. This project studies the fine-scale details of the structure and geometry of fault zones at crustal depths using aftershocks of larger earthquakes in California. Using highly accurate locations of aftershocks along faults that just broke in big earthquakes, the internal makeup of fault zones can be imaged at the meter scale. This will enable detailed studies of fault features such as the thickness of damage zones and irregularities in the fault surface, which are essential for understanding how faults work and which factors control the evolution of rupture.\r\n\r\nThe characterization of three-dimensional fault zone structure and its evolution is essential for understanding how faults work and which factors control the evolution of rupture. This project studies the ultra-fine, three-dimensional structure of active faults in California, how it evolves with fault maturity, and how it ultimately governs the initiation, propagation, and termination of earthquakes. Geological studies of fault outcrops have provided a generalized and highly simplified, one-dimensional picture of faults in which the fault core, including the principal slip surface(s), is surrounded by a damage zone of fractured rock. In three dimensions faults appear to be much more complex and a complete description of them, even an idealized one, does not exist. This project?s main goal is a systematic and comparative analysis of over 150,000 high-precision aftershock locations and additional parameters associated with 78 large (M &#8805; 5.5) strike-slip and thrust earthquakes in California that have the resolution power to image the internal structure and properties of fault zones at the scale of tens of meters or better. These data are used to investigate the evolution of fault zone structure with fault maturity, and to measure features of fault maturity such as the evolution of the smoothness of the fault and growth (or shrinkage) of the damage zone with fault displacement. We expect this study to recognize common factors in the fine structure of these faults and the earthquakes that occurred on them as well as how these features change with fault maturity. Furthermore, fault segmentation, jogs, and step overs will be characterized and their role in the nucleation and arrest of rupture as well as in fault growth and interaction investigated.",

Long-term surface fault traces indicate that structural heterogeneities associated with secondary reverse and normal fault structures are present at both rupture tips, near Middle Mountain and Gold Hill (Figure 1). Detailed analysis of almost 50 years of high-resolution seismicity reveals a fault plane that has been twisted into a helicoid between Middle Mountain and Gold Hill. Numerical models support our conclusion that this shape is the result of long-term torqueing of a strong stuck patch surrounded by a weak creeping region (Figure 2). The changes in fault friction behavior and related geometric discontinuities act as barriers to rupture propagation of moderate size earthquakes at Parkfield, and as areas of stress concentrations where rupture initiates. Our study demonstrates also that smooth strike-slip faults with large cumulative offset can form new fault segments at a late stage in their evolution.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In a second study we used high-resolution aftershock locations to characterize the three-dimensional structure of active faults in California and how it evolves with fault structural maturity (Perrin et al., 2020, in preparation). Specifically, we estimate the widths of the shear damage zone using precise aftershock locations of several large earthquakes and relate them to long term fault displacement (Figure 3). We find that the zone of brittle deformation around the fault core is narrower along mature faults (e.g., Figure 4) compared to immature faults. We observe a rapid fall off of the number of events at a distance range of 70 ? 100 m from the main fault surface of mature faults, and 200-300 m from the fault surface of immature faults (Figure 5). The total width of the active zone of deformation surrounding the main fault plane reach ~1.2 km and 2-4 km for mature and immature faults, respectively. The wider zone of deformation presumably reflects the increased heterogeneity in the stress field along complex and discontinuous faults strands that make up immature faults (Figure 5c). In contrast, narrower deformation zones tend to align with well-defined fault planes of mature faults where most of the deformation is concentrated. Our results are in line with previous studies suggesting that surface fault traces become smoother, and thus fault zones simpler, as cumulative fault slip increases.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 06/08/2020<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Felix&nbsp;Waldhauser</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1520680/1520680_10403040_1591665818151_NSF_EARFPR_Outcome_Figure1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1520680/1520680_10403040_1591665818151_NSF_EARFPR_Outcome_Figure1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1520680/1520680_10403040_1591665818151_NSF_EARFPR_Outcome_Figure1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Figure 1: Map view (a-c) and cross section (d) of faults and seismicity from 1966 to 2015 along the Parkfield section of the San Andreas Fault, California.
