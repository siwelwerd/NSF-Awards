 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project will research how informal science learning can be supported while museum visitors are engaged in \"productive struggle\" with interactive exhibits. Often informal science learning projects focus on developing positive affective outcomes.  Research has shown, however, that negative affective experiences such as struggle and challenge can be particularly powerful for learning. Learners who experience struggle and effort are likely to adopt a growth mindset, in which they attribute their mastery of skills and understanding to effort rather than innate ability.  This been shown to be an important factor in lifelong learning, academic achievement, and persistence. The research will develop and refine a model of productive struggle and its impact in designed informal science learning experiences, and will elaborate a flexible set of evidence-based design guidelines and strategies for eliciting and supporting visitor engagement in productive struggle. This project is supported by the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program which funds research and innovative resources for use in a variety of settings as a part of its overall strategy to enhance learning in informal environments.\r\n\r\nResearch suggests that productive struggle, which manifests itself as confusion or even frustration, can occur when learners actively engage in challenges that push them just beyond the limits of their existing capabilities. For learners to engage in productive struggle, they must perceive that their efforts will be worthwhile. The research will (1) explore the individual and contextual factors associated with the emotional experience of productive struggle during informal learning experiences, (2) elaborate how learning experience design strategies can be implemented to support diverse learners to successfully engage in productive struggle, and (3) examine the relationships between productive struggle experiences, learner characteristics, and desired learning outcomes. Through an iterative research process involving qualitative comparative analysis, design-based research, and descriptive quantitative analysis, the proposed project will develop an empirically-tested theoretical model and a refined and tested set of guidelines and strategies for designing informal learning experiences which encourage productive struggle.",

Building off research showing that difficult emotions can enhance learning, this project's team of researchers and museum professionals from the Museum of Science, Boston, EdTogether, CAST, and the University of Rochester has designed exhibits and conducted research about how to support the emotional experience of productive struggle. This project defines productive struggle as having three parts: first, someone encounters something disruptive that causes them to struggle, feeling emotions like confusion or frustration. Second, the exhibit supports them to persist through that struggle. Third, the person feels a sense of productivity that can be connected with resolving the struggle or having an overall sense of achievement.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Through this project, the project team built three museum exhibits that fostered productive struggle. The first was a physical challenge where people try to move slowly enough to sneak up on a virtual bird. The second exhibit involves using a screen-based interface to answer questions about skulls to try to figure out what they are. At the third exhibit, visitors manipulate air with fans and vacuums to move ping pong balls through various puzzles. The team developed these exhibits iteratively--testing our prototypes along the way and trying different strategies for supporting productive struggle. Researchers and museum professionals documented their learning in a framework that lists the effective approaches museums can use to encourage visitors to encounter productive struggle.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Once the team had finalized its exhibits, the researchers led a final study about productive struggle.

The research also explored the outcomes of productive struggle. The project found that people who experienced productive struggle stayed longer at the exhibits, tried more attempts at the exhibits, and were more likely to describe learning that was aligned with the exhibit's content goals. In follow-up interviews, participants also shared that they valued having these difficult but satisfying experiences. For example, one shared, \"My definition of a valuable experience is me trying, failing, but in the end succeeding, and I did that multiple times...I think something is valuable if it means something, if it's easy it doesn't mean anything, and if it's too hard it doesn't really mean anything either, but if it's just right it means a lot.\"</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>To help share the lessons learned from this project, the team has delivered numerous conference sessions, written a book chapter, submitted two journal articles, written a guide about designing museum exhibits that support productive struggle, and led professional development workshops for museum professionals.
