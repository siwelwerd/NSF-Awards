 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will investigate the relationship between land surface and atmospheric water transport over grassland and cropland regions such as the United States Southern Great Plains and Chinese grasslands. The PI will collaborate with Dr. Youngryel Ryu and his laboratory students at Seoul National University in Seoul, South Korea. Dr. Ryu is the developer of the Breathing Earth System Simulator (BESS) model that estimates how much water is exchanged between the land and atmosphere. This model provides global estimates of water exchange from 2000-2015. The PI will be analyzing the modeled results to see how well it can estimate the amount of water that is exchanged over grassland and cropland regions. Understanding the water cycle over agricultural regions, such as the Southern Great Plains, is important for water budgeting, weather prediction, crop and livestock management, and many other applications. \r\n\r\nThe project focuses on the Evapotranspiration (ET) aspect of the water cycle over grassland and cropland regions. The region of interest for the project is over the United States Southern Great Plains that includes Kansas, Oklahoma, and northern portions of Texas as well as grassland regions in China. The BESS model developed by Dr. Ryu produces 1 to 5 km spatial and 8-day temporal resolution of modeled ET over the entire globe from 2000-2015. A validation of BESS will be constructed by comparing the modeled ET with observed ET at various observing sites in the regions. The PI will assess the spatial and temporal variations of ET over the regions of interest using the modeled output. This information can then be used to determine how agricultural practices and weather patterns influence ET in these regions and how ET in these areas may respond to climate change.\r\n\r\nThis award under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the National Research Foundation of Korea.",

It is difficult and costly to measure these processes over a large region. Satellites are a better option to measure how much water is leaving the surface of the Earth because they can provide global measurements quickly. However, the issue is that we do not have appropriate techniques for accurately quantifying these processes with the satellite data. It is still being debated on what is the most appropriate method for estimating evaporation from satellite data. This research explores one of these methods. The Breathing Earth System Simulator (BESS) developed by Dr. Youngryel Ryu at Seoul National University estimates how much water is leaving the surface of the Earth by using satellite data. However, this method is fairly young and has not been tested across much of the globe. Since the SGP has not been analyzed using this method it was appropriate to do so. From the results of this research it was concluded that BESS performs better at estimating evaporation across the SGP than several other methods. These results then led to a deeper analysis of how evaporation magnitude varies during different weather conditions, years, and agricultural practices across the SGP. It was found that evaporation is highly variable across the SGP and that there is more evaporation in the eastern portion of the SGP than the western portion. In fact, on average 76% of rain that falls across the SGP is actually partitioned back into the atmosphere through evaporation. This research helped shed light onto how much water has left the surface of the SGP from 2000-2015. These results can be used to better understand the past climate of this region and the future water resources.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 03/14/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Hayden&nbsp;R&nbsp;Mahan</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImage\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation onePhoto\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1614304/1614304_10433487_1489097023747_JuneET--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1614304/1614304_10433487_1489097023747_JuneET--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Southern Great Plains ET\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1614304/1614304_10433487_1489097023747_JuneET--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Southern Great Plains ET\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Average daily evapotranspiration over the Southern Great Plains of the United States during June.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Hayden Mahan</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Hayden&nbsp;R&nbsp;Mahan</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Southern Great Plains ET</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
