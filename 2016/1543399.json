 "awd_abstract_narration": "The continent of Antarctica has approximately the same surface area as the continental United States, though we know significantly less about its underlying geology and seismic activity. Multinational investments in geophysical infrastructure over the last few decades, especially broadband seismometers operating for several years, are allowing us to observe many interesting natural phenomena, including iceberg calving, ice stream slip, and tectonic earthquakes. To specifically leverage those past investments, we will analyze past and current data to gain a better understanding of Antarctic seismicity. Our recent research revealed that certain large earthquakes occurring elsewhere in the world triggered ice movement near various stations throughout Antarctica. We plan to conduct an exhaustive search of the terabytes of available data, using cutting-edge computational techniques, to uncover additional evidence for ice crevassing, ice stream slip, and earth movement during earthquakes. One specific focus of our research will include investigating whether some of these phenomena may be triggered by external influences, including passing surface waves from distant earthquakes, ocean tides, or seasonal melt. We plan to produce a catalog of the identified activity and share it publicly, so the public and researchers can easily access it. To reach a broader audience, we will present talks to high school classes, including Advanced Placement classes, in the Austin, Texas and Atlanta, Georgia metropolitan areas with emphasis on general aspects of seismic hazard, climate variability, and the geographies of Antarctica. This project will provide research opportunities for undergraduates, training for graduate students, and support for an early-career scientist.\r\n\r\nIn recent years, a new generation of geodetic and seismic instrumentation has been deployed as permanent stations throughout Antarctica (POLENET), in addition to stations deployed for shorter duration (less than 3 years) experiments (e.g. AGAP/TAMSEIS). These efforts are providing critical infrastructure needed to address fundamental questions about both crustal-scale tectonic structures and ice sheets, and their interactions.  We plan to conduct a systematic detection of tectonic and icequake activities in Antarctica, focusing primarily on background seismicity, remotely-triggered seismicity, and glacier slip events. Our proposed tasks include: (1) Identification of seismicity throughout the Antarctic continent for both tectonic and ice sources. (2) An exhaustive search for additional triggered events in Antarctica during the last ~15 years of global significant earthquakes. (3) Determination of triggered source mechanisms and whether those triggered events also occur at other times, by analyzing years of data using a matched-filter analysis (where the triggered local event is used to detect similar events). (4) Further analysis of GPS measurements over a ~5.5 year period from Whillans Ice Plain, which suggests that triggering of stick-slip events occurred after the largest earthquakes. An improved knowledge of how the Antarctic ice sheet responds to external perturbations such as dynamic stresses from large distant earthquakes and recent ice unloading could lead to a better understanding of ice failure and related dynamic processes. By leveraging the vast logistical investment to install seismometers in Antarctica over the last decade, our project will build an exhaustive catalog of tectonic earthquakes, icequakes, calving events, and any other detectable near-surface seismic phenomena.",

In the past few decades, many geophysical instruments have been deployed in this continent, allowing us to observe many interesting natural phenomena, including iceberg calving, ice stream slip, and tectonic earthquakes.

However, most of those triggered events are only recorded by a single station, and hence cannot be easily located. In this project, we systematically examine evidence of remotely triggered microseismicity around Mt. Erebus with many seismic stations during a 16-yr time period. Mt. Erebus is a large active stratovolcano that forms the bulk of Ross Island, Antarctica. It is the southernmost active volcano on Earth and is located approximately 35 km from McMurdo Station (United States) and Scott Base (New Zealand) (Figure 1). The eruption style on Mt. Erebus is relatively mild Strombolian type eruptions from a long-lived lava lake. With ongoing small-scale eruptions, persistent lava lakes, and longstanding monitoring infrastructure, the volcano is a natural laboratory to study volcanic processes and interactions between volcanoes, earthquakes and ice movements.</p>\n<p>In a recently published work (Li et al., SRL, 2021), we detected many small seismic events around Mt. Erebus one day before and after 43 large distant earthquakes. We found that 7 large earthquakes (including the 2010 magnitude 8.8 Maule, Chile and 2012 magnitude 8.6 Indian Ocean events) triggered local seismicity on the volcano (Figure 2).</p>\n<p>Most triggered events occurring during the passage of the Rayleigh waves from distant mainshocks. In addition, their waveforms and locations for the triggered events are different when comparing with seismic events during persistent small-scale eruptions, but they are similar to other detected events before/after the mainshocks. Based on the waveform similarities and their locations, we infer that these triggered events are likely shallow icequakes triggered by stress perturbations from teleseismic surface waves.</p>\n<p>We found that distant earthquakes with higher peak amplitudes (and hence peak dynamic stress changes) are more capable of triggering icequakes at Mt. Erebus (Figure 3). We also found that the icequakes in this study are more likely to be triggered during the austral summer months. Our studies highlight the need to continuously monitor Mt. Erebus with dense seismic instrumentation to better understand the interactions between volcanic and cryospheric processes and global seismic activities in Antarctica.</p>\n<p>This project support one master student and one Ph.D. student at Georgia Tech.
