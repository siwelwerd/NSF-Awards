 "awd_abstract_narration": "Most animals survive in turbulent air or water environments and are living proof that it is possible to quantify odor signals in complex turbulent flow conditions to track and find sources of odors (such as food, mates, etc.). However, our engineering knowledge is still incapable of formulating simple and effective measurements that will enable man-made systems to predict, navigate and utilize properties of this turbulent flow to locate sources of chemical release. This project builds on recent exciting computational modeling of the neurobiology of organisms by the proposers, which predict that lobsters are capable of estimating not only the concentration of odors but also the time since the last odor was encountered. Lobsters accomplish this by using ensemble competition across a population of olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs), called \"bursting ORNs\". Bursting ORNs function to compute the time since last encounter of an odor that, along with concentration, can provide a measure of the distance to the odor source. This research will seek to increase understanding of how ORNs perceive odor concentration and intermittency measured within an odor plume, and how this information is integrated within the lobster?s brain. An additional goal is to develop new neurobiology-based theories in the search for odor sources that can be implemented within human-engineered autonomous underwater vehicles that have the ability to navigate in turbulent chemical plumes.\r\n\r\nThe broader implications of this work stem from the large potential market for defense and civilian applications of a new generation of electronic noses for tracking chemicals in natural or man-initiated disasters. Through this project, there are also excellent resources and outreach opportunities for integrated education and training of students at the intersection of fluid dynamics, neuroscience, computer engineering and information processing. Outreach will be coordinated through the Center of Innovative Brain Machine Interfaces at the University of Florida and will provide opportunities for undergraduate and graduate research, promote neurotechnology innovations, and foster entrepreneurship activities in order to create potential future start-up companies.\r\n\r\nThe research will include laboratory experiments of chemical plume mixing and ORN responses to odor encounters by lobsters, theoretical analysis of search optimization, as well as numerical simulations and novel system architecture for electronic noses. This research brings together a multidisciplinary and complementary team of experts, including a fluid dynamicist, a neurobiologist, and an electrical engineer with the very clear goal of understanding and exploiting olfactory scene analysis in turbulent flow. In this new light, neurobiologists will understand new sensing strategies for olfaction, and engineers can improve the quantification of turbulent mixing and replicate these sensory strategies to propose novel bio-inspired sensors capable of quantifying the dispersion of chemical plumes and improve the search for the source.",

This summary addresses the signal processing and computational modeling component of the grant. We proposed a novel way to model odor plumes based on the discovery of groups of neurons in the lobster nose that oscillate (bursting Olfactory Neurons or bORNS) when an odor is received. Through computational modeling we verified that the population of bORNS can estimate the time since the last time the odor was received, i.e. the population is sensitive to intermittence in the odor plume. From the theory of Poincare recurrency, we further established that the time since the last odor encounter is a noisy (stochastic) estimate of the T1 index of chaotic dynamics, that is one of quantifiers of chaotic flow. Therefore, our working hypothesis is that lobsters use their bORNs to navigate the environment by seeking the source of odor plumes. This component of the grant designed and tested algorithms that work in real time to take advantage of the spatial gradient of the T1 index. Because of the difficulty of the task, we first validated the approach with simulations in a realistic virtual environment of turbulent plumes developed by our colleague at the U. of Virginia. We created a virtual animat equipped with two rigid sensors that sensed the ?odor? (color concentration) in the plume and decided the way to proceed to maximize the gradient of the T1 index. As a comparison, we created a second virtual animat that responded to the local concentration of odor, which is based on the current static views of ORNs.&nbsp;&nbsp;We showed that the mean time to find the source of the plume is significantly shorter, and more robust with the bORNs hypothesis (T1 index) than with the ORNs (concentration), while the tracks are more stable and tend to be more biological realistic (along the edge of the plume). The planned computational portion of the grant did not advance much because of experimental difficulties in making population electrical measurements in living lobsters. Since bORNs have also been discovered in mammalian noses, we developed a transient model for local field potentials, anticipating the possibility of performing, in the future, electrical recordings in mouse. One of the major requirements is to be able to measure olfactory bulb signal neuromodulation with high precision (millisecond precision), which is not possible with current spectral techniques. Our modeling provides the required time resolution, and the algorithm is being tested with more available data from mouse cortex for neuromuscular control. The results are extremely promising. The project funded two Ph.D. students at the ECE Dept, University of Florida. Two journal papers were published acknowledging the grant, with others submitted and in preparation, as well as one plenary speech in an international conference. A potential industrial impact is the design of a new generation of electronic noses, which now sense the type of smell, but are oblivious where the scent comes from. A robot navigating with the help of our algorithm could guide automatically the robot equipped with electronic noses to the source of the smell.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/03/2020<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Jose&nbsp;C&nbsp;Principe</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImage\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation onePhoto\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1631759/1631759_10451267_1601756946041_outcomes1024_2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1631759/1631759_10451267_1601756946041_outcomes1024_2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Comparison of two search algorithms in turbulent flow\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1631759/1631759_10451267_1601756946041_outcomes1024_2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Comparison of two search algorithms in turbulent flow\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Each of the 5000 green dots is the random start locations for a search.
