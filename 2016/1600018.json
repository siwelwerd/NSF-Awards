 "awd_abstract_narration": "This collaborative proposal aims to combine advances in ice core sampling technology, knowledge of Andean storm event meteorology, cyberinfrastructure, and climate modeling and analysis to fresh snow, snowpits and ice core data to be recovered from ice caps in Peru and Bolivia.\r\n\r\nThe specific goals of the project are to investigate South American atmospheric circulation features (e.g. El Ni\u00f1o/La Ni\u00f1a (ENSO), South American Low-level Jet, Southern Hemisphere trades and westerlies), tropical-mid-latitude-polar teleconnections, and the significance of key global-scale forcing functions that control atmospheric circulation (e.g. solar variability, volcanic activity, dusts, and greenhouse gases) and have significant relevance to moisture and heat transport over South America.\r\n\r\nThe regional retreat of alpine glaciers coupled with increased population, industry, and agriculture activities are generating future demands on water resources. Declines in water resources may magnify the regional impacts of ENSO.  Instrumental records of climate and environmental variability over the region are sparse yet ice cores from Central Andean glaciers provide a source of high resolution records of past climate dynamics and chemistry of the atmosphere extending back centuries to millennia.  \r\n\r\nClimate reconstructions from ice cores could provide added temporal and spatial context to existing multi-proxy reconstructions in order to assess the impact of natural and human-induced physical and chemical climate change at the storm-scales that impact day to day and season to season events, and in the process, develop analogs for predicting future change.\r\n\r\nThis project builds on the researchers' recent W.M. Keck Foundation and NSF-supported transformative laser sampling of ice cores and the newly released, NSF-supported cyberinfrastructure and climate analysis tools.  It also involves supporting an early career post-doctoral scholar, development and testing of new analytical tools, and strong collaboration with South American scientists.",

Tropical ice core records such as those from Quelccaya have been used to understand human impacts on the chemistry of the atmosphere, changes in atmospheric circulation over tropical South America, the coincidence and potential contributions of climate change to the status of landscapes (desert, tropical forest, water availability), ecosystems (grazing, agriculture, species distribution) and the course of past civilizations.</p>\n<p>Our project included partner researchers from Peru (Instituto Nacional de Investigaci?n en Glaciares y Ecosistemas de Monta?a (INAIGEM); Universidad Nacional de San Antonio Abad del Cusco); Brazil (Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sol) and the US (Appalachian State University). It introduced graduate students and early career researchers to local Andean culture, local people, and field research in remote high altitudes while also helping to advance their understanding of field and laboratory research, data interpretation, presentation of research results and the production and publication of peer-reviewed scientific publications.</p>\n<p>We conducted two field seasons on Quelccaya (2018 and 2022) separated because of COVID restrictions. In 2018 we recovered a 25 m deep, electromechanically drilled ice core from the summit of Quelccaya. In 2022 we recovered a thermally drilled ice core from the summit of the glacier to bedrock (128.55 m depth) with the support of the US Ice Drilling Program (University of Wisconsin).</p>\n<p>Analysis of the upper 25m of both the Quelccaya ice core and a 25 m ice core from Illimani in Bolivia, provided by our Brazilian colleagues, demonstrates that while separated by ~450 km they have very similar chemistry records suggesting that the climatology, as derived from these chemistry records, is also similar. However, Quelccaya (5670 masl) has experienced significantly more surface melt than Illimani (6438 masl). In addition, there has been a marked increase in surface melting on the Quelccaya ice cap between the 2018 and 2022 field seasons leading to increased exposure of crevasses.</p>\n<p>We compared temperature, precipitation, and other climate variables from six widely used climate reanalysis products used to: gain climate change perspective, as input to model predictions for future climate, and to inform ice-core climate proxy record calibration in the Altiplano region of the central Andes. The reanalyzes are ERA5, MERRA2, Japanese 55-year Reanalysis, Climate Forecast System Reanalysis and version 2 extension, and NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis. We validated these data products against observations from automatic weather stations on the Quelccaya Ice Cap, Peru (5,670 m asl) and Chacaltaya, Bolivia (5,238 m asl), in addition to lower sites ranging in elevation 2,500?4,900 m asl. Our results suggest that ERA5 provides the most robust overall depiction of temperature and precipitation across the study domain, and the data set is particularly useful for its back-extension to 1950. Examination of ERA5 vertical atmospheric profiles for a latitudinal transect over Quelccaya shows considerable variability, including across major El Nino events.</p>\n<p>Based on detailed snowpit sampling on Quelccaya and a regional citizen science sampling network variability in water isotope values is found to be directly associated with changes in synoptic weather events. This improves the application of ice core data recovered from this region in terms of its application to individual storm events and atmospheric circulation pattern associations.</p>\n<p>During the 2022 thermal drilling organic material was detected at two levels (122 and 124 m) in the 128.55 m deep ice core to bedrock. Along with the ice surrounding the visible organic material that can also be radiocarbon dated this offers the most substantial opportunity to date to assess the actual age of the ice recovered from a summit to bedrock Quelccaya ice core.</p>\n<p>The potential value of our ultra-high resolution laser-based ice core sampling (120 micron) versus classic continuous melter and/or discrete mechanical cut sampling (1-4 cm resolution) is validated by the detection of annual layers (based on least 80 samples per year) in highly compressed near-basal Quelcccaya cliff ice and spot sampling of a lower section (120 m) of the 2022 thermally drilled Quelccaya summit ice core to bedrock (128.55 m). Laser analysis of the 2022 ice core will at the very least provide sub-annual scale resolution throughout the estimated 1200-year record developed in previous research and reported as annual sampling back ~400 years and multi-year sampling at older levels.&nbsp; Future examination of the 2022 ice core will yield potentially an even longer than 1200-year record.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 06/28/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Paul&nbsp;A&nbsp;Mayewski</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1600018/1600018_10431874_1687962673637_Slide5--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1600018/1600018_10431874_1687962673637_Slide5--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Transporting ice cores off the summit of Quelccaya\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1600018/1600018_10431874_1687962673637_Slide5--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Transporting ice cores off the summit of Quelccaya\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Transporting ice cores off the summit of Quelccaya with our Peruvian logistics colleagues</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">M.
