 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ice accumulation causes accidents and disruptions in transportation activities around the globe.  Roadway ice often occurs in ways that are difficult for drivers to detect. Similarly, airborne icing conditions are hazardous and occur in ways that are difficult for pilots to detect. Current motor vehicles and general aviation ice detection systems are merely simple notifications that the air temperature is near or below the freezing temperature of water.  Unfortunately, measurements of temperature alone are not capable of detecting the presence of hazardous icing conditions. Commercial airplanes have more complex icing detection systems, but unfortunately they measure ice accumulation on probes away from the areas in which ice accumulation can create hazardous flight conditions.  This I-Corps team has developed a simple optical system capable of detecting hazardous icing on roads, and capable of detecting icing hazardous ahead of aircrafts.\r\n\r\nA major goal of this project is to implement the icing detection technology developed at the University of Michigan into existing cameras and investigate what the best adoption pathway for it is. A proof-of-concept prototype of a simple system capable of detecting slippery black ice on roads, bridges, and runaways will be developed. A system capable of warning drivers about the presence of\r\nslippery black ice on roads can be fabricated using existing cameras and optical detectors. At night, light sources covering the spectral range of interest can be used to illuminate bridges, roads and runways. Once icing is detected, alerts can be displayed on monitors or via warning lights. As part of this project, a proof-of-concept prototype will be demonstrated to potential customers.\r\nThe proposed technology has been tested successfully in the laboratory and outdoors. It can be implemented in existing motor vehicle cameras, web cameras currently used to monitor roads, and in existing aircrafts' camera systems.",
