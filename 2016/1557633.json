 "awd_abstract_narration": "At the dawn of agriculture, our ancestors harvested wild grains and began replanting them year after year. This process rapidly led to selection for grains that stayed on the plant, instead of falling on the ground. Now, 10,000 years later, this capacity to stay on the plant until harvest has obvious economic importance. The change from wild grains that fall and cultivated ones that do not is caused by naturally occurring mutations in a normal (that is wild) process. However, the process of shedding seeds occurs differently in different grains. For example, the details of dropping seeds in wild rice are different from those in wild sorghum or wild millet. This project will discover what natural mutations led to the cultivated grains, and whether the natural process of shedding seeds in rice, sorghum, and millet is genetically similar. Because retaining seeds on the plant is the very basis of agriculture, it is an obvious aspect of plants that can engage students at all education levels. Master teachers and undergraduate education majors at Oklahoma State University, as well as undergraduate science majors and local high school students, will participate actively in the observations and data collection required for the project.\r\n\r\nShedding of seeds occurs via a characteristic zone of weakness, the abscission zone (AZ), in which the contents of cells and cell walls are modified to allow a fruit to fall off the parent plant. This project will test whether development is generally conservative, i.e., whether the AZ is produced by activating a conserved developmental program at different times or in different locations, or whether development produces novel structures (in this case, the AZ) by using novel gene combinations. Specifically, recombinant inbred lines and wild accessions will be used to identify genes that contribute to shattering in the model species green millet (Setaria viridis). These studies will be complemented by transcriptomic data on green millet in comparison to Brachypodium distachyon and rice. These investigations will test the hypothesis that some aspects of AZ development are shared among the three species but that many aspects differ because the AZ forms in a different position in each. The investigation will then be expanded to many other grasses, some of which are similar to millet, rice and Brachypodium, and some of which show distinct patterns of seed shedding. The results will define the extent of parallel and convergent evolution in an ecologically and economically critical pathway.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project tested an apparently simple hypothesis, that formation of an abscission zone would be controlled by similar genes in all species and in all positions on the plant.  An abscission zone is a specialized break-point, where a leaf, flower or fruit falls off the main plant.  In many cases, it is comprised of a layer of small, more or less round cells that are clearly distinguishable from the cells on either side.  In addition, the cell walls in the abscission zone are often made up of different materials from the surrounding cells.  The combination of cell size and cell composition makes the abscission zone easily visible in cross section.\n\n            Wild grasses drop their seeds at maturity, which is a necessary process to disperse the offspring from the parent plant. The seeds almost always fall off with other plant structures, although exactly which structures are involved, and hence the position of the abscission zone, differs between species.  We hypothesized that there must be an ?abscission zone program? that is simply switched on or off at different times in development or different positions in the plant.\n\n            This hypothesis was wrong.  Three species (rice, Brachypodium, and Setaria) were studied in depth.  The cell structure and cell wall composition of the abscission zone in rice were already well known, and we confirmed the published results.  However, the structure of the zone in Brachypodium and Setaria was novel (Figure 1).  With the help of two talented undergraduate students and two high school students, the sample was expanded to include a total of 17 species, uncovering even more diversity.\n\nWe then extended our observations to gene expression, and found that, although each species has a set of genes that are specifically expressed in the abscission zone, only a couple of genes are common to all species.  In other words, each species has its own ?abscission zone program?, but the program is not shared among species.\n\n            Despite this great diversity, we have identified two genes that seem to control abscission in several species, albeit by apparently different mechanisms.  We have created mutations in these genes using CRISPR-Cas9 so we can determine more about what they do in each species.\n\n            This result has practical implications.  All cereal crops (domesticated grasses) hold on to their seeds until harvest.  Their abscission zones have been disabled by mutations in the underlying genetic network.  In the parlance of agriculture, the crops are described as non-shattering whereas their wild relatives are shattering. Crops that could be the grains of the future (for example, the African grains tef and fonio) are partially or wholly shattering, meaning that many of the seeds end up on the ground rather than in the hands of farmers.  Our data shows what it will take to disable the abscission zone in these crops.  Because of the enormous diversity that we have found in the way grains fall off the plant, each crop needs to be studied individually and the genetic basis of shattering worked out de novo.\n\n            Our work has involved many students and public outreach efforts.  We have trained several undergraduates and high school students, and two of the undergraduates are authors on publications. The project has been led by a post-doc, Dr. Yunqing Yu, who regularly gives talks to high school and elementary school students about where food comes from and how domesticated plants lose shattering.  Notably, all the trainees supported by this grant are women and all are moving on to higher levels of education and professional work in science.  We have thus contributed to continued development of the scientific work force and enhanced participation of under-represented groups.\n\n            In summary, a project involving basic research on a single layer of small cells has provided education for trainees at all levels. In addition, it has provided the foundational knowledge needed for improving cereal crops.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/10/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Elizabeth A Kellogg"
