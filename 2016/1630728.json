The conference will be held in New York City, New York on July 5-8th 2016. Supporting student travel to attend professional conferences and workshops is a very important mission of the NSF.  This award provides travel grants that will allow highly talented PhD students to attend LICS, which will give them the opportunity to attend technical talks, and interact with established experts in the field. The broader significance and importance includes fostering the next generation of researchers in this research area, as well as providing international experiences to build a globally-aware workforce. The organizers will give priority to students from under-represented groups and from small universities.",
