 "awd_abstract_narration": "Partially saturated soils are three-phase earth materials that contain both air and water in the void space between the solid grains.  Such soils are commonly encountered in field construction for a wide range of civil engineering works, including foundations, landfills, slopes, retaining walls, compacted fills, and highways.  The mechanical behavior of partially saturated soils is not well understood because of complex interactions of the three phases.  This award supports fundamental research, using both experimental and computer modeling methods, to provide needed knowledge of the mechanisms by which partially saturated soils undergo deformation and volume change (i.e., consolidation) under various loading conditions.  This work has the potential to transform current understanding of partially saturated soils, which has relevance to sampling, testing, characterization, and monitoring, as well as design and construction of sustainable civil infrastructures using these materials.\r\n\r\nThe objective of this research program is to conduct a comprehensive experimental and computational investigation of multiphase consolidation for partially saturated soils, and then assess the significance of these findings for relevant applications in geotechnical and geoenvironmental engineering.  This work has both intrinsic scientific merit in terms of advancing the current understanding of a widespread physical process, as well as practical utility in terms of developing improved prediction methods for settlement, fluid flow, effective stress, and final material property profiles for a wide range of engineering applications.  The experimental program will include multiphase consolidation tests conducted for a variety of soils with changing stress and hydrologic conditions.  Measured data will be interpreted using a new and consistent framework based on unified effective stress theory and the suction stress characteristic curve.  The computational program will develop new models using a novel tri-lagrangian (solid-water-air) discretization method to track movements of each phase while accounting for geometric and material nonlinearities, compressible non-Darcy gas flow, coupled flow effects, phase discontinuities, and mechanical and hydrologic hysteresis.  Once validated, the new models will be used to perform numerical simulation studies to assess the significance of multiphase soil consolidation for a variety of engineering applications and highlight the importance of these effects to the broader geotechnical and geoenvironmental engineering community.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project was a collaborative effort between the Pennsylvania State University and the Colorado School of Mines.  The major goal of the project has been to advance the state-of-the-art with respect to current understanding of the mechanisms and modeling of volume change behavior and multi-phase consolidation for unsaturated (i.e., 3-phase) soils and then assess the significance of these findings for a variety of applications in geotechnical and geoenvironmental engineering.  Research also was conducted on several other related topics for the project, including consolidation, coupled contaminant transport, and coupled heat transfer in saturated soils.\n\nConsolidation occurs when soil undergoes volume change in response to material self-weight or changes applied stress conditions. The processes for unsaturated soils are similar to those for saturated soils and include time-dependent fluid flow and increasing soil stiffness with compression. The difference is that, in this case, the pore fluid contains both water and air, and thus relevant mechanisms include coupled air and water flows, changing soil saturation and suction, air compressibility, air dissolution, water vapor, and mechanical and hydrological hysteresis.  As a result, the complexity of the unsaturated soil consolidation process goes far beyond the corresponding process for saturated soils.  When large vertical strains are taken into account, as in the current study, where material properties (e.g., hydraulic conductivity, soil-water characteristic curve) change with porosity, the results are interesting and sometimes unexpected.  The research has intrinsic scientific merit in terms of fundamental assessment of new mechanisms and associated parameters as well as practical assessment of the implications for engineering design.  The work has relevancy for various applications, such as foundations on unsaturated soils, surcharge loads on gassy sediments, consolidation of landfill compacted clay liners, primary compression of landfill solid waste, cyclic wetting/drying behavior of landslide-prone soils, seismic compression of compacted fills, and dewatering of sludges, tailings, and other partially saturated geo-materials.\n\nMajor success was acheived on the development of new analytical solutions and numerical models for soil volume change behavior and consolidation, both for unsaturated and saturated conditions.  Validation exercises were conducted to the maximum possible extent using available analytical, numerical, and experimental results.  The models were then used to simulate conditions for several types of engineering systems.  The results demonstrate that consolidation leads to unusual soil behaviors, especially when considering unsaturated conditions, coupled solute transport, and coupled heat transfer.  The effects of consolidation can be important not only during the consolidation stage but also long after because transient fluid flows change the distribution of fluid mass, air, solute, temperature, etc., in a given system, which then becomes the initial condition for subsequent processes.\n\nBroader impacts of this work included the training of three Ph.D. students and collaborations with our partner institution and researchers at several other institutions.  Project researchers and collaborators include representation both nationally (Pennsylvania, California, Colorado) and internationally (China, Australia).  Technical results of the research have been disseminated to the scientific and professional engineering communities through refereed articles and conference presentations.  A total of 20 journal papers, 4 conference papers, and 3 PhD dissertations are in various stages of publication for the project.  The work is still ongoing and significant additional progress, and research products, are expected.  \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/30/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Patrick J Fox"
