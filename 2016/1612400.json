The curriculum and the teach pedagogies in this informal learning program have documented success of supporting youths' mathematics learning as well as raising achievement levels in school. Through rigorous research and evaluation, this project seeks to analyze and understand the nature, extent, and reasons for Math Corps' success with youth learning in Detroit as well as the processes of program replication in three sites: Cleveland, OH; Utica, NY; and Philadelphia, PA. As such, this project will deepen understandings of program replication and of addressing the needs of youth in economically-challenged communities in order to promote mathematics learning.\r\n\r\nThe project's research studies will assess the multiple factors that make Math Corps successful  with youth in Detroit and document the implementation of the program to the three replication sites. Research methods include discourse analyses, surveys, interviews, and pre/post-tests. The project will also conduct a retrospective evaluation of Math Corps based on quantitative datasets regarding both near-term and long-term youth outcomes.\r\n\r\nThis projects is funded by the Advancing Informal STEM Learning program, which seeks to advance new approaches to, and evidence-based understandings of, the design and development of STEM learning in informal environments.",

Its perspective can be seen through its 101 rules for the staff: \"Believe in kids.\", \"Empower kids.\", \"Learn from kids.\", \"Laugh with kids.\", \"Lead kids.\", \"Be vulnerable with kids.\" . . . The kids have three rules: \"Be yourself.\", \"Always strive to find your greatness.\", and \"Be safe.\" Academically, for close to thirty years, students have consistently shown dramatic gains in mathematical achievement, with pre-test averages of 30% increasing to post-test averages of 90% in six weeks.
