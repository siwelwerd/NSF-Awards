 "awd_abstract_narration": "The prefrontal cortex of the brain controls how people remember sizes of things, such as a number of items or the pitch of a sound, within a short time frame of about a few seconds. This ability, called parametric working memory (PWM), helps people to interpret their world, make decisions, and act or behave. Dysfunction in PWM may be involved in many brain diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and bipolar disorders. These diseases affect more than 200 million people worldwide. Through this research project, researchers will learn more about how the prefrontal cortex controls PWM in healthy and diseased brains. With this new information, they may be able to create new treatments for many people suffering from brain diseases.\r\n\r\nPWM relies on the persistent activity of neurons in the prefrontal cortex. This persistent activity is graded such that the firing rate of neurons correlates with the quantity of things to be remembered, which can emerge from network interactions with the local microcircuitry. Yet, to robustly display graded persistent activity, these networks must incorporate neurons with bistability, such that stable quiescence and activity coexist in their range of input. Neurons in the prefrontal cortex can display bistability that depends on non-selective cationic (CAN) currents activated by calcium. However, cellular bistability in the prefrontal cortex occurs under very specific experimental conditions of stimulation and neuromodulation. The researchers' overall goal is to determine whether CAN-mediated conditional bistability in the prefrontal cortex is a genuine physiological property of neurons and whether it supports graded persistent activities within local recurrent networks. They will develop a multidisciplinary research program of computational and experimental analysis to study properties ranging from molecular interactions to the behavior of neural networks. With theoretical modeling at the molecular, cellular, and network levels, extensive numerical simulations, intracellular recordings, and optogenetics, the researchers will identify and control neural substrates that mediate PWM. In this way, they will learn the causal mechanisms and dynamic principles of PWM in the prefrontal cortex, including the multi-stability that characterizes its graded persistent activity. These efforts will help researchers to better understand higher cognitive and behavioral functions and pathologies related to PWM, and also advance theories of fundamental properties in neuroscience. A companion project is being funded by the French National Research Agency (ANR).",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nProject Outcomes\n\nParametric working memory is the essential ability of the brain to remember quantities when making very fast decisions (on the scale of a few seconds). In parametric working memory tasks, the firing frequency of neurons in the prefrontal cortex scales with the amplitude of the information to be remembered. This neuronal behavior is called \"graded persistent activity.\" Thus, graded persistent activity is the neural correlate of parametric working memory. How neurons generate such graded persistent activity remains unknown.\n\nHere, we combined expertise in computational and experimental neuroscience from the Paz and Delord labs to identify the neural substrates that mediate graded persistent activity in the prefrontal cortex.\n\nNeural network modeling indicated that graded persistent activity relies on the existence of \"bistable\" neurons (Koulakov et al., Nature Neuroscience 2002), in which stable resting potential and stable firing coexist (Rodriguez et al., The Journal of Neuroscience 2018). Next, we designed an experimental protocol to detect bistable neurons and to collect information on their properties. We then studied the bistability of more than 500 neurons by using whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiological recordings in brain slices from adult rats. We found that a subset of prefrontal cortical neurons exhibit \u2018conditional\u2019 bistability, meaning that the same neurons can show persistent activity in certain contexts. This form of bistability could potentially allow neurons to store and retrieve quantitative information. Furthermore, we found that the neuromodulator acetylcholine, but not serotonin or dopamine, boosts conditional bistability by regulating the balance between afterdepolarization calcium-activated cationic non-selective (CAN) currents and afterhyperpolarization currents.\n\nThis discovery forms the basis of our future work that will focus on examining the role of acetylcholine, CAN and AHP channels in the prefrontal cortex in disorders associated with abnormal parametric working memory.\n\nIntellectual Merit: Parametric working memory has profound implications for higher-level cognitive functions including perception, action, decision-making, behavioral control and verbal or nonverbal forms of cognition.  Thus, understanding the cellular mechanisms and dynamical principles underlying this form of working memory in the prefrontal cortex will benefit research on higher cognitive and behavioral functions related to working memory.  \n\nBroader Impacts: This work has an important impact on public health.  Working memory in the prefrontal cortex is affected in numerous neurological and psychiatric disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, bipolar disorders, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and epilepsy, which affect more than 200 million people worldwide.  Deciphering the principles, dynamics and mechanisms underlying working memory could lead to innovative and efficient applied therapeutic approaches to improve the lives of millions of individuals and society at large.  \n\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion: Diversity fuels discovery.  The multidisciplinary character of the project provided an excellent opportunity for undergraduate and graduate students and postdoctoral fellows to gain experience in international and interdisciplinary approaches critical for modern neuroscience research in a highly collaborative inclusive setting. \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/05/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jeanne Paz"
