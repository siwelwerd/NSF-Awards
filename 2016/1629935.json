 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project upgrades the Cognitive Radio Network Testbed (CORNET) at Virginia Tech (VT) by adding new processing, networking and radio frequency (RF) hardware and software and redesigning the testbed architecture to enable cutting edge research across many engineering and science disciplines. CORNET currently comprises 48 software programmable radio nodes that have facilitated experimental research and education in wireless communications for seven years. The upgrade will add the necessary radio and computing infrastructure to support compelling CISE research and experimentation in emerging and new technological/regulatory/economic areas in communications, computing and transportation, among others, through collaborations with computer science, electrical and computer engineering and aerospace and ocean engineering researchers at Virginia Tech. The new CORNET testbed enables advancing research in radio frequency (RF) spectrum access, resource virtualization for effective on demand service provisioning through sharing, and federation of distributed resources (RF spectrum, radio nodes, computing nodes, testbeds) with applications to coexistence of government commercial\r\ncommunications systems and radars, autonomous vehicles, fifth generation (5G) cellular communications, Internet of Things, and many others. The proposed upgrades are needed to enable CORNET to continue to serve cross department and interdisciplinary research needs at Virginia Tech. The testbed allows a diverse student and faculty population to learn, cooperate and innovate in science and technology across several disciplines. The educational activities include extending undergraduate and graduate classes at Virginia Tech with experimental hands on sessions that leverage the new testbed capabilities.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe project focuses on three core thrusts: (a) Hardware upgrade, (b) Network/resource management upgrade (virtualization, computing clusters, better scheduling), (c) User software upgrade (preconfigured experiments & tutorials). The hardware upgrade adds 30 wide-band Ettus Research USRP X310 software defined radio (SDR) front ends (X310s) with 60 wide-band daughter boards and multiple antennas. A high performance computing cluster consisting of 30 multi-core servers to form a nontraditional shared baseband processing center. The distributed RF front ends are connected to the central computing cluster through a dedicated 10 Gbps Ethernet network that allows flexible association. Proposed software upgrades allow resource virtualization for efficient radio, computing and network resource sharing and better support for user and experiment management. One of the four indoor testbed floors will be equipped with 12 pairs of X310s that can be configured for MIMO operation or use as transceiver and monitor. Additional X310 pairs will be installed, one pair on each of the remaining three floors, and current hardware redeployed to support as many concurrent users and use case scenarios as possible. The configuration enables experimental investigation of spatial multiplexing, diversity, beam forming, and direction-finding techniques and related communication protocols. The monitoring configuration facilitates spectrum sharing research and education by providing real-time and identifiable spectra for each transmitter to be analyzed, logged, or displayed as needed to enable an experiment, tutorial, or contest. Basic tutorials will be developed to enable effective access and use of the testbed by a broad population of researchers and students at Virginia Tech.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project supported enhancements to the cognitive radio network testbed (CORNET), a remotely-accessible wireless communications testbed.  The enhanced testbed will help researchers develop, evaluate, and refine 5G wireless applications and enhancements to 5G wireless systems, as well as new technologies for use in future generations of wireless systems.\n\nNew software-defined radio transceiver devices were purchased that can transmit, receive, and digitize chunks of the radio frequency spectrum up to 6 GHz in frequency, with bandwidths as wide as 100-120 MHz.  These radio devices support experiments that use new and future wireless technologies, many of which are expected to use a large range of radio frequencies at a time. \n\nThe new radio devices each contain two or four radios.  This allows experiments that use multiple antennas, as will be typical in 5G and future wireless systems.  Using multiple antennas allows radios to focus their transmitted signals in a specific direction, listen more effectively for signals from other radios, reject unwanted signals or interference, and/or increase data rates to provide better service for applications such as high-definition and three-dimensional video, virtual and augmented reality, communication with airborne drones or ground vehicles, and other current and future applications. \n\nVirginia Tech now has 30 of these high-performance radios that can be used in the testbed.  For cost-effectiveness, 24 additional, lower-cost radios were purchased that will support experiments that will be used to teach wireless communication concepts, so that the higher-performance radio devices will be more available for use in research.\n\nSo far, the enhanced tested has been used for several efforts including:\n\nTest and determine requirements for an initial open radio access network (O-RAN) implementation using open source software that will support multiple research projects related to 5G and future wireless communication systems and applications.\nProvide students with access using a standard web browser, so that the students can use the testbed and its radio devices for research, instructional laboratory exercises and experiments, and class projects.\nSupport development, testing, and hosting of remote laboratory exercises related to wireless communications and radio frequency spectrum sharing.  Potentially, these types of exercises can be used for self-paced, online learning by several hundred students per year, including engineering, computer science, and other students, as well as professionals who are taking continuing education courses.  College and pre-college instructors can also use the exercises to provide in-class demonstrations to students.  The exercises also demonstrate the testbed\u2019s capability to support scripted experiments as well as cooperative and competitive educational activities.\nPerform fast computations to enable research on machine learning applications in future wireless communication systems.\n\n\nAs a result of the project, many students have gained knowledge and/or hands-on experience with wireless communication systems and concepts, through research and demonstrations that used the testbed.  several students have also gained experience with system administration, installation and configuration of \"virtual machines\" to support experiments.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/28/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Carl B Dietrich"
