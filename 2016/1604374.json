Most of this waste is disposed of in lagoons or stored outdoors to decompose, leading to numerous environmental issues such as greenhouse gas (methane and nitrous oxide) and ammonia emissions, eutrophication of surface waters resulting from phosphorus runoff, and human exposure to pathogenic bacteria. Biogas production from livestock waste provides a promising alternative to address these issues while providing a wide range of valuable byproducts such as electricity, bedding, and organic fertilizer. The EPA's AgSTAR program reports that about 8,000 U.S. farms could support biogas systems, providing about 1,600 MW of electricity (enough to power one million homes) and reducing methane emissions by 1.8 million metric tons (equivalent to taking 6.5 million cars off the road). Despite this potential, the development of biogas systems has been limited by high technology costs, competing prices for natural gas obtained from non-renewable sources, and limited government policies and incentives.  This project aims to develop optimization models and the necessary solution approaches as a multi-stakeholder decision making tool for developing biogas production systems from livestock waste. The proposed work is cross-disciplinary, combining ideas from multi-objective and stochastic optimization, social choice and economics, high-performance computing, and agricultural and energy systems.\r\n\r\nA key scientific objective of the proposed project is the development of computationally efficient solution strategies for multi-stakeholder, multi-objective optimization problems. The proposed project will pioneer the incorporation of credible social objective metrics into optimization models. The PIs propose new metrics for incorporating the impact of decisions on multiple stakeholders into the model. The models developed will capture a wider range of technologies and configurations not considered before. In particular, the PIs will model interactions between waste transport, storage, and processing systems, feedstocks and nutrient management systems, biogas and electricity production and delivery systems, and district utility systems. The ability to couple these systems will provide new opportunities to achieve economic viability and to evaluate environmental and social impacts. The developed frameworks will identify socially-optimal compromise solutions that factor in the priorities of multiple stakeholders (urban/rural communities, environmental groups, farmers, technology providers, and local/regional governments). This will be achieved by using statistical metrics, such as the conditional value at risk and the generalized entropy index. The use of these metrics will enable policy makers to assess the impact of their decisions on stakeholder satisfaction. The project team has access to real data sets and a group of stakeholders for formulating realistic case studies that may have immediate impact on the decision-making processes of the involved stakeholders.  The PIs plan to train a PhD student and develop new teaching materials for undergraduate and graduate courses. They also propose outreach activities to increase public awareness on the effects of methane emissions from animal farms and recruit students from underrepresented minorities into STEM fields.",

Most of this waste is disposed of in lagoons or stored outdoors to decompose, leading to greenhouse gas emissions (methane and nitrous oxide) and nutrient emissions (phosphorus and nitrogen) that create widespread air and water pollution. Biogas recovery from livestock waste provides a promising alternative to address these issues while providing a wide range of valuable byproducts such as electricity, bedding, and nutrient-rich fertilizers.

The models developed capture complex interactions between stakeholders involved in waste management infrastructures (farmers that supply waste, transportation and technology providers, consumers of waste-derived products). This is done by thinking about the waste management problem as a coordinated market system, similar in spirit to coordinated markets used to manage the electrical power infrastructure. Thinking about this problem in this way has opened new perspectives on how to ensure economic viability of waste management infrastructures that enable widespread environmental benefits. Moreover, this provides a scalable approach that identifies socially-optimal compromise solutions that factor in the priorities of myriad stakeholders affected by the infrastructure (urban/rural communities, environmental groups, farmers, technology providers, and local/regional governments). For instance, in our framework, lakes can participate as stakeholders in the market (represented by government agencies) and charge the market for any impact incurred from waste or derived products. The models developed under this project have been used to conduct extensive case studies in Wisconsin. We have found that the simultaneous recovery of liquified biomethane and of organic fertilizer (nutrient-rich) offers the most viable strategy to process waste and to simultaneously mitigate air and water pollution over wide geographical regions. This synergy arises from non-obvious coupling between carbon and nutrients in the waste streams. We have also found that policy incentives (e.g., in the form of carbon and nutrient credits or taxes) can activate a waste management economy that recovers valuable products and achieves widespread reductions of air and water pollution.&nbsp; Specifically, we have conducted detailed studies that show that a phosphorus release charge promotes widespread adoption of nutrient recovery technologies (e.g., in the form of nutrient pellets or struvite). Our work has also developed new and intuitive ways to measure fairness, which is necessary in determining solutions that properly remunerate all stakeholders that participate in a waste infrastructure (e.g., small and large farms and small and large lakes).&nbsp;&nbsp;Our fairness measures provide new capabilities to resolve conflicts in large populations of stakeholders and integrate concepts of economic theory and statistics.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This project has been conducted in collaboration with agricultural, environmental, and chemical engineers and with the US Environmental Protection Agency. The interdisciplinary nature of this project has offered a rich environment to train new students that have the ability of combining optimization and economic/environmental policy to solve pressing societal problems. The models and concepts developed in this project are widely applicable to other waste infrastructures such as municipal waste management (plastic, food, steel, and glass). The project has collected extensive databases on different waste processing technologies and has constructed models in cutting-edge software that have been widely disseminated. We have also presented our results to diverse audiences that include academics, industry, and high-school teachers. Our main goal here has been to disseminate how systems-thinking can offer new perspectives that can help solve the waste management problem.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 07/03/2020<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Victor&nbsp;Zavala Tejeda</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1604374/1604374_10447562_1593784748715_ScreenShot2020-07-03at8.56.39AM--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1604374/1604374_10447562_1593784748715_ScreenShot2020-07-03at8.56.39AM--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Multi-product supply chain modeling\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1604374/1604374_10447562_1593784748715_ScreenShot2020-07-03at8.56.39AM--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Multi-product supply chain modeling\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Modeling framework for multi-product supply chains.
