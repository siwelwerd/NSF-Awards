 "awd_abstract_narration": "The connection between the quantum world controlled by microscopic forces and the macroscopic world that dominates our everyday lives is not well understood. Macroscopic systems exhibit universal behavior that cannot depend sensitively on microscopic details, but is believed to be subject to powerful and general principles of organization. Universal behavior is seen in a variety of systems of interest across many branches of physics including the quark-gluon plasma of the early universe, high temperature superconductivity and ultracold Fermi gases in the laboratory. In this project, the P.I. will investigate the emergence of these powerful forces that give rise to the collective behavior of macroscopic systems. The plan is to perform a systematic study of properties as a function of system size, focusing on an intermediate regime called the mesoscopic region where quantum mechanics and classical mechanics merge. Both undergraduate and graduate students will participate fully in this research, including communicating the results through papers and talks.\r\n\r\nThe scientific goal of this study is to elucidate the driving forces behind this emerging universal behavior and to propose new ways to observe and control this behavior in the laboratory.  In the last decade, the atomic physics community has taken advantage of cooling and trapping techniques to create and control finite-size systems of ultracold gases that exhibit universal properties. This work will focus on Fermi gases and utilize a perturbation method that yields exact first-order results for all system sizes simultaneously. By studying trends as a function of system size for properties such as excitation frequencies and thermodynamic quantities recently measured in the laboratory, the goal is to uncover signatures of emerging collective behavior in order to understand the dynamics of this fundamental transition.",

The particles in a normal mode move in a synchronized way with the same frequency and phase, allowing a description of the complex, simultaneous motions of many interacting particles in terms of collective behavior.  This approach thus incorporates the many-body effects of large ensembles into simple dynamic motions.  These synchronized motions are exciting since, in principle, they can be harnessed to create devices that are exquisitely controllable on a macroscopic scale, including perhaps high temperature superconductors that could revolutionize electrical engineering applications.  Understanding the emergence and sustainability of collective behavior has been an important goal for decades in multiple fields of physics including condensed matter, nuclear, cosmology, and atomic physics. \n\n    Under this grant, I studied the properties of ultracold gases of atomic fermions with collective superfluid behavior along the transition from a weakly interacting BCS regime to a strongly interacting unitary regime.  Although such systems are typically described using two-body pairs, the so called Cooper pairs, my research suggests that normal modes can be used to provide a simple, coherent macroscopic description without the need for two-body pairing mechanisms.  In the strongly interacting unitary regime which has been intensely studied over the last two decades, I obtained excellent agreement with both experimental data and theoretical results and discovered two phenomena that could sustain the emergence and stability of superfluid behavior.  A subsequent study confirmed these results for a range of interparticle interaction strengths and revealed two distinct dynamical effects that could be responsible for the emergence of collective behavior in these regimes. These normal mode dynamics offer an interesting new alternative to the models relying on two-body pairing mechanisms to achieve superfluidity, completely re-imagining our microscopic understanding of superfluid behavior in ultracold Fermi gases.
