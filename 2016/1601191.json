 "awd_abstract_narration": "Most flowering plants and many of the world's food crops depend on animal pollinators to reproduce. Recent changes in climate may disrupt these ecologically and economically important relationships. Warm springs and early snowmelt associated with climate change alter when plants flower and pollinators emerge in the spring, which may make pollinators unavailable to plants that flower too soon or too late. In addition, decreased snow cover and early snowmelt likely reduce soil moisture during the growing season on mountain slopes. Such drought conditions may decrease the number of flowers, their size or the amount of nectar they contain, which may make them less attractive to pollinators. This research tests effects of soil moisture and timing of flower and pollinator emergence on pollination. The expectation is that drought will greatly decrease pollination through both changes in flowering time and attractiveness. This work will help reveal how the relationship between plants and pollinators responds to climate change, and will improve the ability of land-managers and policy-makers to plan conservation efforts. This project also includes opportunities to engage undergraduate students and public school teachers in field research, as well as providing gateway experiences for children into science through two K-12 outreach programs.\r\n\r\nThis project tests the hypothesis that differences in flowering time interact with water availability to affect the composition and number of pollinator visits. Using field-tested methods, researchers will manipulate flowering time and soil moisture in a factorial experiment with the sub-alpine wildflower Mertensia ciliata. They will measure the impact on pollination and seed set via shifts in the composition and number of pollinator visits, and will determine how those effects may be mediated by changes in floral traits. Experimental results will be integrated with on-going observational studies of individual, population, and community-level responses to natural variation in soil moisture and flowering phenology. Similar field experiments testing the impacts of abiotic and biotic shifts on plant-pollinator interactions are rare. Yet, such experimental approaches can offer vital insights into the mechanisms that determine how pollination systems respond to climate change.  All analyzed data under this award will be disseminated at professional conferences, published in peer-reviewed journals, and made publically available.",

Recent changes in climate may disrupt these ecologically and economically important relationships. Warm springs and early snowmelt associated with climate change alter the timing of plant flowering and pollinator emergence, which may disrupt the temporal overlap between plants and their pollinators. In addition, decreased snow cover and early snowmelt can reduce soil moisture during the growing season. Such drought conditions may decrease floral abundance, flower size, or nectar, which in turn may impact attraction of pollinators. This research tested the effects of these two factors (temporal overlap and soil moisture) in combination. The hypothesis was that decreased pollination due to a change in flowering time can be made worse, or alternatively mitigated, by drought-induced changes in floral attractants. The researchers tested this hypothesis by manipulating flowering time in four categories and soil moisture in three categories in all possible combinations, using the sub-alpine wildflower <em>Mertensia ciliata. </em>Both water availability and flowering time influenced the rate of flower visitation by insect pollinators and the number of seeds made by a plant, but the two effects were additive. Whereas changing water had little effect on the types of pollinators early in the season, drought conditions caused a switch away from all bumblebees to some visits by solitary bees and flies late in the season.&nbsp; The switch to smaller insects partly mitigated the overall decline in pollinator visitation over the season. That kind of interaction in effects of water and flowering time may be more likely for plant species that have a wide variety of potential pollinators. Overall, flowering time had a greater effect on pollinator visitation than did water availability. In contrast, water availability had a stronger effect on number of seeds, a measure of reproductive success.&nbsp; This study illustrates the necessity of examining effects of resources, along with effects of seasonal timing, to understand how plant-pollinator interactions respond to climate . Broader impacts of the project included involving students of all ages and backgrounds in exploring science, through hands-on training in field ecology for undergraduates, graduate students, and a K-12 educator, as well as two public outreach programs for K-12 students.</p>\n<p class=\"Normal2\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"Normal2\"><em>&nbsp;</em></p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 06/12/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Diane&nbsp;R&nbsp;Campbell</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImage\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation onePhoto\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1601191/1601191_10413783_1497283834986_Mertensia--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1601191/1601191_10413783_1497283834986_Mertensia--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Mertensia ciliata\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1601191/1601191_10413783_1497283834986_Mertensia--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Mertensia ciliata\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Flowers of the subalpine plant Mertensia ciliata</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">MK Gallagher</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Diane&nbsp;R&nbsp;Campbell</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Mertensia ciliata</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
