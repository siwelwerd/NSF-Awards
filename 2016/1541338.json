 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project leads to a significant expansion and upgrade of the Virginia Tech campus network by extending high-data rate 10-gigabit per second connections and Science DMZ connectivity to strategic locations on campus. The new network connections enable the incorporation of Big Data concepts in classes; support funded research requiring the transfer of large data sets; and reduce barriers for independent, curiosity-driven research. The network accelerates discovery for researchers in several departments and multidisciplinary areas. Data kiosks in the Newman Library and Torgersen Hall provide high data rate connectivity for other researchers. The network is tightly integrated with local high-performance computing and storage systems and national cyberinfrastructure, enabling large-scale collaborative research and sharing of computational and data resources.\r\n\r\nThe expansion of the university's network to create a campus research network provides multiple 10-gigabit per second ports in classrooms and laboratories in eight buildings across the Virginia Tech campus in Blacksburg. The expansion is accomplished by deploying 48-port 10-gigabit per second Ethernet switches. Each of these switches has a 10- or 40-gigabit per second uplink. The core aggregation router connects to the campus 100-gigabit per second backbone network with multiple links for redundancy. The network provides at least a ten-fold increase in end-to-end network connectivity, making sustained high data rate connections ubiquitous between local and national computational and data resources, research laboratories, instruments, and selected classrooms.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe growth of data-intensive research requiring the transfer of very large amounts of data and/or the low-latency transfer of data motivates and demands new network and other cyberinfrastructure.  The project \"CC*DNI Networking Infrastructure: A Campus Research Network and Distributed Science DMZ\" addressed the need for significantly improved research cyberinfrastructure (CI) at Virginia Tech. This improvement was necessary to keep pace with and contribute to national cyberinfrastructure and to support data-intensive research and education in multiple science, engineering, and other disciplines.  The resulting significant expansion and upgrade of the Virginia Tech campus network extended the benefits of \"fat pipe\" and Science DMZ connectivity to strategic locations on and near Virginia Tech's campus in Blacksburg, Virginia.  This new dedicated network, called the Virginia Tech Research Network, or VT-Rnet, provides direct connections to shared high-performance computing systems and to the ASCED Science DMZ and, subsequently, Internet2.  VT-Rnet has transformed the scope and scale of data-intensive research that is feasible at Virginia Tech and with collaborators.  Prior to VT-Rnet, research connections were typically limited to 1-gigabit per second (Gbps) data rates and traversed 10-Gbps links shared with other connections.\n\nIntellectual Merit:  This project expanded the university's network to create a campus research network, VT-Rnet, that provides 10-Gbps ports for data-intensive research and education applications to 25 different locations in 13 different buildings across and near Virginia Tech's Blacksburg campus.  Traffic from these ports traverses 40-Gbps uplinks from access routers to the existing 100-Gbps campus backbone network.  Five additional connections for VT-Rnet were deployed and are in operation at the University Data Center to support research data connectivity.  VT-Rnet port locations were selected based on an open request process that considered concentrations of research and educational needs for large-scale and/or low-latency data connectivity.  Open ports will continue to be allocated to new research needs in the 13 connected buildings.  A particular challenge was providing 10-Gbps service to the Virginia Tech Transportation Institute (VTTI), which is located off campus.  A cost-effective collaborative fiber build created a new fiber path to VTTI that now provides 10-Gbps connectivity to the VTTI data center to support their data-intensive research.\n\nVT-Rnet provides significantly faster data transfers compared to the \"normal\" Virginia Tech network.  Independent testing demonstrated a 13.6- to 40-times speed up when accessing on-campus high-performance computing resources from an on-campus research laboratory and a 7.5-times speed up when accessing an external data source (National Center for Biotechnology Information) from the same research laboratory.\n\nVT-Rnet has accomplished its three key goals: (i) VT-Rnet has enabled students in multiple graduate and advanced undergraduate classes to efficiently complete large-scale data transfers for analysis and other projects; (ii) VT-Rnet has supported National Science Foundation and other federal agency-funded research projects across the university; and (iii) VT-Rnet has greatly reduced data-related barriers for independent, curiosity-driven research which often seeds funded research programs.  VT-Rnet has supported and continues to support research and education in multiple fields in multiple institutes and departments including:  naturalistic driving studies (VTTI); interactive arts and virtual environments (Institute for Creativity, Arts, and Technology); biocomplexity and genomics (now the Fralin Life Sciences Institute and previously the Biocomplexity Institute); digital libraries (Computer Science), genetics (Crop and Soil Environmental Science); medical imaging (Biomedical Engineering and Mechanics); wireless communications and software-defined radios (Electrical and Computer Engineering); computation for molecular science and (NSF-funded Molecular Sciences Software Institute); advanced visualization (Mechanical Engineering, Biochemistry), and fluid mechanics (Mechanical Engineering).  Other groups at Virginia Tech can also benefit from this project and VT-Rnet through a dedicated \"data kiosk\" in the Torgersen Hall and through data archiving services offered by the University Libraries.\n\nBroader Impacts:  VT-Rnet has positively affected the education and research training of many graduate and undergraduate students. VT-Rnet has accelerated work on many projects funded by the NSF other federal agencies.  VT-Rnet has also enabled large-scale data sharing for multi-institutional collaborative research.  Also, VT-Rnet has provided several graduate students and network support and engineering staff members with the opportunity to learn more about the design and operation of high-data rate network infrastructure.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/31/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Scott F Midkiff"
