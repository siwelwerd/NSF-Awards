 "awd_abstract_narration": "Part 1: Non-technical abstract: \r\n\r\nPotato is one of the top four staple crops in the world and the basis of a more than 4-billion-dollar industry in the U.S. Up to 33% of U.S. potato yield is lost due to post-harvest issues each year. The proper ?healing? or ?curing? of potatoes to fortify their protective skin with the natural polymer suberin is critical for the storage of potatoes. Potato tubers with non-cured bruise or wound areas are much more susceptible to disease development and water loss. The long-term storage of potatoes allows consumers to be supplied with fresh potatoes and potato products (chips, French fries, etc.) year round. By analyzing the regulation of the synthesis and deposition of suberin, this project will provide insight on the fundamental processes underlying the potato skin healing or curing process. This will enable the reduction of post-harvest yield losses and the development of tools and germplasm for breeding efforts aimed at improving tuber storability. Even a marginal reduction in post-harvest storage losses would significantly improve economic return for potato producers and distributors. The project includes as outreach the development of public resources for the scientific and academic (Grades 9-12) communities, and the training of students from underrepresented groups.\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 2: Technical abstract: \r\n\r\nSuberin is produced In higher plants during normal development and in response to stresses like wounding. Despite its nearly ubiquitous presence, the regulation of suberin deposition remains enigmatic, yet its better understanding has positive agricultural implications. For example, an improvement in the proper deposition of wound suberin, which is critical for long-term storage of potatoes (Solanum tuberosum), would result in a significant reduction in crop loss during storage. The overall objective of this research is to decipher the transcriptional networks that regulate suberin biosynthesis, to enable the development of potato lines with improved wounding and storability. The transcription factor AtMYB41, identified by PI Kosma, and additional factors acting on suberin biosynthesis will be used as a springboard to define the transcriptional networks that regulate suberin deposition, with an emphasis on wound suberization. In parallel, the molecular basis of potato wound suberin production will be investigated using comparative transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses of potato cultivars that differ in suberization and storability. The end goal is to manipulate loci underlying differential wound suberin production by combining transcriptomics and SNP genotyping for targeted breeding approaches aimed at improving tuber storability. The project includes public resources and outreach activities for students from underserved groups.",
