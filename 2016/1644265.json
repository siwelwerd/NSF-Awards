 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Enhancing Success in Transfer Education for Engineering Majors (ESTEEM) project will support and enhance degree completion by academically-talented, low-income students in Engineering at four California Community Colleges and a major public research university, all of which are Hispanic-Serving Institutions. Promising students enrolled at Alan Hancock College, Oxnard College, Santa Barbara City College, Ventura College and the University of California, Santa Barbara, will participate in an integrated program of academic tutoring, career advising, professional network-building, and scholarships designed to provide sustained support for transfer students before, during, and after the transition from community college to a four-year university. ESTEEM research will explore the major barriers to successful transfer, and the effectiveness of strategies targeted at helping aspiring Engineering students to overcome them. Faculty from each of the five institutions will engage in significant collaboration to ensure that appropriate courses are shared between sites, and to strengthen student transfer applications. ESTEEM will serve as an important new model for expanding access to and increasing diversity in California's higher education system.\r\n\r\nThe goals of the ESTEEM project are to enhance the competitiveness of California Community College students in their transfer applications to four-year Engineering B.S. programs, to improve transfer students' preparation to undertake advanced engineering coursework, and to accelerate the adjustment of transfer students to a University academic environment. The scope of the project includes coordination of transfer pathways through inter-institutional collaboration, informed by an education research study of curricular and co-curricular interventions that promote transfer success via an overlapping cohort-sequential design. In collaboration with community college faculty, Engineering faculty at the University of California, Santa Barbara will pilot the offering of gateway courses to community college students. ESTEEM Scholars at the community colleges will develop personalized education plans with faculty mentors to plan their transfer to a 4-year Engineering B.S. program. ESTEEM Scholars who transfer to the College of Engineering at the University of California, Santa Barbara, will receive continued scholarship support and faculty mentoring to ensure their successful graduation. An educational impact study using an overlapping cohort-sequential design will examine the impact of each type of enhanced curricular and co-curricular undergraduate experience on transfer completion and post-transfer adjustment, perceived likelihood of success, and articulation of goals.",

The UC Santa Barbara students were all engineering majors (mechanical, chemical, electrical, computer engineering and computer science), while the community college students were students interested in transferring to a 4-year program in engineering. The principal criteria for selection of ESTEEM Scholars were academic potential and high financial need (i.e., not currently being met by other forms of financial aid or merit-based scholarships) in students whose goal was to become an engineer. The project provided substantial scholarships to these students with the aim of reducing their need to work during their studies, and thereby promote better academic outcomes. In addition, students were provided with academic support (personalized tutoring and faculty academic counseling), career planning (including graduate school and non-academic job seeking skills), dedicated and semi-private study/collaboration space, as well as networking with engineering professionals and access to internship opportunities. At UC Santa Barbara, 113 total Scholars were supported, of whom 104 have already been awarded a BS in an engineering field to-date. In this group, 69 are now employed in jobs that require or make use of their engineering degree, while 35 are pursuing further education (MS or PhD) in the area of their BS degree or a related area. For the community college ESTEEM Scholars, 148 successfully transferred to a 4-year institution, with 133 of these transferring to an engineering program (the remainder chose a science or math program). Among these students, 64 have already graduated, with a majority having jobs in the engineering field. Through continuous tracking and evaluation, the ESTEEM project aimed to understand barriers to persistence and particularly barriers to transfer for students with an interest in engineering. Without additional support, low-income engineering students, who often reflect additional intersecting minoritized identities and are more likely to be the first in their family to attend college, leave the field at higher rates than their peers. Students who are likely to persist in engineering reported supportive relationships with mentors, positive near peer role models, a strong sense of community, and an intention to complete their engineering major. Yet, accessing these support systems is often challenging for low-income students, who are more likely to work long hours and spend more time off campus and less likely to have adequate opportunities to interact with others in their major and see themselves in role models and as part of that community. Several barriers to transfer for community college students were identified, including concerns about the affordability of UC Santa Barbara, high GPA/admission requirements, anxiety about leaving one&rsquo;s social network for a new and unfamiliar academic environment, and a lack of coordinated support to navigate the application process. Unfortunately, the COVID-19 pandemic further disrupted the higher education plans and financial viability of both UC Santa Barbara engineering students and prospective engineering transfer students, especially those from low-income families. The S-STEM financial support was crucial for the academic achievement of many of these students, by lowering the need to work to support themselves and their extended families.
