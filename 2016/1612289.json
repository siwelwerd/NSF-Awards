The fellowship supports a research and training plan for the Fellow that will increase the participation of groups underrepresented in biology.  The title of the research plan for this fellowship to Tara Mastro is \"Reorganization of postsynaptic signaling complexes by dynamic competition for protein binding domains.\" The host institution for this fellowship is California Institute of Technology, and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Mary B. Kennedy.  \r\n\r\nThis research advances our understanding of how new neural circuits that underlie learning and memory are established in the brain. Specifically, the Fellow is quantitatively describing newly discovered competitive protein interactions that underlie learning and memory. This research is producing a detailed understanding of the systems that regulate synaptic transmission, and is advancing knowledge of brain function and dysfunction on a molecular and biochemical level. Furthermore, the research has implications for disease because recent approaches to treat several neurological disorders have drawn on what is currently known about the mechanisms of learning and memory and the process by which synapses are changed to form new circuits. \r\n\r\nThe Fellow is gaining expert knowledge in neuroscience, specifically in the molecular mechanisms that underlie learning and memory.  Specific training activities include mastering technical laboratory skills involving neuronal cell culture and biochemistry, and developing expertise in written and verbal scientific communication.  The Fellow is actively broadening the participation of under-represented groups in biology by forming support networks to aide in the retention of disabled people in the sciences, including individuals who have had a disability over their entire lifetime as well as those who have experienced onset disabilities. In addition, the Fellow is engaged in outreach to high school students from under-represented groups, thereby promoting the importance of diversity among individuals who are in the earliest stages of considering STEM careers.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n Background: Synaptic Plasticity in the brain is crucial for normal development and for learning and memory. Plasticity is mediated by processes termed long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD). Understanding the molecular mechanisms of synaptic plasticity are of great interest because derangement of synaptic plasticity contributes to neurological and psychological diseases. Research has shown the abundant PSD protein, synGAP has a central role in synaptic function and development, as well as in human cognitive disability. Thus synGAP is a target for pharmacological intervention in cognitive disability. It is estimated that 35% of all disease burden can be attributable to brain disorders.In humans synGAP heterozygous mutation or copy number variation has been associated with ~ 9% of non-syndromic intellectual disability (ID), often accompanied by an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and epilepsy.\n\n Results: The Kennedy lab has recently proposed a synGAP mediated \"slot\" model for the diffusional trapping of AMPARs during LTP. In this model the PDZ ligand of synGAP occupies a significant portion of the PDZ domains of PSD-95 (15-30%). Upon phosphorylation of synGAP by CaMKII, the affinity of synGAP for the PDZ domains of PSD-95 is reduced. The reduction in affinity of synGAP for all the PDZ domains of PSD-95 increases competitive binding from other PDZ ligand containing PSD proteins including TARPs.  This model predicts that when the amount of synGAP bound in the PSD is reduced either chronically by haploinsufficiency or acutely by CaMKII phosphorylation, there will consequently be an increase in the other PDZ ligand-containing proteins bound to PSD-95 in the PSD. This was shown to occur in a chronic model of synGAP depletion using synGAP haploinsufficient mice.  These findings have been reproduced in a larger biological set of mice and rats of two different developmental time windows (adolescents and adults).  Individual animals were analyzed allowing for comparisons of males and females. Surprisingly the males and females responded differently to the genetic perturbation. The synGAP heterozygote female mice and rats, but not males, showed a correlative increase in competing target proteins as synGAP was decreased. These results may indicate differences in the mechanisms of LTP between sexes.\n\n            Competition in the PSD for the PDZ domains of PSD-95 was also tested using an acute phosphorylation model.  In this model, the affinity of synGAP for the PDZ domains of PSD-95 was reduced by inducing phosphorylation of synGAP by CaMKII during LTP in primary cortical and hippocampal cultures from rats.  It was predicted that the amount of target proteins that compete for PDZ domain binding with synGAP would be increased in the LTP samples compared to basal samples.  This was observed to be true for TARPs in wild-type cultures.  However, this was not found to be true for synGAP heterozygous cultures.  This may mean that reducing synGAP by 50% in the heterozygous state alters competition dynamics such that reducing the affinity of synGAP further via phosphorylation has no additional impact because a limit has already been reached. Current work attempts to restore normal levels competition in the PSD by adding mutant synGAP back to the system that either lacks the PDZ ligand or GAP activity. The specific region of synGAP that is critical to competition can be determined. This level of analysis is useful for downstream drug targeting.\n\n            Preliminary work has been done to measure the equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) of the TARP-gamma 8 c-terminal tail for the PDZ123 domains of PSD-95 using recumbently expressed sections of the proteins and Biacore&trade; Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) technology.  Other targets will be measured in the future. Work has also been done to determine how phosphorylation of the TARP-gamma 8 c-terminal tail alters the KD. These KD measures will be combined with the in vivoresults to build a model of the complex multiple equilibria that exists in the PSD during basal conditions and during LTP.\n\n Border Impacts: Another goal of the work completed was to create and participate in programing that would broaden participation in STEM.  One specific goal was to create programing that would increase the participation and retention of persons with disabilities in science.  Feedback from focus meeting groups indicated that mentorship and co-mentorship may be a critical part of retention and participation of persons with disabilities in science.  A pilot \"PODs\" program was created for postdoctoral scholars.  Incoming and current postdocs are asked to complete a survey.  PODs of about four people are then created using the information from the survey. PODs can have several focuses that span leisure activities, disability, ethic origin, gender identity, etc.  This program has been running for ~ months and has a 6% participation rate for the postdoc population.  Professionals at the consultation and diversity center are collaborating on the project and participants are surveyed every six months. If successful, the program will expand to student populations.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/06/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Tara Mastro"
