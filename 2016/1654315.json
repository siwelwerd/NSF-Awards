 "awd_abstract_narration": "NSF's Revolutionizing Engineering Departments (RED) program aims to produce \"revolutionary\" changes, creating knowledge about the implementation of sustainable changes in engineering and computer science education. Through this conference, future principal investigators on RED grants will benefit from sharing knowledge, engaging in dialogue, and participating in an online format to allow transfer of information and ideas, and broadly communicating their experiences about the scope of NSF's RED program. This conference aims to instigate exchanges of revolutionary ideas, stimulate new directions that are well-aligned with the RED program description, and cultivate innovative potential in the production of RED grant proposals. The conference offers potential awardees a better understanding of how to scale their projects, aiming to produce the widest possible impact at universities across the country. The objective is that through the conference the pool of submissions proposed to NSF will be increased and the quality will be enhanced. As NSF prepares to enter its third year of RED proposals, an additional goal of this conference is to broaden awareness of what it means to be revolutionary in engineering and computer science. This conference provides an excellent opportunity to deconstruct static and rigid formulations of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education and to explore the radical possibilities for programmatic change. \r\n\r\nThe conference aims to instigate exchanges of revolutionary ideas, stimulate new directions that are well-aligned with the RED program description, and cultivate innovative potential in the production of RED grant proposals. The conference offers potential awardees a better understanding of how to scale their projects, aiming to produce the widest possible impact at universities across the country. The primary objective of this conference is to disseminate information to produce a greater yield of successful RED submissions by providing an online venue for prospective awardees. This conference will lead to three outcomes. Participants will 1) learn from panelists and share questions about understanding revolutionary change, 2) understand the importance of competently assembling a RED team with specific roles, and 3) critically consider the change model throughout the research process with the aim of producing sustainable and scalable outcomes. The impact of this conference will also broaden awareness of what it means to be revolutionary in engineering and computer science. This conference emerges from the pool of current RED projects engaged in creating institutional transformations in Engineering and Computer Science. The leadership teams from these RED projects are passionate and energized in helping others begin revolutions within their programs that can lead to widespread changes in engineering education. This conference provides an excellent opportunity to make a broader impact by sharing knowledge about current RED projects, offering mentorship to institutions interested in starting their own revolutions, and maximizing NSF's investment in the RED program.",
