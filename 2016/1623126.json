This project at the University of the Virgin Islands seeks to develop a growth mindset and creativity through specific evidence-based interventions. The project will be validated with a carefully designed educational research study which focuses on the novel use of growth mindset training. The project is guided and informed by an on-going evaluation.\r\n\r\nSpecific objectives of the project are to: increase by 15% the retention and persistence rates for those STEM students who struggle early in their college careers; increase by 10% overall persistence and graduation rates for STEM students; increase the self-efficacy of STEM students as measured by validated, reliable instruments;  establish a summer bridge program focused on mathematics for incoming freshmen; have summer and academic year research experiences; conduct mindset training in the freshman development seminar; and develop a sustained, comprehensive evidence-based faculty development program, which will give faculty the skills and tools necessary for the success of the overall model. This project will provide a validated replicable model that can be used by other open admissions or low selectivity universities and community colleges throughout the Nation.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOverview \n\nThe University of the Virgin Islands (UVI) HBCU-UP ACE implementation grant project was built on prior successes and sought to expand and validate UVI\u2019s model of student retention, persistence, and success in STEM, as well as testing evidence-based interventions. The UVI Growth Model project was created to promote students\u2019 growth mindset and creativity through specific evidence-based interventions. The UVI Growth Model is one part of a comprehensive approach toward student success in STEM. The model builds on the Tinto model for student retention (Tinto, 1993, 1997).\n\nUniversity data show that the students most vulnerable to attrition from or stopping out of their undergraduate STEM programs at the undergraduate level are those with GPAs below 2.5.  The University of the Virgin Islands developed and implemented innovative curricula and practices.  Developed for this project were (1) a Summer Boost program for students who have encountered early difficulties in transitioning to college, (2) a greatly expanded peer-led team learning (PLTL) approach in gatekeeper STEM courses (mathematics, computer science, chemistry, and biology), (3) a summer bridge program focused on mathematics for incoming first-year students, (4) summer and academic year research experiences, (5) mindset training in UVI\u2019s freshman development seminar, (6) a sustained, comprehensive, evidence-based faculty development program, which gave faculty the skills and tools necessary for the success of the overall model. A focus on developing a growth mindset and creativity through specific evidence-based interventions was a part of each activity.\n\n Intellectual Merit \n\nThe UVI Growth Model Included a longitudinal study that assessed the relationship between students\u2019 non-cognitive variables at the beginning and the end of program interventions.  The Summer Boost program included four aspects: Creative Problem Solving; Growth Mindset vs. Fixed Mindset curriculum; entrepreneurship and innovation.  The participants were students who had completed fewer than 60 (of 120) credits and had a GPA of 2.5 or below on a 4.0 scale. Student participants displayed a positive change (from pre-test to post-test) in their confidence in their ability to solve problems creatively (Stolz, Blackmon, Engerman, Tonge, &amp; McKayle, 2022).  They also displayed a statistically significant change in their view toward whether or not persons can change their intelligence.  There was a decrease in participants\u2019 agreement with the statement: \"your intelligence is something about you that you can\u2019t change very much\", and another similar statement. \n\nAnother intervention was the implementation of peer-led team learning (PLTL) for students in developmental mathematics courses.  The peer-led team learning curriculum was developed at the university.  Peer leaders were trained on the mathematics content and facilitation techniques.  6-8 students were assigned to one peer leader, who met with the students once each week.  Students who participated in this activity demonstrated a slight increase in their mathematics self-efficacy as documented in pre- and post-tests (Monrose Mills, Blackmon, McKayle, Stolz, &amp; Romano, 2020). These results point to new directions for PLTL at the university, including finding ways to increase the interactions between peer leaders and participants.  Moreover, pass rates in the developmental mathematics courses generally increased over the life of the grant.\n\nA third innovative intervention was the Math Behind the Science program.  This is a six-week summer program for pre-college freshman students.  Based on pre- and post- tests, students were able to begin their college careers in higher-level mathematics courses than they would have without the program. The curriculum focused on mathematics, with a large proportion of the delivery being hands-on collaborative work. Students shared that the program increased their mathematical skills and overall confidence in their STEM classes. \n\nBroader Impacts \n\nMany students participated in multiple programs and shared their reflections.  From interviews with students, it is clear that participating in PLTL increased student comfort with leadership roles, and developed leadership attributes. Some attribute their persistence as an undergraduate and pursuit of post-baccalaureate study to skills and confidence that they learned as a PLTL participant and peer leader.\n\nThe innovative curricula of the Summer Boost program, the PLTL program, and the Math Behind the Science programs were developed at the University of the Virgin Islands.  For Summer Boost, for example, the creativity curriculum introduced students to creativity from the human perspective, the science of creativity, the creative mindset, and a four-step creative problem-solving approach.  There is integration with the creativity curriculum and the entrepreneurship curriculum.  For example, the curriculum introduces participants to the importance of creativity for entrepreneurs.  Students are also engaged in a curriculum that explores the difference between a growth mindset and a fixed mindset (Dweck, 2016), and are asked to apply all they have learned to real-life situations. In the future, this curriculum will be offered to various students at the university as part of a university-wide Boost program.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/05/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Camille A Mckayle"
