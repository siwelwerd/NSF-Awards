 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cryoconite holes are pockets of life completely encased in otherwise barren glacial ice.  These pockets of life form when dust blown onto the ice melts a small, largely isolated hole that can function as its own tiny ecosystem.  This dust can contain microorganisms such as bacteria, algae, or microscopic animals. The microorganisms within the hole interact and carry out functions typical of a larger ecosystem, such as a forest. Cryoconite holes are especially important in extreme cold environments such as the Antarctic Dry Valleys, where they function as repositories of life.  Because cryoconite holes are mostly enclosed and persist for years, they can be tracked over time to test fundamental scientific questions about how communities of interacting organisms develop to become fully functioning ecosystems.  This project will sample existing and experimentally created cryoconite holes to understand how these ecosystems develop and to what degree random processes (such as which organisms get there first) affect the final community composition and functioning.  The results will not only improve our understanding of how microbial communities assemble and affect the functioning of microecosystems such as cryoconite holes, but also how the processes of community assembly affect functioning of larger ecosystems, such as forests.  A better understanding of community establishment, development, and response to abiotic factors are essential to forecasting ecological responses to environmental change.\r\n\r\nIt is essential to unravel the links between community assembly, biodiversity, and nutrient cycling across numerous ecosystems because these are critical factors determining ecological responses to environmental change. The unique, largely isolated nature of cryoconite holes provides an experimental system that will advance fundamental understanding of the processes (e.g., stochastic dynamics such as dispersal limitation, assembly order, and ecological drift) driving community assembly.  This project will use a field sampling campaign and a number of manipulative experiments to test a hypothesis that unites theory in community and ecosystem ecology: the degree to which stochastic processes guide microbial community assembly and affects regional patterns in biodiversity and ecosystem processes.  Cryoconite holes will be sampled to compare community composition, environmental factors, and ecosystem functioning between hydrologically connected and isolated holes.  New cryoconite holes will also be constructed and monitored over the course of two growing seasons to specifically alter assembly order and community size, thereby pairing a unique manipulative experiment with field surveys to address questions with relevance to the Antarctic and beyond.  Amplicon sequencing, metagenomics, microscopy, sensitive environmental chemistry methods, and photosynthesis and respiration measurements will be used to test a series of sub-hypotheses that relate stochasticity to patterns in regional biodiversity, heterogeneity in environmental factors, and ecosystem processes.",

Cryoconite holes are holes in a glacier's surface caused by sediment melting into the glacier (Figure 1). Surprisingly, these perennially cold holes are self-contained ecosystems that include abundant microbial life (bacteria, fungi, protists, algae etc.), and have recently gained attention as model systems for studying how biological communities form in nature, and as a source of microbes that can create new products (for example enzymes and antibiotics) at cold temperatures. They are also being studied as possible sites where complex life forms may have evolved during past eras when the Earth was completely covered in ice (Snowball Earth). Cryoconite holes in Antarctica are very unique in that they form a thick ice lid that seals them off from the rest of the world making each hole an isolated <em>island</em> in an otherwise frozen world (see Figures 2 and 3). Thus, Antarctic cryoconite holes are ideal, naturally-replicated test tubes to test theories for how communities of organisms assemble together and function under natural conditions. The researchers spent three Austral summers studying natural cryoconite holes and constructing artificial holes that were manipulated to test how the arrival order of microbes and the initial size of the community affects the composition and functioning of the final community. An overview of the project can be viewed in the award-winning short film: <em>Cryo Holes: What are They and Who Studies Them</em> (https://cryoholes.wordpress.com/about/).</p>\n<p>The researchers showed that natural cryoconite holes contained remarkably similar communities on a given glacier, but that communities differed significantly when comparing between different glaciers in the Dry Valleys of Antarctica, and that cryoconite hole communities in Antarctica are very different than cryoconite hole communities on glaciers in alpine and polar environments throughout the rest of the world. They further demonstrated that artificial cryoconite holes could be reproducibly created using various microbial communities from Antarctic streams. They then carried out a large-scale experiment (see Figure 4 and 5) to show that the order in which community members arrived had a measurable effect on the makeup of the final microbial community in cryoconite holes after two years.&nbsp; This finding was surprising since it was assumed that the harsh environmental conditions of Antarctica would select for the same specialized microbial community no matter what order different organisms arrived. The researchers also carried out many different chemical, physical and biological measurements to determine what factors may be important in the assembly of microbial communities in cryoconite holes. These data showed that cryoconite holes nearer to the coast had more abundant microbial life, including organisms that could efficiently use atmospheric nitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>) and carbon (CO<sub>2</sub>), whereas inland glaciers are more starved for nutrients (for example see Figure 6). These analyses also showed that the essential element phosphorus is most limiting nutrient to the growth of microbes in cryoconite holes. This finding is important because it shows that starvation for nutrients may be more important than cold temperatures in explaining why glaciers further from the coast have such low levels of microbial life compared to glaciers nearer the coast where phosphorus is more abundant.</p>\n<p>Finally, while carrying out the work described above on the glaciers of Taylor Dry Valley, the research team also searched previously unexplored areas of the Valley and the Asgard Mountain Range above the valley (see Figure 4) for microbes that could be the source of inoculum for cryoconite holes on the glaciers of Taylor Valley. During this search they discovered novel microbial communities (in biological soil crusts) that form in areas where wind-blown snow can accumulate, such as in gullies and on moraines. These newly discovered oases of microbial life in an otherwise barren landscape are likely the source of sediments that accumulate on the surfaces of Taylor Valley glaciers and form cryoconite holes, but more detailed genetic work will be necessary to confirm this hypothesis. Overall this research team made many important discoveries that have been communicated in numerous scientific articles and more directly to the public via seminar talks, visits with K-12 classes, a short documentary movie (https://cryoholes.wordpress.com/about/), and even through standup comedy routines presented by group leader Dr. Pacifica Sommers.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 01/04/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Steven&nbsp;K&nbsp;Schmidt</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1443578/1443578_10454937_1641323828013_Fig1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1443578/1443578_10454937_1641323828013_Fig1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1443578/1443578_10454937_1641323828013_Fig1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A.
