Many Data Science Meetup groups have been created across the country, each with an active local membership and a vibrant set of community-driven activities. The objective of this workshop is to connect the rapidly growing number of participants in these Data Science Meetup groups, in order to take the best advantage of this wealth of data science talent across the nation in addressing some of the national priority goals, including the goal of creating a well-educated Data Science workforce.\r\n\r\nThis workshop will result in data science meetup groups collaborating with local governments and non-profits to advance their impact and create data science solutions to national priority issues, including socioeconomic issues. The workshop will allow participants to network with their peers, including meetup organizers, nonprofits, government agencies, in order to create a national data science network. The meeting organizers have an established track record and extensive experience working with governments and non-profits on the use of data science techniques to address social issues, and have created several open source systems to address education, health, energy, and economic development problems.",
