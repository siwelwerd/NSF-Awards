 "awd_abstract_narration": "The National Academies' Board on Mathematical Sciences and their Applications (BMSA) provides a broad interface between the research enterprise and federal agencies that rely on the mathematical sciences. It plays a unique role of advising the federal government and policy community how to make best use of the mathematical sciences. Over its 32 years of existence, the BMSA has produced 78 reports. Through its work, the Board strengthens the policy making process; increases the visibility of, and appreciation for, the mathematical sciences; and identifies growth areas for the discipline.\r\n\r\nThe Board provides objective and authoritative advice on how best to apply the tools of mathematics, statistics, operations research, financial engineering, simulation science, analytics, risk analysis, systems engineering, and decision analysis to practical problems of national importance. It consists of 19 pro bono experts from a broad range of quantitative fields with experience in academia, industry, government, and national laboratories. Five BMSA members are members of the National Academy of Sciences and three of the National Academy of Engineering; all are recognized leaders in their fields. Board members carry out their work by identifying important steps of value to federal agencies and the mathematical sciences, and then recruiting leading mathematical scientists to participate in workshops, studies, and other activities focused on the technical challenges of federal decision-makers.",
