 "awd_abstract_narration": "People use a compass to learn their direction of travel.  Such a compass works because its tiny magnetic needle aligns with the magnetic field of Earth and indicates the direction of North.  On scales much larger than Earth, our own Milky Way Galaxy also has its own magnetic field.  In fact, all galaxies in the Universe appear to have magnetic fields, and these magnetic fields can have profound effects on a galaxy's development throughout its lifetime.  Through a series of sophisticated computer simulations, this project aims to unlock the puzzling origin of the magnetic fields found in galaxies.  Upon completion this project might point to an origin of these magnetic fields that coincides with the birth of the Universe itself.  Such a result could have a profound influence on our current understanding of fundamental physics, and its pursuit serves the national interest of developing US scientific leadership in astrophysics.  This project will also strengthen the US science workforce by directly training undergraduate and graduate students in general and computational astrophysics.  Project plans also include a vigorous education and public outreach program.\r\n\r\nMore technically, observations show that galaxies have magnetic fields with a component that is coherent over a large fraction of the galaxy with field strengths of order microgauss.  These fields are assumed to be from the amplification of initial weak seed magnetic fields of unknown nature.  The two scenarios of their origin are (1) a bottom-up astrophysical one, where the needed seed field is generated on smaller scales and (2) a top-down cosmological scenario where the seed field is generated prior to galaxy formation in the early Universe on scales that are large now.  Based on current observations, this project aims to distinguish between these two scenarios.  To achieve this goal, the evolution and observational signatures of cosmic magnetic fields will be studied in different astrophysical environments such as clusters, galaxies, and interstellar medium.  Numerical simulations will model the evolution of cosmic magnetic fields in the expanding Universe with time varying dissipative properties when initial conditions correspond to the different scenarios of the magnetogenesis.  This project is divided into the following related parts: (i) theoretical studies of magnetogenesis mechanisms including the cosmological and astrophysical scenarios; (ii) numerical simulations of large-scale magnetic fields evolution to analyze whether astrophysical mechanisms can lead to extragalactic magnetic field strengths comparable with the lower bounds; and (iii) determining potentially observable signatures of cosmic magnetic fields coherent at large scales---including cosmic structure formation, microwave background fluctuations, or ultra high energy gamma-ray propagation.  The project will search for signatures of primordial cosmic magnetic fields that distinguish cosmological seeds from astrophysical sources.",

Both helical and nonhelical hydromagnetic turbulence are found to exhibit inverse cascading and produce large-scale magnetic fields at the present time. Helical fields from the electroweak phase transition are shown to have potentially nanoGauss magnetic fields at tens of kiloparsec length scales. Turbulent primordial magnetogenesis via the chiral magnetic effect has been simulated for the first time, but the resulting magnetic field strengths are shown to be too weak to explain the observed lower limits on the magnetic field field strength. A new diagnostic tool for classifying decaying turbulence has been developed and is now used in other applications (see Figure 1). Inflation-produced scale-invariant magnetic fields are found to exhibit a weaker inverse cascade than previously thought. Perfectly uniform inflationary magnetic fields are found to lead to rapidly declining fluctuations. We show that handedness in the cosmic microwave background can only be found if the turbulence is inhomogeneous. Our Galaxy shows hemispheric handedness, which is shown to result from the opposite viewing directions of the Galactic spiral (see Figure 2).<br /><br />Primordial hydromagnetic turbulence can also be studied by analyzing the resulting gravitational waves spectrum and its polarization properties. For that purpose, we have implemented a new gravitational wave solver into the publicly available Pencil Code. We developed a new method that allows us to reach up to 20 times longer a time steps than by standard integration of the gravitational wave equations. The resulting gravitational waves would be observable with LISA (see Figure 3).<br /><br />Apart from the conferences and publications in highly ranked journals, the results of our research are used as teaching material for advanced courses and summer schools, allowing young researchers to start working with and on the newly developed techniques and insights. The most important results are included in university courses taught by the project's main participants. Notably, two PhD theses by Alberto Roper Pol and Sayan Mandal were performed during the project. The PI and the research team members (including students involved in the project) have participated in a number of national and international conferences, workshops, and symposia (such as 12th International LISA symposium, 29th TEXAS 2017 symposium on Relativistic Astrophysics, The XXX IAU General Assembly, PHENO 2017, 2018, and 2019), and have delivered presentations. A number of invited talks were given at different institutions. The PIs have organized the NORDITA 2019 four-week program (including a workshop and a conference), entitled \"Gravitational Waves from the Early Universe\", at which the results of our research were widely discussed. Dissemination of the project results included not only the scientific community, but the much wider public as well. This was primarily aimed toward educational purposes.
