 "awd_abstract_narration": "Number theory is the branch of mathematics concerned with the study of the integers.  Two of the fundamental objects considered in this research project are prime numbers and polynomial equations with integer solutions, both of which play a central role in cryptography.  A theme of modern mathematics is to consider a family of related questions and to understand how the solution changes as the question varies within the family, with an eye toward revealing the structure underlying any individual question.  In number theory, the families are typically discrete -- there is no way to continuously turn one integer into another without leaving the integers -- but one may take a broad view and ask about the proportion of questions or objects satisfying a certain property; this is the viewpoint of the subfield of number theory known as arithmetic statistics.  This project will explore various questions within arithmetic statistics and number theory in general, often from different angles, with the goal being to see the extent to which these different approaches complement and inform each other.\r\n\r\nMore specifically, the key objects of consideration are primes, L-functions, number fields, and elliptic curves.  This project will study the growth of the average size of Selmer groups of elliptic curves with level structure using tools from the geometry of numbers as developed by Bhargava.  It will consider quadratic twists of elliptic curves, in particular the extent to which analytic and algebraic non-vanishing results can be intersected, and it will consider similar problems for twists of elliptic curves by nonabelian number fields. It will also study the distribution of values of Artin L-functions, obtaining applications to class numbers, extreme value problems, and geometry.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis grant supported research in the area of number theory, and more specifically in arithmetic statistics.  The template for most questions in arithmetic statitiscs is of the form, \"How many arithmetic objects are there of same flavor, and what are their typical properties?\"  For example, one might ask how many prime numbers there are below some point, and what properties these primes typically have.  While the number of primes below a given point has been understood for over 100 years, the properties of primes are still under study; this grant supported collaborations of the PI with Soundararajan and with Thorner on the behavior of primes.\n\nOther \"arithmetic objects\" of interest include number fields, essentially mild relaxations of the rational numbers.  Here, the problem of determining how many number fields there are is not well understood, but this grant supported research of the PI with Thorne, and of the PI with Wang and Wood, on this question, which obtains some of the best progress toward an answer.  This grant also supported work of the PI with Wang and Wood on the typical behavior of class groups of number fields, which is an explcit object describing the behavior of factorization in a given number field.\n\nOne final object of interest in arithmetic statistics is elliptic curves and their generalizations, abelian varieties.  These are simple polynomial equations in at least two variables, all of whose solutions are required to have rational coordinates (or, perhaps, in a number field).  Such equations may have infinitely many solutions, but if so, then there are a finite number of solutions that \"generate\" all others.  The smallest number of solutions that can generate all others is called the rank, and with Bhargava, Klagsbrun, and Shnidman, the PI considered the typical rank in natural families of abelian varieties.  Their work is the first general work to apply over general number fields, and to abelian varieties of arbitrarily large dimension (essentially, the number of variables in the defining polynomial equation).\n\nFinally, a key theme of the work supported by this grant is that these three classes of problem do not live in isolation.  The PI frequently used ideas or problems from one to motivate or udnerstand questions in another.\n\n \n\nIn terms of broader impacts, while supported by this grant, the PI organized conferences, workshops, and seminars, with a particular emphasis on the work of younger researchers.  He was also a mentor to a postdoc, PhD students, and undergraduate researchers.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/28/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Robert J Lemke Oliver"
