 "awd_abstract_narration": "Advances in the synthesis of Ferrofluids (engineered fluids that respond to magnetic fields and have a number of well-established industrial applications) have increased the scope of potential applications of these fluids to new areas. Emerging applications of ferrofluids include: magnetic targeting of drugs, cell sorting in biomedical systems and magnetically driven contaminant removal. In each of these applications the use of ferrofluids enables new techniques that depend on the use of magnetic fields for 'remote control' of the ferrofluid. However, the realization of such technologies is hampered by complexities simulation of these systems for further development and design. The proposed research program includes the development of effective, robust computational tools that will enable such simulations. In particular, the computing codes will include the particular magnetic physics of ferrofluids as well as the forces resulting from the magnetic fields, which serve as the means of control in these applications. The development of these effective simulation tools will support and accelerate innovation in these emerging these technologies. Moreover, the proposed program of code development, simulations and integrated physical experiments will serve as a proof-of-concept for the inclusion of realistic multiphysics fluid simulations for complex scientific and  engineering applications. The proposed research program will involve undergraduate and masters-degree students in leading-edge research, including students who are members of groups under-represented in STEM disciplines such as women and first-generation college students.\r\n\r\nIn magnetic drug targeting, a ferrofluid whose constituent nanoparticles have been functionalized to carry theraputic drugs is directed to a tumor or other localized site (e.g., in the eye); sorting of(nonmagnetic) biological cells by immersion in a ferrofluid so that the force of an applied magnetic field depends on cell size; purification of a polluted fluid by adsorbption of contaminants to magnetic nanoparticles, which are then separated from the fluid by magnetic forces. However, advances in these applications are stymied by the complex, multi-scale and multi-physics nature of the fluid-dynamical systems in which they occur. In particular, because contemporary fluid-dynamics codes are not designed to incorporate the additional physics of magnetic-fluid systems, effective simulation with these codes is difficult. The proposal describes a plan to develop and test a new parallel, multi-phase code for fully three-dimensional flows. This project will lead to a flexible and efficient, multi-phase magnetic-fluid simulation code that is fully three-dimensional and parallelized for high-performance computing. Hence, the code will enable realistic simulations relevant to the significant applications addressed. Specifically, in order to address the above-noted applications, the code will model and simulate flows with dynamic interfaces between the ferrofluid and other fluids. Moreover, the code will implement models of viscosity effects (magnetoviscosity) as well as driving forces that result from applied magnetic fields (magnetophoresis) in a flexible manner that simplifies adjustment and updating of the models.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project developed, tested and applied algorithms for a new computer simulation software platform for multiphase magnetic liquids.  The simulation platform that was developed is the first fully three-dimensional general code for magnetic multiphase flows.  The software was developed within the framework of a new open source tool for simulating fluids with interfaces known as Paris. \n\nThe challenges that were overcome involved maintaining numerical accuracy over a broad range of types of magnetic fluids in which different physical effects made different computational demands which are not always compatible.  At the same time, the project successfully built broad generality into the software, permitting its use to a wide range of configurations and fluid properties, making it more applicable to problems in many fields, including biomedicine and robotics.\n\nTo ensure the fidelity of the simulation software, this project also built and performed laboratory experiments that were used both for algorithm validations and also as proofs of concept for biomedical applications, such as magnetic control in chemo-theraputic treatment of tumors. \n\nWe also designed new devices to assess the viability of using magnetic fluid based chemo-therapy on localized tumors, including handheld low-cost devices to detect, track and control the motion of small regions of magnetic fluid in an environment resembling biological tissue or blood vessel.\n\nAll of the research activity performed in this project involved undergraduate and masters degree engineering students at the Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art.  Students were exposed to and invited to participate in this research during special university research events as well as by integrating academic content into coursework and pedagogy and also by promotion by the Albert Nerken School of Engineering.\n\nFour papers were published in leading peer-reviewed journals resulting from the research supported by this project grant.  Students were co-authors on most of these publications.  In addition, two mechanical engineering masters degree theses were written and defended and three successful mechanical engineering senior capstone design projects were completed under this project.  Students from this project presented results as talks and posters at two major international conferences on magnetic fluids in general and their applications in biomedical and drug targeting applications.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/25/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Philip A Yecko"
