It has enabled electronic data (0s and 1s) to be directly written onto light pulses that travel the globe and essentially form the backbone of the internet. It is also used to change the color of light emitted by lasers, of importance for high-speed computing and sensing, as well as to enable realization of novel quantum sources of light that may enable next-generation ultra-secure optical communications. However, currently the performance of lithium-niobate based optical devices is limited by their bulky size. This project aims to miniaturize these to the nanoscale by patterning lithium-niobate onto a photonic microchip, thereby enhancing their efficiency many-fold. This will enable the design of novel light sources with greatly improved properties compared to current technology and also significantly reduce the optical power requirements. The proposed research program is a natural template for informing students, teachers, and the public of how scientists and engineers explore the unique behavior of materials at the nanoscale, and make use of these properties in the creation of new devices. The team will leverage the \"magic\" of optics and lasers to engage a wide audience and inform the public of their ongoing research. The program has strong theoretical and experimental components and addresses both fundamental and engineering aspects of light-generation in nanoscale optical devices and systems. Therefore, it represents a unique research and educational opportunity for students at all levels. The devices and systems that will be developed will be of great interest to both the scientific community and commercial industry.\r\nAbstract (technical): Lithium-niobate, with its large second-order susceptibility, relatively large refractive index and wide transmission window extending from ultra-violet to mid-infrared, is one of the most important optoelectronic materials, widely used for electro-optic modulation and classical & quantum optical frequency conversion. However, due to difficulties associated with fabrication, most of these components are discrete and cannot be easily integrated onto a photonic microchip. Fortunately, recent advances in lithium-niobate thin-film fabrication techniques, via crystal ion slicing, are promising and enable chip-scale integration of nanophotonic devices. The proposed program builds on these results and seeks to develop an integrated nonlinear nanophotonics platform that combines the unique material properties of periodically-poled lithium-niobate with the superior light confinement and dispersion engineering in wavelength-scale optical waveguides and cavities. The new platform will be developed based on thin x-cut lithium-niobate device layers (~500-nm thick) bonded on top of a SiO2 substrate that provides optical isolation. The team will develop new techniques for surface poling of thin x-cut lithium-niobate films, thus allowing for efficient phase matching. State of the art nanofabrication techniques will be used to realize optical waveguides and cavities directly in the periodically-poled device layer. The devices will operate over a wide wavelength range (visible to mid-infrared) and enable strong photon interactions resulting in 40-fold more efficient nonlinear processes than those found in conventional counterparts. The program is expected to result in a wide variety of integrated devices and systems with applications in quantum frequency conversion, entangled-photon pair generation, supercontinuum generation, and frequency comb generation. The proposed program is transformative since it introduces lithium-niobate into the family of materials suitable for integrated, on-chip photonics. It will result in the development of a wide range of novel & more efficient nonlinear optical devices & systems, and make an impact on disciplines as diverse as quantum information science & technology, remote sensing, astronomy and optoelectronics.",

This platform is based on a previously well-established crystalline material, lithium niobate (LiNbO3, LN), with long-standing use in the telecommunication and laser industry. Its outstanding properties such as large second-order nonlinear susceptibilities (e.g. d33 = 25 pm/V), a large piezoelectric response (e.g. C33 ~ 250 C/m2), a wide optical transparency window (350 nm ? 5 um) and a high refractive index (~2.1), made it suitable for high-speed electro-optic phase and amplitude modulators, optical frequency converters, and surface acoustic wave filters. <br />Many of these applications benefitted from the ability to enhance this crystalline material by modifying its properties through well-established micro- and nano-fabrication techniques similar to those used for the processing of silicon wafers. One of these techniques, periodic poling, greatly expands our ability to convert a wide range of optical frequencies to their second harmonics, producing wavelengths not readily available using lasers, or bestowing novel temporal characteristics, such as shortening the duration of the pulses such lasers can produce. The other fabrication technique produced waveguides which greatly enhanced the effect of electro-optic and nonlinear optic interactions by confining the injected light to a small volume, increasing the strength of the electric field while also allowing for the integration of multiple on-chip waveguide components such as power and wavelength splitters / combiners, spatial-mode filters, and adiabatic mode converters, among others.<br />While both of these techniques had been well established and prolifically used by both industry and academic groups, they were limited by the relatively small refractive index difference between the core of the waveguide and its cladding (~1%). This resulted in the length of usable devices being measured in centimeters with a small number of co-integrated on-chip components; achievable bend radii for curved waveguides, for example, were on the order of several millimeters. <br /><br />All this changed dramatically with the advent of commercially available, wafer-scale smart-cut(TM) processing of crystalline materials such as LiNbO3, ushering in a paradigm shift for all of the above-mentioned applications. Here, a sub-micrometer-thin film of LN on a silica (or sapphire) cladding layer is realized by ion implantation and thermally induced exfoliation [Figure ?SmartCut Process Flow?]. Direct etching of thin-film LN (TFLN) on insulator (LNOI) to form low-loss ridge waveguides (&lt; 0.03dB/cm) extends the performance of this novel nanophotonic platform far beyond traditional waveguide technologies due to sub-wavelength modal confinement [Figure ?PP-TFLN Components?]. Resulting from this are order-of-magnitude increases in nonlinear conversion efficiencies, reductions in drive voltages for electro-optic modulators, decreased waveguide bend radii now measured in tens of micrometers, and the possibility of dispersion engineering; using periodically poled TFLN (PP-TFLN) for the first time, the teams at Harvard and Stanford University demonstrated a record-setting normalized second-harmonic efficiency (2600 %/W-cm^2) at telecommunication wavelengths, a 30-fold increase over state-of-the-art converters prior to these results.<br /><br />Much as third-order nonlinear interactions were revolutionized over the past decade by the advent of silicon and silicon nitride nanophotonics, PP-TFLN ridge waveguides offer the prospect of similarly revolutionizing second-order interactions. Especially intriguing for future applications is dispersion engineering available in these structures which offers ultrabroadband operation akin to that seen with third-order nanophotonics, but with the much stronger nonlinear coupling inherent to second-order interactions. This design freedom allowed us to engineer guided-wave optical frequency converters with bandwidths exceeding those determined by the dispersion of the underlying bulk material by more than an order of magnitude, while simultaneously reducing the pulse energies required for efficient frequency conversion by a factor of 30 [Figure ?Broadband SHG and SCG?]. Similar design principles were used to produce devices which spectrally broadened short optical light pulses to well over two octaves, generating light whose spectrum ranged from the green all the way to the invisible mid-infrared [Figures ?TFLN Supercontinuum? and&nbsp; ?Broadband SHG and SCG??]. Such devices can play an important role in metrology applications where precise and stable optical frequency references (so-called ?frequency combs?) are being used to precisely measure the constituents of gases and liquids, for example.<br /><br />Going forward, we will be exploring the possibility of not only modifying externally input light using such frequency converters, but to generate useful laser-like source on chip. Low-loss micro-ring waveguides have already been demonstrated in these waveguides enabling the extension from simple traveling-wave devices to resonator devices such as parametric oscillators and filters. The same advantages this platform provides for classical optical devices will also apply to extension to quantum optical devices operating in the few-photon regime.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 01/27/2020<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Martin&nbsp;M&nbsp;Fejer</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1609688/1609688_10443187_1580174717432_TFLNSupercontinuum--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1609688/1609688_10443187_1580174717432_TFLNSupercontinuum--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"TFLN supercontinuum\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1609688/1609688_10443187_1580174717432_TFLNSupercontinuum--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"TFLN supercontinuum\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Image of the visible portion of the multi-octave output spectrum of the supercontinuum illustrated in Figure \"Broadband SHG and SCG\".</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Carsten Langrock</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Martin&nbsp;M&nbsp;Fejer</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">TFLN supercontinuum</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1609688/1609688_10443187_1580174590019_PP-TFLNComponents--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1609688/1609688_10443187_1580174590019_PP-TFLNComponents--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Periodically-poled TFLN components\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1609688/1609688_10443187_1580174590019_PP-TFLNComponents--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Periodically-poled TFLN components\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Schematic of the basic architecture of a TFLN nanophotonic frequency conversion device, along with images of the key components: SHG microscope image of in-plane periodic poling, SEM of an etched waveguide with simulated modal intensity distribution, and false-color SEM showing the periodic domain s</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Carsten Langrock, Marko Loncar</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Martin&nbsp;M&nbsp;Fejer</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Periodically-poled TFLN components</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1609688/1609688_10443187_1580174478088_SmartCutProcessFlow--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1609688/1609688_10443187_1580174478088_SmartCutProcessFlow--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"SmartCut Process Flow\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1609688/1609688_10443187_1580174478088_SmartCutProcessFlow--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"SmartCut Process Flow\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Process flow for fabrication of a sub-micron-thickness layer of single-crystal lithium niobate by the commercial \ufffdSmartCut\ufffd method, a key input to the nanophotonic devices reported here.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Carsten Langrock</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Martin&nbsp;M&nbsp;Fejer</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">SmartCut Process Flow</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1609688/1609688_10443187_1580175143947_BroadbandSHGandSCG--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1609688/1609688_10443187_1580175143947_BroadbandSHGandSCG--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Broadband SHG and SCG\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1609688/1609688_10443187_1580175143947_BroadbandSHGandSCG--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Broadband SHG and SCG\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Results for two frequency conversion experiments in dispersion engineering in TFLN waveguides.
