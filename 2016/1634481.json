 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will combine advanced observational techniques with high resolution hydrodynamic modeling to quantify the morphological evolution of bedforms in a tidal channel and their feedbacks with hydrodynamic roughness. In complex coastal environments, our ability to understand interactions across multiple scales is often limited by gaps in the observational data or modeling framework. This study will span those gaps in order to address fundamental questions on morphological evolution and frictional effects. Morphodynamic modeling has made great progress at simulating basin-scale evolution over centuries to millennia, and yet quantitative skill and process-based assessments remain limited by observations. Similarly, hydrodynamic models have incorporated various processes that can contribute to effective roughness and alter predicted velocities and bed stress, and yet quantitative assessment of friction at the scale of the model parametrizations makes the merits of the inclusion of complex roughness formulations ambiguous. This research will directly address these limitations in spatial and temporal resolution, and the results will be applicable more broadly to larger scale and more slowly evolving coastal settings. This would significantly improve our abilities to characterize and manage a wide range of coastal processes. Inundation, eutrophication, harmful algal blooms, and long-term morphological response to sea level rise in back-barrier and shallow estuarine environments all depend on the small-scale hydrodynamic and bedform coupling studied here. This project will support the training of both a graduate student and postdoc. The multidisciplinary topic and a research approach that integrates advanced observational and modeling tools will prepare them to make contributions either in basic research or engineering and management of coastal systems.\r\n\r\nIn the nearshore ocean, bedforms interact across a cascade of spatial and temporal scales. Ripples respond to tidal velocities, and convergences and divergences in ripple migration lead to the growth and movement of mega-ripples. Similarly, mega-ripple evolution at spring-neap to event time scales contributes to the formation of dunes and larger scale features. Using autonomous surface and aerial vehicles the team will map out the evolution of a dynamic tidal channel across this range of forcing conditions, explicitly resolving the spectral evolution from wavelengths of 10s of cm to 100s of m. Shipboard and moored observations will also measure the frictional effects of the bedforms on the overlying flow across multiple scales, providing a direct comparison between local turbulent stresses and the barotropic pressure gradient. A spatially limited and dynamically evolving domain permits high resolution modeling of the hydrodynamics and sediment transport in the system, including unprecedented quantitative evaluation of the morphological response. Small scale, process-based modeling will be paired with larger scale morphodynamic simulations to link hydrodynamic features at the bedform scale with the integrated effect on effective roughness. Parameterization of subgrid-scale roughness will be compared with observations to assess how multiple scales of bedforms affect the frictional response with changing tidal forcing.",

These bedforms interact with overall geometry of the system to control the strength of the tidal currents, the tidal water elevations throughout the estuary and the sediment transport processes that feedback into the overall morphology and bedform geometry. This study developed new measurement techniques to measure both the flows and the complex topography. Aerial photography from small multirotor drones was used to make maps of the exposed sand features at low tide using structure from motion (SfM) which combines multiple photographs to resolve the topography of the landscape (Figure 1). In this study we extended the technique to measure shallow bathymetry when features on seafloor were clearly visible in the photographs by developing a correction for refraction at the air water interface. A jet drive kayak (Jetyak) autonomous surface vessel (ASV) with a bathymetric sidescan sonar was used to map the estuary with resolution that can resolve ripples and the overall morphology. The combined approach of using a drone and a USV to measure very shallow bathymetry provide a method to rapidly characterize tidal inlet and estuary systems which will become increasingly important as sea level rises and these systems become more frequent conduits for coastal floods.  \nThe Jetyak also measured tidal current velocity with an Acoustic Doppler Current Meter and the tidal water surface slope with a precision GPS. The combined measurement of velocity, water surface slope and bedform geometry allowed us to investigate the frictional dynamics of the system (Figure 2). The hydrodynamic friction due to flow over bedforms damps the tide as it propagates up the estuary resulting in a smaller tidal  range at the landward end of the estuary with increased friction.  Analysis of the Jetyak and in-situ sensor data revealed drag coefficients that were 3 to 5 times higher than expected based on other estuaries.  \nA high-resolution circulation and transport model was developed to analyze the frictional dynamics of the tidal channel.  The bathymetric grid had horizontal resolution of 4-6 m and realistic simulations were run for the observation periods. The model reproduced observed decreases in tidal amplitude and growth of overtides spatially along the channel (Figure 3). Along-channel sections of water level and velocity measured with the Jetyak were also well represented  by the model. \nEvaluation of the momentum budget in the model showed that the dominant balance is between the pressure gradient and stress divergence.  However, the model also revealed substantial variability in the amplitude of the terms with bathymetry (Figure 4). The stress divergence and pressure gradient were typically greater on the shoals than in the channel, and local (at scales of 10s of m) pressure gradients substantially deviated from larger scales (100s of m).  Observations were predominantly in the channel due to navigational constraints and measurement accuracy required spatial filtering of the water surface gradient, so despite the high-resolution of the measurements they could not resolve the momentum budget at the scales of variability with bathymetry. This can introduce biases to observational estimates of the drag coefficient, particularly in shallow tidal systems with strong variations in depth and velocity.\nAlong with the hydrodynamics, the model was used to evaluate how the variability in tidal dynamics and bed stress influence sediment transport and morphological evolution.  Spatial patterns in the model compared well with net sediment transport calculated from bathymetric surveys (Figure 5).  Morphological evolution in the model was found to be much greater than in observations when sediment transport was calculated based on the total bottom stress that was calibrated to the hydrodynamics.  This hydrodynamic roughness incorporates both form drag from sub-grid-scale bedforms and skin friction at the grain scale.  When sediment transport is calculated based only on the skin friction only the net transport rates were more consistent with the observed change.\nIn addition to bedforms, channel curvature can be a source of enhanced drag.  Analysis of observations from another shallow estuary with strong channel curvature showed that drag was increased by up to a factor of 5 compared to bottom roughness alone. This increase in drag resulted from a combination of form drag due to flow separation in channel bends and greater bottom stress from lateral circulation.  \nNumerical modeling at  the bedform scale was also used to examine the frictional dynamics.  The small-scale modeling of flow over bedforms was not able to predict the large drag that was measured and the large-scale modeling required larger small scale drag to be imposed than is typically used (Figure 6).  Additional research is required to fully understand the mechanisms for the larger than expected frictional drag.\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/02/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Peter A Traykovski"
