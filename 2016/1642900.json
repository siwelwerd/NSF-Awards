 "awd_abstract_narration": "The professional misconduct of harassment preferentially targets women, although men can also be victims of harassment. The realms of science and academia are not immune to this problem. Research confirms the extent of harassment in academic environments and in disciplines with low diversity, where the lack of established support networks can lead to feelings of vulnerability and professional insecurity. Another problem identified by research on harassment is the scarcity of well-defined resources for reporting and responding to inappropriate behavior, and the perceived risk that the victims' careers may be jeopardized if they speak out (Clancy et. al, 2014). These events have highlighted the need for support mechanisms for the targets of inappropriate behavior, as well as the need for a suitable institutional response to deter continued misconduct.\r\n\r\nLeaders from scientific societies and universities will be brought together to discuss the issue of sexual harassment in the sciences, develop a statement of collective principles around expected ethical behavior, and suggest best practices for societies and academic institutions in addressing these issues. The approach proposed through this workshop will (1) establish firm and broadly supported expectations within the scientific community for ethical conduct and help identify consensus steps towards creating a harassment-free work culture; (2) provide a recommended common structure for responding when such issues are discovered, including suggested recourse and resources for both individuals and organizations; and (3) explore support needed for the targets of such inappropriate behavior when confronted with such situations, and the tools and training needed for the organizational managers who are responding.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "Major Activities Accomplishments:  \nThe singular major activity of this project was the planning and execution of a September 9, 2016 workshop, Sexual Harassment in the Sciences: A Call to Respond.  The workshop was held in Washington, D.C. and included 60 invited participants, an even mix of academic heads and chairs, professional society leaders, and federal agency program leaders.  \nSpecific Objectives: \nThe workshop objective was to generate common principles, and identify resources and best practices to address the challenge of sexual and gender-based harassment on campus, in the field, and at scientific meetings.\nSIGNIFICANT RESULTS: \nSpecific significant results from the workshop were:\n\nthe establishment of a document titled \"Draft Organizational Principles for Addressing Harassment,\" broadly disseminated to other scientific societies to start the dialogue and help stimulate the adoption of best practices;\nthe establishment of a \"StopHarassment\" website, where tools, resources and other article of interest for addressing harassment are gathered and available to the public; \nfollow-up workshops and invitation to share the results of the workshop at annual scientific meetings (AGU, Geological Society of America, and the Society of Exploration Geophysicists); and \nfurther sharing and discussion of workshop results with the leadership of other scientific organizations, including: the American Society for Microbiology, American Meteorological Society, American Geoscience Institute, American Astronomical Society, the U.S. Geological Survey, University Corporation for Atmospheric Research, and the National Academy of Sciences.\n\nOther key outcomes and achievements from this project:\n \n\nThe conference was convened by 6 partnering organizations&mdash;the American Geophysical Union (AGU), American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), the Earth Science Women?s Network (ESWN), the Association for Women Geoscientists (AWG), and the American Geosciences Institute (AGI) and the American Chemical Society (ACS)&mdash;demonstrating an openness to strategic collaboration on addressing harassment-related issues.\nThe workshop was broadly covered in scientific media (EoS, Science, Chemical and Engineering News) and associated press releases.\nAn innovative new organizational campaign, SafeAGU, was initiated to publicly advertise and provide support for potential targets of harassment.\nAppointments of an AGU Task Force and an AGI Task Force, to help address issues and recommendations evolving from the workshop\nA follow-on successful NSF proposal titled \"ADVANCE Partnership: From the Classroom to the Field: Improving the Workplace in the Geosciences\" led by Erika Marin-Spiotta, PI, University of Wisconsin.\n\n\nOpportunities for training and professional development: \n\nThe project has resulted in development of preliminary workshop offerings to address the topic of harassment in the sciences, and beginning work towards tailored by-stander intervention training for targeted science communities. This is ongoing work to be addressed in follow-up to this project.\n\nDissemination to communities of interest:\n\nThe workshop results have been disseminated through discussion at national scientific meetings, including AGU, GSA, SEG annual meetings; and with the leadership of multiple other scientific organizations.  For example, a report on this work at the American Geosciences Institutes annual meeting of more than 50 affiliated society leaders resulted in the appointment of a separate task force to help establish codes of conduct and broad principles that each of the 50 affiliated societies can adopt.  The resources available on the \"stop harassment\" website have also been widely promoted.\n\nIMPACTS\n\nThis project has had 3 major areas of impact: on the disciplines of the project, on other scientific disciplines, on development of human resources, and in the potential to impact  society beyond science and technology.\n\nImpact in the scientific disciplines\n\nThis project has had an impact in the adoption and dissemination of its \"Organizational Principles for addressing harassment, the establishment of a new \"Stop Harassment\" website, and in the establishment of multiple follow-on workshops and discussion sessions to begin public dialogue on addressing the topic of harassment in the science. \n\nThere has been invited discussion of this topic across the sciences, and not just the geosciences.  For example, there was an invited presentation to the Board of the American Society for Microbiology, and a committee formed by the National Academy of Sciences to address harassment across all STEM disciplines included a presentation and discussion on the results of this NSF project in its data-gathering.\n\nImpact on the development of human resources:\n\nFollow-on work from this project has the potential to help lead to culture change in our approach to harassment and associated issues in our workplace, including a potential impact on efforts to improve the retention of women in science.\n\nImpact on society beyond science and technology\n\nThis project has focused on addressing the issue of harassment in the sciences; however, harassment and associated forms of unacceptable behavior is also an issue in broader society.  Follow-on tools, research, and firmly established principles of conduct to be established in our sciences are likewise anticipated to have broader impact beyond the scientific community.    \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/27/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Billy M Williams"
