 "awd_abstract_narration": "A key goal in ecology is understanding how and why environmental variation shapes species interactions. Food webs describe the feeding relationships between organisms, and illustrate the ecological roles of plants and animals in natural communities. Food webs also describe how the entire suite of feeding interactions might function. Understanding how and why food webs differ between places is important because it can help predict ecological impacts of environmental change such as species loss or habitat change. In this project, researchers will study how changes in soil nutrients cause differences in food webs. The research focuses on the feeding interactions between plants and caterpillars, and between caterpillars and their predators. By documenting \"who eats whom\" in Northern California soils of low versus high fertility, this project will be able to describe complex food webs and ask how these webs are different across soil types. Because most of our understanding of this topic comes from agricultural ecosystems that have soils impacted by fertilizer, this project will provide new insights as it is based on soils that naturally vary in fertility. This research will involve several undergraduate students and an ecology club.  \r\n\r\nVariation in soil resources is a ubiquitous form of environmental heterogeneity, with strong direct and indirect effects on organismal traits and species interactions. Multiple theories address the effects of resource level on trophic interactions: the Resource Availability Hypothesis (RAH) suggests that resource availability should shape plant traits and, consequently, their quality to herbivores; in turn, the Slow Growth, High Mortality (SGHM) and High Performance, High Mortality Hypotheses (HPHM) relate plant quality to interactions between herbivores and natural enemies. Based on these theories, this research will disentangle the interacting roles of predation and nutritive and defensive plant traits in shaping plant-caterpillar-top predator tri-trophic interactions. Using a natural mosaic of low fertility serpentine and higher fertility non-serpentine soils in California, this project will build exclusion cages to assess how top-predators affect plant-caterpillar interactions across different soil types. Plant nutritive and defensive traits will be measured simultaneously to disentangle the relative importance of traits and predation in driving food web structure across different resource contexts. Together, these experiments will advance our understanding of how and why species interactions vary across heterogeneous landscapes.",

The structure of these interactions can help us understand important ecosystem functions, such as how energy is transferred between organisms or how stable an entire ecosystem might be to species loss or habitat change. In this research project, we studied how feeding interactions and food web structure are shaped by differences in soil resources, which is a common source of resource variability in nature. We focused our study on plants, plant-feeding insects, and their predators: together, these groups of organisms constitute over half of the biodiversity on the planet, forming complex webs of interactions across the globe.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We found that soil type had cascading effects on ecological communities and food web structure. We first tested predictions of the Resource Availability Hypothesis (RAH), which suggests that abiotic resources should shape plant traits and, consequently, their quality to herbivores. When we studied plant nutritive and defensive traits, we found that some plants were less nutritive (lower nitrogen and leaf water content) and more defended (greater toxin content and leaf toughness) on low-resource soils, and that the strength of these effects varied by host plant genus. Next, we documented consistent effects of soil origin on herbivore performance: caterpillars grew more slowly on plants from low-resource soils than on plants from higher-resource soil types. This component of our research showed a direct link between low-resource soils and reduced plant quality to herbivores.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>While the quality of food plants can have direct effects on herbivore performance, it can also influence how susceptible herbivores are to their natural enemies. For example, the Slow Growth High Mortality Hypothesis (SGHM) posits that slow-growing herbivores on low-quality plants should be more vulnerable to enemies; in contrast, the High Performance High Mortality Hypothesis (HPHM) suggests that predation should be greater on higher-quality plants, where herbivores are more abundant. Based on these theoretical expectations, we asked whether predation and parasitism were influenced by resource availability. We built exclusion cages to assess how bird predation differs across soils, and reared caterpillars to measure parasitism by wasps and flies. We found that the strength of parasitism and predation did not differ across soil types. These findings are currently in preparation for <em>Ecology</em>.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Finally, we found that caterpillar communities were less abundant and diverse on low-resource soils. In addition, we found that there were profound effects of resource level on plant-herbivore food web structure: low-quality plants in low-resource soils were associated with fewer generalized interactions between plants and herbivores, resulting in more specialized network structure. Because such &lsquo;modular&rsquo; structure is thought to mediate stability of ecological communities, this result suggests that abiotic resource level can promote stable structures within food webs. Because we found effects of soil type on plant quality but not on predation, we can conclude that these differences in food web structure are primarily due to &lsquo;bottom-up&rsquo; effects of plant quality, and not &lsquo;top-down&rsquo; effects of predators. These findings can be found across two manuscripts: one article is currently in press in <em>Ecology</em>, and the other is in preparation for <em>Ecology Letters</em>.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We achieved the principal goal and final outcome of this project, which was to understand how resource availability shapes food webs. We were able to explore both &lsquo;bottom-up&rsquo; and &lsquo;top-down&rsquo; forces in a single system, and to do so over a natural source of resource variation. Together, the results of this study have advanced our understanding of how and why species interactions vary across heterogeneous landscapes. In addition to reaching our intellectual goals, this project also incorporated a range of broader impacts. Over the lifetime of this project, we trained over ten undergraduate students in field and laboratory methods. Most of these students were young women in science, and several were first generation college students or members of underrepresented groups in STEM. We led multiple field trips and workshops in collaboration with the SEEDS Ecology Club (Strategies for Ecology Education, Diversity, and Sustainability) at UC Davis, during which students helped record species diversity and predation rates of caterpillars. By the end of this project, we had collected over 3,000 caterpillars, and contributed new natural history information such as host plant associations and morphology to the publicly-available resources www.bugguide.org and www.mothphotographersgroup.msstate.edu.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 06/10/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Moria&nbsp;Robinson</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1600961/1600961_10414480_1528651282245_S2_Geometrids--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1600961/1600961_10414480_1528651282245_S2_Geometrids--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Geometridae\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1600961/1600961_10414480_1528651282245_S2_Geometrids--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Geometridae\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Geometrids that are currently undescribed as larvae.
