 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is funded from the Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Sites program in the SBE Directorate. As such, it has both scientific and societal benefits, and it integrates research and education.\r\nThis eight-week international REU Site brings eight undergraduate students from diverse backgrounds to Sicily, Italy for four weeks to collect data from ancient human skeletons, and back to the United State for four weeks to work in the research laboratories at the University of Georgia. Students complete independent research projects relating to the health, activity patterns, diet, and genetic relatedness of people at the Greek colony and battlefield of Himera to better understand the biocultural consequences of culture contact in the past. Globalization is ever-increasing and often resembles colonization with its spread of ideas and people to developing nations. REU students will learn first-hand about deep roots and biological dimensions of interactions between diverse populations. Participants receive specialized field and lab training in archaeological chemistry, anatomy, research design, and data analysis. Students will leave the REU with greater technical and analytical skills, better preparedness for graduate study and professional careers, and heightened awareness of global issues relating to population contact, inequality, human conflict, and health transitions. These skills are foundational for improving global citizenship and stewardship in any career.\r\n\r\nTo promote scientific literacy and global engagement among undergraduates, this three-year REU Site integrates students as junior partners of the Bioarchaeology of Mediterranean Colonies Project, a cross-disciplinary, international research program that has brought undergraduate students to the Mediterranean for the past three summers. REU students generate new anthropological knowledge related to human adaptation and the impacts of culture contact in the ancient Mediterranean. Student projects focus on the more than 12,000 skeletons unearthed at Himera, which in the 7-5th centuries B.C. was the site of Greek colonizing efforts and violent battles. Himera represents an early epicenter of rising ethnic inequality. REU students plan and execute independent research projects exploring biocultural impacts of culture contact in Greek Sicily, including changes in diet, activity patterns, health, mobility, and genetic admixture, using stable isotope biogeochemistry, molecular anthropology, osteology, paleopathology and statistical analysis. Students collect bioarchaeological data from human skeletons at Sicily for four weeks, and spend the remaining four weeks at the University of Georgia (UGA) apprenticed in the UGA Bioarchaeology and Biochemistry Laboratory, analyzing field specimens. REU students participate in focused workshops and seminars, and work with dedicated mentors, receiving hands-on training for research projects. Through these activities, students (1) learn archaeological and anthropological field and lab methods, (2) learn from both American and Italian scholars, (3) visit museums and archaeological sites on Sicily, (4) design, execute, and present independent research projects that make substantive contributions to anthropology, (5) live in the city of Palermo, Italy where they will interact with Italian students and citizens, and (6) remain in close contact with faculty mentors for a full academic year to publish their results and present at international conferences. Two PhD student affiliates will gain mentorship training. REU students will leave better prepared to pursue and succeed in graduate school, excel in STEM careers, and be more globally engaged citizens.",

Each student formulated a hypothesis, evaluated and applied bioarchaeological methods and theoretical frameworks to test their hypothesis, collected data from human skeletons at the field site in Sicily, and analyzed the skeletal data back in the United States using archaeological chemistry, microscopy, and statistics. By critically examining the unique perspective offered by human remains, our 2016-2018 REU students&nbsp;used evidence to support<strong>&nbsp;</strong>new interpretations of colonization in the past.</p>\n<p>This REU Site helped to advance anthropological understanding of the impacts of culture contact on people?s health and lifestyles. It is known through history and archaeology that people at Himera came from diverse cultural backgrounds. By exploring biological correlates of diverse burial style, burial location, and body positioning in Himera?s necropoleis, students identified a wide range of variability in health, diet, and physical activity patterns at Himera, providing evidence for incipient social inequality in the ancient Mediterranean. Student-supported research using skeletal stable isotope ratios confirmed historical accounts of two epic battles fought at Himera, indicating that foreign allies fought alongside Himera in the battle of 480 BCE against Carthage, which Himera won, but not in the subsequent battle of 409 BCE, which Himera lost. This research indicates the importance of alliances and coalition formation for success in ancient conflicts among discrete geopolitical actors (Greek city-states) long before any single, shared cultural or national identity. Students compared their findings from Himera to other Greek colonies and cities in the ancient Mediterranean, and demonstrated that skeletal health was poor at Greek mother cities, both before and after colonization, supporting the hypothesis that Greek colonies were established in part to relieve population pressure and resource shortages in Greek mother cities.</p>\n<p>REU students applied&nbsp;professional research and communication skills through interacting with academic professionals, peers, and members of other cultures in the course of field and laboratory collaboration. The REU has resulted in 58 presentations first-authored by students at national and regional peer-reviewed academic conferences. Pre- and post-assessment surveys indicate that the program increased student confidence in problem-solving, formulating research questions, analyzing data, understanding the research process, using statistics, writing in a scientific style, working collaboratively, including with people from other cultural backgrounds, identifying limitations of research methods and designs, working in a lab, understanding theory, making connections among scientific disciplines, and understanding the relevance of research to their coursework. Many of our students are currently in graduate programs and/or working in scientific disciplines. Regardless of what careers the students ultimately pursue, the skills they developed as part of the REU Site: Bioarchaeology Research on the Impacts of Colonization on Local Population Health<strong> </strong>will make them more scientifically literate citizens.&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 06/19/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Britney&nbsp;K&nbsp;Mcilvaine</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1560158/1560158_10412087_1560960239694_20160615_100826--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1560158/1560158_10412087_1560960239694_20160615_100826--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Students collect skeletal data\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1560158/1560158_10412087_1560960239694_20160615_100826--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Students collect skeletal data\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">REU students examine human skeletal material and collect data for their independent research projects in the summer of 2016</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Katherine L.
