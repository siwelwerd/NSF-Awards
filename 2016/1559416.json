 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant will support the refurbishment of an internally heated high-pressure vessel (IHPV) acquired by the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH) from NASA.    Experiments under deep earth conditions are the primary means of investigating chemical evolution of magmas under controlled conditions. The installation of this apparatus will provide much greater access for students participating in AMNH-sponsored high school, undergraduate, graduate, postdoctoral, and teacher training programs.  The additional IHPV access will also support AMNH and other, non-museum colleagues to enhance U.S. competitiveness in research in magmatic processes. \r\n\r\nThe IHPV will be used to investigate melt-mineral-fluid phase equilibria and component partitioning behaviors in geologic systems under controlled conditions. The primary research objective is to obtain critical, missing knowledge to better address the compositional range of magmas that threaten society with eruptions or are part of hydrothermal mineralizing processes that produce metallic resources.",

Dr. Webster tested the IHPV extensively by running pilot experiments. This second IHPV in the AMNH lab doubles our capacity to see how much water and CO2 can dissolve in silicic magmas, depending on their sulfur and chlorine contents. The magmas we are working on are like that of Mt. Saint Helens, Vesuvius, and other explosive volcanoes. These experiments are ongoing in the two IHPVs. They will be used to calibrate models for bubble formation deep under volcanoes like those from Oregon to Alaska, and to calibrate models for magma crystallization, all to understand their eruption processes and potential. Fluids from such magmas also form metallic ore deposits, and our experiments will increase understanding of ore formation. Enabling better understanding of silicic magmas by use of the IHPV will improve our ability to model and predict explosive volcanic systems, which are a societal threat. Understanding halogens in silicic magmas will improve our ability to find and exploit mineral resources formed in magmatic environments.</p>\n<p><span>Two graduate students and one post-doctoral fellow worked in the lab during commissioning of the new IHPV, learning experimental petrology from Dr. James D.
