 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project encompasses a series of critical mathematical and scientific questions for multiscale problems arising in the fields of pattern formation, chemistry and combustion, neuroscience, electrical engineering, and multi-particle systems. The first project is on pattern formation and analyzes the dynamics and stability of fronts, pulses, and spots in paradigm reaction-diffusion systems. The second project studies model reduction methods used in complex multiscale chemical reactions, biochemical networks, and combustion by incorporating also the effects of diffusion. The third project involves a completely new class of solutions, known as torus canards, found in models from neuroscience. These solutions help understand the transitions between periodic spiking and bursting. The fourth project will focus on ways to model and analyze the impacts of cut-offs on the dynamics of fronts. The project involves graduate students and postdoctoral fellows in the research, as well as collaborations with scientists at national laboratories. \r\n\r\nThis research project addresses a series of questions concerning multiscale problems in pattern formation, chemistry and combustion, neuroscience, electrical engineering, and multi-particle systems. In the pattern formation project, paradigm reaction-diffusion systems will be studied. The goals are to develop new analytical techniques and mathematical theory for determining the boundaries of the stable pattern-forming regimes, analyzing the stability of semi-strong pulse interactions, modeling the scattering of pulses in 1-D systems and spots in 2-D systems, extending renormalization group methods for stability of modulating pulses, and predicting the dynamic bifurcations of pulses and fronts. The second project centers on accurate model reduction methods for large-scale combustion, chemical, and biochemical systems exhibiting multiple time scales. The goals are to analyze, develop, and improve cutting-edge model reduction methods for finding the low-dimensional manifolds that govern the effective system dynamics in the presence of diffusion. In the third project, the new phenomena of torus canards and canards in partial differential equations will be investigated. A theory of generic torus canards will be developed for fast-slow systems with multi-dimensional fast and slow variables. Known to exist in many neuroscience models, such as the Hindmarsh-Rose equations, the Morris-Lecar-Terman model, the Wilson-Cowan-Izhikevich system, and the forced van der Pol equation, torus canards are critical in the transition regimes between tonic spiking and bursting. A detailed study will also be carried out of the new bursting rhythms known as amplitude-modulated bursting rhythms. The fourth project will study the impacts of cut-offs on the reaction terms, introduced to accurately model regions of low particle densities, on the speeds, shapes, and stability of propagating fronts. A series of important problems related to fourth-order models, two-dimensional space dynamics, front initiation, and front pre-cursors will be studied.",

For example, rhythms in nerve cells range from low-frequency (0.02 Hz) to high frequency (100 Hz or more). Also, in chemistry and combustion, reaction rates vary over many orders of magnitude (nanoseconds to tens of seconds), as do diffusion length scales.</p>\n<p>In this project, new mathematical theory was developed to study the dynamics of multi-scale systems in physics, neuroscience, chemistry, and engineering problems.

Delayed Hopf bifurcation was studied in the Complex Ginzburg-Landau equation in pattern formation, a spatially-extended pituitary-lactotroph model in neuroscience, the FitzHugh-Nagumo equation, the Brusselator model in chemistry, and other multi-scale systems. Project research showed that solutions of these systems actually remain near key states, even for long times after the states have become unstable due to slow passage through Hopf bifurcations. This delay is critical for postponing the destabilization of desirable states and suppressing the onset of oscilllations. Analytical formulas were derived for the space-time buffer curves which control the space-time dependencies of the delayed, post-Hopf onset of the oscillations.</p>\n<p>A new type of attractor, called Multi-Mode Attractors, was discovered in reaction-diffusion systems during the project. These attractors exhibit different modes of temporal oscillation (spiking, alternating small- and large-amplitude oscillations, and bursting) in different regions of the domains. They were found in models of spatially-extended systems of pituitary-lactotroph cells and of cardiac myocytes, during Early After Depolarization. Moreover, new spatio-temporal canards were discovered in the transition intervals between adjacent regions.</p>\n<p>Mixed-Amplitude Chimeras were discovered during the project. In chimera states, systems of coupled oscillators exhibit regions of coherent (synchronous) oscillations co-existing with regions of decoherent (asynchronous) oscillations. For the new Mixed-Amplitude Chimeras, the coherent oscillators exhibit large-amplitude, low-frequency oscillations, while the decoherent oscillators exhibit small-amplitude, high-frequency oscillations. These substantial differences in the structures, amplitudes, and frequencies are important for oscillators in the different regions to have different functional roles.</p>\n<p>Analysis was performed of the dynamics and stability of pulses in multi-scale reaction-diffusion systems.

These methods are typically designed to find low-dimensional invariant manifolds in state space, thereby decomposing large, intractable multi-scale systems into tractable, low-dimensional models. Substantial design and implementation improvements were also made. Further, a new class of nonlinear partial differential equations was discovered that have exact, closed-form, low-dimensional invariant manifolds, making these new PDEs valuable to benchmark reduction methods.</p>\n<p>The project research developed new mathematical theory for torus canards, which occur ubiquitously in neuroscience.Their primary geometric and genericity properties were determined, for how they mediate the transitions between tonic spiking and many different types of bursting, as were mechanisms responsible for their creation, and formulas for their dependence on system parameters. The new phenomenon of Amplitude Modulated Bursting (AMB) was discovered while studying torus canards. AMB is a novel class of rhythms in which burst events are modulated in amplitude, which is important for extending burst duration and functional roles. Mathematically, it was shown that AMB is created by a new class of singularities in differential equations, called folded toral singularities, for which the first theory was developed by Vo.
