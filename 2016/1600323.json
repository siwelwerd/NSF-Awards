The meeting will take place in Montr\u00e9al, Qu\u00e9bec, Canada, on 18-21 October 2015. It will be held in conjunction with the Knowledge Network on the Ethical, Environmental, Economic, Legal and Social issues regarding Nanotechnology Network. The funds will be used to enable participation of students, postdoctoral researchers, junior scholars and independent scholars who have minimal travel and lodging funds to attend, and fully participate in, the 2015 S.NET meeting in Montr\u00e9al. \r\n\r\nTechnical Summary\r\n\r\nS.NET is an international scholarly organization devoted to furthering critical and diverse analyses of technoscientific research and development in various fields. It includes a wide range of academic and professional communities, and strives to incorporate a correspondingly broad spectrum of disciplinary perspectives and methodologies into its scholarly activities. The award will support the professional development of junior science and technology studies scholars, as well as students and researchers from underrepresented groups. More generally, it will encourage the production of scholarship of significant and practical value to multiple important societal activities, including the critical advancement of a wide range of scientific and technological inquiries, innovative approaches to product development and sustainable marketization, and, consequently, insurance of the near-term well-being and longer-term survival and enrichment of humanity.",
