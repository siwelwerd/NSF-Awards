 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Cyberlearning and Future Learning Technologies Program funds efforts that support envisioning the future of learning technologies and advance what we know about how people learn in technology-rich environments. Cyberlearning Exploration (EXP) Projects explore the viability of new kinds of learning technologies by designing and building new kinds of learning technologies and studying their possibilities for fostering learning and challenges to using them effectively. This project will advance undergraduate and graduate research training in STEM by designing organizational processes and cyberlearning technologies that support self-directed learning within a community of researchers. Faculty mentoring, research experience, and authentic problem solving increase undergraduate performance and retention in STEM, especially among women and underrepresented minority students. Faculty mentoring is effective but labor intensive and often reserved for more productive graduate students; undergraduate research positions can provide authentic practice but are limited in number. This research posits that undergraduates and graduates in STEM can better develop in collaborative cyberlearning research communities. These communities use collaborative cyberlearning technologies to: (a) teach research and collaboration, (b) supportively engage students in independent research, and (c) train graduate students to become effective mentors and future research leaders. Taking a community-based approach to training self-directed learners should significantly increase the number of undergraduate students doing authentic research, provide graduate students with authentic practice in mentoring and leadership, and increase the efficacy and scale of research training amid scarce resources. \r\n\r\nThis project seeks to fill an urgent need to mobilize the nation's diverse student talent pool and broaden participation in science and engineering research, one of the National Science Foundation's core missions. In support of this goal, this research will lay a theoretical foundation for understanding the broader ecosystem of integrated online/offline, social, project-based learning environments through development and testing of empirically-validated principles for designing cyberlearning research communities. The research develops socio-technical cyberlearning systems that train increased numbers of novice researchers without greatly increasing the orchestration burden on research mentors. The proposed solution is a general, theoretical model, `Agile Research Studios,' for helping faculty better train student researchers through social structures, practices, and cyberlearning tools that: support planning research inquiry, seeking help, practicing reflection, collaboration, and sharing. Agile Research Studios will be supported by Virtual Studio, an online platform that orchestrate socially-shared regulation learning outside of the classroom by supporting 3 interrelated feedback loops: (a) a sprint planning and replanning loop in which students and mentors receive feedback on project plans and progress, (b) a help and collaboration loop that helps students scope and prioritize help requests and connects them to helpers, and (c) a reflection and sharing loop that promotes growing over time and promoting collaborations and awareness across a studio. The project will develop and evaluate the Agile Research Studios model using a design-based research process, in the context of Design, Technology, and Research (DTR), a research community that applies Agile Research Studios to support 20+ learners working on more than 15 research projects at Northwestern University (NU).",

Research experiences greatly enhance student learning and development, broaden student participation, and retention in STEM fields, and provide numerous intellectual, personal, and professional benefits. Despite these benefits, the efficacy and scale of research training provided by an institution or research mentor is often limited by practical implementation and orchestration challenges. As research groups expand in size, faculty have less time and attention to mentor each student. Without sufficient mentoring and support, novice researchers can struggle to engage in core research activities such as creating research plans, forming research arguments, designing studies, and preparing manuscripts, and are often relegated to rote tasks. This can lead students to discount the value of research experiences and their own self-efficacy, resulting in fewer students participating in research and few receiving the promised benefits of research programs.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>To overcome these challenges, the PIs and team advanced a socio-technical cyberlearning model and system capable of training many novice researchers by reducing the orchestration burden on research mentors. Specifically, the project led to the development of Agile Research Studios (ARS), a new model for research training consisting of an integrated set of social structures, practices, and tools for planning research inquiry, seeking help, and practicing reflection that facilitate students learning to self-direct complex work within a community of researchers.

These skills are necessary for students to conduct authentic research that demands (1) self-directed research planning, monitoring, reflection, and replanning; and (2) adopting effective help-seeking and collaboration to overcome challenges. To support 20+ students developing such skills within a research learning community, ARS: (1) adapts agile work processes to research through 2-week sprints that cycle through the process of planning, progress making, and reflection to permit student researchers continual access to authentically situated learning opportunities; (2) provides venues for accessing mentors and peers across the studio who provide coaching and support across structured and unstructured interactions, both in-person and online; and (3) adopts and advances modern work and collaboration tools that facilitate learning in a networked learning community.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Our evaluation showed that the ARS model enables a single faculty researcher to mentor 20 or more students in independent research, while improving the quality of learning, producing research outcomes, and lowering the barrier to participation while increasing the number of students who receive authentic research training.
