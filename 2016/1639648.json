 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will develop and utilize capabilities for its scientists to \"drill down\" into abstract statistics about the flows of the atmosphere and ocean, to build a library of Notebooks with clear views of the actual weather systems (in the atmospheric part of the work) or Gulf of Mexico ocean eddies (in the ocean part of the work). The researchers will build this software, DRILSDOWN, using popular and powerful open-source software components that already exist, so it should be very generally applicable and have a long future. The power at the heart of the DRILSDOWN software will be the Integrated Data Viewer. The front end will consist of Jupyter Notebooks, a very popular new approach for literate computing and reproducibility of science. Literate computing allows a human-readable, meaningful, openly published document to have embedded computer-executable codes that can be repeated by anyone to replicate the results. The code can be adjusted if a user wants to see how analysis choices translate into outcomes. The involvement of scientists and a postdoc and and students will ensure the product development is useful to real research activities, while the collaboration with professional software developers (and the use of popular existing components) will ensure that it is robust and flexible enough to serve other ?use cases?, including researchers in other areas of geoscience.\r\n\r\nThe project will develop and utilize new software called DRILSDOWN to facilitate the linking of statistics to instances, a key step in the science of complex systems. In order to guide and stress test the software development, the team will perform novel atmospheric and oceanic science newly enabled by DRILSDOWN. In the atmosphere, they will study some distinct but related published measures of high-impact flow events variously classified as Rossby wave breaking (or potential vorticity filamentation) in the upper troposphere, or as poleward water vapor transports in the lower troposphere. Three-dimensional case studies will show the relationship between these low- and high-altitude descriptions, based on statistics of each measure which will allow us to select cases with high-low, low-high, and high-high measures. How do these different measures perform at characterizing these high impact events, and how might they be reconciled and perhaps optimized? In the ocean, similar activity will be to examine statistical characterizations of eddy shedding from the Loop Current in the Gulf of Mexico, an important current system for oil spills, hurricanes, fisheries, and other hazards and interests. Full-detail case studies of marginal cases (shedding/ non-shedding) will inform fundamental science understanding of the shedding process, as well as helping to improve the algorithms for objectively measuring it, so that large ensembles of possible ocean flow scenarios can be more effectively and rapidly screened, with realistic uncertainty quantification, for instance in the event of an incident requiring ocean forecasts.",
