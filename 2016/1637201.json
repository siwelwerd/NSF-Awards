 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non Technical: Changing of the seasons drives biological rhythms across the globe, from annual breeding seasons, to crop planting and harvest, to economics. Thus, disruptions to seasonal biology will have serious impacts on human health and well-being. Understanding how organisms respond to seasonality is a major goal of research spanning physiology, ecology, and behavior. We propose a symposium bringing together perspectives from each of these fields, with a particular focus on evolutionary responses to past and future changes in seasonality. Integrative research spanning sub disciplines has proven to deliver transformative discoveries in a way that narrowly focused research cannot. The proposed symposium will facilitate such integrative research by bringing together researchers from across fields, working on organisms ranging from plants to mammals, to synthesize the current state of knowledge on biological seasonality and to identify important gaps in knowledge and opportunities for cross-pollination across fields.\r\n\r\nTechnical: The symposium will be hosted at the January 2017 annual meeting of the Society of Integrative and Comparative Biology (SICB) in New Orleans, USA, and will produce manuscripts for an issue of the SICB journal Integrative and Comparative Biology (ICB). Prior to the conference, the organizers will remotely coordinate the drafting of a synthetic review paper by a group of participants. During the meeting, participants will present their own research and continue drafting the synthesis paper during a hosted workshop. This workshop will also serve to facilitate new, cross-disciplinary research. Finally, participants will publish their individual research alongside the review paper in a special issue of ICB.",

The symposium took place on 6 January 2017, and brought together 12 leading researchers who study the impacts of seasonal environments on the physiology, ecology and evolution of plants and animals. Seasonality is one of the most pronounced causes of environmental variation, and the seasons are changing rapidly making it difficult for organisms to adapt. It is vital that we understand how seasonality has shaped genetic, physiological, and ecological diversity, in order to predict how this diversity will change in future. Prior to the symposium, the 12 researchers met via videoconference calls and collaboratively identified the four most pressing questions in the field of evolutionary impacts of seasonality. During the symposium, researchers presented their current research towards addressing these questions. The following day, we held a complementary session of contributed talks from students and postdoctoral researchers, who were provided with travel grants to offset their costs and lower barriers to entry. During lunch on the day of the complementary session we held a lunch workshop that was open to all interested researchers from the symposium, the complementary session, and beyond. 35 people attended the workshop, with the goal of refining the four questions that were previously identified as being at the forefront of the field, and delineating an approach to addressing those questions on mid- and long-term timeframes. This generated a set of ideas and perspectives that broadly represented the community of researchers working on these problems. After the symposium and workshop, 11 of the 12 main symposium participants plus three interested workshop participants worked together to turn those four questions into a manuscript laying out the current state of the field, and directions forward.
