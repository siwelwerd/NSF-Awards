 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Discovery Research K-12 program (DRK-12) seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) for preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models, and tools. Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects. \r\n\r\nReadiness through Integrative Science and Engineering (RISE) is a late stage design and development project that will build upon the results of an earlier NSF-funded design and development study in which a co-construction process for curriculum development was designed by a team of education researchers with a small group of Head Start educators and parent leaders. In this phase, the design team will be expanded to include Classroom Coaches and Community Experts to enable implementation and assessment of the RISE model in a larger sample of Head Start classrooms. In this current phase, an iterative design process will further develop the science, technology, and engineering curricular materials as well continue to refine supports for teachers to access families' funds of knowledge related to science, technology, and engineering in order to build on children's prior knowledge as home-school connections. The ultimate goal of the project is to improve school readiness for culturally and linguistically diverse, urban-residing children from low-income families who tend to be underrepresented in curriculum development studies even though they are most at-risk for later school adjustment difficulties. The focus on science, technology, and engineering will address a gap in early STEM education.\r\n\r\nThe proposed group-randomized design, consisting of 90 teachers/classrooms (45 RISE/45 Control), will allow for assessment of the impact of a 2-year RISE intervention compared with a no-intervention control group. Year 1 will consist of recruitment, induction, and training of Classroom Coaches and Community Experts in the full RISE model, as well as preparation of integrative curricular materials and resources. In Year 2, participating teachers will implement the RISE curriculum approach supported by Classroom Coaches and Community Experts; data on teacher practice, classroom quality, and implementation fidelity will be collected, and these formative assessments will inform redesign and any refinements for Year 3. During Year 2, project-specific measures of learning for science, technology, and engineering concepts and skills will also be tested and refined. In Year 3, pre-post data on teachers (as in Year 2) as well as on 10 randomly selected children in each classroom (N = 900) will be collected. When child outcomes are assessed, multilevel modeling will be used to account for nesting of children in classrooms. In addition, several moderators will be examined in final summative analyses (e.g., teacher education, part or full-day classroom, parent demographics, implementation fidelity). At the end of this project, all materials will be finalized and the RISE co-construction approach will be ready for scale-up and replication studies in other communities.",

Unlike a prescriptive curriculum, the RISE approach was guided by a set of core principles based on a commitment to recognizing individual and collective strengths and experiential knowledge in classrooms, homes, and communities to create culturally inclusive curriculum (see McWayne et al., 2018b; McWayne et al., 2020a; McWayne et al., 2021a). To date, we have completed three phases of collaboration: 1) a curriculum and professional development phase, 2) an effectiveness study phase, and 3) piloting a sustainability and capacity building &ndash; phase (Figure 1). Below is a brief description of each phase.</p>\n<p>In <strong>Phase I</strong>, we documented and deepened teachers&rsquo; existing STE classroom practice and co-constructed with teachers a curriculum framework. The design of this framework incorporated the expertise of teachers, parents, and the researchers (see Figure 2). At the end of Phase I, researchers examined detailed records of all implementation and partnership activities (e.g., video recordings of every RISE meeting, meeting agendas, planning notes, and artifacts) to document the RISE Model of Co-construction (Figure 3; McWayne et al., 2020a). Data showed the process of co-construction was initiated by creating the right conditions through which mutually respectful relationships, trust, and relational capital were built; expertise of all partners was explicitly recognized and validated; and roles and authority were leveled to ensure all engaged as equal partners. Joint activities then became the core strategy of co-construction, because shared goals required partners to become attuned to each other&rsquo;s perspectives and negotiate shared understandings of goals and the agenda. Shared activities and goals then resulted in shifts (i.e., appropriation of new roles and new knowledge). The sequenced processes that constituted co-construction were manifested in both the HSC and STE components. Evidence from an external evaluation involving a quasi-experimental study showed the promise of RISE&rsquo;s ecological validity. Key outcomes included: 1) a comprehensive approach to Professional Development (PD) that consisted of hands-on PD Workshops, peer learning communities co-facilitated by a coach, bi-monthly 1:1 classroom coaching and a co-constructed STE curriculum framework aligned with the Next Generation Science Standards (National Research Council, 2012); 2) a Model of Co-construction (McWayne et al., 2020a); 3) articulation of a Home-to-School Approach (McWayne et al., 2018b; 2019); and 4) evidence suggesting that RISE improved teacher attitudes and classroom quality, based on self-report and observational data.</p>\n<p>In <strong>Phase II</strong> (2017-2020), we had two aims: 1) to refine and strengthen the home-school connection (HSC) supports for implementing culturally relevant STE learning activities (later deemed HSC+STE Integration); and 2) to increase the scalability of RISE by developing training resources for supporting future teachers in their practice around STE and engaging families. We increased the number of classrooms who participated through a process of random assignment to a RISE or Control condition (<em>n</em>=22; <em>n</em>=18, respectively). Results showed evidence for the effectiveness of RISE (McWayne et al., 2021a), including positive effects on teachers&rsquo; attitudes toward teaching science, their observed STE practices, their experience of PD, and their confidence in making home-school connections to enrich their STE curriculum. We also had evidence of implementation variability with respect to HSC+STE integration (Figure 4) and preliminary evidence that for classrooms with higher levels of cultural inclusion, families reported fewer cultural and relational barriers to their engagement in Head Start.</p>\n<p>We just concluded a pilot sustainability <strong>Phase III</strong>, which grew out of response to Phase II results. Presentations to ABCD directors and central administration spurred the idea to bring the co-construction and home-to-school approaches to their managers &ndash; namely, the Education Supervisors and Coaches representing the education arm, and the Family Community Engagement Supervisors (FCEs) representing the social service arm. Directors felt strongly that bridging these two sets of managers is important, because FCEs&rsquo; close relationships with families can be leveraged to gain access to families&rsquo; experiential knowledge, whereas coaches and education supervisors directly mentor teachers and have deep knowledge of the classrooms. This phase involved a total of eight full and half-day Professional Development workshops (PDs) held once per month from August 2021 through May 2022 with Head Start managers. The goal was to create an organizational shift from a largely school-to-home perspective of family engagement and curriculum toward a more culturally inclusive, home-to-school approach. We are currently in the process of analyzing survey and interview data that documented managers&rsquo; pre and post attitudes and beliefs about family engagement and curriculum integration, as well as their reflections about our PDs throughout the year. Further, Head Start managers will be presenting their year-long group projects to ABCD administrators and other Head Start teachers this Fall 2022, which they co-designed and implemented with Head Start teachers, family advocates, and families.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 08/11/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Christine&nbsp;Mcwayne</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1621161/1621161_10459173_1660159233888_Figure1Outcomes--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1621161/1621161_10459173_1660159233888_Figure1Outcomes--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1.
