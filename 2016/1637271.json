 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests continued support for the highly-successful Undergraduate ALFALFA Team (UAT), which has over the past 8 years provided research-based educational opportunities for 253 students closely collaborating with 25 faculty from a diverse range of universities.  Astronomy faculty from 20 institutions, predominantly small colleges in the northeast, carry out several related scientific programs that involve a radio survey of hydrogen in and around nearby galaxies.  They obtain new data at several observatories and analyze catalog data obtained at Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico.  Undergraduates will be intimately involved in all aspects of the scientific program, including planning and carrying out the observations. They will attend an annual workshop at either Green Bank Observatory or Arecibo Observatory. This program serves as a prime example of the value of scientific collaboration, particularly for faculty and students at isolated schools, and of the importance of research as a component of undergraduate education.  This exposure to front-line astronomical research enhances the educational infrastructure and the quality of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) at a large number of schools.  The program has an even wider impact through the curriculum and outreach materials they produce and share, and through broadening the participation of groups underrepresented in STEM.  Most students who go through the program continue in STEM-related careers.\r\n\r\nUAT projects will address major outstanding problems in astronomy and cosmology, such as the number and origin of optically-dark dwarf galaxies, the structure of large-scale filaments, pre-processing of HI gas outside clusters, and star formation in low-metallicity systems.  All of these programs are enabled by and make use of the ALFALFA (Arecibo Legacy Fast ALFA) HI survey, as well as new observations.  The main components of the program are (1) an annual workshop at either Arecibo Observatory or Green Bank Observatory; (2) observing runs at these and other radio and optical facilities; (3) summer and academic year undergraduate research projects; (4) collaborative research among faculty and students at the member schools.  The broader impact also has 4 main components: (1) enhancement of undergraduate education through direct involvement in research; (2) enhancement of educational infrastructure; (3) broad dissemination of curriculum and outreach materials; and (4) broadening participation of underrepresented groups.",

Riccardo Giovanelli and Martha Haynes at Cornell University, and its follow-up programs. The objective of the UAT is to provide opportunities to undergraduate students and faculty at undergraduate-focused institutions to develop expertise in observational radio observations and its motivating science. The UAT studies galaxies containing atomic hydrogen gas in the nearby Universe (within 750 million light years) using the national observatories Arecibo in Puerto Rico and Green Bank, in West Virginia.</p>\n<p><br />Under this grant, the UAT has developed a successful collaborative model to educate and train students and faculty from a diverse set of institutions as they investigate scientific questions about galaxy evolution, including the influence of a galaxy's environment on its star formation and gas content, the properties of gasrich, faint galaxies, and the properties of galaxies in the vicinity of a supercluster. Partnering with Arecibo and Green Bank Observatories, we have offered opportunties to undergraduates and faculty to attend undergraduate workshops at national observatories and, via the normal proposal and awarding of observing time, participate in galaxy observations. We have worked with more than 450 undergraduates and 26 faculty to date, including 8 workshops onsite at Arecibo (148 undergraduates) and 5 workshops onsite at Green Bank Observatory (111 undergraduates), observing runs onsite at Arecibo (111 undergraduates), remote observing runs on campus, undergraduate research projects (226 academic year and 254 summer projects), and presentation of results by students and faculty at national meetings such as the AAS.</p>\n<p>The annual workshop fosters interactions and collaborative learning with faculty mentors, peers at other institutions, observatory staff, and ALFALFA scientists via lectures, observing sessions, and group work. Few undergraduates have opportunities to visit a national observatory, particularly a radio astronomy observatory. Tours and workshop observing sessions allow the students to gain an understanding of radio astronomy<br />observations that they would not have achieved working in isolation at their home institutions. The workshop experience inspires further research participation by students: more than 80% of workshop attendees carried out a summer or academic year project and more than 40% were involved in more than one project. During COVID, the UAT offered a 6-week daily workshop summer experience via zoom, allowing many faculty and students to interact virtually around science projects at a time when many undergraduates could not otherwise participate in summer research.</p>\n<p>The UAT has extended research opportunities to undergraduates who otherwise would not be able to participate in science research.&nbsp; Under this collaborative grant to St. Lawrence University (SLU), three undergraduate students have been able to travel to Arecibo and Green Bank Observatories, participate in on-site and remote observations of galaxies with the Arecibo and Green Bank Telescopes, analyze the observational data using software housed and maintained on observatory servers, and participate in the scientific analysis of those data leading to publications in the astronomical literature.</p>\n<p>Of the three St. Lawrence University students, two were females, one of whom was a first-generation college student and the other was from an underrepresented group in STEM.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>During the Covid-19 summers of 2020 and 2021, one student had financial and logistical support (including computers at home and at SLU) to conduct astronomical research.&nbsp; In the summer of 2022, three students&nbsp; were supported at SLU doing astronomical research.&nbsp; They presented posters and talks on their experiences and accomplisments to the UAT faculty and students, the public at SLU, participants in the McNair Scholars Program (remotely), and other undergraduates at SLU.&nbsp; Their enthusiasm got other students interested in research in their own fields as well as astronomy.</p>\n<p>Through the UAT, the SLU faculty were able to engage in astronomical observing and research at a level difficult to maintain with the high teaching loads of a small liberal-arts college.&nbsp; The additional computing resources, travel support, and engagement with colleagues and students continues to enhance their knowledge of cutting-edge astronomical observing, data analysis, and theory.&nbsp; They then bring more understanding of astronomy and more enthusiasm for research into all their interactions with students in classes and laboratories than they could maintian with a strictly independent research program.&nbsp; Thus this grant enhances the education of all SLU students and faculty, not just those directly involved.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 11/30/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Aileen&nbsp;A&nbsp;O'donoghue</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1637271/1637271_10461174_1669840349797_StLawrenceUAstronomersAtGreenBank--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1637271/1637271_10461174_1669840349797_StLawrenceUAstronomersAtGreenBank--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"St. Lawrence University Astronomers at UAT Summer Workshop at the Green Bank Observatory\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1637271/1637271_10461174_1669840349797_StLawrenceUAstronomersAtGreenBank--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"St. Lawrence University Astronomers at UAT Summer Workshop at the Green Bank Observatory\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Faculty O'Donoghue (center) and Miller (right) with students Karasinski ('24, left), Perkins ('22, 2nd from left), and Reyes ('25, 2nd from right) on the grounds of the Green Bank Observatory with the Green Bank Telescope used in UAT observations of supernova-hosting galaxies in the background.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Jeff Miller</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Aileen&nbsp;A&nbsp;O'donoghue</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">St. Lawrence University Astronomers at UAT Summer Workshop at the Green Bank Observatory</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1637271/1637271_10461174_1669842409519_2022WorkshopFullGroup--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1637271/1637271_10461174_1669842409519_2022WorkshopFullGroup--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"UAT Summer 2022 Workshop Participants at the Green Bank Observatory\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1637271/1637271_10461174_1669842409519_2022WorkshopFullGroup--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"UAT Summer 2022 Workshop Participants at the Green Bank Observatory\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The full group of 12 stuents and 6 faculty participants at the Summer 2022 UAT Workshop.
