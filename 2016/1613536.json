 "awd_abstract_narration": "Globular clusters are groups of hundreds of thousands of stars.  There are more than 100 globular clusters orbiting our Milky Way galaxy.  The atomic elements found in stars in globular clusters retain the chemical fingerprints of the earliest generations of stars. These elements offer a glimpse into the ways that nature formed stars in the early Universe and produced the heavy elements (iron, uranium, etc.) like those found on Earth today. This investigator will collect and interpret new observational data on trace elements found in five globular clusters.  These clusters were formed prior to the assembly of our galaxy. \r\n\r\nAbundance variations among the heavy elements may signal another expression of the multiple populations phenomenon in globular clusters. These variations are not predicted by current models of globular cluster formation and evolution. New optical spectroscopy data collected using the M2FS spectrograph at the Magellan Telescopes will settle the issue. The investigator will perform observations that will conclusively confirm or refute previous ideas based on lower-quality spectroscopic data. If confirmed, the community will gain a new tool to guide models of globular cluster formation and evolution. If refuted, the community may refocus its efforts to develop models that fully explain the chemical and dynamical properties of globular clusters in the Milky Way.\r\n\r\nThis project will also result in the development of a new introductory course that explores the connections between heavy elements forged in ancient stars and the nuclear weapons that have shaped global politics over the last few generations. This course would reach a broad audience of undergraduates at the University of Michigan, including many students who are not majoring in one of the STEM disciplines. The course will introduce students to the role of science in the public arena, articulated specifically through the compelling story of how stardust from ancient supernovae became the key ingredient in the nuclear arms race. This will increase scientific literacy, enhance public engagement with science and technology, and improve the preparedness of future leaders.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n \n\nThe principle investigator, Dr. Ian Roederer, has completed work on the NSF-funded program, \"A Focused Test of Whether Neutron-Capture Elements Are Another Expression of the Multiple Populations Phenomenon in Globular Clusters.\"  Understanding the formation and evolution of globular clusters is a major challenge in modern astronomy.  The chemical composition of stars within globular clusters reveals that these are complex systems.  Studies typically rely on relatively light elements, like oxygen or sodium, to probe and try to make sense of this complexity.  This program, however, attempts to probe that complexity using the heaviest elements on the periodic table, like barium or europium.  These elements are produced by a process called the r-process.  Here, three key \"intellectual merit\" and \"broader impacts\" outcomes from the project are highlighted.  \n\nSome Milky Way stars have relatively high levels of the heaviest elements found in nature.  One study examined the environments where these stars were born.  It showed for the first time that r-process enhanced stars are members of the Milky Way halo, and that they were born in dwarf galaxies, rather than globular clusters.  Later, the stars were added to the halo when their parent dwarf galaxies were torn apart by gravitational interactions with the Milky Way.  This work was published in the peer-reviewed Astronomical Journal and presented at several scientific conferences.\n\nAnother study examined stars that may be the remains of a globular cluster that was torn apart by the gravitational interactions with the Milky Way.  If true, this globular cluster would have been unlike any globular cluster known today.  The heavy-element content of its stars, commonly referred to as \"metallicity,\" is much lower than any other globular cluster.  The elements produced by the r-process are also present at levels unlike any known globular cluster.  This result suggests there may be an undiscovered population of globular cluster remnants hiding in the Milky Way halo.  This work was published in the peer-reviewed Astrophysical Journal and presented at a scientific conference.\n\nA new introductory-level undergraduate course, called \"Stars and the Atomic Age,\" was also developed as part of this program.  This course invites students, particularly non-STEM majors, to consider the connections between stars, nuclear weapons, and the search for life in the Universe.  The course materials are freely available for download online.\n\nIn addition, 14 other peer-reviewed publications were produced, one undergraduate student's research training was supported, one graduate student was trained to conduct astronomical observations at the Magellan Telescopes, and 10 talks were presented at scientific conferences and university seminars for astronomers and physicists.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/25/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Ian U Roederer"
