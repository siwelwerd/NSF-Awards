The intent is to strengthen the network among participants and leverage learning from the Cincinnati Strive experience with collective impact across the Midwest and beyond.\r\n\r\nResults from the NextLivesHere:  Social Change Innovation Summit, will be disseminated in the tri-state region through the Greater Cincinnati STEM Collaborative (GCSC and the Ohio STEM Learning Network (OSLN).  National dissemination will occur through informal and formal STEM professional organizations and publications as well as through participation in the NSF-developed national backbone organization.",

This was done by incorporating  the framework of collective impact and backbone organization development  into a deep dive case-study of collective impact work being done in  Cincinnati. Experts and practitioners were engaged in a series of design  sessions to recognize issues, discuss implications, and identify  solutions for &ldquo;wicked problems&rdquo; in backbone development.

Nine different partners with over 10 years of experience in collective  impact came together to create a different type of conference; a  conference that actively immersed a cross-sector group in the real work  of what it takes to listen, understand, dream, argue, and create a  different outcome for our children and our community! The conference  worked to achieve desired societal outcomes by equipping a broad  audience (local experts, national experts, and practitioners) to create a  conception of a viable backbone organization that can support  collective impact to increase representation in STEM education and  careers.
