 "awd_abstract_narration": "Plant growth is crucial to agriculture, with important implications for yields of traditional agricultural crops and for production of biomass for biofuels.  At the cellular level, plant growth involves two distinct processes, cell division, which produces new cells, and cell expansion, which increases the size of the cells.  During division, the cell doubles its DNA content and subsequently the cell divides to form two cells, a process known as the mitotic cell cycle.  During the cell expansion phase of growth, many plant cells continue a modified version of the cell cycle, in which the DNA content doubles but the cell does not divide.  Examples of economically important cell types that double their DNA without division include cereal endosperm, cotton fibers, and nitrogen-fixing symbiotic nodules in legumes.  In addition, this process plays important roles in cell differentiation, and is essential for nitrogen fixation in legume root nodules, but the detailed mechanism of this modified cell cycle remains poorly understood.  A protein (known as SIM) has been identified that functions as an inhibitor of cell division, but allows DNA replication.  The goal of this project is to understand how SIM regulates the balance between division and DNA replication during plant growth.  The project will also play a role in the education of graduate students and undergraduates from diverse backgrounds, will test the effectiveness of the film as a classroom teaching tool, both in learning course content, and on student attitudes towards science, and will train undergraduates in mathematical modeling for the biological sciences.\r\n\r\nThe SIAMESE (SIM) gene encodes a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor that blocks mitosis without blocking DNA replication.  Although SIM is clearly plays a key role in the transition from mitotic growth to endoreplication, the control of the G2/M transition in plants is complex, and many questions remain about how endoreplication is established, and the role of SIM and related proteins in this process.  The proposed work will use a combination of molecular genetic manipulations, live cell imaging and mathematical modeling to test specific hypotheses about the role of SIM and the related SMR proteins in the mitosis/endocycle transition.  The Specific Objectives of this proposal are to answer the following questions: Can a combination of mathematical modeling, genetic and cell biological experiments be used to create a coherent model of inhibition of G2/M during the transition to endocycles? How is degradation of SIM protein regulated?  Do SIM or other SMRs play a role in controlling progression through G2 during the regular mitotic cycle?",

The goal of this project was to understand how SIM regulates the balance between mitotic division and cell expansion during plant growth.  SIM is the founding member of a large family of related cell division regulators called SMRs, that inhibit cell division in response to a wide variety of developmental and environmental signals.  The overall goal of our project was to use a combination of genetics, live cell imaging and computational modeling of plant cell division to understand specifically how SIM and other SMRs regulate cell division in plants.\n\n            The cell division cycle (cell cycle) is regulated by enzymes called cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), that in conjunction with partner proteins called cyclins, control the transitions between phases of the cell cycle.  The SIM protein binds to CDKs inhibits CDK function to specifically block mitotic division without blocking other stages of the cell cycle, such as DNA replication.  However, plants have several types of CDKs that play different roles in the cell cycle, and there has been some controversy about which exact CDKs are the targets of inhibition by SIM in living plants.  A major aim of our work was to identify the specific CDKs targeted by SIM.  Our work clearly showed that SIM inhibits two specific types of CDKs in living plants, and identified key functional regions of the SIM protein, clarifying our understanding of both SIM function and of the cell cycle in general.  The most significant part of these results were published in two papers in the journal Plant Physiology, which are two of the eight publications resulting from the award. \n\n            A second aim of the proposed work was to test the prediction of a computational model of the plant cell cycle that SIM and other SMRs are able to regulate the length of the normal mitotic cell cycle, in addition to their role in arresting cell division.
