 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supports a Postdoctoral Research Fellow to study the formation and growth of small particles in an environmental chamber.  There is significant interest in the formation of small particles in the atmosphere from volatile plant emissions such as isoprene.  Measurements in the laboratory will help to quantify the probability of such gas phase species forming aerosol mass in the atmosphere. \r\n\r\nA key approach for understanding the formation of secondary organic aerosols (SOAs) from isoprene is to study the uptake kinetics of epoxide species such as dihydroxyl epoxides (IEPOX) and methacrylic acid epoxide (MAE) on aerosol particles.  Chamber studies will be performed at varying relative humidity (RH) values to explore the effects of viscosity on reactive uptake.  This research will also examine the evolution of particle chemical composition as a function of viscosity both qualitatively and quantitatively through mass spectroscopic techniques.  Results obtained from this research will improve models used in climate studies, air quality assessment, epidemiology, and other areas of environmental health that can affect public policy related to climate change and public health.",

Isoprene-derived SOA is one of the important sources of PM in many parts of the world. Studies have shown that isoprene-derived SOA can account for up to 40% of the total PM in the Southeast U.S. The likelihood of isoprene&nbsp;epoxydiols&nbsp;(IEPOX) reacting with ambient particles to form secondary organic aerosols (SOA) is derived in this study, which is defined as the reactive uptake coefficient (&gamma;<sub>IEPOX</sub>).&nbsp;&gamma;<sub>IEPOX</sub>is an important parameter for accurately modeling the amount of isoprene-derived SOA in the air and estimating these important effects of PM. In this study,&nbsp;&gamma;<sub>IEPOX&nbsp;</sub>for inorganic acidic sulfate particles is derived to be 2*10<sup>-2</sup>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>However, ambient PM is complicated in composition and often does not exist in pure form. To solve this issue, this study also coated the inorganic acidic sulfate particles with atmosphere-relevant secondary organic materials that are derived from&nbsp;four types of common precursors.

Figure 1 shows that even when the organic coating is 15 nm,&nbsp;&gamma;<sub>IEPOX&nbsp;</sub>could drop up to one order of magnitude. Our team is the first research group to conduct such study of IEPOX uptake with authentic SOA coatings, and we also work with the modeling team to implement the results into regional and global models to better simulate the effects of the organic coating on heterogeneous reactions.

Therefore, this study also derived the phase state of organic coatings at different relative humidity (RH) and composition. The multivariant and box models were used to derive a generalized relationship for better prediction of the isoprene-derived SOA in regional and global models.&nbsp;Figure 2 shows that as the most sensitive region to heterogeneous chemistry is when the viscosity of the SOA is in the range of 10<sup>3&nbsp;</sup>Pa s&nbsp;to 10<sup>5&nbsp;</sup>Pa s.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>(3) The chemical composition of the organic coatings and their effects on isoprene-derived SOA formation are also derived from this study. Figure 3 shows that as the O:C ratio of the SOA increases, the percent of IEPOX-derived SOA also increases because SOA becomes more hygroscopic and is easy for IEPOX to diffuse through.&nbsp;The current method provides a practical way to estimate the effects of aerosol phase states on SOA formation by using common instruments deployed in field campaigns, such as Aerosol Mass Spectrometer (AMS) or Aerosol Chemical Speciation Monitor (ACSM).</p>\n<p>(4) This study also used the experimental results to explain field measurements and estimate the effects of SOA coating on isoprene-derived SOA in the Southeast U.S.&nbsp;To further understand the impacts of pre-existing SOA coatings on the reactive uptake of IEPOX, the ambient data collected from the 2013 SOAS campaign were used for model estimations. A comparison of IEPOX-derived SOA with and without an organic coating, together with diurnal RH variations based on field measurements made during the 2013 SOAS campaign at the Centerville, AL ground site is shown in Figure 4. The results show that IEPOX-derived SOA would have increased by 16-27% without considering the effect of pre-existing monoterpene SOA coatings during this time period.
