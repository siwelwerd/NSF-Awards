 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI will study mathematical models which describe the swelling and shrinking of fluid-saturated, elastic, porous media (elastic solids) and the interactions between the fluid and the elastic porous structures. The significance of the research is due to the fact that many natural substances, e.g., rocks, soils, and even biological tissues, as well as man-made materials such as foams, gels, concrete, and ceramics are such elastic porous media. Thus, research findings will be applicable in a multitude of areas (biomechanics, pharmacology, energy technology, geomechanics, geophysics, and materials science). The models developed can be used to describe various man-made materials and manufacturing processes. They can also be used to model the biomechanics of soft tissues and biological porous media, enabling the modeling and optimization of new therapies, development of new diagnostics tools, and advancing our understanding of human physiology. This research will also improve our capability to model, analyze, and assess the environmental impact of processes associated with hydraulic fracturing, wastewater injection, and carbon capture and storage, and activities associated with production of geothermal energy. Graduate and undergraduate students will be trained and will participate in the work. Research findings, and experience from it, will be incorporated into the graduate and undergraduate curricula.\r\n\r\nThis research focuses on mathematical and computational issues arising in continuum models of poroelasticity and electroporoelasticity. These provide a unified and systematic treatment of various porous materials and processes which arise in diverse areas of science and engineering and a variety of applications. Additional physical phenomena, such as the electromechanical response of the medium, as well as chemical and/or thermal effects, may also be accounted for. Thus, poroelasticity, electroporoelasticity, or even electro-chemo-thermo-poroelasticity, are all complex coupled, multiphysics, multiscale, phenomena, where the swelling and shrinking of an elastic or viscoelastic deforming porous medium is coupled to the electromechanical (and/or the thermal, and chemical) response of the medium and saturating fluid. Poroelasticity also involves multiple scales; the micro-scale corresponding to the molecular scale, and the scale of continuum mechanics, the macro-scale. The PI will develop mathematical and computational tools and study, analytically and computationally, various mathematical problems arising in poroelasticity. Among the issues considered will be the well posedness of mathematical pde models and the derivation and analysis of efficient and accurate numerical algorithms for approximating solutions of these partial differential equations.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe work carried out with support from this grant involved the analytical and numerical studies (analysis and numerical analysis) of the equations of electroporoelasticity and the training of a Ph.D. student.  The work advances our capabilities to model and computationally simulate complex, multiphysics phenomena. \n\nThe equations of quasistatic electroporoelasticity are used to describe the interaction of fluid motion, electromagnetic fields, and forces, and their effect on elastic porous material, in particular the mechanical behavior (swelling and shrinking) of fluid-saturated porous media.  The swelling and shrinking of an elastic porous medium are coupled to the electro-mechanical response of the medium and that of the fluid.  These effects are used in electroseismic prospecting and may also be used to develop  new medical imaging technologies. \n\nIn electroporoelasticity electromagnetic waves and mechanical (acoustic) waves are coupled through the electrokinetics phenomenon. Ions in the pore fluid interact with ions in the pore walls creating an electrical double layer.  In the presence of electromagnetic fields this creates movement of the fluid and solid matrix and conversely movement of the fluid and solid matrix induces an electromagnetic wave.\n\nAfter formulating the equations (a system of partial differential equations) which describe quasistatic electroporoelasticity, the equations were studied analytically and the problem was shown to be well posed.  That is, it was shown that the equations have a solution, and furthermore, that under a certain condition, that is satisfied by real-world materials, the solution is unique.\n\nA numerical algorithm, based on the finite element method, for the numerical simulation of quasistatic electroporoelasticity phenomenon was devised.  The algorithm was studied analytically, in particular, it was show that the discrete equations (the computer model) have a solution, and that the solution is unique whenever the original partial differential equations have a unique solution.  Furthermore, error estimates were derived and it was shown that the approximate solutions converge to exact solutions of the problem.   The numerical method was implemented and tested on some model problems.\n\nTraining future applied mathematicians is of critical importance.  The grant partially supported a Ph.D. student, advised by the PI.  The student completed his Ph.D. and defended his dissertation which was based on the work performed.  The student participated in the analytical work, and in the design of the numerical method.  He implemented the finite element algorithm for simulating such electroporoelasticity phenomenon on a supercomputer class computer and tested the method on some model problems.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/12/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Amnon J Meir"
