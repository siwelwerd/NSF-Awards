ILs are considered green solvents because of their low volatility, but also have unique and tunable properties that allow them to be used in applications where few alternatives are available, such as the solubilization and catalytic conversion of lignocellulosic biomass to commodity chemicals.  Recently, molecular and nanometer-scale structural and dynamic features of ILs have been identified that indicate coexisting domains of both charge and polarity, which may explain why they are able to dissolve amphiphilic polymers, such as cellulose and lignin. Introducing a surface leads to density and charge layering at the interface giving rise to oscillatory surface forces and the ability to precisely tune surface properties.  The proposed work focuses on tuning these surface properties for ILs in contact with metal complexes confined in nanopores to provide a local environment for high catalytic performance and stability.  Nanoporous supports provide control in localizing a catalyst, creating a distinct environment for tuning reactivity and controlling the partitioning of substrates, reactants and products. This project will translate the unique local solvent and layered electronic properties of confined ILs to heterogeneous catalysis, addressing the major limitations of the commercial applications of ILs. The relationship between the solvent environment in the confined pore and the corresponding catalytic activity will be applied to challenging aqueous-based catalysis.\r\n\r\nThe dehydration of D-glucose to 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) will be used as a model reaction. The following tasks are proposed: (1) Construction, characterization and control the local environment of ionic liquids and tethered imidazolium-based ionic liquids in nanoscale pores as a function of pore size. Surfactant templated silica thin films with oriented, tunable nanopores (2-20 nm) will serve as the platform for characterization of the local environment and subsequent catalysis in ionic liquids. (2) Design of IL/metal ligands and their corresponding silanes to translate homogeneous catalysis in ILs to effective, stable heterogeneous catalysts in nanoscale pores. The dehydration of glucose to HMF using non-toxic aluminum-based catalysts will be investigated, with a goal of improving its catalytic performance to make it a viable alternative to traditional toxic catalysts. (3) Demonstration of the catalysis of glucose to HMF from the aqueous phase and development of a confined IL pore environment that minimizes catalyst deactivation and leaching due to water uptake.\r\n\r\nThe proposed research project has the potential to generate innovative green/sustainable chemistry and engineering technologies for a broad range of applications in catalysis, energy storage, photovoltaics, gas separations, and carbon dioxide capture.  Multi-faceted plans to develop a video-based communication program (video-CATS) are included, which will train students on how to communicate science for the benefit of society to a diverse audience.",
