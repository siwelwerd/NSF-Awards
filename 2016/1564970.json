 "awd_abstract_narration": "This National Science Foundation (NSF) Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (S-STEM) project at Randolph College in Lynchburg, Virginia will provide scholarships for talented, low-income students pursuing bachelor's degrees with a major in a physical science, engineering, or mathematics. In addition to scholarships, the program will provide academic support to increase persistence and degree completion. Project efforts will include an intensive summer transition program; a seminar series through the four years of college; enhanced tutoring services in a living-learning community; peer, faculty, and industry mentoring program; and enhanced access to internships and research opportunities. The project will also conduct research to help determine the most effective way to utilize mentors from industry in helping to support student degree completion. Scholarships and support for academically strong low-income students, who may not otherwise be able to afford college, will help to produce a well-trained workforce that will contribute to the economic vitality of Virginia and the nation.\r\n\r\nThis project will advance understanding of the role of living-learning communities, research participation and use of mentors from industry to increase retention and degree attainment in STEM majors. Mentoring will be a particular subject of study. While the value of mentoring is well accepted, a majority of prior work in this area focuses on peer or faculty mentors. The project at Randolph College will study mentoring of undergraduates by industry professionals. The study will attempt to assess factors impacting students' potential for mentoring and will develop effective models for structuring the mentoring experience with mentors from industry. The findings that emerge from the program will be disseminated widely to the STEM education community and will help to increase understanding of the attributes and practices of successful student scholarship and support programs.",
