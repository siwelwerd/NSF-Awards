 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) and Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF) Programs, Professor L. Robert Baker from Ohio State University (OSU) and colleagues Umit Ozkan, Gerald Frankel, Anne Co and David Cole have acquired an X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS) which operates at near ambient pressures instead of the more usual high-vacuum operation of standard XPS. These instruments use X-rays to eject electrons from surfaces. The electrons are detected and analyzed to identify the elemental and chemical composition of such surfaces. This surface-sensitive probe is used to study electronic devices, batteries, fuel cells, sensors, corrosion, materials degradation, catalytic reactions and geochemistry. It serves the need in academia and industry to probe chemical details of solid and liquid surfaces under chemically-relevant conditions. The instrument is used by researchers at OSU and about a dozen regional institutions including industries and institutions serving underrepresented minorities in STEM fields. This participation generates a significant regional impact. Undergraduate and graduate students are trained to use the instrument in research projects, laboratory coursework and workshops. \r\n\r\nThe award is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels at OSU, especially in areas such as: (a) studying solid electrolyte interphase and interfacial ion solvation, (b) probing catalysis, electrocatalysis, and solid oxide fuel cells, (c) analyzing materials degradation and corrosion, and (d) studying earth science and geochemistry.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is a surface sensitive probe that is both element- and oxidation-state specific.   Accordingly, XPS has been widely used to study catalysis and electrocatalysis, materials degradation, corrosion, geochemistry, and electronic devices and sensors.  However, a major limitation of traditional XPS is that this technique operates in ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) due to the short mean free path of photoelectrons.  Consequently, it has been extremely difficult to study surfaces under the high-pressure conditions necessary to understand processes relevant to catalysis, corrosion, geochemistry, sensing, or materials and device failure.  Recent developments have shown that a multi-stage differential pumping system equipped with a series of electromagnetic lenses makes it possible to efficiently collect photoelectrons from surfaces exposed to pressures up to 20 mbar.  This technique, known as near ambient pressure (NAP) XPS, represents a 1010-fold pressure increase relative to traditional UHV XPS experiments.  This technique is now enabling the study of surfaces and interfaces under chemically relevant conditions.  \n\nIn this instrumentation project a NAP-XPS instrument was acquired and installed at Ohio State University.  This instrument is equipped with an in-situ cell and differential pumping system that allows samples to be exposed to controlled gas environments up to 20 mbar. The in-situ cell also allows control of sample temperature to &gt;600 &deg;C.  This instrument has been successfully integrated into the OSU Surface Analysis Laboratory, where it is an integral part of this open-access user facility.  As such it is accessible to all academic departments at Ohio State University as well as other academic and industrial institutions.  This instrument is managed by a full-time PhD scientist with extensive experience in NAP-XPS measurements.  A website has been put in place for publicizing instrument capabilities and accepting applications from internal and external users.  \n\nThis NAP-XPS instrument is currently being utilized by a number of users to study topics ranging from CO2reduction and H2O oxidation electrocatalysis, ethanol steam reforming on Ni catalysts, hydrochlorination on Pd catalysts, chemical stability of lead halide perovskites, and chemically induced spin state switching in Co3Fe2molecular magnets.  \n\nThe proposed research and outreach activities of this project have been impacted by restrictions on research and teaching resulting from COVID-19.  These include university travel bans, lab shutdowns, and transition to online and/or hybrid methods of instruction.  Despite these restrictions, the NAP-XPS instrument is providing transformative new research capabilities, and we anticipate this facility will continue to display significant regional and national impacts on research and education as restrictions are lifted and additional users, especially student users, gain access to these unique capabilities.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/13/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Lawrence R Baker"
