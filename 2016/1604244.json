 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports research in general relativity theory, and related problems in mathematical astrophysics, in which strong gravitational fields play an interesting role. The general scope of this research includes problems in gravitational astrophysics in which insights from analytical, applied, and computational mathematics can be used to help interpret gravitational waves detections by Advanced LIGO. In particular, the projects supported here will improve our understanding of neutron star collisions, providing insights into the nuclear composition of such objects. They will also study the impact of solving the Einstein equations, which govern the dynamics of black holes and neutron stars, in spacetimes of different geometrical characteristics. \r\n\r\nThe research projects can be grouped in three specific areas: neutron star physics, gravitational-wave data analysis, and numerical relativity. These studies will allow observations of neutron stars and our understanding of strong gravitational fields to be used to determine the neutron-star equation of state in a way that is free from any assumptions about the microphysics of neutron star matter.  They will also help the gravitational wave simulation community determine the accuracy of their waveform models that play an essential role in detecting and interpreting astrophysical gravitational wave signals. The studies in numerical relativity described here involve developing techniques for solving Einstein's equations on manifolds with arbitrary spatial topologies.  These methods will be used to study a variety of problems, including an effort to explore the gravitational analog of the turbulent cascade seen in fluid systems, and exploring cosmological models numerically to determine whether and how non-trivial topology could be recognized through observations.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project has studied three different areas of gravitational physics: 1) The development of numerical methods that can be used to solve the equations of gravitational physics on the computer; 2) The analysis of data analysis methods and data itself from the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Observatory (LIGO); and 3) The gravitational aspects of neutron stars.  The particular contributations from this project were published in eight refereed papers in the scientific literature.  These papers dealt with a variety of technical issues, including the development of new more efficient ways to represent the gravitational and electromagnetic fields in numerical models of our universe, and the formal proof of the conditions needed to prevent the formation of a certain type of singularity (shock waves) in one of the widely used representations of Einstein's gravitational field equation.  Work was also done on a the development of minimum quality standards for the theoretical model gravitational waveforms that are used as part of the data analysis process for LIGO.  This project also supported the beginning of a search for gravitational wave signals in the publicly available LIGO data that may be emitted by nearby rotating neutron stars.  This project also developed new more efficient and physically appropriate representations of the properties of matter within the centers of neutron stars.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/07/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Lee Lindblom"
