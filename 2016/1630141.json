 "awd_abstract_narration": "Doctoral candidate Ryan Lash, of Northwestern University, along with colleagues in the US and Ireland, will undertake research to study how the adaptation of ritual heritage contributes to the sustainability of marginal communities. The commemoration of shared heritage through the maintenance of traditional rituals and material culture is often an important means for communities ? both past and present - to maintain integration and identity.  Nevertheless, most approaches to sustainability in the past focus on environmental and demographic factors while placing little emphasis on considerations of community commemoration and cooperation. By focusing on the material realities of community life over long time frames, archaeology is especially poised to build comprehensive accounts of sustainability that consider how the challenges of social integration and environmental adaptation are entangled. How do communities adapt their traditions and maintain solidarity as they undergo major transformations in subsistence practices and political economy? How can people deploy old practices to make new forms of social organization possible? By investigating what contributed to community sustainability in the past, social scientists can better address parallel challenges in the present. In particular, this research can inform strategies of heritage maintenance among indigenous or other marginalized communities undergoing economic transformations that threaten their ways of life and continued existence. \r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Lash and his research team will investigate how members of a small island community adapted the monuments and practices of a ritual tradition as the community underwent major transformations in agriculture, political economy, and demographics in the 18th to 20th centuries. Previous scholarship suggests that ritual practices can foster shared heritage and identity by maintaining monuments from the past as places of collective access and commemoration. From c. 1750-1960, islanders on Inishark in western Ireland visited a series of monuments as part of annual ritual processions dedicated to St Leo. Scattered around islanders? houses and field plots, these monuments were remnants of a monastery abandoned centuries earlier. To assess the impact of this ritual tradition on community sustainability, research will trace how the use, abandonment, renovation, and destruction of ritual monuments corresponds across time with transitions in village agriculture, landholding, and demographics. Combining oral history, archival documents, and excavation of four monuments will reconstruct the changing practices and spatial dynamics of the ritual tradition. Results will test common assumptions about the capacity of heritage maintenance to support political economic formations by structuring community members? movements and commemorations. A research team of American, Irish, and local collaborators will generate a dataset that will enhance archaeological analyses of sustainability and inform local initiatives that incorporate archaeological heritage as a key cultural and economic resource.",

To find answers, this archaeological research project examined the island of Inishark, set five miles off the coast of western Ireland. Between AD 1780 and 1960, a village community endured on Inishark despite political marginalization, economic hardship and transformation, blights of famine, and an unforgiving maritime environment. This research tested the hypothesis that islanders' maintenance of a pilgrimage tradition centered on the remains of an early medieval monastery (AD 700-1300) fostered community identity, heritage, and solidarity in the face of these challenges. Folklore accounts refer to 14 monuments on the island visited in annual pilgrimages as part of islanders' veneration of Saint Leo. To examine the relationship between ritual tradition and community organization, this study traced how islanders' interactions with pilgrimage monuments changed across time with transformations to the social and economic circumstances of the village community.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>NSF funding supported the excavation of five pilgrimage monuments during the summers of 2016 and 2017, as well as the essential work of cataloging, analyzing, and curating discovered artifacts. This research produced a series of important results. Excavations at pilgrimage monuments venerated in the 19<sup>th</sup>-20<sup>th</sup> century uncovered a number of rare, early medieval artifacts, such as carved cross-slabs and inscribed stones. These discoveries confirm that pilgrimage monuments were initially constructed c. AD 700-1300 and remained periodically revisited for centuries later. Excavations at a stone hut called Clochan Leo uncovered numerous layers of activity, beginning with early medieval carved stone (AD 700-1100s) and followed by temporary hearths, glass bottles, and ceramic drinking and serving vessels related to periodic pilgrimage activity between c. AD 1650 and 1960. These finds indicate that pilgrimage monuments were dynamic places that accumulated the material traces of activities over many centuries. As such, they could act as potent reminders of a deep heritage. While curating old objects was a vital component of the pilgrimage tradition, some objects were lost and forgotten across time. Indeed, islanders venerated some pilgrimage monuments throughout the history of the village, while others fell out of use or were even destroyed in the course of building new houses and field walls. The dis-use and destruction of ritual monuments increased particularly as the village transitioned from a system of collective landholding and agriculture to one based on private ownership by individual households. This suggests that pilgrimage monuments acted as important markers and mediums of shared heritage when collective action was most vital to the village's subsistence. In the last decades of the 1800s, the focus of communal ritual switched to a newly refurbished church building, in which visiting priests could hold mass once a month. Islanders then focused their venerations on only a few major pilgrimage monuments in areas removed from agricultural land claimed by individual households. In short, islanders adapted the pilgrimage tradition to accommodate changes to the village's social and economic organization.</p>\n<p>This study has important implications for understandings of the role of heritage (i.e. monuments, traditions, and ideas about the past) in creating and maintaining social relations amidst change and adversity. Political projects often justify themselves by citing continuity with the past or renewal of a disappearing heritage. Rather than a pristine relic of the medieval past, the pilgrimage tradition on Inishark was a dynamic heritage that islanders modified to negotiate new circumstances. In other words, pilgrimage monuments were vital to community sustainability not because they prevented social change, but because they offered islanders mediums to re-negotiate the past and their community relations in the face of change. The archaeology of Inishark thus has significance for contemporary heritage resource management. Results of this study may inform strategies of heritage management aimed at fostering communal solidarity and sustainability among small rural communities in the wake of wider social transitions that limit traditional subsistence and economic opportunities.
