 "awd_abstract_narration": "The team will assemble optical and infrared observations of hundreds of thousands of galaxies.  The observations pick out galaxies about 10 to 12 billion years back in time.  This period is known to be one of hectic change for galaxies.  The team will study how these changes depend on whether a galaxy has many neighbors, or no neighbors at all.  This important topic could not be studied before because not enough observations were available.  The team will release their assembled catalog to the public.  Senior team members will train junior members.  The team will give public talks, offer residential workshops to teachers and develop a three-dimensional show for a children's science museum.\r\n\r\nIn a tour de force, the team will combine data from five deep, wide-area galaxy surveys that include both photometry and integral-field-unit spectroscopy.  They will use the combined data to study galaxy evolution over the full range of galactic environments at redshifts z ~ 1.9 to 3.5.  These are key redshifts for galaxy evolution, as they probe the assembly of massive galaxies, the peaks in star formation and black-hole accretion, and the collapse of the largest proto-clusters of galaxies.  The team will amass photometry for about 600,000 galaxies and spectroscopy for about 260,000 galaxies.  Using this dataset, the team will conduct statistically meaningful analyses that were heretofore impossible.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nTwenty years ago, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) revolutionized our understanding of galaxies by surveying the sky in multiple colors and obtaining spectroscopy of virtually all the galaxies in the local universe.   By doing so, basic data was acquired on all types of galaxies in all types of galaxy environments, from low density voids to the richest of clusters, allowing us to study many of the factors that affect galaxy evolution.  The purpose of our program was to do the same for the high-redshift universe between 1.9 &lt; z &lt; 3.5, when the universe was only ~ 1/4 of its present size or 1.8 to 3.4 billion years after the Big Bang.  By uniting 4 deep imaging programs --- one in the optical (5 filter bands), 2 in the near-infrared (3 filter bands), and one in the far-infrared (3 filter bands) --- and spectroscopy over every square arcsecond of the 26 deg2 SHELA region of the sky, we created a unified dataset comparable to the SDSS but for the era of \"cosmic noon\", when the bulk of the stars in the universe were forming.  More than two dozen papers have already been written contrasting the properties of the distant galaxies found in SHELA with the predictions of state-of-the-art  simulations of the universe.\n\nOur program also provided support to train Penn State students, both at the graduate and undergraduate level.  The supported students included Joanna Bridge, who was the first graduate student supported by this grant .  She went on to become a postdoc and the University of Louisville and is now Senior Data Scientist at Humana.  Also notable was undergraduate Laurel Weiss  worked on numerous aspects of the project; she is now a graduate student at the University of Texas at Austin. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/03/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Robin B Ciardullo"
