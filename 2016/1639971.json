 "awd_abstract_narration": "Tuskegee University is implementing the TU CS10K Project in partnership with Auburn University, the University of Alabama, A+ College Ready, the Alabama State Department of Education, the Black Belt Commission, the Exploring Computer Science Program, the Tuskegee University Computer Science Advisory Board, and 19 school districts in the 17 counties that traditionally constitute the historic Black Belt region of the state of Alabama. Computing impacts almost all aspects of our daily lives and its important that students get the opportunity to study computer science (CS) through formal course work in order to excite them about studies and career opportunities in CS. Yet, the vast majority of high school students in Alabama attend schools that do not offer rigorous CS curriculum. To address this, the TU CS10K Project aims to develop, implement, study and evaluate an ambitious project to establish the Exploring Computer Science (ECS) curricula in all 43 high schools of the historic Alabama Black Belt. \r\n\r\nThe TU-CS 10K Project will prepare 60 in-service teachers for ECS instruction in partnering high schools using the ECS model of teacher professional development (PD): a one-week comprehensive Summer Institute followed by face-to-face meetings during the school year, monthly virtual Google Hangouts, an online community of practice, and a follow-on Summer Institute, all of which are designed to prepare teachers for ECS course instruction, focusing both on content and instructional strategies. The PD will be provided by endorsed ECS PD facilitators and assisted by the PIs and CS graduate students; implementation support will be delivered to classroom teachers by teacher Professional Learning Communities. Additionally, recruitment and awareness activities will be carried-out to motivate high school students to take ECS, with the aim of involving 1,500 racially and ethnically diverse male and female 9th and 10th graders.  The project's research agenda will advance knowledge in K-12 CS education in high-needs settings, and a rigorous evaluation plan will provide continuous guidance to the PIs to ensure that the project is on track to meet its goals and objectives.",

The partnership consists of Tuskegee University, the University of Alabama, Auburn University, the Exploring Computer Science (ECS) Professional Development Team, A+ College Ready, the Alabama State Department of Education and dozens of school districts state-wide.</p>\n<p>ECS4Alabama is motivated by deep disparities that affect the country&rsquo;s computing workforce. In particular, talent from the African American community and other historically under-represented groups is not well-represented in CS-related occupation. A major contributing factor to this diversity problem is the lack of uniform availability of rigorous CS curricula at the K-12 level that builds the computing pipeline.</p>\n<p>Starting with the Alabama Black Belt region in 2017-2018 school year, and subsequently expanding state-wide, ECS4Alabama has established the ECS course in 92 majority-minority high-schools. ECS was specifically selected as a CS curriculum for partnership schools because of its successful history at other sites in the US to attract students to CS, regardless of backgrounds, because the CS concepts in the course are interwoven with practices that promote inquiry learning that is contextualized as culturally relevant. The project has trained 105 teachers across several cohorts for ECS instruction (one teacher per school, with additional teachers trained at a school following turnovers) through a 14-day rigorous Professional Development, phased over a 12-month period. ECS4Alabama teachers are predominantly female African Americans, thus serving as critically important role models for students from minoritized communities. A survey administered to project teachers (n = 62) reveals that an impressive 88% would like to teach ECS long into the future with another 79% willing to receive training on other CS courses. These findings are notable in the context of promoting long-term sustainability of CS Education in Alabama, in particular in majority-minority High Schools.</p>\n<p>The ECS course has gained popularity also amongst students in the state. Since ECS4Alabama&rsquo;s inception, approximately 6,500 students state-wide have taken ECS in those schools that have teachers trained through the project, the majority of the course-takers being from historically underrepresented communities, including a sizeable proportion of young women of color.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>ECS4Alabama is also preparing teachers from its own ECS teacher community to serve as facilitators at ECS Professional Development events. To-date, six ECS4Alabama teachers have become certified trainers and four additional ECS teachers are gaining readiness for this role. This capacity building effort of ECS4Alabama is designed to promote cost-efficient training by relying on &ldquo;home-grown&rdquo; trainers as opposed to those from out-of-state.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Alabama State Department of Education (ALSDE) has been a strong advocate for ECS in the state, recognizing the course as one of the endorsed CS offerings for the State&rsquo;s High Schools. Moreover, the ALSDE has provided ECS4Alabama with generous financial support to prepare teachers beyond those prepared through NSF funding. Additionally, a 2019 state law mandating that all high schools must offer students with CS experiences through stand-alone courses will effectively sustain ECS in the state for the foreseeable future. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Assessment of program activities revealed that students who reported being more involved in ECS also reported greater benefits. This was especially true in relation to student engagement in cognitively demanding work and when afforded autonomy to work on CS activities. That is, students who reported having greater autonomy and involvement in developing solutions to solve real problems in class reported more positive outcomes associated with the ECS class. More specifically, they found the class more useful, had more confidence in their 21st Century skills, found the ECS course more relevant, were more motivated to persist in CS, had more confidence in their ability to succeed in CS, were more interested in CS careers and reported greater overall outcomes, especially in relation to creativity, problem solving, critical thinking, and working effectively with other students. In addition, teachers described the ECS curriculum as engaging for their students. Moreover, teachers found ECS activities easy to adapt and to modify relative to their existing content areas.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified:
