During the past decade, however, there have been transformational advances in experimentation and simulation, and these have led to the capacity to characterize the temporal and spatial structure of turbulent boundary layers at unprecedented levels of detail. These advances can further lead to our ability to control turbulence with profound impact in energy consumption, pollutant generation and dispersion, transportation and climate change. \r\nThe focus of the workshop will be on areas that are very research active, including i) Exact Coherent Structures; ii) Data Informed Sparse Representations; iii) Quasi-linearized Models, and iv) Asymptotically Reduced PDE Models. A goal of the workshop is to advance a deeper understanding of the details of how the various modeling strategies developed recently in these areas are pragmatically implemented. It would provide ample opportunities for lengthy and open discussions that will usefully facilitate the understanding by the non-experts on how their experiment and/or computation based research might usefully connect to model development and implementation.",
