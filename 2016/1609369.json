 "awd_abstract_narration": "NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: The economically feasible separation of hydrogen fuel from water using light remains an important technical goal for the scientific community. Hydrogen is a valuable fuel because it has a high energy density and its combustion does not generate greenhouse gases. One factor that limits efficient hydrogen synthesis by water splitting is the performance of the available catalysts. For the surface of the catalyst to split water, it must perform two functions: it must transfer both negatively-charged electrons and positively-charged holes to water molecules on the surface. Whichever of these functions occurs more slowly limits the overall reaction. In this project, catalysts are created that have two different types of surfaces. Some areas of the surface promote the transfer of negative charge and the other areas promote the transfer of positive charge. The relative areas are adjusted to optimize the overall reaction rate. This approach provides a valuable tool for the design of water splitting catalysts for economic solar hydrogen production.  The project will have broader impact through the training of undergraduate and graduate students, web-based applications for education and integration into a course on sustainability, the dissemination of the research results beyond the campus, and broadening participation, particularly of women in engineering/science.\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL DETAILS: This project is based on the hypothesis that the relative areas of reducing (positive) and oxidizing (negative) domains on an oxide surface can be controlled and that this ratio influences the overall photochemical reaction rate of catalysts that can be used to produce solar fuel or degrade environmental pollutants. Controlled-atmosphere high-temperature annealing is used to tailor the surface termination. The surface charge distribution is measured by scanning potential microscopy and evaluated using photo-reduction and oxidation reactions that leave insoluble products at the site of the reaction. The novelty and merit of this project lie in the efforts to control the termination chemistry and correlate the types and relative areas of polar domains to the chemical properties of the surface. Because oppositely charged surface terraces promote separately the reduction and oxidation half reactions, surfaces with a combination of oppositely charged domains provide a nearly ideal environment where photo-generated charge carriers are separated, reaction products are separated, and the relative rates of the two reactions are controlled by the relative areas of the charged domains. Each of these factors improves photocatalytic efficiency by mitigating losses associated with recombination, back reaction, and an imbalance in the number of reactive sites for the two half reactions. This project demonstrates how to control polar surface domains and create more efficient photocatalysts needed for the practical production of solar hydrogen.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe project aimed to better understand the surfaces of catalysts that can be used to produce solar fuel or degrade environmental pollutants.  For example, water molecules can be split to produce hydrogen fuel.  For this reaction, the surface of the catalyst must be able to do two opposite things at once: it must attract negatively charged electrons to produce hydrogen and it must also attract positively charged electron-holes to produce oxygen.  This can be accomplished if the surface of the catalyst has some areas that are positively charged and others that are negatively charged.  Such areas can arise from different ionic terminations, ferroelectric domains, ferroelastic domains, or surface orientations.  A set of experiments were carried out to determine the appropriate ratios of positively and negatively charged surface areas and the best sources of this charge.  The intellectual merit of the project is embodied in the results of these experiments and the conclusions that were drawn from them.  It was found that it is possible to control the distribution of charged domains on strontium titanate surfaces with appropriate thermo-chemical treatments, suggesting that it is possible to optimize the photochemical properties of water splitting catalysts.  It was also found that the properties of the charged domains can be maintained even after thin protective titania coatings are deposited, a finding that is important for developing catalysts that will remain stable in service.  Among the different methods for creating surface areas with different charges, it was found that using multiple surface orientations to promote the two reactions works better than using other sources of charge.  It was also found that controlling the pH of the solution around the catalyst is important for optimizing reactivity.  Finally, one of the most important outcomes of this project was the development of high throughput, automated photochemical reactor that makes it possible to quickly evaluate the influence of materials parameters on the water splitting reaction.  The findings of the project have been disseminated through a number of archival publications, doctoral dissertations, and presentations at international scientific conferences.  The project had broader impact through the education and training of students in materials science and engineering.  This includes supporting the graduate education of three students who have graduated and are now working in US industry and creating research experiences for masters and undergraduate students.  The project also had broader impact by contributing to our knowledge of catalysts capable of making solar fuel.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/25/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Gregory S Rohrer"
