 "awd_abstract_narration": "An award is made to the State University of New York at Buffalo to develop an instrument to measure the internal vibrations of proteins. Proteins are large molecules with thousands of atoms and perform most cellular functions. Proteins consist of long chains of amino acids, and these chains fold into specific structures. In general, proteins must alter their shape in order to perform their biological function. For example, Hemoglobin, the protein that transports oxygen, changes shape in order for oxygen to bind. The internal vibrations of the protein structure that enable this change in shape are critical for understanding protein function. Recently a method has been devised to measure protein internal vibrations, called crystal anisotropic terahertz microscopy (CATM). The instrumentation and protocol development in this project makes CATM accessible to non-specialists, and enables broad application of the technique. The development of this instrument leads to the interdisciplinary education of two graduate students and two undergraduates. Integrated with the instrument development are educational and outreach activities that include an undergraduate seminar course and a week-long summer program for 7-12th grade inner city students from underrepresented groups. \r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to produce a compact turn-key spectroscopic system for the routine characterization of intramolecular vibrations of proteins. The technique called crystal anisotropic terahertz (THz) spectroscopy (CATM) uniquely measures these motions. Auto-CATM  provides non-experts with the ability to quickly and easily categorize and classify biomacromolecules. The mini-system from Zomega Terahertz Corp. is the starting platform for the final instrument. A proof-of-concept database, and molecular modeling and data visualization software toolbox facilitate the development this new instrument. This instrument provides insights into how intramolecular vibrations are impacted by frequently modified parameters such as binding state and temperature. The technology developed for Auto-CATM also enable new rapid measurements for both bulk and micron scale materials and thus impact solid state physics and materials science.",

These vibrations are at terahertz frequencies, 1012 Hz:  very high compared to vibrations of a violin string, 103 Hz, but very low compared to where vibrations are typically measured with light, 1014 Hz.

Unfortunately, this type of off-the-shelf instrumentation does not provide very much information for protein vibrations.  A single protein has many vibrations closely spaced in energy, so it is difficult to distinguish one from another.  We previously addressed this challenge by introducing a polarization method which readily isolates protein vibrations based on their direction of motion, anisotropic terahertz microscopy (ATM). \n\nThe ATM method can characterize these motions, but a single spectrum is not sufficient to establish the important frequencies which are robust enough to compare to calculations.  It is critical to be able to establish dynamical fingerprints by showing the spectra are consistent protein to protein.  Further to establish which vibrations are important to function, the spectra must be measured for proteins with specific mutations or drug binding.  Finally to establish that changes are arising because of changes in the protein vibrations and not from other causes, measurements must be repeated to account for small naturally occurring structure variations, or variations in sample preparation and environment.  This amount of sample characterization is not possible with the original instrument, which took 24 h for a single measurement.\n\nThe original ATM system used a microscope configuration where the sample was placed on an electro optic crystal, which allowed for high spatial resolution, but limited the ability to easily vary the polarization needed to get the contrast between different vibrations.
