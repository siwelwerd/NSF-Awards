 "awd_abstract_narration": "The organizers aim to promote significant US participation in the Conference on Geometric Functional Analysis, to be held May 16-20th, 2016, at the University of Alberta, in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.  The conference will be among the largest of its kind in recent years, surveying the state of the art on modern geometric functional analysis and its applications.  The plenary talks include a number of previous invited speakers to the International Congress of Mathematicians. Emphasis will be placed on promoting interaction between early-stage researchers and leading experts, contributing to future research opportunities.  Early-stage researchers from across the US will be able to showcase their work through talks and a poster session.\r\n\r\nGeometric functional analysis is concerned with geometric and linear properties of finite dimensional spaces, studying their characteristic behavior when the dimension, or a number of other relevant free parameters, grows to infinity.  Since high dimensional systems appear naturally and play an essential role in mathematics and applied sciences, the techniques from the field are of broad interest.  In the last decade, geometric functional analysis has had a significant impact on a variety of fields including the geometry of convex sets, random matrix theory, quantitative metric geometry, probability and applied fields such as compressed sensing. The aim is to communicate new techniques that merge tools from the latter fields to the broadest of audiences.  Participants will have the opportunity to hear about the latest developments and the landscape of future research directly from the main contributors.
