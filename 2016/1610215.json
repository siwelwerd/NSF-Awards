 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-technical Description: The ability to manipulate properties of light beams has changed our understanding of the physical universe. Photon beams are being explored to process information, probe the nature of solids and understand how the brain responds to and interacts with external stimuli. New semiconductors that interact with light in unusual ways often form the cornerstone for enhancing the effective coupling of photons to matter. The project investigates the potential of new semiconducting oxide systems in emerging photonic devices. The research goal is to explore optical and electronic properties of thin film SmNiO3 that has a controllable phase change near room temperature that can be systematically induced by changing the electronic structure for potential applications in optoelectronic devices such as optical modulators and optical memories. The project is collaborative between materials scientists and photonics engineers to bring multi-disciplinary skills together to work on cutting-edge topics in nanophotonics incorporating new thin film oxide materials. The project trains graduate and undergraduate students to carry out research at the intersection between materials science, nanophotonics, and optoelectronics. The project engages diverse students in interdisciplinary research that encompasses materials growth, device design, computer modeling, cleanroom nanofabrication, and optical/electronic characterization of materials/devices. \r\n\r\nTechnical Description: This project investigates the potential of electron-doped perovskites as novel phase-changing materials for future light modulation devices needed for optical memory, brain-inspired photonic devices with multiple states. The research goals of this collaborative project are to elucidate the fundamental mechanisms and reliability of non-volatility of the electron incorporation process and to understand the limits on the speed of phase change studied by optical routes. The research team uses a combination of thin film materials synthesis, electron diffraction, carrier transport measurements, optical microscopy and spectroscopy to study the nanostructure and optical properties of selected perovskite oxides. The research team uses ?metasurfaces?, which are two-dimensional arrays of optical antennas, to maximize the interaction between intensely confined light and thin films of phase-change materials. The project involves diverse graduate and undergraduate students to work on frontier topics in nanophotonics. Collaborations between materials scientists and photonics researchers enhances the research experience and broaden the technical horizons of the participating students.",

Our work has demonstrated that SmNiO<sub>3</sub> exhibits a large modulation of resistivity and optical band gap at room temperature during electron-doping-induced phase transition. The project has led to fundamental understanding of the nature and dynamics of phase transitions in rare-earth perovskite nickelates. The project has succeeded in integrating the phase-change material with two-dimensional nanostructured thin-films, called metasurfaces, which has led to strongly enhanced interactions between light waves and the phase-change material, and a few novel photonic devices.

We discovered a new optical phase-transition material samarium nickelate, SmNiO3. SmNiO3 is a strongly correlated perovskite. Electron doping at room temperature substantially modifies its bandstructure and triggers its phase transition reversibly between a transparent and an opaque state. Optical transmission of SmNiO3 thin films is measured to change reversibly between a few percent and more than 70 percent over the entire visible, near-infrared, and mid-infrared spectra (wavelengths from 400 nm to 15 microns) (<strong>Fig. 1</strong>). The magnitude and bandwidth of optical tuning that this material offers are rarely seen in other tunable optical materials.</p>\n<p>2. We discovered a new mechanism to trigger the phase change of SmNiO3 based on water electrolysis (<strong>Fig. 2</strong>). We conducted systematic spectroscopy measurements and showed that the complex optical refractive indices of water-treated SmNiO3 are quite comparable to SmNiO3 treated with standard liquid and solid electrolytes. We found that SmNiO3 is stable in salt water, does not corrode, and allows exchange of protons with the surrounding water at ambient temperature, with the concurrent modification in electrical resistance and optical properties. The implication of the discovery is that, since SmNiO3 is stable in liquid water, it could be used in biochemical or biomedical environments (aqueous solution of living cells and tissues), as a reconfigurable optical interface for imaging or sensing applications.</p>\n<p>3. We experimentally demonstrated free-space optical modulators based on thin-film SmNiO<sub>3</sub> integrated with a metasurface structure consisting of a two-dimensional array of cross aperture antennas (<strong>Fig. 3</strong>). The antenna array facilitates a strong interaction between light and the phase-change material, resulting in a strong optical modulation at the antenna resonant frequency when SmNiO<sub>3</sub> undergoes phase transition.</p>\n<p>4. We experimentally demonstrated a variable emissivity coating that can provide a tuning of thermal emissivity by ~50% (<strong>Fig. 4</strong>). Surfaces with variable emissivity can be used to control thermal radiation in response to varying climatic conditions to thermoregulate building and vehicles.</p>\n<p>5. We designed a smart window based on SmNiO<sub>3</sub> that is able to modulate transmissivity of sunlight over the visible and near-infrared range by more than 60% (<strong>Fig. 5</strong>).</p>\n<p>6.
