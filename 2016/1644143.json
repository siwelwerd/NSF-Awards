 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will establish a support and mentoring system for students with low socioeconomic status (SES) in the Purdue University School of Engineering.  Scholarship support will be provided for twenty academically motivated, low SES students to support four years of education in engineering. Students with low SES typically come from high schools with fewer resources than their wealthier colleagues, impacting their ability to take Advanced Placement classes and to engage in academic support and tutoring for standardized exams, which can affect their placement in competitive engineering programs.  This project will devise strategies and collect data to demonstrate that students that lack the competitive advantage of higher SES can successfully enter and complete an engineering major when the appropriate support mechanisms are provided.  \r\n\r\nParticipants in the project, dubbed \"Rising Scholars,\" will be identified from those students who applied for entry into the Engineering major, but were denied and diverted into Exploratory Studies instead.  These would be students who are judged not competitive for the major at entry, but who still have a chance of academic success in the major, based on GPA and standardized test scores.  The project will create assessment and progress monitoring oversight groups to guide Rising Scholar cohorts from matriculation to post-graduation job placement, will develop and deploy techniques to identify applicants with the potential for STEM success from low SES populations, and will nurture Rising Scholars and their support networks to provide a \"high touch, high impact\" path through college.  Data will be collected from the cohorts using specifically designed survey instruments to determine how a student's support network changes and grows as the student is matriculated, retained and graduated from selective and rigorous STEM programs and to determine what quantifiable metrics can be used to improve the admission process to identify and open the way for an economically diverse student body in STEM.",

He developed a program teaching youth that strong support networks can help them flourish in stressful situations. Mr. Peterson developed a questionnaire that discerns the support adults provide students, as well as the strength of the connections. He found that at-risk youth will excel that have the support of at least five strong connections. The Rising Scholar program used this philosophy and modified Peterson&rsquo;s questionnaire to identify the strength of the university students&rsquo; web of support.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;The Rising Scholar program recruited 21 low-SES applicants to Purdue University that were not accepted into their first choice of engineering in three cohorts entering during the falls of 2017, 2018, and 2019. These students already possessed a strong network of supporters or felt they could learn how to use a web of support. These students were matched with similar demographic students that were directly admitted to engineering (E) or other students in the exploratory studies (Ex) program with similar first semester courses. The Rising Scholars and matched students&rsquo; demographics can be seen in Table 1 of the appendix.</p>\r\n<p>There was a prescribed path through graduation that followed best-practice choices which encouraged students to meet university personnel to build their support networks. This schedule started by attending the Minority Engineering Program (MEP) Academic Boot Camp, which is a simulation of the first semester in engineering. Throughout their tenure at Purdue, the students attended yearly dedicated seminars, had research experiences in professors&rsquo; laboratories, and finally completed internships, if available. &nbsp;The progression of summer experiences was designed to build on the previous year and allow the students to have plenty of pertinent skills as they interviewed for the internship.</p>\r\n<p>When comparing the Rising Scholars (RS) and their matched-pair groups, it was found the RSs were retained at a similar rate as (E) and at a higher rate than the (Ex) students in engineering or STEM majors. By the end of the project, the Rising Scholars had fewer students who had withdrawn and had no students who had been dropped. The first three years&rsquo; retention data is shown in the appendix, Table 2. Detailed discussions of retention and performance data can be found in the listed conference papers.</p>\r\n<p>First- to third-year performance data are presented in the appendix, Table 3. The RS students had a significantly greater cumulative GPA compared with both E and Ex students at the end of the first and second year when using a t-test statistical analysis. The RS had a significantly higher value when comparing the cumulative GPA of all students at the end of five years, but they also had a higher number of credits attempted. There was no difference between all RS to Ex students.</p>\r\n<p>Graduation rates were compared after five years. No statistical differences were found between the number of graduates for RS and E or Ex students between graduating in engineering, STEM, or all degrees. The Rising Scholars still had three students working toward graduation in Fall 2024, and two degrees were earned that semester. A final engineering degree is expected to be earned in Spring 2025, which would result in 11 engineering degrees for the Rising Scholars. No other comparison students were still working on a degree at this time.</p>\r\n<p>A positive measure of the Rising Scholar program was seen during the COVID years. While all students had the potential of building strong campus networks, some students were more conscience of the goals of the program and were able to build their networks stronger and more quickly. Table 4 provides a summary of the students&rsquo; mentoring networks, and Figure 1 shows their grades through the COVID pandemic. At the end of three years at the university, the team looked at the RS&rsquo;s networks as they matriculated into the program and through semi-yearly questionnaires. Results showed that most of the students who entered with thinly-webbed networks continued to lag behind those who began with thickly-webbed networks, particularly in connections with on-campus individuals.</p>\r\n<p>Overall, it can be considered that this program was successful through multiple lenses.&nbsp; Graduation rates from the university at the close of the program, in Table 5, were the best of the three comparison groups. By December 2025, two more engineering degrees had been added, placing the Rising Scholars ahead of the other groups in overall STEM degrees. Our RS cohorts have the potential to add another engineering degree in Spring 2026. Beyond the graduates who might not have had the chance to obtain Purdue degrees, this program completed sound fundamental research into the effect of strong mentoring networks on the success of low SES students in higher education STEM fields.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 02/17/2025<br>\nModified by: Carol&nbsp;S&nbsp;Stwalley</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1644143/1644143_10463734_1739630260214_Table_2___Rising_Scholar_Outcomes--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1644143/1644143_10463734_1739630260214_Table_2___Rising_Scholar_Outcomes--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Rising Scholar Years 1-3 Retention\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1644143/1644143_10463734_1739630260214_Table_2___Rising_Scholar_Outcomes--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Rising Scholar Years 1-3 Retention\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Table 2 - First to third year retention for Rising Scholars and their Engineering and Exploratory student comparisons.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Carol S.
