 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hock/1543432\r\n\r\nOver the last half century the Antarctic Peninsula has been among the most rapidly warming regions in the world. This has led to increased glacier melt, widespread glacier retreat, ice-shelf collapses, and glacier speed-ups. Many of these changes are driven by changing precipitation and increased melt due to warmer air temperatures. This project will use a combination of two models - a regional atmospheric model and a model of processes at the glacier surface - to simulate future changes in temperature and snowfall, and the resulting changes in glacier mass. The combination of models will be tested against the observational record (since 1979 when satellite observations became available), to verify that it can reproduce observed change, and then run to the year 2100. Results will provide better estimates of the impacts of future climate changes over the Antarctic Pensinsula and the expected glacier mass changes driven by the evolving climate. \r\n\r\nThe project will use the large changes observed on the Peninsula to validate a model framework suitable for understanding the impact of these changes on the glaciers and ice shelves there, with the goal of developing optimally constrained future climate and surface mass change scenarios for the region. The framework will provide both a coherent picture of the impacts of past changes on the region's ice cover, and also the best available constraints on forcings that will determine ice mass loss from this region going forward under a standard scenario.  The Weather Forecasting and Research (WRF) Model will be used over the domain of the Antarctic Peninsula and neighboring islands to quantify trends in spatio-temporal patterns of mass change with a focus on surface melt. The WRF model will be enhanced to account for the specific conditions of glacier surfaces, and the modified model will be used to simulate climate conditions and resulting surface mass budgets and melt over the period 1979-2100. Tying modeled past climate changes to the surface and satellite-based observational record will provide a foundation for interpreting projected future change. Results will be validated using available weather station observations, surface mass-balance data, and satellite-derived records of melt.  The activity will foster partnerships through collaboration with colleagues in Spain, Germany and The Netherlands and will support an early-career postdoctoral researcher and two graduate students, introduce undergraduate and high-school students to original research and provide training of students through inclusion of data and results in course curriculums.",

It was one of the fastest-warming regions during 1950s?1990s; Iceberg A68 calved off the Larsen C Ice Shelf (LCIS) in 2017; a 32-year record-high surface melt occurred on the northern George VI Ice Shelf in 2019-20; and a record-high temperature of 18.3<sup>o</sup>C was observed at the northern tip on February 6 2020; etc. To better capture the air-snow-ice interaction over the AP and achieve improved surface mass balance modeling over LCIS, a snow/ice-enhanced version of the Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF-ice) was developed. Specifically WRF-ice couples with three extra snow/ice modules of thermodynamic sea ice, two-moment blowing snow, and snow/firn thermodynamics.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">With the WRF-ice model, we conducted studies of blowing snow impacts on the AP lower atmosphere and surface modeling. It is found blowing snow effects within WRF-ice include moistening and cooling of the air, cloud enhancement, and intensified precipitation (Fig. 1). The moistening and cooling effect of blowing snow sublimation on the lower atmosphere is strong when the air is dry (Fig. 1a). Over relatively warm and humid area, blowing snow helps enhance cloud, which can lead to either colder or warmer surfaces due to the competing effects of longwave and shortwave cloud radiative forcing (Fig. 1b). Over the mountainous area, additional moisture from blowing snow sublimation can intensify precipitation rate (Fig. 1c).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\"><br /></span></p>\n<p>We further applied the WRF-ice model to the Larsen C Ice Shelf (LCIS), AP, for a season long simulation to evaluate the impacts of blowing snow on the LCIS surface energy and mass balance modeling. It is found decreased latent heat flux due to the moistening effect of blowing snow sublimation leads to a positive anomaly in the surface energy budget (Fig. 2b), which further helps enhance surface melt and runoff.&nbsp;While enhanced runoff and strong blowing snow sublimation contribute to a reduced surface mass balance,&nbsp;increased precipitation and suppressed surface sublimation by blowing snow, plus blowing snow deposition help to increase the surface mass balance over LCIS (Fig. 2a).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Foehn wind effect warming is believed an important process that contributes to the LCIS surface warming and melt (Fig. 3). The impacts of different mechanisms including isentropic drawdown and latent heating on the LCIS foehn wind warming are investigated. It is found that latent heating is the dominant foehn warming mechanism when the windward precipitation is strong, while during weaker precipitation the dominant foehn warming mechanism is isentropic drawdown. Overall, the amount of windward precipitation determines the relative contribution of latent heating vs isentropic drawdown on the leeward foehn wind warming.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>LCIS, the 4th largest ice shelf in Antarctica and the largest in the AP, is one of ice shelves with the highest surface melt rates. To better understand the large-scale drivers of surface melt over LCIS and the variation of AP regional climate, we performed the EOF/PC analysis on the sea level pressure field of the fifth generation ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis (ERA5). It is found that the time series of the EOF mode 1 which represents the variations in depth, location and strength of the Amundsen Sea Low is correlated with the LCIS surface temperature in winter and spring through the northerly/northwesterly wind anomalies west of the AP (Fig. 4b/c). The EOF mode 2 captures the variation of the Weddell Sea Low and is correlated with LCIS surface temperature in autumn and summer due to southerly wind anomalies east of the AP (Fig. 4e/h). Interannual variation of summer melt is also negatively correlated with the EOF mode 2. Moreover it is found that the recent decline in surface melt trends over LCIS from 2004-2018 is due to southerly wind trends east of the AP driven by increasingly cyclonic circulation captured by EOF mode 2 (Fig. 5).</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 02/13/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Jing&nbsp;Zhang</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1543445/1543445_10418443_1676349623263_Fig1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1543445/1543445_10418443_1676349623263_Fig1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Fig.1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1543445/1543445_10418443_1676349623263_Fig1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Fig.1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Conceptual model of blowing snow impacts</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Luo et al 2020, JGR</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Jing&nbsp;Zhang</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Fig.1</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1543445/1543445_10418443_1676349848223_Fig3--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1543445/1543445_10418443_1676349848223_Fig3--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Fig. 3\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1543445/1543445_10418443_1676349848223_Fig3--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Fig. 3\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Foehn wind warming over AP</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Zhang and Zhang 2019, JMR</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Jing&nbsp;Zhang</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Fig. 3</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1543445/1543445_10418443_1676349957204_Fig4--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1543445/1543445_10418443_1676349957204_Fig4--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Fig. 4\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1543445/1543445_10418443_1676349957204_Fig4--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Fig. 4\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Surface temperature and wind vector anomalies associated with the AP regional circulation</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Zhang et al 2021, J Climate</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Jing&nbsp;Zhang</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Fig. 4</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1543445/1543445_10418443_1676350215971_Fig5--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1543445/1543445_10418443_1676350215971_Fig5--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Fig. 5\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1543445/1543445_10418443_1676350215971_Fig5--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Fig. 5\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">AP regional circulation and  LCIS surface temperature and melt during summer</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Zhang et al 2021, J Climate</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Jing&nbsp;Zhang</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Fig. 5</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1543445/1543445_10418443_1676349760471_Fig2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1543445/1543445_10418443_1676349760471_Fig2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Fig. 2\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1543445/1543445_10418443_1676349760471_Fig2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Fig. 2\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Blowing snow impacts on the LCIS surface energy budget and mass balance</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Luo and Zhang 2022, GRL</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Jing&nbsp;Zhang</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Fig. 2</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
