 "awd_abstract_narration": "The award provides for the operations at Aquadilla in Puerto Rico an imaging radio array that would provide an excellent diagnostic capability for observing the radio wave effects generated by the powerful Arecibo Observatory heater in the F-region ionosphere. The InterAmerican  University Aquadilla imaging facility would be capable of observing the spatial distribution of the heated region. This array would also detect and track the motions of these waves generated by the Arecibo heater system across the magnetic field line. It would also observe the growth and decay of the wave structures emitted by the heated region. A full time post-doctoral associate and the summer participation of three European graduate students would be supported with this award.\r\n\r\nThe award would support the use of the Aquadilla radio array in application to the study of a wide range of radio wave emissions generated by the Arecibo Observatory heating. The award would enhance the R&D capabilities of the atmospheric, space, and radio infrastructure at Inter American University and in Puerto Rico, and would support STEM undergraduate education and the development of graduate research programs. The project would promote collaborative use of the facilities of the Arecibo Observatory by local students and faculty, thereby supporting the longer-term future of the Observatory. The use and development of the array will drive the development of new radio techniques and technologies. Areas of technological application include imaging techniques, antenna technologies, over-the-horizon radar, long-range communications, and space-based communication and navigation. The work proposed here promotes the development of shortwave radio technologies. Shortwave communications, which do not depend on space systems, and of shortwave radar, against which stealth technologies are largely ineffective, are important and strategic technologies.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThe earth's ionosphere is a part of the earth's upper atmosphere, roughly 60 to 600 miles in altitude. The ionosphere, although a part of the atmosphere, is also a part of outer space, which also begins at 60 miles above the surface of the earth, so that the ionosphere lies in the nearest region of outer space to us. In fact, most of our satellites orbit right in the middle of the ionosphere, including GPS and Starlink satellites and many others. \n\nThe ionosphere is made up mainly of positively-charged oxygen ions and negatively-charged electrons. Oxygen ions are oxygen atoms that have lost an electron by absorbing X or ultraviolet radiation (X rays and UV rays) radiated from the sun, thus protecting us from radiation that would cause cancer. In fact, the ionosphere is the result of the neutral upper atmosphere of the earth, called the thermosphere, absorbing most of the dangerous radiation that comes from the sun. The famous ozone layer absorbs only the little bit of ultraviolet radiation that manages to penetrate the ionosphere. \n\nSo, the ionosphere is a gas made up of positive ions and negative electrons. The electrons in the ionosphere are famous for reflecting shortwave radio signals, and thus allowing ham radio operators to talk to people across the country and across the world. Radio stations like Voice of America and Radio Free Europe broadcast on shortwave for the same reason. Before satellites and internet, shortwave radio was an important source of communication and entertainment for much of the world. \n\nToday, shortwave is still important in emergencies. In the movie Independence Day, after the aliens destroyed our satellites, people then had to communicate using shortwave radio. That is not just science fiction: If a solar storm, or worse a war, destroys our communications satellites, we will in fact be able to rely on backup systems that use shortwave radio, and not only those provided by volunteer ham radio operators. Even the U.S. Air Force operates a backup shortwave communication system, called the High Frequency Global Communications System. \n\nAll of this and more depends on the ionosphere. Our goal in this project has been to learn about the ionosphere, specifically, about the microscopic interactions between the particles and waves in the ionosphere, and the space weather that those particles and waves contribute to. As part of the project we have begun installing a radar and radio antenna array for making radar images of the ionophsere. The array, composed of 18 antennas, is locaated in Cayey, Puerto Rico, a one-hour drive south of San Juan. \n\nUsing the antenna array we can create radar pictures of the ionosphere, to study the small and large structures that make up the space weather, and the turbulence created by electron, ion, and radio waves in the ionosphere. The structures and turbulence affect the paths taken by, and quality of, shortwave radio signals, and of other signals such as GPS and Starlink data being sent to Earth. \n\nThe new antenna array, along with the computer programs we have written for working with the radar data from the array, will help students and researchers to use the new data to better understand and predict space weather and its effects on our satellites and other modern electronic and electrical systems.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/09/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: BrettCIsham\n"
