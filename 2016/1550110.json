 "awd_abstract_narration": "Large-scale faults (>1000 kilometer) are first-order features observed at Earth's active and ancient plate boundaries. Active faults, such as the San Andreas, accommodate relative motion between tectonic plates. Ancient plate boundary faults now within plates, such as the New Madrid fault in Missouri, can also continue to be active, as demonstrated by major earthquakes on them. Why some plate boundary faults remain the locus of crustal deformation and uplift 100s of millions of years after they form has remained a topic of debate. This study will provide ideas on how and why some major faults that form at plate boundaries persist as zones of weakness in the crust, prone to reactivation. The results will ultimately inform a broad group of scientists on deep crustal processes that control the location of seismicity, high heat flow, and hydrothermal systems that may have implications for the understanding of geologic hazards and resources. In addition to the scientific goals of the project, important societal relevant outcomes of the project will include the training of graduate and undergraduate students in an important STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) discipline. The project will facilitate collaborative research between three U.S. research institutions, thus contributing to support of scientific infrastructure. It will provide research funding for two early career gescientists. The project will contribute to the broadening of participation of underrepresented groups in STEM. Importantly, the project will  foster international collaboration and exchange between U.S. and Argentine scientists. Results of the research will be broadly disseminated through presentations at professional society meetings and in peer-reviewed scientific publications. \r\n\r\nThe presence of major fault zones within continental crust which show evidence for reactivation over 100s of millions of years defies models for continuum deformation of the continents, wherein faults are viewed as passive features responding to mantle flow. Large-scale faults occur on every continent and many long-lived intracontinental fault systems record complex histories of reactivation, in particular localizing convergent and strike-slip deformation.  This research will test competing models for the origin of persistent large-scale faults by studying the tectonic history of exhumed middle and lower crust sections of an ancient fault zone. End member models predict that such fault zones originate either as: 1) convergent-collisional boundaries between blocks of different strength, 2) transform boundaries along pre-existing zones of weakness, or 3) strike-slip boundaries within the arc-forearc region of oblique subduction settings.  The Valle Fertil fault zone of western Argentina is an approximately 1200-kilometer-long major crustal lineament that records at least 400 million years of intermittent deformation and is an ideal location to test the above models because of excellent geophysical constraints on crustal strength contrasts, variable depths of exposure along strike, a well constrained tectonic evolution, and ideal mineral assemblages for dating the history of deformation within the fault. The results from the Valle Fertil fault can be applied to other intracontinental faults to address what factors determine the origin of major structures within complex orogens and the processes by which they ultimately become large-scale faults with complex histories of continued reactivation.",
