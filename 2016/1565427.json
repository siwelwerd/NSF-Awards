 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this collaborative project funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics & Mechanisms B Program of the Chemistry Division, Professors David N. Beratan and Peng Zhang of the Department of Chemistry at Duke University and Professors Igor V. Rubtsov and Russell H. Schmehl of the Department of Chemistry at Tulane University are developing novel ways to control the flow of electrical charge through molecules.  Electron transfer at the molecular scale is essential in naturally occurring reactions and in devices of technological significance.  The ability to dial in the rate of electronic motion and to control the directionality of these reactions on the molecular scale is a significant challenge that could open up new strategies for solar energy conversion, for understanding of biological energy conversion schemes, and for developing new strategies for devices of technological significance.  The project includes intensive collaborations among chemical synthesis, ultrafast spectroscopy, and theory to establish a very rich interdisciplinary training environment for students.  The team is promoting science and education by providing summer research opportunities to economically-disadvantaged and historically underrepresented groups.  In addition, novel curriculum developments involve multi-university, multi-faculty teaching of courses that address the chemical and physical principles underpinning the research. \r\n\r\nThe overall aim of the project is to understand the chemical and physical approaches that use infrared perturbations to control charge flow at the molecular scale.  The research also includes the design of novel molecular structures where the charge flow is strongly influenced by the infra-red radiation. The project combines the power of theoretical and experimental approaches to manipulate charge flow in molecules. The researchers use ultrafast multi-pulse spectroscopic methods in the laboratory to drive and to perturb the reaction dynamics of donor-bridge-acceptor compounds. Several classes of donor-bridge-acceptor molecular systems are prepared and studied, including transition-metal complexes, bimetallic complexes, hydrogen-bonded systems, and systems with bi-stable bridges. Using newly developed methods of non-equilibrium molecular dynamics, the same molecular systems examined in the experimental laboratory are simulated, targeting the development of understanding vibrational excitation that may perturb both reaction coordinate motion and donor-acceptor electronic coupling interactions.",

The goal of this research is to use spectroscopy, molecular design, synthesis, theory, and simulations to establish fundamental understanding of how to manipulate the electron transfer reaction outcome in specialized donor-bridge-acceptor structures by exciting vibrations of the bridge. Electron transfer (ET) is a central process in nature and technology; controlling electron transmission with external stimuli could provide entirely new schemes for directing the charge flow on the molecular level and result in the development of novel smart materials.</p>\n<p>The use of alkyne bridges is attractive as they support conjugation, leading to strong electronic-states coupling, are rigid and sustain symmetry, and permit lengths for substantial electron transfer distances. The alkyne bridges also feture a CC stretching vibrational mode, convenient for manipulating the ET reaction outcome. The conjugation, however, leads to mixing of the charge-separated and local excited states, resulting in incomplete charge separation. In this project we developed principles to obtain full-electron charge-separated state in DBA compounds featuring conjugated bridges that offer strong electronic-state coupling conditions and tested them using novel molecular systems.</p>\n<p>Several series of compounds, synthesized by Tong Ren at Purdue University (Fig. 1), were studied in this program using ultrafast spectroscopy in the visible and mid-IR spectral regions (Fig. 2). The compounds with Co center Fig. 1A, were found to be ineffective in ET modulation, predominantly because the conjugation among the two alkyne arms is broken by the cobalt atom.</p>\n<p>For the compounds where the D and A are linked directly with an alkyne bridge (Fig. 1B-D) the coupling of the local excited and charge-separated (CS) states across the conjugation was found to be dependent strongly on the torsion angle, &theta;, between the donor and acceptor planes (Fig. 1B). In addition, angle &theta;&nbsp;also defines the transition and permanent dipole moments of the ground and excited electronic states, vibrational frequencies and transition moments of the CC stretching modes of the bridge (Fig. 3), and the rate of charge-separation. Moreover, we found that the influence of the torsion angle on the states coupling originates from the symmetry of the frontier orbitals and therefore can be changed by selecting the D and A moieties (Fig. 4). Quantum calculations show that conformations with a wide distribution of &theta;&nbsp;angles are present for the D-C4-NAP compound at room temperature and the rates of charge separation depend greatly on &theta;&nbsp;(Fig. 3A). &nbsp;</p>\n<p>The ET rates and other properties of D-C4-NAP were found to be favorable for efficient ET rate modulation by exciting the CC mode of the bridge. Three-pulse measurements were performed, exciting the DBA compounds electronically and vibrationally, followed by probing the reaction outcome in the visible spectral region (Fig. 5). The experiments show different modulation outcome in compounds with small and large dihedral angles (Fig. 6). For conformations with large dihedral angles &theta;&nbsp;&gt; 40<sup>o</sup>, the ET process is decelerated by IR excitation by a factor of 0.95. Remarkably, in the compounds with small dihedral angles, the ET rate increases with vibrational excitation of the bridge by 1.4-fold. It is found for the first time that the rate modulation occurs directly by the mode excited with radiation, the CC stretching mode, as the charge-separation rate is faster than the CC mode lifetime. Other compounds were also tested for the ET rate modulation, but much smaller effects were observed. Nevertheless, these experiments helped testing our understanding of the processes occurring in these compounds. The findings of ET rate modulation in D-C4-NAP compound open avenues of designing novel DBA compounds that will target much larger ET-rate modulation effects.</p>\n<p>The broader impacts of the project are resulted from educating young scientists on interdisciplinary topics at the interface of quantum dynamics, spectroscopy and electron transfer processes.
