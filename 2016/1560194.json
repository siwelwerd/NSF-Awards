 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site at Old Dominion University (ODU) engages undergraduate students traditionally underrepresented in STEM fields in hands-on research in the fields of electrochemical clean fuel production and applications, including solar fuel production, biofuels upgrading and production, and fuel cell materials and applications. The U.S. pioneered the development of these technologies, and continues to lead the way from laboratories to commercial markets.  However there is a general lack of understanding and awareness of these technologies in the public and also among the stakeholders.  This REU Site will help in educating and preparing undergraduate students in this area and play a role in the development of energy professionals for a sustainable society.\r\n\r\nThis REU Site offers opportunities for undergraduate students, working with faculty mentors and industry professionals, to engage in multidisciplinary electrochemical clean fuel research activities during a 10-week summer program. In addition to active energy research projects mentored by faculty from the College of Engineering, students will participate in research seminars, workshops on writing and communications training, field trips to industries related to clean energy, and career development activities. Recruitment of REU Site participants will target 12 collaborating institutions which include Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and undergraduate institutions with limited STEM research activities.",
