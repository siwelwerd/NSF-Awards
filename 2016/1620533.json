The meeting will consist of short talks, poster sessions, communal dining, and conversations that will provide ample opportunity for sharing latest research results and for exploring collaborative possibilities.\r\n\r\nMitochondria and chloroplasts are two organelles that are responsible for energy conversions in the biosphere.  Chloroplasts play essential roles in in converting carbon dioxide into food and mitochondria are involved in converting food into energy stores.  The Broader Impacts of this work involves both the importance of these organelles to the biosphere as well as the training of new scientist to pursue research in these important fields. Cutting-edge or late-breaking research will be highlighted in several short talks chosen from the abstracts. The primary purposes of this conference are to promote discussion between scientists with common professional interests, including those from non-research-intensive colleges and universities, to foster the exchange of ideas from advanced aspects of their field, and to enable scientific collaborations to evolve in new directions.",
