 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program in the Division of Chemistry, Professor Chen at Spelman College is working with undergraduate students to develop and investigate a new laser spectroscopic technique that was invented at Spelman.  This new three-dimensional spectroscopy method can overcome problems and limitations of other existing forms of spectroscopy in the study of the properties and behavior of molecules in chemistry. Specifically in this project, Professor Chen works closely with his students to 1) further develop theory and software for spectral interpretation; 2) demonstrate the study of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) as the sample molecule using this technique; 3) combine the new spectroscopic technique with a high resolution, coherent, two dimensional spectroscopic method to improve the speed of data collection and information extraction; and 4) identify other interesting molecules that could benefit from the enhanced capability of this technique. At Spelman College, one of only two Historically Black Colleges for women in the US, many students in Professor Chen's lab are from underrepresented minority groups. With this project, he provides them with a stimulating undergraduate research experience that encourages and better prepares them to pursue graduate school.  \r\n\r\nHigh resolution molecular spectroscopy is a mature technique with a long record of providing detailed information about molecular structure and behavior.  However, many molecules have stubbornly resisted analysis because the spectra they produce are too heavily congested, perturbed, complex, and patternless.  Furthermore, analytical applications of high resolution molecular spectroscopy are limited by difficulty in interpreting spectra when the sample is a mixture.  The purpose of the project is to develop and explore the capabilities of High Resolution Coherent Three Dimensional (HRC3D) spectroscopy as a method for overcoming these limitations.  In conjunction with a recently developed High Resolution Coherent Two Dimensional (HRC2D) technique, which has complimentary capabilities, these two tools provide an alternative method for studying polyatomic molecules (such as NO2) in systems that cannot be studied using existing methods.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nMany of the challenges the world faces (e.g., developing new sources of clean energy, limiting climate change, eliminating threats from emerging diseases) and the solutions needed to solve them require a better understanding of what happens at the molecular level. During the past few decades, tools for studying molecules have advanced because of a multidimensional revolution that makes them more powerful, enabling new information to be extracted and viewed in more sophisticated ways. For example, NMR spectroscopy has been expanded to increasingly higher dimensions (2D, then 3D, then 4D, etc.) to study systems that were previously considered too complicated, such as large biomedical molecules that otherwise cause congestion. Other techniques such as optical spectroscopy are increasingly being used in 2D mode, but further expansion to 3D has been experimentally difficult, and major benefits needed to justify such efforts have not been clearly demonstrated. The results of this project address both of these obstacles. We developed the ability to record 3D optical spectra that are only slightly more difficult than recording 2D spectra. The results demonstrate two important advantages of 3D over 2D optical spectroscopy. One is that congestion problems that continue to obscure important information in the 2D spectra can be completely eliminated in 3D spectra. The second is the ability to select and then study just one species in a mixture. Furthermore, the resulting 3D spectra contain unique 3D patterns that provide direct information on molecular shape and behavior.\n\n\nThe 3D technique that we have developed appears to have some potential applications in other areas of chemistry and science. The technique has some unique properties that make it potentially useful for controlling chemical reactions. As a result, important chemical reactions that are inefficient could be improved and optimized to create more beneficial products and fewer unwanted byproducts. The 3D technique could also be used to create rotating molecule qubits needed to make a new generation of quantum computers. Unlike current quantum computers, these computers would be able to operate at room temperature and be less susceptible to noise.\n\n\nThis project was carried out at Spelman College, a historically Black college for women. Nineteen Black students (18 female and 1 male) have contributed to this project as undergraduate research assistants. Six of them coauthored papers on this research that were published in leading research journals. Two have earned Ph. D.s and are now in the workforce. Six are currently enrolled in Ph. D. programs. Four completed their studies at Spelman, then completed their degrees from additional programs (e.g., masters or dual degree in engineering) and are now in the workforce. Three are in medical or dental school.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/19/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: PeterCChen\n"
