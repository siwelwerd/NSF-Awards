 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the most significant barriers to the wider adoption of autonomous robotic systems in commercial applications is the challenge of achieving 100% reliable autonomy in unconstrained human environments. One path toward more robust autonomy is to spend more time in research labs improving robot capabilities, delaying deployment until autonomy is entirely robust.  Instead, it may be valuable to deploy robots out in the wild and adapt their behavior based on the rare examples, corner cases, and contingencies encountered after deployment in order to achieve near-term, fully reliable autonomy. This approach is specifically motivated by the call center model, in which robots are deployed at end-user sites and contact a remote human operator for assistance whenever an error is encountered.  This project develops a system that enables robots to perform lifelong, incremental improvement from remote human assistance with the long-term goal of achieving full autonomy. This research program has significant broader impacts, making personal robots more accessible to everyday people, while also providing opportunities for human-robot interaction that are ideal for educational K-12 programs, as well as undergraduate and graduate education. \r\n\r\nTowards these goals, novel algorithms, interfaces, and user studies are being developed to advance the state of the art in three key areas related to the call center model: (1) Robust, Multi-Sensory Task Outcome Detection: multimodal techniques for identifying conditions under which to seek assistance or deploy recovery behaviors; (2) Transparency Devices for Situated Awareness: visual and language interface modalities for increasing the situational awareness of the remote operator and allowing for intuitive interaction, leading to more efficient and correct recovery procedures; (3) Low-Level and High-Level Task Model Refinement: lifelong learning techniques for incorporating corrections and recovery procedures into existing task models, as well as active learning methods to collect more targeted data.  The proposed approach is being evaluated on a variety of mobile manipulation tasks that a hotel concierge robot might perform, such as delivery tasks or preparing for and cleaning up after a conference banquet.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project seeks to enable a robot with sub-optimal behavior to detect errors, clearly communicate requests for help, and incrementally improve its task models from recovery procedures performed by human operators.  Toward this goal, our work has made contributions in the following areas:\n\nCrowdsourced benchmark for skill learning: we carried out an extensive crowdsourced evaluation of widely-used LfD approaches to identify their limitations in real-world settings. To perform this evaluation, we collected data from 9 participants, across 4 different manipulation tasks with varying starting conditions. The resulting demonstrations were used to train 180 task models and evaluated on 720 task reproductions on a physical robot. Our results detail how i) complexity of the task, ii) the expertise of the human demonstrator, and iii) the starting configuration of the robot affect task performance.\n\n\nStochastic dynamics representation for probabilistic skills: we developed an approach which encodes a distribution over motions and generates motions that generalize to via-points while maintaining feasibility.  We additionally developed an incremental variant of the approach for learning from demonstrations collected in a cluttered-environment.  Our results show that the developed technique is capable of more reliable and efficient generalization of the learned skill to new scenarios than was possible with prior methods.\n\n\nGeometric representation for shape-based skills: we developed a method that learns cost functions based on motion statistics in multiple geometric coordinate systems and then generalizes the motions via optimization to new start/goal locations.  Our experimental evaluation demonstrates the algorithm?s ability to learn the optimal weights directly from the demonstrations without making task-dependent assumptions present in other methods.\n\n\nStable dynamical system representation for infinite-horizon skills: we introduced an approach which learns stable time-invariant motion policies based on potential fields, which are robust to temporal perturbations.\n\n\nTaskspace decomposition for coordinated infinite-horizon skills: we developed an approach that learns a task made up of multiple coordinated subtasks, thus generating motions simultaneously satisfying constraints in different subtask-spaces. The resulting motions are also kinematically and environmentally feasible.\n\n\nActive learning through imitation of an expert questioner:  We developed a novel active learning approach that is the first to reason about environmental constraints within the objective function of the learner, and the first AL work to use imitation learning for mimicking the policy of an expert questioner. In experimental evaluations we showed that environmentally-aware reasoning allows our algorithm to significantly outperform an established AL baseline of uncertainty sampling and task-centric questioning strategies.\n\n\nIn addition to the above research, the project supported the career development efforts of two graduate students through conference, mentoring, and networking events.  Algorithmic techniques and datasets developed in this work have been made available to the research community, and hands-on demos of the work have been leveraged in outreach activities with over 500 participants.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/08/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Sonia Chernova"
