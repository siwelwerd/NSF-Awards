 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project will examine the determinants of concentration of poverty -- the extent to which the poor are isolated in high-poverty neighborhoods -- with emphasis on the role of public policies that shape metropolitan growth and development.  The investigators will use a longitudinal database of U.S. metropolitan areas to analyze the role of changes in the income distribution vs. changes in the spatial organization of households by race, ethnicity, and income across the cities and suburbs that make up metropolitan areas.  The project will provide new insights regarding the extent to which concentration of poverty is a function of the segregated pattern of the housing stock, especially new housing construction, and it will enhance understanding of the contribution of local control of development decisions and restrictive land-use policies in establishing a landscape of housing that creates and maintains concentration of poverty and segregation by race and class.  The project will test the hypothesis that concentration of poverty is the product of larger structural forces, political decisions, and institutional arrangements than usually are considered.  This research will provide the factual and empirical basis to determine what changes are needed in metropolitan development policies and practices if the nation is to reduce the concentration of the poor in high-poverty neighborhoods, and it will contribute to wider discussions regarding the critical contemporary issues of segregation, concentration of poverty, social mobility, and inequality.\r\n\r\nThe lived experience of poverty in the U.S., especially for poor African-American and Hispanic people, is shaped by the spatial organization of wealth and poverty.  Recent research has demonstrated clear links between neighborhood poverty and social and economic outcomes.  Unfortunately, the number of people living in high-poverty ghettos, barrios, and slums has nearly doubled since 2000, rising from 7.2 million to more than 14 million.  These increases were underway well before the recession began in 2007, so they reflect changes in the spatial organization of poverty as well as the effects of the financial crisis.  The investigators will examine the extent to which concentration of poverty has been driven by patterns of housing development that segregate metropolitan housing by type (single-family vs. multi-family), tenure (owner-occupied vs. rental), age of housing (median year built), and housing unit characteristics.  They will determine differential patterns of housing among and within metropolitan areas by assessing the constraints imposed by land use regulations, because density zoning, material restrictions, setback requirements, and other measures imposed by a highly fragmented set of local jurisdictions within metropolitan areas constrain market outcomes and channel housing construction towards local homogeneity and economic segregation at larger scales.  The investigators will use a multilevel longitudinal panel of neighborhoods, political jurisdictions (i.e., cities and suburbs), and metropolitan areas from 1970 onwards in order to decompose concentrated poverty into spatial and non-spatial components and to empirically measure the relationship of the spatial component to the pace and exclusivity of metropolitan development.",

It then rose again until reaching a peak in 2012, when nearly 15 million US residents lived in high-poverty neighborhoods. Sociologists, economists, public health researchers, and other scholars have demonstrated that such neighborhoods harm those who live in them, especially children. The problem is particularly acute for African Americans and Hispanics, who are far more likely to reside in high-poverty neighborhoods than non-Hispanic whites. This project studied the determinants of concentration of poverty, with a particular emphasis on the role of public policies that shape metropolitan growth and development.</p>\n<p>Inequality among a metropolitan area?s neighborhoods is driven by two quite different factors: 1) inequality among households and 2) the spatial sorting of households of various income levels across neighborhoods, i.e. economic segregation. We compiled a panel data set including almost all US metropolitan areas spanning four decades, from 1970 to 2010, using census-tract level data from the US Census and the American Community Survey. Because individual-level data is not available in consistent boundaries over this period for most metropolitan areas, we developed an innovative and highly accurate technique, Mean-Constrained Integration over Brackets (MCIB), for estimating inequality parameters from the grouped data available at the census tract level (Jargowsky and Wheeler 2018). One product of this project is a Stata package to produce the MCIB estimates.</p>\n<p>Between 1970 and 2010, income inequality at the household level increased in nearly all metropolitan areas, consistent with national and international trends. Figure 1 tracks the Gini Index for household income for the weighted average of 264 metropolitan areas, which increased steadily starting in 1980. However, the Gini Index for <em>neighborhood</em> inequality grew more rapidly than household inequality. The implication is that not only was there more economic inequality to go around, but there was also a greater degree of spatial sorting of households into neighborhoods on the basis of income. In other words, economic segregation must have increased.</p>\n<p>Virtually every metropolitan area saw rising inequality of household income. New York and Philadelphia, as shown in the left panel of Figure 2, both experienced rising household income inequality, but both had even faster increases in neighborhood inequality. This was the dominant pattern seen in most metropolitan areas and implies that economic segregation was rising in those areas. A few metropolitan areas, however, followed a different pattern. Neighborhood inequality also increased in Denver and Minneapolis, but only in proportion to the increase in household inequality, as shown in the right panel of Figure 2. Thus, in places like Denver and Minneapolis, there was more neighborhood inequality, but only because of the increase in household inequality; the degree of spatial sorting of household income among neighborhoods remained stable (Denver) or even decreased (Minneapolis).</p>\n<p>The variation in the levels of and trends in economic segregation among metropolitan area is driven in part by local decisions about zoning, land use policies, public transportation, highway construction, and affordable housing construction. We decomposed the concentration of poverty into the part due to changes in household inequality and the part due to economic segregation. The results showed that most of the variation in neighborhood inequality, both across metropolitan areas and within them over time, was due to economic segregation rather than increasing income inequality.</p>\n<p>In addition to creating high-poverty neighborhoods, restrictive land use policies increase housing costs for those who can least afford it. In dissertation research funded by this grant, Christopher Wheeler demonstrated that restrictive land use policies reduce housing affordability for African American and Hispanic homeowners and renters. This research was the first to estimate the impact of specific land-use regulations on housing affordability for different racial and ethnic subgroups of renters and homeowners.</p>\n<p>Exclusionary zoning and restrictive land use policies create a highly segregated pattern of housing by level of affordability - an architecture of segregation - across the metropolitan landscape. Figure 3 shows that even after controlling for a wide range of economic and demographic variables and metropolitan fixed effects, the proliferation of single-family homes in new suburbs contributes significantly to the concentration of poverty. In other words, high-poverty neighborhoods, most of which are found in the central cities and older inner-ring suburbs, are connected to suburban sprawl and the creation of high-income enclaves on the metropolitan periphery.</p>\n<p>A central implication of the research findings of this project is that concentration of poverty is not inevitable. We have it because we build highly unequal neighborhoods; indeed, most metropolitan areas require it. Thus, concentration of poverty is a policy choice. Given the documented harms of high-poverty neighborhood environments, most especially for children, there is a pressing need to address the exclusionary land use policies and development paradigms that produce and maintain the concentration of poverty.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/17/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Paul&nbsp;A&nbsp;Jargowsky</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1636520/1636520_10450590_1639760062612_outcomes_figure_1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1636520/1636520_10450590_1639760062612_outcomes_figure_1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1636520/1636520_10450590_1639760062612_outcomes_figure_1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Household and Neighborhood Inequality (Gini) Relative to 1970</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Paul A Jargowsky</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Paul&nbsp;A&nbsp;Jargowsky</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 1</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1636520/1636520_10450590_1639760207942_outcomes_figure_2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1636520/1636520_10450590_1639760207942_outcomes_figure_2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 2\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1636520/1636520_10450590_1639760207942_outcomes_figure_2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 2\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Household and Neighborhood Inequality (Gini) Relative to 1970, Selected Metropolitan Areas</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Paul A Jargowsky</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Paul&nbsp;A&nbsp;Jargowsky</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 2</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1636520/1636520_10450590_1639760334432_outcomes_figure_3--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1636520/1636520_10450590_1639760334432_outcomes_figure_3--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 3\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1636520/1636520_10450590_1639760334432_outcomes_figure_3--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 3\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The Effect of Exclusionary Share of New Housing Units on Concentration of Poverty, 2010 to 2016</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Paul A Jargowsky and Christopher Hess</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Paul&nbsp;A&nbsp;Jargowsky</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 3</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
