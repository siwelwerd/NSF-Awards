They will do this through a broad series of activities including workshops, assessments of interventions performed within chemistry departments, and broad dissemination of e.g. best practices.\r\n\r\nWork like that of Prof. Hernandez and his colleagues is aimed at finding effective means for recruitment and retention of the most talented Americans into the chemical enterprise.  Success in these efforts will have profound implications for American economic prosperity and continued competitiveness.",
