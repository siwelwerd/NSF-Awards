In recent years, there has been rapid development of experimental techniques that provide direct measurements of both equilibrium and non-equilibrium electronic structures, as have new calculational methods for the time-independent and time-dependent electronic structures. The workshop will allow researchers at the forefront of their fields to discuss, exchange ideas and explore applications of novel spectroscopies to correlated f-electron systems in a focused forum and also bridge the ever widening gap between time-resolved experiments and non-equilibrium theory. The participants will include graduate students, junior and senior faculty at US universities and national laboratories, as well as international leaders in the field.",
