 "awd_abstract_narration": "The search for new fundamental interactions of nature is at the heart of experimental particle physics.  The current Standard Model of particle physics has been enormously successful at describing current measurements, but it is an incomplete theory.  All of the experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) operating at CERN near Geneva, Switzerland are focused on discoveries beyond the Standard Model.  This project and the LHCb experiment as a whole seek new discoveries through precision measurements of particle decays produced at the LHC.  These measurements aim to answer questions stretching back to the Big Bang, such as, why is our universe dominated by matter and not antimatter? \r\n\r\nThis project involves two main components.  To improve the quality of data taken by LHCb and ensure it continues to produce excellent results throughout the next decade, construction of new detector upgrades is underway.  This project will lead the characterization and production of the silicon microstrip sensors that form the heart of the Upstream Tracker subdetector upgrade.  Using data collected by LHCb, a novel method will be employed to study decays containing particles that are difficult or impossible to measure directly.  As a result, new measurements will be performed of the mixing of quark flavors and the direct search for new interactions that violate conservation laws of the Standard Model.",
