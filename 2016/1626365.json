 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Washington, the Exploratorium, the Education Development Center, Inverness Research, and the University of Colorado - Boulder have come together to form a Research+Practice (R+P) Collaboratory.  The Collaboratory seeks to address and reframe the gap between research and practice in K-12 STEM education.  This gap persists despite decades of work by many leading organizations, associations, and individuals.  Attempts to close the gap have generally focused on creating resources and mechanisms that first explain or illustrate \"what research says\" and then invite educators to access and integrate findings into practice.  Recently, however, attention has turned to the ways in which the medical sciences are addressing the gap between research and clinical practice through the developing field of \"translational research.\"  In medicine, the strategy has been to shift the focus from adoption to adaptation of research into practice.  Implicit in the notion of adaptation is a bi-directional process of cultural exchange in which both researchers and practitioners come to understand how the knowledge products of each field can strengthen the professional activities in the other.  Along these lines, the R+P Collaboratory is working with leading professional associations and STEM improvement efforts to leverage their existing knowledge and experience and to build sustainable strategies for closing the gap.  Activities include:\r\n\r\n     -  Collecting, creating and synthesizing translational research resources to expand STEM educators' and educational leaders' access and awareness to current relevant research.\r\n     -  Supporting multiple opportunities for cross-sector (research and practice; education and social sciences; formal and informal) meetings to foster critical engagement and cultural exchange. \r\n     -  Testing, documenting and innovating new resources and mechanisms at Adaptation Sites and disseminating both products and results through the R+P Resource Center. \r\n\r\nThe R+P Collaboratory is developing an online 'Go-To' Resource Center website that houses the resources collected, created, and curated by the Collaboratory.  The Resource Center also has significant 'Take-Out' features, with all materials meta-tagged so that they can be automatically uploaded, reformatted, and integrated into the existing communication and professional development mechanisms (e.g., newsletters, digests, conferences, and websites) of a dozen leading professional associations within a Professional Association Partner Network.\r\n\r\nIn light of new and emerging standards in the STEM disciplines, the Collaboratory is focusing its work on four salient and timely bodies of research: (a) STEM Practices, (b) Formative Assessment, (c) Cyberlearning, and (d) Learning as a Cross-Setting Phenomenon.  Special emphasis is being placed on research and practice that focuses on the learning of children and youth from communities historically underrepresented in STEM fields.\r\n\r\nThe work of the R+P Collaboratory includes research and evaluation of its own efforts through studies aimed at answering the following questions:\r\n     -  How are Collaboratory resources and engagement activities accessed, experienced and leveraged by participants?\r\n     -  What resources, mechanisms and learning contexts support cultural exchange among STEM education researchers and practitioners?\r\n     -  What new kinds of practices result when research-based evidence is adapted into evidence-based practices, and how does it change learning opportunities for K-12 aged children?\r\n     -  How can effective strategies, mechanisms and resources of the Collaboratory be scaled and adapted to new contexts?",

This approach assumes that research has answers to the questions of practice, and that these answers need only be disseminated and then applied in some straightforward way, resulting in improved practice.</p>\n<p>Through the Research + Practice Collaboratory we framed the problem differently. We argued that education research needs more active involvement of STEM educators, across all levels of the system and at all stages of research. Our approach was based on decades of research on the \"use of research\" that reveals that most educators do not find education research, as presented in reports and summaries, directly relevant or applicable to their most pressing problems and challenges.

It produces tools and findings that speak directly to the concerns of educators. This approach also represents a more ethical approach to education research by giving equal voice to the insights, experiences, and complex working conditions of practitioners on the frontlines of advancing equity and excellence in STEM education.</p>\n<p>We studied three kinds of activities.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>1) CREATING CONTEXTS FOR CRITICAL ENGAGEMENT&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The communities of research and practice have distinct cultural norms, languages, and routines that can get in the way of productive communication. We experimented with ways to support mutual cultural exchange between these communities, in order to produce new insights and strategies for tackling pressing problems in STEM education. For example, Inquiry Group convenings of educators and researchers around a shared implementation topic produced novel approaches.</p>\n<p>We helped over 3,000 educators, researchers, and scientists learn about research-practice partnerships. Our workshops have egnaged CSforAll, the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), the Center for Advancement of Informal Science Education (CAISE), Lucas Education Research, and the National Alliance for Broader Impacts (NABI). A key focus involved building capacity among early career educational researchers to take up partnership approaches through webinars, workshops, and sponsored engagements.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>2) BUILDING AND STUDYING RESEARCH + PRACTICE PARTNERSHIPS</p>\n<p>Too frequently, educational research is conceived and designed in isolation from practice. We need more collaborative approaches that engage formal and informal educators, researchers, and students to jointly discuss and design opportunities for improving STEM education. Guided by a&nbsp;<a href=\"http://learndbir.org/\">Design-Based Implementation Research (DBIR) approach</a>, we built local research-practice partnerships to support equitable, meaningful, and purposeful connections.</p>\n<p>These strategic partnerships focused on equitable STEM education that spanned 44 US state contexts and 2 US territories. This work included the Council of State Science Supervisors (CSSS), CSforAll network, Afterschool Alliance, CAISE, National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM), and National Science Teaching Association (NSTA). The collaborations supported the flow of ideas and resources through networks focused on promoting equity in STEM education (e.g., broadening participation in CS, promoting cultural pedagogies in science education, equalizing early mathematics learning opportunities in rural settings).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>3) DEVELOPING RESEARCH + PRACTICE RESOURCES</p>\n<p>We published numerous resources on developing and managing research-practice partnerships, including a&nbsp;<a href=\"http://researchandpractice.org/toolkit/\">multifaceted partnership toolkit</a>&nbsp;and two books:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.routledge.com/Connecting-Research-and-Practice-for-Educational-Improvement-Ethical-and/Bevan-Penuel/p/book/9781138287310\">Connecting Research and Practice for Educational Improvement: Ethical and Equitable Approaches</a>&nbsp;(Bronwyn Bevan and William R. Penuel, eds.) and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.hepg.org/hep-home/books/creating-research-practice-partnerships-in-educati\">Creating Research-Practice Partnerships in Education</a>&nbsp;(by William R. Penuel and Dan Gallagher).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Teaching tools developed through engagement between research and practice integrate evidence-based approaches with practical considerations of the teaching context. The process of co-designing and testing tools can created powerful contexts for cultural exchange and the development of new insights. Our conjecture about producing more relevant and useable educational resources by having educators and researchers co-design them was overwhelmingly supported across our efforts.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We produced resources on research-practice partnerships and on equitable STEM education that have had millions of uses, shifting educational practice on-the-ground. In one initiative (led by Pam Buffington) a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://tinyurl.com/EDC-Interactive-STEM\">collection of videos</a>&nbsp;and research briefs were broadly used to support the equitable teaching of mathematics across rural networks.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In another effort, the STEM Teaching Tools site (<a href=\"http://stemteachingtools.org/\">http://stemteachingtools.org/</a>)&nbsp;edited by Philip Bell currently receives ~10,000 visitors each month and its Twitter account engages people with resources ~85,000 times each month.

It represents a novel way to share knowledge and tools synthesized from research and practice with educators in relevant, timely, and actionable ways.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The work of the Research + Practice Collaboratory continues through a variety of other efforts working to promote equitable STEM education through partnership-centered approaches (e.g.,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://cosss.org/ACESSE\">ACESSE</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.colorado.edu/program/inquiryhub/\">InquiryHub</a>).</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 07/30/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Philip&nbsp;L&nbsp;Bell</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1626365/1626365_10218648_1627588845350_RPP-Toolkit-card--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1626365/1626365_10218648_1627588845350_RPP-Toolkit-card--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Research-Practice Toolkit\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1626365/1626365_10218648_1627588845350_RPP-Toolkit-card--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Research-Practice Toolkit\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Research-Practice Toolkit developed by the Research + Practice Collaboratory</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">The Research + Practice Collaboratory team</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Philip&nbsp;L&nbsp;Bell</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Research-Practice Toolkit</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1626365/1626365_10218648_1627588971405_STEM-Teaching-Tools--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1626365/1626365_10218648_1627588971405_STEM-Teaching-Tools--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"STEM Teaching Tools Overview\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1626365/1626365_10218648_1627588971405_STEM-Teaching-Tools--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"STEM Teaching Tools Overview\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Brief description of this collection of resources for science and STEM educators on equitable approaches to teaching.
