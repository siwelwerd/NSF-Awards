 "awd_abstract_narration": "The dynamics and time-evolution of subduction are driven by mechanical and chemical processes that influence buoyancy forces, slab motion, contrasting thermal fields, phase equilibria, and volatile transport. By enhancing mass transfer and energy release, the cycle of fluids (and in particular, hydrous silicate melts) in subduction zones is a major component of slab recycling, arc volcanism, and continent-building processes. A better understanding of the role of melt and volatiles in subduction is therefore key to improving our knowledge of the structure and composition of subduction zones as well as geodynamic processes at work. It can also help us better assess volcanic and earthquake hazards in these contexts.\r\n\r\nThis project is a multi-disciplinary and multi-scale investigation of the electrical conductivity of hydrous silicate melts in subduction context, at the depth of the mantle wedge and shallower, in order to characterize and model the electrical response of hydrous melts in subduction zones. In situ electrical measurements will be performed at pressure and temperature conditions relevant to subduction zones on dry and hydrous silicate melts. The major objective is to understand better the transport properties of melts and volatiles in subduction zones as imaged by geophysical (electromagnetic) surveys.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe high pressure laboratory at ASU does high pressure experiments on samples of minerals, rocks and other materials under extreme pressures and temperatures, equivalent to the Earth's upper mantle, transition zone, and the top of the lower mantle.  At the same time, the samples are large enough (millimeters in size) to measure the electrical conductivity of the minerals and rocks directly.  Such electrical conductivity experiments have been done on solid mineral and rock specimens for about 20 years in a few multi-anvil laboratories, and have given us insight into the electrical properties of the crust and upper mantle.  However, the methods have not been readily available to any startup laboratorythat wants to try them.  Also, the measurements become more difficult if the sample melts.  We have not yet been able to obtain electrical measurements on melted samples at high pressure.\n\nIn this study, we wanted to gather information on both solid and molten samples and to measure their electrical conductivity at high pressures and temperatures.  We had to develop a cell that could contain the melts in a small cylinder at high temperature, and yet could also have electrodes at both ends to do the necessary electrical measurements to understand melted rocks and also molten metals under pressure.  We designed a new cell and succeeded in containing the melts while measuring their conductivities.\n\nThe cell designs were mostly done at ASU by co-PI Kurt Leinenweber with input from the PI Anne Pommier at Scripps Oceanographic Institute in San Diego, while the measurements, scientific interpretations and conclusions were done in San Diego and also at the x-ray beamline of University of Chicago - GSECARS - located at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne, Illinois.\n\nThe first major publication from the project was a technical description of the high-pressure experimental configuration developed for this study.  It was published in the journal American Mineralogist.  \n\nThe second publication had to do with the measurement of electrical conductivity of samples of iron and sulfier (combined) that were relevant to the core of Mercury.  The experiments were done at the same pressure as the core of Mercury, and over a range of temperatures.  The melting of the sample could be observed in the electrical signals (and was verified at the beam line, the subject of possible future publications).  The sample did not leak significantly during or after the melting, as shown by post-run analysis, and the sample could me melted by heating and then recrystallized by cooling, while still making electrical measurements.  The results gave insight into the possible liquid FeS layer of Mercury's core, showing experimentally that such a layer will be electrically insulating.\n\nThe technology developed here is freely available to the high pressure community through the COMPRES Multi-Anvil Cell Assembly Development project.  So far two laboratories (in addition to ASU and Scripps) have received all the parts to make working cell assemblies for high pressure/temperature electrical conductivity measurements.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/17/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Kurt Leinenweber"
