 "awd_abstract_narration": "Texas A&M International University (TAMIU), an Hispanic Serving Institution implements the College of Arts & Sciences Community-aid (CASC-Aid) project in which 18 academically talented students with financial need majoring in Mathematics, Mathematics Education, Physical Science, Pre-Engineering, and Systems Engineering receive up to $6,800 for the academic year. In addition to offering financial assistance, CASC-aid addresses issues such as mathematics anxiety by providing an opportunity for scholars to share their previous math experiences and by offering Learning Support, an alternative to traditional recitation that engages learners in real-world applications and anticipates common misconceptions for those in early college math courses. Other components of the project include professor-led Community Tutoring; Success Workshops that cultivate mentoring; and, events and resources such as career guidance, advising, and field trips. The CASC-aid project will advance knowledge and understanding through a multifaceted evaluation plan and the investigation of research questions related to Learning Support, mathematics anxiety, and mindset. It will increase the number and promote the teaching of underrepresented and underserved students in STEM disciplines due to the investigation of the impact of each component with respect to TAMIU's undergraduate student population that is 59% female, 95% Hispanic, 57% low-income, and 57% first-generation.\r\n\r\nThe College of Arts & Sciences Community-aid (CASC-Aid) project consists of a primary intervention, Learning Support, with My Math Story plus Introduction/Welcome Letter used for recruitment and retention, as a second intervention strategy. From prior research and teaching experiences, Learning Support is anticipated to be the most effective intervention. Multiple research questions are included where the outcomes or statistical findings can be converted to effect sizes for practical interpretation to determine which intervention strategy is most effective. The effect sizes from the Learning Support and My Math Story outcomes in the research questions will be computed to a d effect size measure. Effects sizes permit placing statistical results (F-test, t-test, chi-square, z-test) on the same reference scale. The CASC-aid project has the potential to significantly advance knowledge and understanding through the multifaceted evaluation plan and the investigation of research questions related to Learning Support, mathematics anxiety, and mindset. The goals and scope of the CASC-aid project are to develop, implement, and evaluate a program that fosters a community of academic success for Hispanic STEM students by enveloping mathematics courses with academic and student support services.",

The original end date of the project was August 31, 2021. Due to COVID 19, two one-year-no-cost extension requests for the project were submitted and approved.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Investigators of the CASC-aid project include Drs. Jane Elizabeth Casey (Former Co-PI), Hoonandara Goonatilake (Co-PI), Won Kim (Co-PI), Runchang Lin (PI), Selina Mireles (Former Co-PI), and Xuesong Wang (Former Co-PI). In addition to the PI/CoPIs, Drs. Saqib Hussain, David Milovich, Hongwei Wang, Qingquan Wu, and Ms. Sofia Maldonado have served as Senior Personnel and faculty mentors for the CASC-aid project. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, six graduate assistants (GAs) had been hired for the CASC-aid project to provide the proposed Learning Support in Mathematics. The GAs are Oscar Benavides, Ramiro Castillo, Rafael Colunga Vasquez, Jacinto De La Cruz Hernandez, Aracely De La Torre, and Mimi Yang. During and after the pandemic, the proposed Learning Support in Mathematics was provided by TAMIU Academic Center for Excellence.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The total awarded amount for the CASC-aid project was $999,998, which allowed TAMIU to offer an annual scholarship of up to $6,800 to a minimum of 18 undergraduate students every semester. From the spring 2017 semester to the spring 2023 semester (a total of 13 semesters), the CASC-aid project has provided 254 semester-wise scholarships to 95 students (many students have been provided the scholarship for more than one semester) with a total amount of $729,875, which helped them to complete a total of 3,557 semester credit hours. On the other hand, about $31,700 were paid to PI/CoPIs and senior personnel of the project, $37,000 were used to hire external evaluators, and $97,150 were paid to GAs for their services.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Among the 95 CASC-aid scholars, 91 (95.8%) students were Hispanic or Latino, and 39 (41.1%) students were female. As for their majors, 7 students were in Biology/Chemistry, 40 were in Mathematics, 37 were in Engineering (including Computer Engineering, Systems Engineering, Petroleum Engineering), and 11 were in Pre-Engineering (students in this program will transfer to Engineering programs at other institutions). By the end of the summer 2023 semester, 59 CASC-aid (58 Hispanic or Latino, 25 female) scholars have graduated from STEM Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science programs at TAMIU, including 6 students in Biology/Chemistry, 25 in Mathematics, and 28 in Engineering; 10 pre-engineering students have transferred to engineering programs at other institutions. The other CASC-aid scholars are still working for their degrees in STEM disciplines at TAMIU.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In addition to financial support, the CASC-aid project has provided other services and support to the CASC-aid scholars and all STEM students in general at TAMIU. (1) From the Spring 2017 semester to the Spring 2019 semester, the project has provided GA-led Learning Support study sessions/workshops for students in College Algebra, and Calculus I-III. (2) The PI/CoPIs have offered professor-led Community Tutoring services for CASC-aid scholars. (3) Since Fall 2017, the CASC-aid project has sponsored/co-sponsored 31 seminar presentations for Success Workshops. (4) A faculty mentor has been assigned to every CASC-aid scholar. Career guidance, advising, and research opportunities have been provided to CASC-aid scholars. Though, during the COVID-19 pandemic, TAMIU has experienced difficulties as most other institutions, we have managed to deliver as many services to the CASC-aid scholars as possible remotely.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The CASC-aid PI/CoPIs have investigated research questions related to Learning Support, mathematics anxiety, mindset, etc. Research outcomes have been published in peer reviewed journals and/or presented in national conferences.</p>\n<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kim, Won G. and Lin, Runchang and Goonatilake, Rohitha, \"Hispanic STEM Undergraduates&rsquo; Narratives of Mathematics Learning Experiences\", the 2022 AAC&amp;U Conference on Transforming STEM Higher Education, Arlington, VA, November 3-5, 2022.</p>\n<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Casey, J.
