 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThis award is a request to fund a set of research training cruises on the University of\r\nMinnesota?s R/V Blue Heron for early career scientists. The  work will have two goals:\r\n1) teach early career lacustrine scientists how to acquire, plan for, and manage cruises aboard\r\nUNOLS ships, introducing a new generation of scientists to UNOLS and the academic fleet; and\r\n2) expose members of the Great Lakes scientific community, which has an abysmally low submittal\r\nrate of proposals to NSF requesting UNOLS ships, to UNOLS and the academic fleet. The awardee\r\nundertaken two successful Chief Scientist Training Cruises (in 2014 and 2015) and with this\r\n will expand the number of participants and our area of operations from solely Lake\r\nSuperior to both Lakes Superior and Michigan.\r\nIntellectual Merit :\r\nThe training cruise envisioned herein will allow early career scientists to collect seed data\r\nand test hypotheses for future proposals to NSF.\r\nBroader Impacts :\r\nThis proposal intends to educate the next generation of researchers about the capabilities\r\nof UNOLS. This type of outreach between UNOLS and potential users is not only important for\r\nthe broader scientific community, but doubly important for the Great Lakes community which\r\nunderutilizes UNOLS assets.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nUsing funds provided by the National Science Foundation in grant OCE-1638454 ?EAGER &ndash; Great Lakes Research for Early Career Scientists?, the University of Minnesota Duluth was able to stage multiple workshops and take five groups of early career researchers (graduate students, post doctorial researchers, and 1st and 2nd year faculty members) out on multiday cruises on the University?s research vessel, the Blue Heron.  These workshops and short cruises were undertaken to help counter two problems, one specific to the Great Lakes basin, and one impacting marine research in general.  In the Great Lakes basin, researchers often underestimate their vessel and equipment needs for work on the big lakes.  Since the Great Lakes can be quite dangerous in a small vessel this can endanger researchers.  For the broader marine research field, there is a concern that early career scientists are not receiving the training they need in how to acquire, plan for, and manage cruises aboard the research vessels found in the U.S. academic fleet (UNOLS-University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System).  With these workshop and cruises we not only gave some early career scientists the training they need to be successful Chief Scientists, but also exposed future Great Lakes researchers to work aboard a well-outfitted research vessel, the R/V Blue Heron.\n\n \n\nThe programs were very successful.  Post program assessments indicate that the participants felt the program was useful.  Some comments:\n\n \n\n\"This cruise was a fantastic opportunity to learn by experience.  It is difficult to teach leadership, but this program does it well by giving the chief-scientists-in-training the freedom to develop a cruise plan on their own and learn the responsibilities and logistics that go along with it. I came home with a 5 page list of things to do differently on my next cruise, but also twice as much data as I expected.
