 "awd_abstract_narration": "Control technology makes it possible to use robotics for manufacturing and autopilots for autonomous vehicles. Control technology enhances productivity, efficiency, and safety. Applications that are especially challenging require computer algorithms that can adapt to unpredictable changes in the system and its environment. This project will use adaptive control to improve the performance of engines that burn fuel in combustion processes.  These engines are used worldwide to generate energy for the electrical grid.  The challenging problem is to burn the fuel more efficiently and reduce pollution despite changes in the demand for electricity.  The technology developed under this project will enhance the operation and reliability of the electrical grid while reducing the emission of greenhouse gases and soot particles.  The project will involve students from multiple engineering disciplines and will enhance the diversity of future professionals working in this area of technology.\r\n \r\nThis project will advance knowledge and understanding in the theory and practice of feedback control by developing diagnostic modeling techniques for retrospective cost adaptive control (RCAC). The modeling information required by RCAC concerns the presence of specific features (such as right-half-plane zeros and nonlinearities) as well as the accuracy with which those features must be known (locations of the right-half-plane zeros and details of the nonlinearities).  As an extension of RCAC, adaptation and closed-loop identification are performed concurrently as dual RCAC (DRCAC). This technique depends on efficient algorithms for biquadratic optimization. If identification with DRCAC using feedback sensors fails to reveal the essential modeling details, then non-feedback sensors with more in-depth diagnostic capability will be used to probe the system to obtain data for calibrating reduced-fidelity models. These models will be used by DRCAC for online analysis and closed-loop simulation, and, if necessary, the feedback sensing and actuation strategy will be modified. The intellectual objective of this project is a deeper understanding of dual control and the development of the diagnostic methodology in order to facilitate adaptive control of complex systems in theory and practice.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOverview \n\nWhen fuel is combusted in gas turbine engines, there is a tendency for the combustion to cause thermoacoustic oscillations.  These oscillations appear as noise and vibration, which can damage the engine.  This is especially the case when the engine is operated with a lean fuel mixture, which is desirable for minimizing pollution.  Under lean operation, thermoacoustic oscillations can lead to engine shutdown, which may be dangerous.  It has long been a technological goal to use feedback control to actively suppress thermoacoustic oscillations while maintaining the efficiency and power output of the engine. \n\nTo make progress toward that goal, this project combined advanced computational modeling techniques with adaptive control.  Computational modeling was used to help design, build, and analyze a sophisticated laboratory-scale combustor that exhibits thermoacoustic oscillations.  This combustor, called the Dual Independent Swirl Combustor (DISCo), uses controllable valves to vary the fuel rate and has thermal and pressure sensors to monitor its operation.\n\nTo suppress thermoacoustic oscillations in DISCo, we refined and applied an adaptive control technique called Retrospective Cost Adaptive Control (RCAC).  RCAC was implemented on a real-time computer that collects sensor data, implements the control algorithm, and sends valve commands in a fraction of a second.  RCAC uses sensor data to determine suitable valve settings and requires only rudimentary knowledge of the complex dynamics of DISCo.  Laboratory experiments showed that RCAC can suppress the thermoacoustic oscillations in DISCo while maintaining the power output. \n\n \n\nIntellectual Merit\n\nThis project advanced knowledge in combustor analysis and design through computational techniques.  This project also advanced adaptive control of complex systems by providing a challenging venue for refining, implementing, and testing adaptive controllers.\n\n \n\nBroader Impacts \n\nThe technology developed under this project is useful in diverse applications.  In particular, reduced-order modeling of complex combustion dynamics is applicable to the analysis and design of rocket engines for atmospheric and space applications.\n\nIn addition, the improvements achieved in adaptive control will benefit other applications, especially technology that involves complex, high-frequency dynamics.  For example, this technique is being applied to unstart mitigation in scramjet engines.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/02/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Dennis S Bernstein"
