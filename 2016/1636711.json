The original\r\nproject funded the survey of over 80 municipalities in Sweden, Finland, and Norway\r\nusing a mixed method of face to face interviews and web-based survey. However, the\r\nweb-based survey response was much lower than anticipated and the face to face\r\nsurvey interviews were more productive than anticipated. This award will allow the PI to\r\nincrease the response rate and the data gathered by completing an additional 40\r\ninterviews face-to-face from the originally planned web-based survey.",
