 "awd_abstract_narration": "Risk perception and natural hazard mitigation traditionally are done by federal agencies in the US and other developed nations.  Research, planning, and mitigation have been top-down for many decades.  A recent development is to reverse that directionality, embedding hazards planning and mitigation in local communities.  Even the American Planning Association in 2014 recognized the importance of granting planning and mitigation authority to local communities.  Experiences of other cultures and at other times when they faced disasters can assist hazard planning in contemporary societies.  The predominance of scholarship of the ancient Maya in Central America is that the elite controlled everything, a thoroughly top-down picture of the elites running the power hierarchy, economy, society, and religion.  Because elite architecture is regularly built out of solid stone, the palaces, pyramids, temples, and tombs preserve better than commoner architecture.  And archaeologists have favored the elite architecture and artifacts, leading to the perception of elites as being all-powerful.  Archaeologists have spent proportionally little effort in examining the lives of commoners, in part because of poor preservation of their remains.  Only rarely is a \"clear window\" into commoner life discovered, and fortunately one of them is the Ceren site in El Salvador. It is a village exclusively of Maya commoners buried by a sudden volcanic eruption in AD 660.\r\nThe project has been investigating levels of authority, and has discovered a surprisingly large roadway from the village leading south.  Excavations will reveal the beginnings of the roadway in the village, and therefore its functions.  Its construction and maintenance evidently were decided within the community.  Geophysical instruments will search for the roadway under the 15 feet of volcanic ash that bury it. Ground-penetrating radar and resistivity tomography are the instruments that will be employed.  Test pits will confirm and follow the roadway.  One apparent branch of the roadway began at Structure 10, the community ritual structure where the harvest ceremony was being held when the eruption began.  There was very little time between the initial warning and the arrival of the hot volcanic ash, but what is striking is the emergency evacuation was successful even though it was at night.  People literally \"headed south\" on the roadway, and we have discovered their footprints while they were fleeing.  This is an example of local authority successfully reacting quickly to an emergency, without having to wait for a top-down decision from elite authority.   The roadway may branch in the village, and lead to a structure that may be at the social or political end, and that building will be excavated in the second year of the project.  A team of the finest experts in earthen architecture preservation have been assembled to improve conservation of this World Heritage archaeological site.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe primary objective of this archaeological project in the Arenal area of Costa Rica was to detect and confirm the processionall footpath heading eastward from the Silencio cemetery to the village using it, from 500 BC to AD 600.  Using the full range of digital and analog remote sensing from NASA and our drone, we were successful in finding that village, close to Arenal volcano.  It erupted 10 times in 4000 years, requiring abandonment of the egalitarian village (and others) for a few decades.  They shared the cemetery with a village far west of the cemetery, where the environmental hazard was drought.  Much cooking, feasting, and rituals were performed in the cemetery, thus providing time to arrange for providing refuge in times of emergency  for each of the villages, and for social contacts leading to marriges with a partner from the other village.  The villages held only a few hundred residents, so exogamous marrige was necessary.  Now that the eastern village is discovered, it is clear that sophisticated perception and mitigation of environmental emergencies were effected.  Ths could serve as a stimulus for modern towns or cities today facing natural disasters to make preparations for future evacuations.\n\nAn exciting unanticipated discovery was made by excavating through three meters of volcanic ash below the footpath: a superbly preserved house floor dating to 1500 BC.  This is the earliest evidence of sedentary life in Costa Rica, and evidently the earliest in lower Central America.  It will be featured in a manuscript submitted to the journal Latin American Antiquity, because of its importance.  One might expect that such early residences and sedentism would have led to population increases resulting in the emergence of more complex societies, such as chiefdoms and perhaps states in this area.  That is compared to other regions where hunting and gathering with high residential mobility continued for many centuries after that time, and complex societies did emerge.  In those areas with chiefdoms, and with states in northern Central America, warfare became endemic, and the inequalities between elites and commoners became exacerbated.  The puzzle that we are dealing with now is trying to figure out how these egalitarian villagers in the Arenal area were successful in avoiding overpopulation and social-economic-political inequalities, in contrast to societies to their north and south. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/01/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Payson Sheets"
