 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will advance efforts of the innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program to better understand and promote practices that increase students' motivations and capacities to pursue careers in fields of science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) by producing empirical findings and/or research tools that contribute to knowledge about which models and interventions with K-12 students and teachers are most likely to increase capacity in the STEM and STEM cognate intensive workforce of the future.\r\n\r\nThe project will answer questions about: 1) the effectiveness of experiences to promote competency, motivation, and persistence for productive participation in STEM; 2) how to engage teachers to use and integrate technology related to STEM careers; and 3) the role industry plays in motivating students to pursue STEM careers and preparing teachers to support STEM career awareness. The project will promote junior high and high school students' interest, skills, knowledge, and career aspirations in engineering through authentic engineering design activities related to building automation. The approach is to use connected devices (known as the internet of things) and additive manufacturing (3D printing) as the basic technological learning tools to be used by the junior high and high school students. The project will acquaint students to these new technologies in which the workforce of the future will need to be comfortable working with these connected devices, how new manufacturing processes work, and understanding the role these technologies can play in the modern enterprise. \r\n\r\nThe project will use the combination of teacher training, community outreach, industry support, and community college partnership to promote STEM careers among junior high school and high school students. The project plan consists of three main activities: 1) the incorporation of authentic design activities related to building automation and supported by industry professionals into junior high and high school classes; 2) the creation of summer programs for junior high school students to create connected devices; and 3) the creation of a dual credit course to be offered in high schools for community college credit using examples from building automation. The project will systematically evaluate the effect of authentic experiential learning activities related to engineering design on students' interests, skills, knowledge, and career aspirations. The work will also examine the effectiveness of a teacher professional development program in preparing teachers to implement authentic engineering design activities. Both the university faculty and industry representatives as collaborators, the project will examine the role these other professionals play in helping teachers overcome any doubts or apprehension they have in engineering design instruction. The project will allow a diverse group of students to learn about new technologies and STEM careers through authentic experiential learning activities and the participation of industry will allow students to better understand what engineers do and why math and science are critical to these technical professions.  The project partners with the Houston Independent School District (HISD), the largest school district in Texas and the 7th largest in the United States, and the proposed work will have significant impact with HISD and their 62% Hispanic and 25% African-American student population, allowing an underserved populations to learn about potential careers in STEM.",

IoT) and additive manufacturing (also known as 3D printing). The project used two delivery modes to provide this content to student participants. The first was a direct camp mode. This was a one-week camp where students engaged in a smart home building contest. The students built a small scale ?home? that tracked simulated energy use and designed solutions that reduced this energy consumption. These designed solutions used IoT and 3D printing solutions.&nbsp;&nbsp;The second mode was the training of teachers and the teachers subsequent incorporation of activities into their lesson plans. The teacher training included a two-week professional development program that brought teachers to the campus of Texas A&amp;M University. The teachers were given the technical background on IoT and 3D printing and then provided content on the engineering design process and authentic experiential learning activities. They worked with Texas A&amp;M faculty to develop lesson plans using the technology to teach math and science concepts. Scaled down versions of these lessons were trialed with student volunteers over a two-day period. The teachers then returned to their schools to implement their lesson plans. Over the project period, five camps were conducted in Bryan and Mission, Texas. These camps served a total of 43 student: 14 in Mission and 29 in Bryan. A total of 39 teachers completed the professional development activities. While the exact number of students impacted is not known, consent forms and pre-implementation data were collected from almost 1200 students.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The intellectual merit of this work involved systematically evaluating the impact of the camps and teacher-based interventions. The targeted populations for both modes of delivery included students and their parents. In the case of the teacher-based delivery mode, the impact of the professional development activities on the teachers was also investigated. To investigate the impact on students two instruments were used to collect data, the first was the ?Draw an Engineer Test? (DAET). This has participants draw that they think engineers look like and answer some questions about what they think engineers do. Student participants also took the Student Attitudes toward STEM Survey (S- STEM); this instrument measures math, science, and engineering attitudes as well as thoughts regarding necessary skills for the 21<sup>st</sup>&nbsp;century. Students took the S-STEM and DAET prior to and after their camp or school lesson.&nbsp;&nbsp;Teacher participants took the Teacher Efficacy and Attitudes Toward STEM Survey (T-STEM), the Design, Engineering, and Technology (DET), and DAET instruments before their professional development, after the professional development and after the implementation of their lessons. The T-STEM asks about teaching efficacy, student technology use, teaching attitudes, and STEM career awareness. The DET asks about the importance and familiarity with design, engineering, and technology as well as the characteristics of engineers and how to implement the teaching of engineering. Parents were asked about their knowledge of building automation, engineering design, IoT, and engineering careers. The results from the students showed statistically significant improvements in math attitudes among all participants and improvements in engineering and technology attitudes among the camp participants. Teachers? DAET showed improved understanding of engineering processes which was in line with their statistically significant improvements in the familiarity of engineering and characteristics of engineers aspects of the DET survey post professional development. Parents also had statistically significant improvements in their knowledge of the topics asked about after their child?s participation in the project activities. Overall, the activities seem to have improved student, parent, and especially teacher knowledge and aptitude with respect to engineering and technology.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The broader impact of this project was focused on allowing a diverse group of students to learn about new and exciting technologies through authentic experiential learning activities. While the camps served a diverse group of students that were 44% female and 67% underrepresented minority, it was a small number of participants. However, the teachers trained in the professional development activities continue to have the knowledge and resources available to impact students. The majority of the teachers that participated in the project came from the Houston Independent School District; this district comprises a student population that is over 80% underrepresented minorities in STEM. The majority of the remaining teachers were also from districts that served large minority populations. Overall, this project provided these teachers with a valuable experience that will continue to benefit students.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/01/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Michael&nbsp;D&nbsp;Johnson</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1615019/1615019_10455009_1637775676659_SmartHome--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1615019/1615019_10455009_1637775676659_SmartHome--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Smart Home\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1615019/1615019_10455009_1637775676659_SmartHome--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Smart Home\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A picture of a smart home built by camp participants.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Emel Cevik</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (restricted use - cannot be shared)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Michael&nbsp;D&nbsp;Johnson</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Smart Home</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1615019/1615019_10455009_1637775945844_IMG_5775--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1615019/1615019_10455009_1637775945844_IMG_5775--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Teachers at Professional Development Workshop\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1615019/1615019_10455009_1637775945844_IMG_5775--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Teachers at Professional Development Workshop\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Teachers working at the professional development workshop at Texas A&M</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Michael Johnson</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (restricted use - cannot be shared)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Michael&nbsp;D&nbsp;Johnson</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Teachers at Professional Development Workshop</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
