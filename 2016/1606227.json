 "awd_abstract_narration": "Vibrations of macroscopic mechanical oscillators such as a guitar string, a tuning fork, or a drum membrane can be well described with classical physics.  This is no longer true, however, if the mechanical oscillators are cooled to sufficiently low temperature such that thermal mechanical motion becomes negligible. In this limit the mechanical oscillators can behave like quantum mechanical systems that contain discrete amounts, or quanta, of vibrational energy.  Recent experimental and theoretical research has paved the way to use these quantum behaviors for quantum information processing and to make better sensors.  Cooling mechanical oscillators to the required ultra-low temperatures, however, is difficult.  The primary goal of this project is to explore experimental approaches that can maintain or preserve the desired quantum processes or properties even in the presence of significant thermal noise (i.e., at elevated temperature).  The project exploits special types of interactions that return the mechanical oscillator to its original state after the completion of the relevant quantum operations.  These quantum operations can function at elevated temperature without the complexity and technical challenge of cooling the mechanical oscillator to its quantum ground state.  The experimental project also provides training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students in areas of both scientific and technological importance.  This training prepares the students for careers in academia, industry, or government.  \r\n\r\n        \tThe experimental research will be carried out in a multimode optomechanical system that couples acoustic whispering gallery modes (WGMs) to optical WGMs in an on-chip silica microsphere via triply resonant Brillouin scattering.  This system takes full advantage of optical WGMs that feature ultrahigh finesse and acoustic WGMs that have no clamping loss.  This research will use a class of optomechanical Hamiltonian that returns the mechanical oscillator to its initial state after the desired coherent operations, thus disentangling the optical and mechanical systems.  These operations resemble the Sorensen-Molmer mechanism for entanglement of trapped ions in a thermal environment.  Optomechanical pi-pulses which can induce state swapping between two relevant optical modes, but leave the mechanical system unchanged, will be used for the implementation of mechanically-mediated optical state transfer.  Detuned sideband coupling, such as that which extends the Sorensen-Molmer entanglement scheme for trapped ions to the bosonic optomechanical system, will be used for mechanically-mediated optical entanglement.  These thermally-robust optomechanical operations can play an important role in developing optomechanical quantum interfaces that can function in an easily accessible thermal environment.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis experimental program at the University of Oregon explores the use of mechanical forces of light to manipulate and control mechanical vibrations of an optical resonator.  These so-called optomechanical interactions have been exploited for the conversion of an optical pulse to a mechanical vibration and for the conversion of the mechanical vibration back to an optical pulse that features a different wavelength.  Together, these two processes can effectively change the color or wavelength of an optical pulse.  This type of optical wavelength conversion can play an essential role in quantum communication networks, in which quantum systems couple to light with different wavelengths or colors. \n\nA special emphasis of this research program is multimode systems, in which two mechanical modes couple to a common optical mode or two optical modes couple to a common mechanical mode.  Interferences between these couplings are important for understanding optomechanical interactions in these multimode systems.  For example, when two mechanical modes couple to a common optical mode, destructive interference between the respective optomechanical coupling processes can prevent the coupling of the overall mechanical system to the optical mode, leading to the formation of an optically-dark mechanical superposition mode.  Similarly, a mechanically-dark optical superposition mode can be formed when two optical modes couple to a common mechanical mode.  These dark modes can be used for the realization of optical wavelength conversions and also for the generation of so-called squeezed mechanical vibrations that are only possible in a quantum world.  These squeezed mechanical vibrations can be quieter than the quantum vacuum and can thus be useful for applications such as sensitive or precise measurements. \n\nConstructive and destructive optomechanical interferences have been demonstrated in this program by varying the relative phase of the optical fields that couple to the respective mechanical modes.  With a 180-degree phase shift, these interference processes can effectively switch the mechanical system from an optically-active to an optically-dark superposition mode.  Additional experiments on the decay of the dark mode reveal directly the decoupling of the mechanical superposition mode from the optical mode due to the destructive optomechanical interference.  Overall, these studies establish that interference is a powerful and essential tool for controlling the interactions between light and mechanical oscillators. \n\nThis research program has also made important contributions to education and human resource by providing training for graduate and undergraduate students in areas of both scientific and technological importance. One graduate student supported by this program obtained a PhD degree in physics.  Another student supported by this program obtained a master\u2019s degree in physics. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/02/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Hailin Wang"
