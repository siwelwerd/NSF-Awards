 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project forms a part of an ongoing vigorous interaction between geometry and high energy theoretical physics.  The engagement of mathematics with other sciences, and of science with mathematics, is a continual source of fruitful ideas with long-term benefits -- our current technology and economy rely on the foundation of basic research from past decades and centuries.  For many years, the interaction of physics with geometry has concerned quantum field theory and string theory, and now condensed matter theory is added to the mix.  A major issue in the latter is the classification of phases of matter.  New exotic phases of matter have direct applications to materials science and to quantum computing.  This research project applies recent advances in abstract topology, the study of the gross structure of shapes, to this classification problem.  The project also aims at broader foundational issues in geometric formulations of quantum field theory, as well as questions in pure geometry.  Graduate students are involved in the research.  \r\n\r\nThis research involves both purely mathematical projects influenced by physics and projects that apply geometry and topology to concrete problems in quantum field theory, string theory, and condensed matter theory.  As an example of the latter, the investigator aims to classify certain topological phases of matter using ideas and techniques from homotopy theory.  Another set of projects aims to develop the general theoretical underpinnings of geometric models of quantum field theory, including issues of scale, unitarity, and long-range approximations.  The investigator also plans to explore questions in pure geometry.  One set of projects investigates invariants of three-dimensional manifolds using abelianization via spectral networks.  This provides a new perspective on dilogarithm formulas for volumes of hyperbolic 3-manifolds.  Another project investigates quadratic forms in topology with applications to special quantum field theories.  Characteristic classes on smooth simplicial manifolds are also revisited, with an attempt to forge a relationship with central extensions of infinite dimensional groups.",

The physics ranges over different theoretical domains: string theory and quantum field theory, which describe nature at its smallest scales, and condensed matter theory, which describes more human scales. Often the geometry involved is topology, the branch of geometry which investigates large-scale properties of shapes, those which do not change when the shape is continuously deformed.  The interaction of this mathematics with physics derives benefits for both.\n\n\nOne sample result from this work illustrates the interplay.  Together with one of my collaborators we prove a theorem in \"topological quantum field theory\", a part of topology which has grown out of the encounter with physics.  Our theorem has an application to condensed matter theory.  Namely, accepting certain modeling assumptions, always a necessary step in applications of mathematics, our result implies certain quantum systems in two spatial dimensions which are insulators in the bulk must have conduction on the boundary.  It is a very general result of which many important special cases were known.  On the other hand, the techniques we use prove a theorem in pure algebra.  With another collaborator we carried out detailed computations in topology to prove a theorem which, again accepting modeling assumptions, implies that M-theory, one form of string theory, is consistent with time-reversal symmetry, as it must be from physical reasoning.  The techniques we use are of interest in pure topology as well.  This is a small sample of results obtained under this grant.\n\n\nThis NSF funding also supports the work of graduate students.
