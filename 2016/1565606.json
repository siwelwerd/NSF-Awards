 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project will conduct a series of field campaigns to observe phenomena producing high-energy radiation in thunderstorms.  These include terrestrial gamma-ray flashes (TGFs), long-lived gamma-ray glows observed in many parts of the thunderstorm charge structure, and x-rays associated with the stepping of lightning leaders.  The overall strategy is to locate probing sensors in or near the high-field regions where these emissions are primarily generated. The sensors to be used include two gamma-ray instruments developed at the University of California, Santa Cruz, under previous NSF awards, as well as sensors provided by our collaborators that sense lightning remotely via static and dynamic electric and magnetic fields. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:\r\nAll the phenomena under study were discovered within the last 30 years or so, with research only becoming widespread in the last decade. Some of the many open questions that will be addressed by this project include: whether downward TGFs occur in natural lightning, whether glows (an avalanche of relativistic electrons) contribute significantly to the discharging of thunderstorms, and whether positive lightning leaders emit x-rays and low-energy gamma rays the way negative leaders do. The primary advantage the field measurements have over others are 1) the proximity of the detection sites to the radiation sources to be studied (thundercloud charge centers and lightning leaders); and 2) the high time resolution and throughput capabilities of the detectors.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:\r\nThe selected field sites (an urban tower in Canada, a region of very low altitude storms in Japan, and a very high altitude site in Mexico) represent the three situations in which it is at least feasible that downward TGFs might produce high enough radiation fields at the ground to represent a public safety issue (upward TGFs seen from space produce dangerous levels of radioactivity within thunderclouds at 10--15~km altitudes). Thus this program should allay (or justify) any concern about radiation at ground level nearly comprehensively. Significant participation from undergraduate and graduate students, including first-generation and otherwise underserved undergraduates, is part of the program.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe overall goal of our component of this collaborative project was to provide measurements of the radio emissions from lightning during operation of the ADELE instrument with the aim of measuring and better understanding the generation of high-energy radiation by thunderstorms.  How thunderstorms are able to launch into space short bursts of high-energy gamma rays, called terrestrial gamma ray flashes (TGFs), remains one of the most scientifically important questions in the field of lightning and atmospheric electricity.  Through this effort, we discovered, to our surprise, that an ordinary cloud-to-ground lightning leader is sometimes capable of generating a TGF.  We also showed definitively that a significant fraction of TGFs have a specific radio frequency signature.  This signature not only gives key insight into the high energy particle acceleration process that creates TGFs, but it enables the detection of this type of TGF from many hundreds of kilometers away without the need for nearby gamma-ray measurements.  This project also partly supported our development of an advanced radio-based lightning imaging system, which detects and locates individual radio pulses produced during the lightning flash.  This system delivers a sequence of images with approximately 10 microseconds of time resolution and with approximately 10 meters of spatial resolution.  These images show in fine detail the development of lightning channels inside clouds, where they cannot be imaged with light or other traditional techniques.  Our part of this collaborative research project supported approximately 30% of the annual effort for one PhD student, and thus served as a successful opportunity to provide further training to these participants in STEM-related fields. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/21/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Steven A Cummer"
