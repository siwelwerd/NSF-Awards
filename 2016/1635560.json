 "awd_abstract_narration": "Surface winds globally impart about half a terawatt of energy to inertial oscillations in the surface mixed layer. The coastal ocean receives less wind work than the open ocean because it has less surface area. However, near-inertial wave generation is enhanced along coastlines, because the boundary induces large convergences and divergences in mixed-layer velocities. This process is dynamically significant because it transfers energy from forced surface-trapped motions to free motions, which can produce currents and turbulence in the stratified interior. Idealized theories and observations of the coastal ocean have confirmed the generation and propagation of near-inertial waves, but observational studies have not yet separated free and forced motions so that internal-wave generation, energy flux, and dissipation can be accurately quantified. Furthermore, the results of individual studies have not been synthesized to estimate the global significance or geography of coastal near-inertial wave generation. This project will improve the dynamical understanding and prediction of near inertial motions throughout the coastal ocean, in marginal seas, and in large lakes. The fieldwork will also contribute to our knowledge of the geophysical dynamics of Lake Superior, a valuable resource that is under-sampled with respect to physical measurements. These contributions include the first broad-scale turbulence measurements in the lake and the extension of a multi-year time series of density and currents. Coinciding measurements of chlorophyll fluorescence, turbidity, and oxygen will also illuminate the presently unknown relationships between turbulence and biogeochemistry in Lake Superior. The project will also develop tools and lessons for graduate oceanography and limnology courses, and support citizen science in Duluth, MN, via the development of a public drifter-building program in conjunction with the local office of the Environmental Protection Agency. The project will also train a PhD student and two undergraduate summer researchers.\r\n\r\nThis project aims to quantify coastal kinetic-energy pathways from wind work to dissipation, and produce a detailed description of coastal inertial-band dynamics by extending existing theories of coastal near-inertial wave generation and definitively testing them. This will be done using realistic numerical simulations and intensive direct observations of wind work, mixed-layer and stratified turbulence, and near-inertial internal-wave generation, propagation, and dissipation along a coastline and over rough coastal topography. Specifically, extensive observations will collected in Lake Superior, which is dominated by near-inertial motions during summer and has negligible tides, weak mean circulation, and little river input, making it also an ideal laboratory of the coastal ocean. The observations will include broad-scale measurements of turbulence from ship-based surveys and Wirewalker wave-powered moored profilers. Three traditional moorings will also be deployed for four years, extending an existing time series that can be used to identify extreme events and long-term trends in near-inertial motions. The project also includes novel analyses of analytical and numerical models, which will aid in the collection and interpretation of observations and enable the results in Lake Superior to be extended throughout the coastal ocean using historical wind, stratification, and bathymetry data.",

In the summer of 2017, 20 full-depth moorings were deployed, providing unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution of currents and temperature in Lake Superior. Three moorings were also deployed for four years, extending the Western Mooring time series to 18 years (it is still deployed). During 42 ship days aboard the R/V Blue Heron, a Rockland Scientific VMP-250 recorded 5,813 profiles of temperature, salinity, fluorescence, turbidity, and turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rate. These are, to our knowledge, the first large-scale surveys of turbulence in Lake Superior. Numerous cross-lake transects of currents and temperature were also collected with a ship-mounted ADCP and an RBR fastDuet, which recorded 3,974 additional profiles of temperature. All data are publicly available and archived with DOIs in the Data Repository of the University of Minnesota (DRUM).<br /><br />Theoretical work established that near-inertial motions can be separated into directly forced motions, described by a harmonic oscillator equation, and propagating inertial gravity waves, described by a Klein-Gordon equation. Global calculations suggested that around 10% of global wind work is converted to inertia-gravity waves along coastlines. Observations from Lake Superior corroborated the theoretical findings, indicating that coastal wave generation is a dominate energy sink for near-inertial motions. The observations were inconsistent with basin-scale modes because near-inertial pressures were not coherent between moorings and wave energy fluxes were directed offshore. Instead we conlcluded that half of near-inertial wind-work is converted to offshore-propagating internal waves at the coast. These waves have an average group speed of 10 cm/s and wavelength of 60 km. Waves and forced motions both decay through interfacial and bottom drag with a timescale of 28 days. Diapycnal mixing in the thermocline only produces a downward heat flux of 1-10 W/m<sup>2</sup>, leading to a strong summer thermocline. As a result, near-inertial energy builds over the summer to around 1 kJ/m<sup>2</sup> before it is rapidly dissipated through mixed-layer turbulence (and entrainment) during major storms in the fall. Theoretical work was also completed on surface oscillations (seiches) and coastal trapped waves, which are also prominent in Lake Superior. <br /><br />One PhD student was directly supported by this award for five years. The project also supported an undergraduate summer intern who worked with the local EPA lab to develop low-cost drifters. That intern went on to pursue a PhD in physical oceanography. Two additional MS students completed research projects related to this work. Technical results have been presented in numerous conference presentations, incorporated into undergraduate physics curricula, and published in two journal articles to date.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 01/24/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Samuel&nbsp;M&nbsp;Kelly</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1635560/1635560_10462643_1674577545774_WW12--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1635560/1635560_10462643_1674577545774_WW12--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Wire-walker time series\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1635560/1635560_10462643_1674577545774_WW12--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Wire-walker time series\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Wind power (a), energy terms (b), temperature (c) and the TKE dissipation rate (d), collected by a wire-walker mooring (WW12).
