 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project funded by the REU Sites Program in the Chemistry Division at the National Science Foundation, Professors Annaliese Franz and Kirill Kovnir are developing the University of California Davis ChemEnergy REU site to provide diverse undergraduate students with a unique ten-week research experience with a strong focus on chemistry at the interface of energy, materials and biotechnology. The REU site has a defined research focus on sustainability with projects ranging from biofuels to renewable energy that allows students to appreciate how chemistry can provide solutions for major challenges facing society.  The broader impacts are to provide research opportunities to diverse students who would not normally participate or would not have the opportunity to participate at their current institution, including accommodations for blind students.\r\n\r\nThis REU project focuses on providing a cohort experience that is designed to cross barriers between chemistry disciplines with a focus on the fundamentals and applications of energy, catalysis and enzymes. The program provides seminars and workshops in energy and catalysis, training with state-of-the art instrumentation, and interactive workshops for science communication training, all of which set the stage for students to discuss and understand the research. This REU program also has experience, resources, and multi-level mentoring to accommodate blind or vision-impaired students in research.  In the ChemEnergy REU, students will gain: 1) skills in critical thinking and science communication, 2) the ability to work as part of a research team, and 3) an understanding of broader issues and how chemistry is connected. The experience is designed to give students a strong start on their path towards future careers in chemistry and energy sciences.",

This focused theme is a strength to our program that provides opportunities for cooperative learning between the students and laboratories involved, a cohort experience, and the reinforcement of important basic concepts to provide a lasting impact on the student?s education. We recruited and selected highly qualified students each year (avg GPA = 3.7), with strong overall recruiting of URM students (17/38, 45%), and a good gender balance (21 female, 17 male).</p>\n<p>The REU fellows were placed in a variety of laboratories within the Chemistry Department working on different aspects of chemical research related to energy research and chemical catalysis.&nbsp; The projects range from inorganic materials chemistry for energy applications to organocatalysis, to computational chemistry. In addition to research, the REU students participate in weekly Friday afternoon seminars and workshops focused on research topics related to the \"Energy and Catalysis\" theme by our participating faculty mentors and/or a workshop focused on a professional development topic. These weekly meetings have been followed by an ice cream \"happy hour\" with the department as a whole and has served as a way for the students to get to know our departmental community.&nbsp; Workshops included topics such as \"Getting into Graduate School,\" \"Writing a Personal Statement,\" \"Thriving and Surviving Graduate School\", \"Science Communication,\" and \"How to make a Poster\".&nbsp; We also incorporated field trips and tour at the Joint Center for Artificial Photosynthesis (JCAP) and to the Tahoe Environmental Research Center. At the end of each summer, we held an REU Symposium with a poster session and reception that was widely attended by faculty and students in the department.</p>\n<p>More than half of the students reported that they presented their REU research at their home institution when they returned in the fall semester (or quarter). Funding was also provided to REU students to support their participation and presentation at regional and national ACS conferences. Several students presented at the ACS National Meetings, SACNAS and Annual Biomedical Research Conference for Minority Students (ABRCMS) and the National Organization for the Professional Advancement of Black Chemists and Chemical Engineers (NOBBCChE). Additionally, some of our REU Students awards, including NSF Graduate Research Fellowships, an ACS Inorganic Division travel award and an ACS Division of Organic Chemistry travel award. &nbsp;Several publications are now published with REU students as co-authors.</p>\n<p>We also provided a pivot to a virtual program in Summer 2020 to support students during these unprecedented times, requesting a no-cost extension to utilize remaining funds on this program. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we proposed to use the remaining funds to support undergraduate students from local community colleges and UC Davis in a part-time hybrid or virtual summer program, with a focus on first-generation students and students from traditionally underrepresented groups. Based on the amount remaining funds, there was an opportunity to recruit and support undergraduate students local to the Davis and Sacramento area who do not require summer housing or students interested in a virtual program, who would still benefit from a summer research and mentoring program.</p>\n<p>We recruited and selected 22 students with a focus on first-generation students, students from community colleges and students from traditionally underrepresented groups, resulting in a overall recruiting of URM students (12/22, 54%) and a good gender balance (14 female, 8 male). We were able to pivot to provide an engaging virtual program with robust components by combining with several opportunities also provided for our NSF LSAMP and McNair scholars at UC Davis.&nbsp; Virtual programming included attending research group meetings on Zoom, weekly one-on-one mentoring and professional development meetings on Zoom, and both a faculty panel and a graduate student panel about applying to graduate school, as well as other networking, science communication and professional development topics. We especially featured faculty snapshots with advance literature reading and Q&amp;A with faculty to build student confidence about research topics and meeting faculty on zoom. In this program, we accomplished our goals to support students to develop knowledge of energy and catalysis, build professional development and communication skills, and build a sense of belonging in the chemistry community during these unprecedented times.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 01/12/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by:
