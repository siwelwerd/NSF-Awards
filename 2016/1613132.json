 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project will study spatially localized patterns such as fronts, spots, or pulses that arise in fluids, nonlinear optics, chemical catalysis, and other continuum systems. Examples include vortices, drops, and solitary waves in fluids, spots in optical and chemical systems, localized buckling of slender structures under compression, pulses propagating along nerve fibers, and localized oscillations in vibrating granular media. These diverse systems have two things in common: (i) they dissipate energy and need to be sustained by external forcing, and (ii) they are sensitive to this external forcing and small changes may lead to distinctly different outcomes (patterns). This project seeks to extend existing theory to similar systems in two and three dimensions and to provide a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms responsible for growth of patterns when the forcing is varied. It will apply the results to improved understanding of vortices in rotating convection and crystal growth from a melt. The project will involve a graduate student in the research.\r\n\r\nSpatially localized structures are common in solutions to many partial differential equations arising in physical modeling. This research project studies dissipative systems driven by periodic forcing in which different forcing amplitudes can lead to distinct localized states. The project seeks to extend existing theory to higher dimensions and to provide a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms behind the different types of growth of the structures that are observed when parameters are varied. The structures of interest include not only spatially localized pulse-like states, but also fronts connecting two distinct states and defects or holes in otherwise spatially periodic structures. In addition, the project aims to apply the results to several systems of importance in physics and engineering, including vortex structures in rotating convection and crystallization from a supercooled liquid. The techniques used include bifurcation theory for reversible and near-reversible systems, coupled with numerical branch-following and direct numerical simulations of realistic systems.",

In general stationary structures of this type are organized in several intertwined solution branches within a parameter region called the snaking region, and this is so in both one, two and three dimensions. The theory developed as part of the project, including numerical continuation based on spectral elements, was applied to several important systems arising in hydrodynamics, nonlinear optics and ecology, specifically: (i) doubly diffusive convection driven by disparities between the diffusion rates of heat and concentration, for example salt, that arises in oceanographic applications, (ii) temporal light and dark solitons in optical fiber cavities and microresonators, and (iii) models of vegetation cover in dryland ecosystems.</p>\n<p>As part of (i) the PI studied the properties of localized structures in three-dimensional porous media heated from below, and in three-dimensional vertical cavities heated from a side. In both cases complex structures are present below the onset of instability of an unstructured state. Such structures can be made to move by inclining the cavity or applying suitable conditions at its boundaries. Even very small changes of this type have a profound effect on the properties of these systems and on localization in particular. In (ii) the PI analyzed the appearance and disappearance of light and dark optical solitons and the transition to complex time dependence with increasing detuning, while (iii) focused on similar behavior in ecological models for parameters near the threshold for vegetation collapse brought about by declining precipitation.</p>\n<p>The PI has also studied the formation of structures with quasicrystalline order in systems with a two-scale interparticle potential. Such structures have a simple diffraction pattern that resembles that of periodic crystals but are in fact nonperiodic. They may form when the melt is unstable with respect to perturbations with one lengthscale but the nonlinear processes that select the crystal structure favor a different lengthscale. Quasiperiodic structures of this type may be global energy minima in both two and three dimensions and so be stable at finite temperature. The PI has discovered different types of metastable spatially localized structures associated with spatially extended quasicrystals (see accompanying figures) with a view to exploring their potential role as critical seeds required to initiate crystallization.

Finally, the PI also investigated the stability properties of states of partial coherence in systems of nonlocally coupled phase oscillators arranged in two- and three-dimensional lattices and compared the theoretical predictions with direct numerical simulations.
