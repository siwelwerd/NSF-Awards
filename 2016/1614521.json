 "awd_abstract_narration": "RUI: Arginine methylation of a lipin homologue and its function in phospholipid biosynthesis in Trypanosoma brucei\r\n\r\nThe research question focuses on investigating modifications of a novel protein involved in essential phospholipid biosynthesis in the parasitic protozoan Trypanosoma brucei. T. brucei spends part of its life cycle in the human bloodstream and part in the African tsetse fly, thus presenting an interesting model system for studies of parasitic adaptation to multiple eukaryotic hosts. This project will strengthen the research environment in the Department of Biology at The College at Brockport, SUNY, by providing opportunities for undergraduate and Master's level graduate students to participate directly in hypothesis driven basic research using an important protozoan model system. In addition, the independent undergraduate research projects will expose participants to science in an interactive, collaborative, constructive framework. Involvement in high impact research activities will enhance the overall educational experience and increase student ability to secure graduate positions, admission to professional school, and employment in various biological disciplines.\r\n\r\nThe major objective of this project is to identify the function(s) of TbLpn, a recently identified protein, and its importance in trypanosome metabolism using a dual genetic/biochemical approach. The functions of TbLpn and the effect of arginine methylation will be assessed in vivo by disrupting its expression by RNA interference and determining the effect of the disruption on cellular growth, cell morphology, cellular phospholipid content, phosphatidic acid phosphatase activity, and expression of lipid biosynthetic genes. This research will address important aspects of trypanosome biology and will constitute an area for growth in the fields of both parasitology and protein modification. By using an innovative approach, potential roles of a novel protein in phospholipid biosynthesis and virulence will be unveiled. In addition, it will potentially increase our understanding of protein arginine methylation in an evolutionarily ancient parasite, and provide insight into the mechanisms and evolution of this common posttranslational modification in higher organisms.",
