 "awd_abstract_narration": "Extant research pinpoints gaps between school and work in respect to engineering practice. For example, a recent American Society of Mechanical Engineering (ASME) study identified a number of student weaknesses, such as: practical experience, project management, problem solving, and design. Equally important, industry supervisors have also identified these gaps. The misalignment between the engineering classroom and workplace poses serious challenges with the professional formation of engineers. Generally speaking, capstone courses are key academic experiences that can bridge these gaps. Few studies, if any, have examined the effectiveness of capstone courses in helping students make the transition from engineering classrooms to the workplace. Instead, most research focuses on course structure, pedagogy, assessment, and end-of-course outcomes. To address the knowledge gaps, the investigators draw on Wenger's concept of communities of practice to study students' experiences as they move from capstone courses to the workplace. \r\n\r\nUsing a multi-case study design, the project is focusing on four primary research questions: \r\n(a) What skills, practices, and attitudes fostered through the capstone experience do individuals draw on or apply in their early work experiences? \r\n(b) What differences do individuals identify between their capstone design and early work experiences, and how do those differences help or hinder their school-to-work transition?\r\n(c) What specific pedagogical practices or aspects of the capstone course do students identify as helping or hindering their transition?\r\n(d) In what ways do individuals perceive themselves to be underprepared in their early work experiences? \r\n\r\nFurther, with a particular focus on women and Hispanics, the investigators proposed to study the extent that capstone design courses prepared these students to enter communities of practice in engineering workplaces. This project is closely aligned with the National Science Foundation's strategic priorities to build the STEM workforce with capable individuals, as well as broadening participation in engineering among underrepresented groups.\r\n\r\nIn the scientific literature, there are numerous studies that highlight the gaps between theory and practice in relation to engineering education and the workplace, yet capstone courses are common practices that engineering instructors use to help students gain more in-depth engineering knowledge. There is a dearth of studies that have examined the effectiveness of capstone courses and how these courses may help students to translate and apply prior engineering coursework to the engineering workplace. With this in mind, this project has immense potential to positively impact engineering instruction across the nation. It also possesses great potential in helping engineering faculty to develop more effective capstone courses, while maximizing their instructional resources to create such courses. Ultimately, this project will benefit U.S. engineering industries seeking to hire adaptable engineering graduates who are technically and professionally prepared to enter the engineering workforce.",

The findings demonstrated the critical ways in which industry-oriented capstone courses provide new engineers with essential professional skills that help ease their transition from school to work. By providing experiences not only in technical engineering work, but also in self-directed learning, teamwork, and communication, capstone courses help build students' identities as professional engineers.

Communication challenges related to both formal communication such as reports and presentations, and informal communication with colleagues and supervisors. Detailed analysis emphasized that the transition to work was less a competency gap that reflected lack of communication skills, and more a substantial context shift as participants had to learn to apply generalized writing, presenting, and interpersonal skills to the specific expectations of different organizations, managers, and colleagues. Participants often had the requisite communication skills, but needed to learn to adapt them to the local norms of individual workplaces.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Challenges related to teamwork included managing work across a team and participating effectively in meetings. In addition, analysis of leadership behaviors using the Competing Values Framework showed that successful capstone project leaders more frequently called on behaviors associated with the innovative Create dimension, which focuses on driving change, but at work, leadership associated with entry level engineers emphasized the Control dimension, which focuses on coordinating and managing processes.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Self-directed learning included managing time and knowledgement. With respect to time, participants had to learn to manage both highly pressured and shifting organizational deadlines and slow periods with little or no assigned work. They also had to shift from an academic to an industry work schedule. With respect to knowledge, participants faced steep learning curves as they moved from generalized engineering knowledge into a range of industries. They had to learn technical concepts, organizational functioning, and contextually relevant skills, while simultaneously learning to locate needed information (i.e., from specific individuals, company documents, vendors, and more). This self-directed learning was often linked to technical challenges as participants built technical skills and knowledge within their industry. Finally, participants faced challenges as they developed professional identities: learning their roles, gaining confidence, and building their engineering judgement.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>To meet these challenges, our participants frequently relied on the skills and experiences they garnered through their industry-oriented capstone projects. Notably, they did not immediately consider themselves competent in all areas. Rather, they considered themselves prepared because the challenges they experienced at work mirrored those experienced in their capstone courses. Thus they had a wide array of strategies to help them address the challenges, build the needed knowledge, and negotiate professional relationships.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Given the oversampling of women in this study, the research team also explored women's experiences of the transition from school to work in detail. Consistent with earlier work, women in our study reported marginally lower perceived preparedness than their male counterparts, but they reported the same sets of challenges and areas of transfer between school and work. Women&rsquo;s transition experiences were highly diverse, though issues surrounding self-directed learning, interpersonal relationships, and growing confidence were prominent themes. In addition, several women experienced overt sexism in the workplace, reinforcing the need to continue to build more inclusive cultures across industries and organizations.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Finally, for all participants, negotiating their emerging engineering identities in the context of the constraints and expectations of their organization was complex. As participants came to understand the mission of their organization, they developed ways of aligning their own interests and values with those of their employers. For some, their personal and professional identities were closely aligned, but for others, critical differences required them to draw on personal resources, negotiate with supervisors, and in several cases, change employers as they came to understand more about themselves and their work as engineers.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>In summary, this study highlights the ways in which the transition from school to work represents not the \"competence gap\" that is often touted, but rather a \"context gap\" as new engineers develop local knowledge about their colleagues, hierarchies, structures, and workplace environments. Equally important, the findings clearly demonstrate that industry-oriented capstone courses that provide not only authentic projects but also practices and expectations reflective of contemporary workplaces are essential in preparing students for this shift.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 05/14/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by:
