For seven weeks each summer, twelve participants, including three teachers, will work in three research teams on problems in Mathematical Modeling, Statistics, and Number Theory.  Depending on the field, projects may be appropriate for students from scientific disciplines other than mathematics.\r\n\r\nThe research experience is intended to give participants an appreciation for the breadth and depth of mathematics and its applications, while providing undergraduates an opportunity to improve their communication skills and in-service teachers an experience that will deepen their understanding of mathematical content and inspire pedagogical innovation.  By working on open problems in mathematics, participants will experience the excitement of exploration, discovery, analysis, proof, and systematization that are part of the mathematician's world. While much of mathematics is accessible only after years of study, the field is rich enough to allow for a full mathematical experience at the undergraduate level.",

The research teams (12 participants each year) spent 40 hours a week for seven weeks of researching each year. They prepared weekly presentations, draft manuscripts for journal publications, and posters that described the research that they were conducting. We presented the results of our research at 31 national, international and regional conferences and published these results in various conference proceedings. Also, one journal papers was published and 3 were submitted and currently are under review.&nbsp;2016-2017 AccomplishmentsThe statistics research team was researching simulation methods to optimize NFL fourth down strategies. Math modeling team, using the nonlinear shallow water equations, studied propagation of the tsunami wave run-up on a sloping beach. The derived model is represented by the leading term in an asymptotic expansion of the non-linear equations. Within the bounds of the linear approximation, the exact analytical solutions for wave runup on a beach, shelf, underwater bump, or series of bumps are found. Areas of practical application of these models include coastal defense against tsunami inundation and&nbsp; harbor protection with submerged breakwaters.&nbsp;Accomplishments in 2017-2018Stochastic Processes team worked on several projects:Within the project: \"Spatial point analysis of segregated communities and greenhouse gas sources\" , we designed a way to quantify segregation across a range of spatial scales using spatial pattern analysis tools: Ripley?s K function and the pair correlation function. We designed a coding framework to efficiently calculate these functions from 2010 census data. Our computational design also allows us to quantify the relationship between racial groups and pollution sources across a continuum of spatial scales, and preliminary results show that disadvantaged racial groups are more likely to be clustered near pollution sources.Within the Project \"Stochastic Differential Equation models of Ascaris (roundworm) infection\" , we developed stochastic differential equation versions of our models that included both demographic and environmental stochasticity. We numerically simulated many realizations of these equations to approximate the dynamics of the means, variances, and probability distributions associated with each disease class.&nbsp;Within the project \"Directional and non-directional sensory cues in stochastic search strategies\", using computer simulations, we evaluated how composite search strategies based on non-directional sensory cues compare to those based on directional sensory cues. These simulations were performed on a wide range of landscapes, allowing us to examine resource distributions with varying degrees of density and heterogeneity.&nbsp;Number Theory team obtained interesting results within the following projects: \"On the number of primes for which a polynomial is Eisenstein\" , \"Explicit bounds on the least kth prime non-residue\", \"Explicit lower bounds on the greatest prime divisor of n^2+c\" , \"S-Euclidean imaginary quadratic fields\", \"Norm-Euclidean ideal classes in Galois cubic fields\". These results are pure mathematical and in order to describe them we need to use equations and formulae. To this end, the key mathematical outcomes for these projects are presented in the attached jpeg files (5 pages).<br />Accomplishments in 2018-2019.Participants worked on two projects. Project 1 was related to modeling the spread of radioactive contaminant in fractured porous aquifers. Accidents and natural disasters can cause radioactive contaminants to leak into the environment, so natural barriers such as subsurface geologic formations can help limit the extent of contaminant spread. As a consequence, studying contaminated fluid flow through aquifers is of vital importance. By solving a system of fractional differential equations that model the radioactive contaminant transport in the fractured aquifer for the steady-state case, the long-time equilibrium situation to determine the maximum possible zones of contamination is considered. The model accounts for the physical processes of diffusion, dispersion, and advection due to fluid flow, in addition to intrinsic properties of the system, such as rock porosity, radioactive half-life of the contaminant and anomalous fracture patterns in the rock. The obtained solutions can be used to examine contamination zones in various real-world conditions to help outline safety procedures and guidelines for disaster prevention.&nbsp;Project 2 was related to Inverse Problem of Obtaining Thermo-physical Properties of Contacting Solids.This research was focused on designing the effective method for calculating thermo-physical properties of solids. Applying the Laplace Transform to the formulated boundary value problem of the temperature distribution within the system of contacting solids was obtained analytically. In the obtained solutions two constants that represent thermal conductivity and thermal diffusivity of one of the contacting solids were unknown parameters. Using temperature distribution obtained experimentally from the laboratory setup, we minimized a functional, which represented the difference between the analytically obtained solution and measured temperature. By minimizing this functional we obtained the unknown thermal conductivity and diffusivity of the solid.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified:
