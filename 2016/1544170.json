Produced by the team that made Frozen Planet, the Penguin film will be an in-depth documentary of the life-cycle of the Adelie penguin.  The goal is to explore the fascinating behaviors of this particular species (Pygoscelis adeliae) within the context of the broader ecosystem of the Antarctic continent.\r\n\r\nWhile there have been other highly successful and popular films about penguins, this will be the first to focus on the Adelie population.  The majority of filming will be in and around the penguin colony of Cape Crozier. The end product will be the first feature length documentary on Antarctic wildlife to be created in 4K, and the resulting footage will constitute the largest 4K film archive of the Ross Sea.  The film will be complemented by an extensive Educator's Guide made readily available to teachers in grades 2-6 across the country, and a separate parent activity pack in English and Spanish.  Beyond the theaters, the film will be distributed on DVD and Blu-ray for years to come.  NSF is providing the filmmakers logistic support only.",
