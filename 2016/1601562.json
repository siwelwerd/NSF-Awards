 "awd_abstract_narration": "Anticoagulants are a class of proteins that help prevent the coagulation of blood.  Anticoagulants are widely reported from blood-feeding leeches and are used extensively in medicine and for pest control. This research will document the presence and evolution of anticoagulants in the closest relatives of leeches. Finding anticoagulants in immediate leech relatives will shed light on the origin of the proteins and may lead to the discovery of novel anticoagulant compounds. Two underrepresented inner-city high school students will be mentored and trained in laboratory methods. Additionally, the researchers will produce an extracurricular teaching module for inner-city high school students focused on natural selection, based on the evolution of anticoagulants. \r\n\r\nThis research will reconstruct phylogenetic relationships among Acanthobdellida, Branchiobdellida, and leeches that will help resolve long-standing questions about the evolution of segmented worms.  The resulting evolutionary framework will then be used to investigate: 1) the distribution of anticoagulants within Acanthobdellida, Branchiobdellida, Lumbriculida, and leeches, 2) whether there is evidence of positive selection along the branches from leech relatives to leeches, coincident with the evolution of obligate blood-feeding, 3) whether Acanthobdellida are the sister group to leeches, and 4) whether the Rhynchobdellida (proboscis leeches) are monophyletic in line with feeding apparatus morphologies, and the pattern of family relationships within the group. Source material will be collected on field expeditions within the U.S.A. and Sweden. Salivary glands will be aseptically dissected for each sampled species and then RNA will be extracted, checked for quality, and sequenced. Phylogenomic and comparative phylogenetic analyses will then be used to reconstruct relationships and test for evidence of positive selection among orthologous genes.",

The exact relationships between these groups have been notoriously had to determine, as acanthobdellidans are hard to collect due to their largely sub-arctic distribution. Understanding these relationships is of the utmost importance for determining the evolution of anticoagulants for bloodfeeding in leeches. Powerful anticoagulants found in leeches have led to their use in folk and authoritative medical practices, most notably for modern reconstructive and plastic surgeries. Throughout the course of this research, we collected new specimens of both branchiobdellidans and acanthobdellidans (primarily in northern and arctic Europe). These specimens then had their DNA and RNA sequenced for genetic characterization and comparisons. This genetic information was then used to make evolutionary trees to better determine the relationships between these worms and leeches. With these comparisons, we found that leeches are most closely related to the acanthobdellidans, indicating that there was a single origin of parasitism and bloodfeeding from a common ancestor to these groups of worms. This contrasts many prior findings, but led us to determine that those works had relied on misidentified DNA sequences. A number of anticoagulants were also recovered from acanthobdellidans and branchiobdellidans. This indicates that many of the powerful anticoagulants that make bites from leeches so bloody were present in a common ancestor that was not bloodfeeding. This project did much to expand the doctoral research of one of the investigators, and forge a number of international collaborations. Two New York inner-city high school students and one undergraduate student were also trained in scientific research. Given their contributions these students have been included as authors in a publication summarizing much of the work done for this project.
