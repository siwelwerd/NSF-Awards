 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the introduction of high-speed\r\nwireless modems usable subsea and significant cost reduction of deep-water operations ?\r\nindustry experts estimate savings of nearly 20% of deep-water operations through the\r\navailability of subsea WiFi. Today, there is no broadband wireless communication available\r\nunderwater. In the deep ocean, remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) require a tether for\r\ncommunication and a support ship for tether management; sensors and systems must either be\r\nphysically connected, or retrieved from the deep sea to exchange data. An ROV support ship\r\ncosts about $120k/day leading to over $7B spent on ROV support ships in 2013. The proposed\r\nmegabit-per-second technology would allow ROV manufacturers and operators to cut the\r\ntether on many of their vehicles. Wireless ROVs can move unencumbered throughout coverage\r\narea, piloted from anywhere (e.g. from Houston), without expensive surface vessels. The\r\nproposed wireless modem technology connects ROVs and machinery to wired infrastructure,\r\nenabling safe operation of heavy subsea machinery without the possibility of cables or tethers\r\ngetting tangled, causing damage or worse. This project will create 10 new jobs in the next three\r\nyears, with many more to be added as the production scales.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project proposes to develop a faster\r\nand more reliable wireless communication system for the sub-sea industry. Current state of the\r\nart communication links for the deep ocean are either tethered, requiring long, bulky, and\r\nexpensive cables to connect machinery and systems, or have extremely low data rates, enabling only \r\nthe most rudimentary of tasks. The proposed underwater wireless communication\r\nsystem will provide WiFi-like data rates in the Mbps (megabits/sec) range ? 100 to 1,000 times\r\nfaster than existing underwater wireless communication technologies - and enable video\r\nstreaming and real-time control of subsea infrastructure, machinery, and mobile underwater\r\nvehicles. Since radio signals do not propagate far underwater, the proposed technology uses\r\nsound waves, as whales and dolphins do, for communication. The speed of sound is 200,000\r\ntimes slower than the speed of radio propagation, and mobile acoustic transmitters and\r\nreceivers hence suffer from severe Doppler distortion. The proposed technology dynamically\r\nmeasures, tracks, and compensates for this distortion, to enable wireless communication at\r\ndata rates never before possible underwater.",
