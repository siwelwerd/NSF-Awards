 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will support undergraduate students to develop robust understanding of core hydrological concepts, as well as the social, cultural, economic, and political dimensions  of water-related issues.  This project will design and study a new, interdisciplinary undergraduate course, Water in Society, designed for first year students (STEM majors and non-majors).  Project work will be transdisciplinary, drawing from the fields of STEM education, hydrological sciences, and social and decision sciences, and will contribute to theory and research on undergraduate teaching and learning about human-environmental systems, STEM-informed decision-making, and science literacy.  The project will impact the future STEM workforce, as well as cultivate water literacy in future voters and consumers.\r\n\r\nThe project will utilize a pre-specified, iterative instructional design process to inform the development and ongoing refinement of a course grounded in tenets of effective post-secondary STEM instruction and contemporary learning theory. Consistent with the project's focus on early-stage, exploratory research in an instructional design context, the project will explore associations between student outcomes, malleable factors, and mediating or moderating variables to clarify underlying theory about how students engage in STEM-informed decision-making about socio-hydrological issues.  The project is a direct response to calls for discipline-based educational research on undergraduate students' science learning.  Project deliverables will include a research-based, interdisciplinary water science course and empirical research findings from study of course implementation throughout the project period.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual Merit: This project has led to important discipline-based education research outcomes.   It is novel in its mobilization of perspectives from the fields of STEM education, hydroscience, and the decision sciences to develop, implement, assess, and revise a theoretically-informed, transdisciplinary undergraduate course focused on water systems (SCIL 109 - Water in Society).  The  project has yielded a new introductory  interdisciplinary water science  course, including its instructional  strategies and approaches, grounded  in contemporary views of ?best  practice? in undergraduate STEM  education, all of which revolve around model-based teaching and learning about water and fostering students' science-informed decision-making abilities.  Empirical research in the course has yielded 10+ peer-reviewed publications and more than 15 conference presentations.  As such, it  is grounded in and has contributed to theory and research on   post-secondary teaching and learning about the socio-hydrological   systems, STEM-informed decision-making, and science literacy.  It was embedded within and  leveraged resources and capacity of broader  institutional initiatives at  UNL, including two academic departments  and two interdisciplinary initiatives.    It was carried out by an interdisciplinary team with disciplinary   expertise and a track record of implementation and dissemination of   NSF-funded projects.      \n\n\n\nBroader Impact: The project directly impacted more than 350 undergraduate students over five years, including  students from low-SES backgrounds and underrepresented groups from  Nebraska and around the world.  Project research is integrated into the development, delivery, and evaluation of the SCIL 109 course  and, as such, represents a holistic effort to incorporate research into  learning and education while, in turn, using learning and education to  inform ongoing research and development. The project promotes cross-fertilization between hydrologists, STEM education, DBER, and the decision sciences.  It was grounded in collaboration between faculty in the Institute for Agriculture and Natural Resources (IANR) at the UNL, leveraging IANR?s Science Literacy Initiative, Robert B. Daugherty Water for Food Institute, and recently-established Food, Energy, &amp; Water in Society minor.  By targeting undergraduate students (i.e., STEM majors and non-majors), the project has impacted the STEM workforce of tomorrow, as  well as cultivated water literacy. Project methods, strategies, and findings have been disseminated in peer-reviewed journals and conference presentations, as well as media outlets, and sustained through the 109 course and minor.  They also serve as a model for integration into other undergraduate STEM courses,  starting with coursework associated with the minor.  Ultimately, project outcomes and deliverables have helped foster  science literacy in tomorrow?s global citizens through innovative,  interdisciplinary, undergraduate STEM education, thus benefitting society.   \n\n\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/30/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Cory Forbes"
