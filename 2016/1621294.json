 "awd_abstract_narration": "Given the adoption of more rigorous mathematics standards, U.S. school districts face a pressing need to improve instruction for struggling learners who are not reaching proficiency on standardized assessments. In response to low performance, a common district solution is to add mathematics intervention classes which aim to provide struggling students with time for more intensive and targeted instruction. Researchers have begun to identify effective mathematics intervention practices, but few studies have examined if intervention teachers are actually implementing these approaches with students. Very little is known about how intervention class time is spent, what mathematics content is emphasized, which evidence-based instructional practices are used, and what challenges are faced by teachers.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this project is to improve mathematics instruction for struggling learners by focusing on the quality of instruction occurring in mathematics intervention classrooms. The investigators will conduct observations and interviews with teachers and district leaders to understand current practices and challenges. This will be followed by a national survey of 300 teachers to document challenges across the country in terms of providing mathematics intervention. The final aspect of the project involves the design of professional development for mathematics intervention teachers based on the needs identified in the earlier phases of the project. \r\n\r\nThe Discovery Research K-12 program (DRK-12) seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools (RMTs). Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects.",

A key part of the definition is that the intervention classes are supplemental and do <em>not </em>replace core mathematics instruction. The purpose of intervention classes is to build students' knowledge, skills, motivation, and confidence, helping them become more successful mathematics learners.</p>\n<p>The project's first goal was to address a gap in the knowledge base about the landscape of mathematics intervention classes in grades 6-8. Prior to our project's work, little was known about how middle grades intervention classes were actually being implemented by school districts. Starting with an observational study, we conducted classroom observations and interviews with intervention teachers and mathematics leaders in Massachusetts. Then, we designed a large-scale survey to investigate the breadth of practices in schools across the nation. In spring 2017, we administered the online survey to a nationally representative sample of 2,024 urban or suburban public schools with students in grades 6, 7, and 8. Approximately 43% of schools (876 schools) responded to the survey, with one respondent per school. The national survey findings revealed that an estimated 69% of schools provided mathematics intervention classes in grades 6, 7, or 8 in the 2016-17 school year. There were common themes in schools' approaches and challenges, but also a lot of variation in implementation models, including scheduling, class length, and class size. To disseminate the findings, the project provided conference presentations, webinars, and an Executive Summary report.</p>\n<p>The project's second goal was to create PD specifically for teachers of mathematics intervention in the middle grades. Drawing on the survey findings, we designed the<em>&nbsp;</em>PD course to focus on identified areas of need for intervention teachers. The development process involved iterative cycles of design, testing with teachers, and revision. The hybrid course started with a three-day summer institute and continued with two in-person sessions, six online sessions, and four small-group, virtual meetings. It focused on key math concepts (in fractions, decimals, integers, and expressions and equations) that tend to pose challenges for students. We designed hands-on activities to deepen participants' own understanding of the mathematics, and also of common student misconceptions and challenges. Participants used formative assessment approaches, including probes and interviews, examined student work samples (print and video), and planned ways to target instruction to students' strengths and needs. They tried evidence-based instructional strategies themselves and with their students. The course assignments were carefully designed to support teachers in classroom implementation and were followed by debriefing discussions at the facilitated virtual meetings. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>The course was piloted tested with 28 teachers of math intervention from districts in Massachusetts and Maine during one school year (70 PD hours). On the evaluation survey, participants' overall feedback was positive; they reported that the course was highly useful, relevant, and applicable to their work as math intervention teachers. Findings from pre-and-post-course instruments revealed increases in participants' mathematics content knowledge, self-efficacy, and reported use of instructional practices. These findings suggest that the course shows promise for having a positive impact on educators' abilities to teach students with mathematics difficulties in intervention classes. Two limitations are that the study had a small sample and did not have a control group.</p>\n<p>In response to the pilot study findings, we made improvements to the course, and also created a new version focused on fractions to offer more extensive PD on this high-priority topic. During the next school year, we piloted the SMI fractions course with a new cohort of teachers. Altogether 77 math intervention teachers and coaches participated in the SMI PD courses.</p>\n<p>The SMI project has widely disseminated its work through articles in journals, such as <em>Mathematics Teacher: Learning and Teaching PK-12</em> and <em>Principal Leadership</em> and by offering presentations and webinars. The project held three annual <em>Forums on Mathematics Intervention at the Middle Grades </em>that convened over 180 mathematics leaders, principals, and intervention teachers from over 40 districts in Massachusetts. The forums included presentations by project staff, practitioner panels, discussions, and activities for district teams to reflect on current practices, identify goals, and plan next steps. Building on this work, we wrote the&nbsp;<em>Strengthening Mathematics Intervention in the Middle Grades </em>guides<em> </em>to provide useful information, examples, and suggestions. The project's website (<a href=\"https://www2.edc.org/accessmath/\">edc.org/accessmath</a>) offers a variety of free resources, including formative assessment probes and 22 videos from the PD courses. These short videos demonstrate recommended instructional strategies for key topics in fractions, decimals, integers, and expressions and equations.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/29/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Amy&nbsp;Brodesky</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1621294/1621294_10463226_1672320767095_Example_Graph_Class_Size_Math_Intervention_Classes--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1621294/1621294_10463226_1672320767095_Example_Graph_Class_Size_Math_Intervention_Classes--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Number of Students in Math Intervention Classes (grades 6-8)\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1621294/1621294_10463226_1672320767095_Example_Graph_Class_Size_Math_Intervention_Classes--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Number of Students in Math Intervention Classes (grades 6-8)\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">This example graph is from the project's Executive Summary Report on the national survey findings.
