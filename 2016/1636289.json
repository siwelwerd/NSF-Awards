 "awd_abstract_narration": "Diamond thin films play an important role in many established and emerging areas of technology including manufacturing tools, protective coatings, and high power electronics due to their increased resistance to wear, chemical stability, low coefficient of friction, low coefficient of thermal expansion, wide optical transparency, biocompatibility, and tunable conductivity. For similar reasons, diamond thin films have also started attracting attention from researchers for use in microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) such as sensors and actuators. However, besides performance the scalability, sustainability, and cost of these films are also factors that influence their viability for widespread use. This award supports fundamental research to provide needed knowledge for the development of a novel diamond film growth process that: (1) can be performed virtually on any substrate, including metals, oxides, and plastics, (2) is economical due to low cost and ready availability of the raw material, (3) poses lower health hazards and is environmentally safe, and (4) can be integrated with standard semiconductor technology. Such low cost, scalable diamond films with tailorable physical properties will enable broad impact in energy, manufacturing, healthcare, sensors, electronics, and other important applications, thus providing a positive impact on the U.S. economy and society. In addition, this multi-disciplinary approach involving research in chemistry, materials science, manufacturing, and engineering will provide a significant impact on broadening participation of minorities in research, and incorporating nanomaterial manufacturing concepts in K-12 curriculum.\r\n\r\nThe concept of directed covalent assembly of nanodiamonds using versatile, room-temperature chemistry to form conformal and compact films will pave the way to a novel class of sustainable coatings for MEMS. The full application potential of covalently assembled nanodiamond films can be achieved by overcoming the scientific barrier of tuning its physical properties (mechanical, thermal, and optical) which are directly linked to the level and distribution of porosity in the film micro-/nanostructure. This research seeks to fill the knowledge gap on the mechanism(s) of porosity reduction through precise control over nanodiamond aggregate size during film fabrication as well as post-fabrication anneal. The research team will characterize porosity distribution and the associated physical properties using state-of-the-art materials characterization methods. Further, microfabricated devices will be made with the nanodiamond films as a vehicle to demonstrate its integration into MEMS, to facilitate quantification of physical properties such in-plane and cross-plane thermal conductivity, and to correlate these findings to the nanodiamond aggregate sizes used during the direct covalent assembly process.",

However, manufacturing of such films is challenging due to the cost involved in setting up and running high temperature chemical vapor deposition reactors, and the substrates that can withstand such reactor environment. One path to synthesizing such films is through room-temperature directed covalent assembly of detonation nanodiamonds aggregates (NDs) using ethylene diamine as a glue. To facilitate the formation of densely-packed continuous ND films suitable for industrial application, experiments were conducted to examine the impact of varying ND aggregate size and film annealing temperature on the film microstructure and cross-plane thermal conductivity. A method of changing ND aggregate size by changing the pH of a suitable liquid was developed. This study showed how the mechanism of film growth changes from Frank-van der Merwe (layer) type to Volmer-Weber (island) type with change in aggregate size. The setup, methods, and results on film morphology and thermal conductivity were disseminated through two international peer-reviewed journal articles. The results were presented at numerous conferences at the national and international level. A Monte Carlo simulation of phonon thermal transport in polycrystalline diamond thin films was developed to predict the impact of changing aggregate size on film thermal conductivity. The results were disseminated through one conference talk and a peer-reviewed journal publication. A suitable 3-omega test setup was built, validated, and successfully implemented to characterize the cross-plane conductivity of the ND films. Scanning electron microscopy was used to examine surface coverage at different scales. Atomic force microscopy-based methods were developed to report film thickness, apparent porosity, and pore aspect ratio; the latter two included image thresholding and watershed segmentation algorithms. Via these tools, film growth mechanism, film microstructure, and thermal conductivity were identified to be dependent on the ND aggregate size and the film microstructure. This study further shed light on film morphology changes when films were slowly annealed in an oven or rapidly annealed with a laser raster. Evidence suggests slow annealing leads to aggregation of a continuous film into discrete islands with increased porosity, while rapid annealing with minimal disturbance to film morphology was feasible below a threshold laser power. For industrial adoption, methods were developed to deposit such ND films via solution method, spin coating, and spray coating.</p>\n<p>This project provided education and research opportunities for four PhD students.
