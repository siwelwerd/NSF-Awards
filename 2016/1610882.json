 "awd_abstract_narration": "NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:  \r\n\r\nThe processes currently employed for the separation of the chemical compounds required by our modern economy are responsible for a significant portion of our society's energy demands. A great deal of scientific effort is currently directed toward trying to minimize these demands by developing new sponge-like materials that can be employed in these separations, broadly via selective absorption of chemical compounds into the available pores. The funded project seeks to develop a novel class of relatively simple sponge-like solids, those that possess individual cavities as opposed to interconnected pores. The work is expected to advance our understanding of chemical confinement and permeability in molecular solids with broader implications in materials and separations science and green chemistry. The project will support the education of our next generation of materials scientists and will provide internship opportunities for promising, low-income high school students in the DC metro area. \r\n\r\n\r\n     \r\nTECHNICAL SUMMARY:  \r\n\r\nMicroporous materials find a host of applications in industrial settings and open-pore structures, wherein pores are interconnected in one, two, or three dimensions, are the targets of much contemporary research in this area.  The funded project will study and develop intrinsically zero dimensionally (0D) porous molecular solids in the context of the seemingly broad misconception that the pores of such materials are inactive as sorbents.  The project aims to:  i) conduct fundamental studies toward the understanding the factors that govern sorption/desorption kinetics (and thermodynamics) in 0D porous molecular solids, seeking to understand the influence of structure, atomic motion and disorder, sorbate affinity, sorbate properties, and defect density, on crystal permeability, ii) develop novel materials and methods for enhanced exchange in 0D porous molecular solids, seeking to expand the functionality of 0D porous materials such that they may be on par with traditional open-pore materials for chemical separations, and iii) exploit the confinement properties of certain 0D porous molecular solids for novel science and applications (e.g., the stabilization of reactive species, or storage of volatiles).",

They have a profound impact on society: as industrial drying agents, in laundry detergents, in goldfish ponds, in petroleum refining/purification.  These materials can reasonably be thought of as sponges that selectively absorb/exchange small molecules, nobel gases, or ions that can be accommodated within their nanovacuum pores.  The vast majority of contemporary research in the area of microporous materials focuses on ?open-pore? structures wherein the pores are continuous (i.e., tunnel-like) and/or interconnected, thereby providing an obvious pathway through which sorbates can diffuse.  Conventional scientific wisdom suggests that any discrete, non-interconnected cavities (or zero-dimensional (0D) pores) in porous materials will be \"closed\" and \"inactive in processes such as fluid flow\" (Figure 1).  This award supported a systematic exploration of the properties of new, mainly crystalline 0D porous materials, characterized as having discrete (that is, non-continuous cavities) molecule-sized ultramicropores.  \n\nIntellectual Merit and Broader Impacts:  The supported research has resulted in a delineation of several experimental biases in contemporary research techniques that effectively obscure the existence of, and the properties of, 0D porous materials.  By studying several specific members of different classes of 0D porous materials--so called cavitands (Figure 2), cryptophanes \n(Figure 3), porous hydrogen bonded organic frameworks (Figure 4) and even certain metal-organic frameworks (Figure 5)--the supported work uncovered a wide range of sorption behaviors associated with 0D porous materials.  It was established that the rates of exchange of sorbates into/out of 0D pores/cavities can vary over several orders of magnitude; some materials do indeed offer pores which are entirely inactive with respect to fluid exchange at room temperature, whereas others can be designed to exhibit sorbate exchange rates that are comparable to traditional open-pore materials.  Broadly, the work focused on uncovering the experimental relationships between the kinetically and thermodynamically selective function of these 0D ultramicroporous sorbents and their underlying structure, and exploring the limits.  The research developed and synthesized new examples of 0D porous molecular solids.  It systematically studied the kinetics of gas sorption/desorption into/out of individual particles (single crystals) of certain 0D porous solids.  The research explored both the thermodynamic and kinetic selectivity of these novel materials for various commodity gaseous and liquid chemical sorbates.  In doing so, the research has uncovered materials that: i) for the first time, can permanently entrap air gases such as dinitrogen, ii) exhibit extremely high C1/2 vs. C3+ hydrocarbon selectivity by virtue of the 0D pore/cavity structure, iii) can separate chloromethane from dimethyl ether (and important industrial separation) by virtue of the 0D pore/cavity structure, iv) can kinetically separate noble gases Kr and Xe, with excellent kinetic selectivity by virtue of differences in rates of diffusion through a dynamic, 0D porous material architecture, v) are capable of acting as crystalline sponges for the structural characterization gases (e.g. the first reported crystal structure of Freon-41, crystal structures of ordered N2, O2, CO2, etc.).
