 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fogging is a very common problem that everyone has encountered, whether it?s on bathroom mirrors, windshields, sports and safety goggles, or military visors. Upon a sudden change of temperature or humidity, fog can form on any surface as a result of condensed tiny water droplets which prevent the passing through of light. Fogging is not only frustrating when it appears on mirrors, glasses, and windows, but also presents a very dangerous yet persistent concern, especially for vehicle operators, sports participants, and workers with safety goggles. The I-Corps project, ?Fogkicker?, at the University of Massachusetts will build upon fundamental NSF-sponsored research originating in the Carter research group. New anti-fogging technologies and materials have been discovered and the goal of this I-Corps team will be to bring these scientific innovations closer to products and processes that will benefit society. This project will contribute to sustainable development and application of nanocellulose materials, targeting at reducing the use of non-degradable petroleum chemical based materials and protecting the environment. The mentoring and funding provided by the I-Corps program will accelerate the development of this new antifogging technology and help attract new third-party funding. The outcomes of the program will be a clear go or no-go decision regarding the commercialization of the anti-fogging technology, a transition plan for the project, and a technology demonstration for potential partners.\r\n\r\nThe I-Corps project, \"Fogkicker,\" at the University of Massachusetts will build upon fundamental NSF-sponsored research originating in the Carter research group. New anti-fogging technologies and materials have been discovered and the goal of this I-Corps team will be to bring these scientific innovations closer to products and processes that will benefit society. FogKicker is made from nanocellulose, a natural nanomaterial that can be extracted from waste paper, wood, or plants. Nanocellulose is an extremely hydrophilic material, which readily and efficiently absorbs water. To make FogKicker, nanocellulose is added to a dilute aqueous solution, which allows the solution to be applied to a variety of surfaces. When FogKicker dries, it creates a hydrophilic coating on the surface it is applied to. This hydrophilic coating absorbs moisture, preventing fog from condensing where the coating is applied; this is how FogKicker prevents the formation of fog on any surface. To formulate the FogKicker solution, the team has also developed a novel process for the extraction of nanocellulose, which has broad applications in automotive, aerospace, packaging, and construction. The mentoring and funding provided by the I-Corps program will accelerate the development of this new antifogging technology and help attract new third-party funding. The outcomes of the program will be a clear go or no-go decision regarding the commercialization of the anti-fogging technology, a transition plan for the project, and a technology demonstration for potential partners.",

New anti-fogging technologies and materials have been discovered and the goal of this I-Corp team was to bring these scientific innovations closer to products and processes that will benefit society. The mentoring and funding provided by the I-Corp program accelerates the development of this new antifogging technology and helped the successful launch of a new company, Treaty LLC. The outcomes of the program was a clear go or no go decision regarding the commercialization of the anti-fogging technology, a transition plan for the project, and a technology demonstration for potential partners. The team consisted of Yinyong Li (Entrepreneurial Lead); Kenneth R. Carter (Faculty mentor), and Gregory S. Thomas (Mentor, Corning Incorporated). Keywords: <em>Anti-fogging Coating, Biodegradable, Nanocellulose, Nanomaterial, Sustainable Technologies</em></p>\n<p><strong>Intellectual Merit:</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;Fogging is a very common problem that everyone has encountered, whether it&rsquo;s on bathroom mirrors, windshields, sports and safety goggles, or military visors. Our project, FogKicker, is a novel natural anti-fog technology. FogKicker is a solution that after application, prevents the formation of fog on any surface, including vehicle windshields, eyewear, mirrors, and windows. Its key component is nanocellulose, a wood derived natural nanomaterial, making FogKicker biodegradable, biocompatible, and non-toxic. Compared with other anti-fog products, FogKicker is more environmentally friendly, cheaper, and has superior anti-fogging performance. Our team underwent the training of the i-Corps program. We visited over 30 dives stores, sports stores, swimming centers, and trade shows to accomplish 119 independent customer interviews. With the data acquired from these interviews, we identified our first segment of customers, which are scuba divers. Divers and snorkelers have the most significant problem with fogging off scuba masks while under water and clearly expressed a desired to have a better anti-fog solution. Since then, we launched our startup company, Treaty, LLC. to commercialize the product, FogKicker. As of the end of the grant two different FogKicker products have been sold online and through distributors/dealers throughout the world. FogKicker products have been sold in more than 20 countries and territories within one year of business.&nbsp; The company and our product have been featured on numerous major media. For example we were featured on an episode of the CNCB TV series Adventure Capitalists. The product was highlighted on NBC's morning show TODAY. We filmed a segment of the TV show, Nature Know Best, which broadcast on the Fox Network and Hulu, Science &amp; Technology Research News. The company was featured as the cover story of BusinessWest magazine and was interviewed by local public radio. The major media coverage increased the visibility of our product and greatly assisted sales. In each interview we highlighted the fact that the company and product came out of NSF supported research and we discussed the i-Corps program.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;Broader Impacts:</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;This project has contributed to sustainable development and application of nanocellulose materials. A number of industries will be positively impacted by FogKicker, such as glass manufacturers, eyewear and google manufacturers, and end-users of these transparent products. As a green anti-fogging product, FogKicker will enhance the safety in working, driving, and entertaining, which improves life quality and working efficiency, as well as reducing injury claims and helping save lives. Meanwhile, by replacing the current petroleum chemical based anti-fogging products with biodegradable nanocellulose based anti-fogging solution, FogKicker will help protect environment in a sustainable way. Kenneth R. Carter and Yinyong Li have become co-founders of Treaty, LLC. Yinyong Li is the Chief Technical Executive and Kenneth R. Carter is the Chief Scientific Advisor of the company. The Springfield, MA based company will likely grow and hire technicians, as well as marketing and sales professionals. Two patents have been filed. These patents are held by the University of Massachusetts &ndash; Amherst and have been exclusively licensed to the startup, Treaty LLC. Carter at UMass and Treaty LLC, will continue to explore new applications of nanocellulose and future IP will be protected. The anti-fogging product, FogKicker, has been sold in more than 20 countries and territories within one year of business. Over 100,000 units have been sold and are being used by the public in underwater and skiing environments. The feedback has been tremendous, with multiple users expressing great satisfaction with FogKicker.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 01/29/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Kenneth&nbsp;R&nbsp;Carter</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1628256/1628256_10413502_1517247197316_FogKicker_06--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1628256/1628256_10413502_1517247197316_FogKicker_06--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"BusinessWest Magazine\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1628256/1628256_10413502_1517247197316_FogKicker_06--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"BusinessWest Magazine\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Ken Carter and Yinyong Li featured on the cover of the November 13, 2017 issue of BusinessWest Magazine</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Ken Carter</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Kenneth&nbsp;R&nbsp;Carter</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">BusinessWest Magazine</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1628256/1628256_10413502_1517246248275_FogKicker_01--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1628256/1628256_10413502_1517246248275_FogKicker_01--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Team Fogkicker\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1628256/1628256_10413502_1517246248275_FogKicker_01--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Team Fogkicker\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Team FogKicker conducting customer interview at Blue Planet Dive shop, Washington DC..
