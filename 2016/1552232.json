 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mass is being lost from the Greenland Ice Sheet both in the form of liquid water and solid ice.  The solid ice occurs in the form of icebergs.  The influence of these icebergs on the stratification and circulation of water in fjords, as well as on the freshwater content of the adjacent ocean, is poorly understood.  This project will improve understanding of the role of icebergs in fjords and the coastal ocean through intensive process studies on iceberg melt and movement.  These studies will include both field observations and numerical modeling experiments.  \r\n\r\nThe project will contribute to the development of the nation's STEM workforce by providing support for the training of a graduate student and a post-doctoral associate.  To enhance the communication of science to the general public, a course in Geo-communication will be modified to include new multi-media approaches.  Additionally, the project will allow the PI to extend his prior collaborations with University of Oregon's STEM CORE program to work with a local middle school on STEM-focused curricula.  To enhance outreach to the broader public, the principal investigator will collaborate with a science historian to transcribe archived data into modern format that will be freely distributed, co-deliver public talks, add content to an existing website, and participate in an annual event on Climate Change and Indigenous Peoples organized by his institution.\r\n\r\nThe ongoing surge in ocean-glacier interactions studies around Greenland is motivated primarily to improve our understanding of the role ocean circulation plays in outlet glacier variability. Two potential mechanisms that lead to glacier acceleration and dynamic thinning are (1) increased submarine melting due to an enhanced ocean heat transport to the glacier termini, and (2) a weakening of the ice m\u00e9lange that buttresses the glacier face. Fjords act as links between these two processes with the large-scale climate forcing on one hand (both oceanic and atmospheric) and the Greenland ice sheet variability on the other. However, one key process, iceberg melt, has been largely neglected in most fjord circulation studies due to a narrow focus on plume driven circulation, as well as the overall difficulty of obtaining in situ observations. This proposal aims to gather novel observations on iceberg melt and movement in Greenland?s fjords by tracking the horizontal and vertical motion of large, deep-keeled icebergs at high temporal resolution. Tracking individual icebergs, combined with ship- and drone-based surveys, will allow quantification not only of iceberg melt rates, but also of their movement through the fjord and eventual dispersal across the shelf and into the interior ocean. Fieldwork will be conducted in relatively well-studied systems in Greenland, with the potential for rapid generalization to other systems. Complemented by numerical ocean modeling, these process studies will enable assessment of how well current parameterizations capture the melt processes occurring in Greenland's waters. Ultimately, these results will provide a solid foundation for improving understanding of the spatial and temporal picture of iceberg motion and melt and how this can be incorporated into operational iceberg trajectory models, as well as global scale climate models.",

The documentary <em>Chasing Ice</em> captivated millions with its vivid imagery of crashing glaciers and a changing Greenland Ice Sheet. Video is powerful, yet the science behind the changing ice sheets is equally clear: they are losing ice both by an increase in liquid runoff and an increase in solid ice discharge, i.e., icebergs. What is missing from the emerging picture of these rapidly changing ice sheets are an understanding of the feedbacks between oceanography and glaciology. Icebergs are a prime example, since their melt can alter ocean conditions far from their parent glaciers, as well as act to buttress or hold back glaciers if they are packed dense enough at the glacier front. Satellite remote-sensing has revolutionized glaciology and that focus has been applied to icebergs too, yet we lack any detailed data of what is happening underwater. We are literally only seeing the tip of the iceberg from space and potentially missing out on how the ocean affects these icebergs subsurface and vice versa, how these icebergs affect the ocean down to depths of hundreds of meters.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The key challenge in improving our knowledge of iceberg processes is the difficulty of obtaining observations, precisely because of the iceberg presence and harsh weather conditions. In this proposal, we collected novel observations of icebergs from ship and drones, combining those data with remotely-sensed imagery as available. Over 3 field seasons in Sermilik Fjord, southeast Greenland, we led research cruises aboard Greenlandic vessels that successfully imaged the underwater portions of icebergs over time. Coupled with above-water drone imagery, we were able to create the first complete 3-D reconstructions of these large (often &gt;500 m deep and 1000 m long) Greenlandic icebergs. These findings have paved the way for a resurgence in iceberg science, as we are now starting to have the data and understanding of how they melt and move to include them in global climate models. Since so much ice is discharged from Greenland at present (and the same processes occur to some degree around Antarctica as well), including their melt and trajectories in climate simulations is necessary as they distribute freshwater around the northern North Atlantic, potentially affecting regional and global ocean circulation. All data from this project have successfully been archived at the Arctic Data Center.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>During the project period, the PI also trained a large number of undergraduate (4) and graduate students (4), and two postdoctoral scholars who both successfully transitioned to into academic careers. Two of the undergraduates were first-generation college students and have since applied to graduate school to continue doing research in STEM fields. Additionally, the project developed curricula for a middle school in Eugene, Oregon, that serves the highest percentage of under-represented minorities in the area. These curricula were hands-on and delivered to students during a dedicated ?iceberg week? that the teachers helped create. Importantly, these educational iceberg activities, after being tested on these local students, are now shareable online and should reach a larger audience. Additional outreach during the project included collaboration with three different artists. One, a Los Angeles-based artist named Rob Reynolds, produces sculptures and virtual reality pieces and reaches a large and very different audience through exhibits and shows at museums in Southern California. The PI also initiated a collaboration with a historian and literature scholar at his university in the final year of the project to examine the way humans and ice (here, icebergs) intersect in Greenland, which led to a new college course and new ways of thinking about how science and the humanities interact. Ultimately, this project was meant to jumpstart the career of the PI both in research and education and it certainly succeeded at that aim.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Images, titles, and captions:</p>\n<p>Apres_recovery2_IMG_4483.jpg: Recovering the ApRES in 2019</p>\n<p>With the helicopter running and landed on an iceberg, Kristin Schild hurries to complete the recovery of the ApRES system deployed on an iceberg in southeast Greenland during summer 2019.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Iceberg_GPS_2018.png: GPS unit on a tracked iceberg</p>\n<p>This is a drone-based picture taken of one GPS unit on the iceberg dubbed ?Stingray? in Sermilik Fjord, southeast Greenland, during summer 2018.
