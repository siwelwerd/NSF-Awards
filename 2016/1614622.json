 "awd_abstract_narration": "Information processing in the brain is organized and facilitated by the complex interactions\r\nof intrinsic biophysical properties of distinct neuronal types, neuronal morphology, and network\r\nconnection topology. These properties give rise to specific types of network oscillations\r\nand other dynamic processes that govern neural information encoding and exchange. This project is \r\ndesigned to create a detailed picture at unprecedented scale of how the\r\nintrinsic properties of hippocampal principal neurons and interneurons define the network\r\nactivity under normal conditions, and how pathological changes in those properties under epileptic\r\nconditions disrupt hippocampal function.  The overarching goal of this activity is to construct\r\na 1:1 scale, realistic and detailed computational model of the CA1-CA3-dentate gyrus network\r\nin the rat hippocampus and study physiological and pathophysiological network dynamics. \r\nThe project will use the Blue Waters supercomputer to execute this detailed model.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the project aims to achieve broader impact in the neuroscience community by providing the\r\nsoftware infrastructure necessary to put unprecedented petascale computing capability within\r\nreach of neuroscientists regardless of their expertise in high-performance computing (HPC).\r\nThe support for GPUs and the Intel MIC architecture being developed in the widely-used NEURON\r\nsimulator will enable neuroscientists to fully utilize supercomputing accelerator architectures\r\nand thus catalyze greater research productivity and pave the way for wider use of large-scale\r\nand full-scale detailed modeling of the brain.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the neuroscience model code and simulation support software being developed as part of the\r\nresearch goals behind this proposal will be made publicly available and will remove the\r\nbarriers of setting up simulations and managing results data that traditionally have impeded\r\nthe utilization of high-performance computing resources.",
