 "awd_abstract_narration": "Urbanized estuaries and coastal regions, where rising sea level, warming temperatures, and invasive species intersect growing human populations, intensifying development, and economically important activities, are among the most vulnerable to the pressures of disruptive global changes.  Interdisciplinary STEM professionals are needed to develop and implement evidence-based adaptation strategies and solutions that will harmonize human-built and natural environments to support coastal ecosystem and community resilience.  This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award to San Francisco State University will prepare a new generation of masters-level graduates with the scientific and professional skills needed to enter STEM and STEM-allied careers that address research projects focused on adaptation, mitigation and conservation solutions for urbanized coastal areas confronting the effects of climate change. Trainees will be recruited from a diversity of populations to enhance the creativity and success of our nation's future STEM professionals. The project anticipates training forty (40) to sixty (60) MS students, including forty (40) funded trainees, from the Departments of Biology, Earth and Climate Science, Chemistry, and Geography; trainees will participate in an interdisciplinary MS degree program in Marine Science based at the Romberg Tiburon Center for Environmental Studies.\r\n\r\nThe project will combine coursework, an interdisciplinary research experience, and a professional internship to graduate MS students adept at working at the interface of science and society in a time of global change. The new MS curriculum will consist of: (1) an integrated series of courses and workshops to provide a comprehensive background in global change impacts on urbanized coastal areas and professional and communication skills training; (2) an internship with a policy, management or public education organization; (3) an independent research project; (4) teaching experience through a teaching assistantship; and (5) dedicated advising sessions throughout the program to support student success and professional development.  Formal coursework will introduce students to interconnected aspects of estuarine and coastal processes, biotic responses, critical habitats, human impacts, and resource management issues associated with global change. Graduate seminars will emphasize critical reading of relevant primary literature. Workshops will address professional skills, scientific communication, scientific writing, data analysis, ethics and budgeting. Our program will train MS students to reach diverse audiences through effective communication and education, and support policymakers in translating science to inform decisions. Trainees will be mentored in conducting cutting-edge research projects that examine impacts of global change and that illuminate fruitful areas for action in developing solutions. \r\n\r\nThe NSF Research Traineeship (NRT) Program is designed to encourage the development and implementation of bold, new potentially transformative models for STEM graduate education training. The Traineeship Track is dedicated to effective training of STEM graduate students in high priority interdisciplinary research areas, through the comprehensive traineeship model that is innovative, evidence-based, and aligned with changing workforce and research needs.",
