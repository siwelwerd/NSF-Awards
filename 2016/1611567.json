 "awd_abstract_narration": "Adams State University (ASU) will implement an ADVANCE Institutional Transformation-Catalyst (IT-Catalyst) project to undertake institutional self-assessment activities and adapt ADVANCE best practices.  During year one of the project, ASU will collect institutional data, including a salary survey and recruitment pool analysis, and workload assessment, and will also conduct faculty surveys and focus groups.  During year two, the team will visit ADVANCE IT institutions to learn about best practices, hold meetings with key stakeholders (faculty/chairs/administrators) to discuss data and best practices.  During year three, the university will work to implement changes and incorporate them into the next iteration of the university's strategic plan\r\n\r\nASU provides a unique context in which to examine the recruitment, retention and promotion of women faculty in STEM disciplines.  ASU is a small, primarily undergraduate, public, Hispanic-serving institution (HSI) in rural south-central Colorado.   The campus has been challenged to recruit and retain women, who account for 27 percent of STEM faculty.  ASU has demonstrated readiness for change; all stakeholder groups have communicated their commitment to the project, and the campus already has extensive programming and policy organized around the theme of \"inclusive excellence.\"   ADVANCE will build on this strong foundation, and the program could serve as a model for small, rural HSIs. \r\n\r\nThe ADVANCE program is focused on developing systemic approaches to increase the participation, retention, and advancement of women in academic STEM careers.  The IT-Catalyst track funds projects that aim to conduct institutional self-assessments and implement ADVANCE strategies that have been shown to be effective to address gendered issues for STEM faculty.",

The supporting self-assessment and review processes and procedures, and the resulting plan, set an example for disciplines across campus. The project identified the most critical areas of need and develop organizational mechanisms that gender equity in science technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and social and behavioral sciences (SBS) disciplines and provide foundational work for an institutional transformation plan.\n\nStudies\n\nDuring the self-assessment phase of the grant period, staff conducted several studies comparing women and men regarding salaries, student evaluations, and time spent on job related tasks. Project staff followed up these studies through focus groups and a questionnaire survey of faculty.\n\nSalary Study - Salary data for tenure-track professors in all fields were examined for the years 2012 - 2016. \n\nStudent Evaluations of Teaching - A comparative analysis was done for male and female faculty student evaluation scores in the STEM/SBS fields (n = 1,760) and in the non-STEM/SBS fields (n = 3686) for Fall Semester 2012 through Fall Semester 2016.

Sixteen surveys were completed (female = 9, male = 7).\n\nProducts\n\nLiterature Review - A literature review on \"Advancing Women in STEM and SBS\" was developed by project staff. This paper is a review of the literature on women, minorities, and persons with disabilities in science and engineering. Included are references to publications that present research studies, statistical information, survey results, reviews of research, organizational diagnostic tools, new approaches to research studies, document analysis, and program models.\n\nInstitutional Transformation Plan - Through the efforts of the NSF ADVANCE grant, ASU has developed an Institutional Transformation Plan (IT-Plan) that will increase the recruitment, retention, and advancement of faculty women, and of Latinas in particular, in STEM and in SBS areas at ASU.
