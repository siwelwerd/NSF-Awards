 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non technical abstract\r\nIn Nature, biological systems have evolved to operate under variable conditions with high fidelity and enviable ability to tune and self-assemble. For example, cells divide or differentiate and muscles contract. This wealth of phenomena is possible because living systems consume energy as a token to pay the toll to achieve those emergent behaviors.  The aim of this CAREER project is to provide a comprehensive picture of the key mechanisms at stake. To this end, the research team will use a bottom-up approach with a variety of experiments using artificial and microscopic building blocks, which consume energy.  The ultimate goal is to design novel, smart and active materials and bring the biological organization to the materials world. The cutting-edge research program mutually integrates with the development of a soft matter curriculum for undergraduate and graduate students. Excellence in education is transverse and relies on two strategic axes: (i) an outreach effort using the natural appeal of \"soft\" materials, e.g. splashing ketchup or cornstarch at science fairs or getting students into the lab, and (ii) a science \"without walls\" components with a bi-annual seminar.\r\n\r\nTechnical abstract\r\nThe aim of this five-year CAREER program is to harness the out-of-equilibrium nature of synthetic colloidal active matter to explore its physical principles and create novel materials with advanced functionalities. It is an experiment-driven proposal, rooted in fundamental questions about the mechanisms of emergent phenomena in nature, here addressed with purely synthetic components. It focuses on self-organization and synchronization with different realization of self-propelled particles using microfluidics, colloid science and microscopy techniques. The thrust of this project is the wealth of original experiments, which complement each other to provide a comprehensive picture of the key mechanisms required for the emergence of complexity in non- equilibrium systems. This approach will pioneer developments beyond soft matter physics and explore uncharted fields of out-of-equilibrium physics from self-organization to motility in biology. The creation of novel materials with cutting-edge functionalities will have an impact in material science, nano- and bioengineering.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "Project 1. Activity-Controlled Annealing\nDevelopments on active colloids have surged in recent years, mainly as a \"toy for physicists\" focused on exotic collective behaviors of collections of  active particles.  It overlooked their practical impact to deploy materials science beyond equilibrium and actually control matter. We showed that active particles added to a material regulates its activity, i.e \"temperature\", internally, by enhancing the annealing of a colloidal monolayer.  \nProject 2. Navigation of gradient-sensing microscopic agents in complex environments. Active navigation relies on effectively extracting information from the surrounding environment, and often features the tracking of gradients of a relevant signal&mdash;such as the concentration of molecules. Microfluidic networks of closed pathways pose the challenge of determining the shortest exit pathway, which involves the proper local decision-making at each bifurcating junction.

We introduced a new type of self-assembly through a novel approach to devise spinning microrotors and micromachines.

In 1665, Huygens reported to the Royal Society in London that the pendula of two clocks hung together presented an \"odd kind of sympathy\": no matter where they started, within about half an hour the two pendula swung towards and away from each other in unison.  At microscale, a scale dominated by noise, the coordination of stochastic components is a non-trivial task and requires a fine balance between interactions and feedback.  The subject has broad implications in transmission of information at small scale, and is essential in understanding synchronization phenomena in biology notably for ciliated organisms, e.g. for transport in lungs, or motility.
