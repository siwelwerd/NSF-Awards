 "awd_abstract_narration": "The extinction of Earth's largest animals is radically changing the feeding relationships among other species (\"food webs\") which may place them at greater risk of extinction in the future. This project will examine Rancho La Brea tar pits for the complete fossil record (large carnivores to plants) and build ice age food webs prior to the major changes at the end of the last ice age 12,000 years ago (human arrival, the loss of large mammals, and climate change). Understanding the relationships among ice age animals and plants will help biologists predict which species were at most risk of extinction and apply these model predictions to present-day biodiversity. This project is also an excellent opportunity to support science education and diversity, by directly involving middle school students in California and Maine in the identification of fossils used in this research. Project findings will also be shared in new La Brea Tar Pits & Museum exhibits, which draw 350,000 visitors each year. \r\n\r\nFor this project, sediments from multiple asphalt seeps will be sampled for the small animals, insects and plants of the La Brea Tar Pits (California, USA). Fossils will be identified, radiocarbon dated, and then integrated into multi-trophic paleo food webs over the 40,000 years before the widespread environmental upheaval at the end of Pleistocene. Previously only the upper trophic levels (particularly carnivores) were investigated in detail; added information will test food web properties for predicting the sensitivity of species to global change. The project?s novel Bayesian framework, employed to reconstruct biomass flow, will be useful to both paleo and modern food web studies by facilitating integration of multiple proxies to characterize uncertainty in trophic interactions.",

Small mammals and plants, which are an important part of ecosystems, have largely been understudied. For this project, investigators took advantage of the opportunity afforded by the newly excavated \"Project 23\" deposits at La Brea, a series of new excavations using modern techqniues that includes the smaller components (i.e., tiny mouse teeth or juniper seeds) that were missing from many of the earlier excavations at La Brea. Team members, including graduate students and undergraduates at UC Merced and the University of Maine, identified tens of thousands of specimens, filling in the broader picture of the LA area during the time of sabertooths and giant sloths. Importantly, this project has developed the first full catalog of plants that grew in the LA Basin 30,000 - 40,000 years ago (the timing is based on dozens of radiocarbon-dated specimens generated for this project), the majority of which had never been identified at this site before.&nbsp;<br /><br />These results have been used to build food web models -- computer simulations that explore how different species of plants and animals interect, which will be used to help predict which species will be most vulnerable and in need of conservation efforts in the future. Because fragments of charcoal were also preserved in these deposits, this project has identified the conditions during which fire is more frequent, and how that affected the plants and animals of LA's Mediterranean habitats. This information will help land managers predict how fire will change in the LA Basin in the coming centuries, and how that will impact plants and animals living in the region today.<br /><br />This project supported the development of new exhibits at the Tar Pits, which recieves 1.4 million visitors a year. It also facilitated the development of a classroom fossil experience that hundreds of LA County students participated in, learning about real paleontology techniques and how the ecology of the past can be used to understand ecosystems today. The methods developed in this project will be used in the Tar Pits' ongoing classroom education efforts, and will provide a model for other museums interested in engaging students with fossil sorting ad identification experiences.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 06/24/2020<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Jacquelyn&nbsp;Gill</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1623840/1623840_10459348_1593028029473_TarPitsSamples--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1623840/1623840_10459348_1593028029473_TarPitsSamples--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Ice Age Plants from the Tar Pits\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1623840/1623840_10459348_1593028029473_TarPitsSamples--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Ice Age Plants from the Tar Pits\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Seeds, twigs, needles, and other plant fragments sorted by students as part of the fossil identification classroom activity developed by the La Brea Food Webs project.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Libby Ellwood</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Jacquelyn&nbsp;Gill</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Ice Age Plants from the Tar Pits</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1623840/1623840_10459348_1593029262110_TarPitsKits--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1623840/1623840_10459348_1593029262110_TarPitsKits--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Classroom Fossil Kit\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1623840/1623840_10459348_1593029262110_TarPitsKits--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Classroom Fossil Kit\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The comic book developed for this project accompanies the classroom exercise.
