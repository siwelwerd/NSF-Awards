 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Learning and Research Center will advance efforts of the Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program to better understand and promote practices that increase students' motivations and capacities to pursue careers in fields of science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) by developing an innovative approach to using library Makerspaces to link literacy, career awareness, and learning in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM).  Middle and high schools students from groups underrepresented in science, including visually impaired students, will digitally design and fabricate 3D-printed tactile storybooks for young children with visual impairments.  In partnership with schools, libraries, and the Colorado Center for the Blind, the project will engage participants in socially purposeful activity as they gain experiences in integrating art, multimodal literacy, engineering design and fabrication, STEM concepts, and mentoring activities that raise awareness of careers in STEM-related fields.  High school students who complete the program will have opportunities to serve as mentors for younger students.  The Tactile Picture Books Project (TPBP) has two overarching goals: a) Expand participation in STEM among underrepresented learners, especially girls, underrepresented minorities and students with visual impairments, through accessible critical making experiences in libraries; and b) Increase STEM career awareness and interest among underrepresented learners.\r\n\r\nThe project will engage more than 770 learners from underrepresented groups, including at least 400 females and 120 students with visual impairments to examine the new strategy and to deepens understanding of the factors that support the success of the approach among groups underrepresented in STEM fields.  A Design-Based Implementation Research (DBIR) approach will be employed to study outcomes relating to three research questions:  a) What aspects of the TPBP curriculum and informal learning environment most effectively support students' STEM competencies and dispositions, including: multimodal literacy and 3D design for diverse learners, fabrication skills, collaboration and innovation, and self-efficacy and persistence?  b) In what ways and to what degree do STEM Professionals, serving as Makerspace mentors, influence students? awareness of and interest in STEM careers?  And c) What aspects of the Critical Making experience focused on tactile books most effectively engage and support underrepresented learners, including girls, minorities and students with visual impairments, in 3D design and fabrication activities, and in developing STEM attitudes and interests?  The project incorporates two tiers of mentors to support critical making experiences in libraries: a) High School Mentors, recruited from partner schools, and b) STEM Professionals, recruited from partner Maker groups.  Accessible tactile pictures created through the project will be distributed to families with blind children via Colorado's Talking Books Library, integrated into public libraries' Sensory Storytimes (designed for children with sensory processing issues and autism), and the 3D designs will be made available online to support widespread production of accessible materials for young children. The TPBP curriculum, design guidelines and research findings will be disseminated via national networks of educators, libraries, Makerspaces, and researchers in education and career development.",

A majority of youth (72% of girls, 57% of boys) cited 'helping others' as their primary motivation to participate in informal BBB programs, as opposed to 17% of girls and 25% of boys who cited their interest in technology. Girls opted in to BBB programs at higher rates than comparable non-BBB maker programs. External evaluation documented high levels of student engagement, and the BBB design task motivated participants to persist through obstacles. One librarian expressed, \"I had a lot of kids who had never [come to the makerspace] before. It definitely drew a different crowd and they took it much more seriously. They had more thoughtful discussions about what they were doing than we'd really had in other big projects that we've done in the makerspace.\" Participants value the authenticity of the design task, appreciate the opportunity to select from multiple modes and tools, and feel like they are creating something that may improve someone's life. Another librarian commented, \"I really did feel like the kids put extra care into what they were doing because they knew that it wasn't just something they were making that was going to sit in their school. It was literally going to somebody else.

Many participants reflect that the project has increased their awareness of the importance of designing products that are accessible for all children, including those with visual impairments.

As one high school participant commented, \"For me, I had never really thought about people with disabilities before or what they might need. Doing this project made me think more about the kinds of things people with disabilities might need-- or the kinds of things they might need in the future.\" In interviews, 95% of youth described gains in understanding universal design and in their ability to produce more accessible products for people with visual impairments or other disabilities.&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">BBB proved to be adaptable across a range of diverse learning environments. Key elements that enhance the learning experience across different contexts include: centering empathy in the design process; taking an asset-based approach in learning about end users, focusing on individuals' abilities rather than their limitations; emphasizing universal design for learning, and considering how information can be presented in multiple formats and modes; investing sufficient time to support an iterative design process; and providing an opportunity to share and celebrate participants' work.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Broader Impacts: </strong>Nearly 5,000 youth, more than half of whom were girls or other underrepresented learners and including 75 children/teens with visual impairments, participated directly in BBB programs.

We disseminated this work broadly via 10 publications (targeting diverse fields including STEM/maker education, literacy and language arts, assistive technologies, and libraries) and presentations at national and international conferences, including FabLearn, International Society for Technology in Education, Literacy Research Association, American Educational Research Association, and SXSW-EDU, reaching 1,323 attendees.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/21/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Stacey&nbsp;A&nbsp;Forsyth</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1615247/1615247_10457733_1639770446167_Precollegiategirlsfeeltactileimage--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1615247/1615247_10457733_1639770446167_Precollegiategirlsfeeltactileimage--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Three female teens participating in a pre-collegiate summer STEM program feel a tactile image they designed.\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1615247/1615247_10457733_1639770446167_Precollegiategirlsfeeltactileimage--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Three female teens participating in a pre-collegiate summer STEM program feel a tactile image they designed.\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Three female teens participating in a pre-collegiate summer STEM program feel a tactile image they designed in a Build a Better Book workshop.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Stacey Forsyth</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Stacey&nbsp;A&nbsp;Forsyth</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Three female teens participating in a pre-collegiate summer STEM program feel a tactile image they designed.</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1615247/1615247_10457733_1639770784560_BBBbooksgamescollageof6--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1615247/1615247_10457733_1639770784560_BBBbooksgamescollageof6--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Collage of six youth-created products designed in BBB workshops, including tactile books and games, and pictures enhanced with sound using Makey Makey.\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1615247/1615247_10457733_1639770784560_BBBbooksgamescollageof6--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Collage of six youth-created products designed in BBB workshops, including tactile books and games, and pictures enhanced with sound using Makey Makey.\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Examples of youth-created products designed in BBB workshops, including tactile books and games, and pictures enhanced with sound using Makey Makey.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Stacey Forsyth</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Stacey&nbsp;A&nbsp;Forsyth</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Collage of six youth-created products designed in BBB workshops, including tactile books and games, and pictures enhanced with sound using Makey Makey.</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1615247/1615247_10457733_1639771004556_JanetAbrahamPDworkshop2020--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1615247/1615247_10457733_1639771004556_JanetAbrahamPDworkshop2020--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Two educators in a BBB professional development workshop collaborate on a project, while other educators work on their projects in the background.\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1615247/1615247_10457733_1639771004556_JanetAbrahamPDworkshop2020--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Two educators in a BBB professional development workshop collaborate on a project, while other educators work on their projects in the background.\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Two educators in a BBB professional development workshop collaborate on a project, while other educators from around the country work on their projects in the background.
