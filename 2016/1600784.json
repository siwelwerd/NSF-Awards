 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project builds upon previous research by the investigator regarding the coupling between polar climate at millennial time scales and the bi-polar origin of Heinrich events (i.e., the polar synchronization hypothesis). The researcher will pursue a number of research questions, among the most important being: (1) How and when did polar synchronization start, and how did it evolve? and (2) What is the nature of the information being exchanged since coupling implies communication or exchange of information? These scientific questions are currently unanswered.\r\n\r\nThe primary Broader Impacts involve greater scientific understanding of polar climate and inter-hemispheric communication of climate forcing. The project also involves undergraduate students in the discovery and understanding of paleoclimate dynamics.",
