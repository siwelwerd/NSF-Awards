 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms program of the Chemistry Division, Professors Mark Ediger (University of Wisconsin-Madison) and Ranko Richert (Arizona State University) are studying organic glasses prepared by deposition from the gas phase. Glasses play an important role in modern technology.  For example, many cell phone displays are organic light emitting diodes and organic glasses are the active layers in these devices. This project seeks to determine properties of glasses and this fundamental understanding may enable the production of improved glasses that are useful in applications. \r\n\r\nThis project characterizes the properties of vapor-deposited glasses using nanocalorimetry and dielectric relaxation. Recent work has established that vapor-deposited glasses can exhibit very high kinetic stability and other unexpected properties. The researchers study the extent to which secondary relaxation processes in vapor-deposited glasses are suppressed as a sensitive indication of the perfection of packing in the glass.  Deposition in the presence of a large electric field is being tested as a means of preparing glasses with even higher kinetic stability. In addition, the project seeks to understand why some organic molecules do not form highly stable glasses when vapor-deposited. The training of graduate, undergraduate, and high school students is being advanced through the integration of chemistry research and education activities. Each summer an educational outreach program is presented to high school juniors, most of whom are from groups that are underrepresented in engineering and science, to develop interest in science/engineering and skills required for success in college.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nGlasses play an important role in modern technology: optical fibers are critical for modern communications, metallic glasses are used in the highest efficiency electrical transformers, polymer glasses form the structure of new commercial aircraft, and organic glasses are the active layers in the light emitting diodes (OLEDs) used as displays in most smart phones.  At present, not enough is known about glasses to efficiently find the best materials for a given application.  The immediate goal of this project was a more complete understanding of the structure and properties of glasses, and in particular, how the structure and properties of a glass can be changed by the way in which glasses are prepared.  For this project, glasses were prepared by vapor deposition.  This is the same method used to prepare OLED displays.  Experiments were performed on model systems to increase fundamental understanding and it is expected that this will enable the production of improved glasses that are useful in applications. For example, understanding more about the mechanisms by which vapor-deposited glasses are formed, should enable production of glasses for OLEDs with improved efficiency and long-term stability.\n\nThe major results of this grant are summarized as follows: 1) Secondary relaxations for many molecular glasses can be suppressed by vapor deposition if the correct deposition conditions are selected.  This means that there is less molecular mobility in the glass and the glass is expected to be more resistant to degradation.  2) Using vapor deposition, glasses with very high stability can be formed from some organic molecules but not others.  Liquids that interact with hydrogen-bonding are less able to form highly stable glasses.  3) An electric field-induced increase in relaxation time was demonstrated for a number of liquids. This has important implications for how glasses change their properties over time.
