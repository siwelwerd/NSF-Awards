 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professors Bingjun Xu and Yushan Yan of the University of Delaware are supported by the Chemical Catalysis program of the Division of Chemistry to develop a basic understanding of the electrochemistry of fuel cells and electrolyzers. Increased efficiency and reduced cost are key to the economical performance of these clean energy producing devices.  Replacing the traditional precious metal containing components of these devices with less expensive metals reduces costs but results in lower efficiency.  In this project a fundamental understanding of the interaction between the device components is developed to enable the use of inexpensive metals while maintaining or even improving their efficiency.  Both K-12 and undergraduate students are involved in the project. In addition, a mobile device-based software application is developed to raise awareness on carbon footprint and the environment and provide a platform for sharing green energy related information. \r\n\r\nThe overarching goal of this research program is to understand the interaction of alkaline polymer electrolytes (organic cations) with electrodes at the molecular level, and its impact on the activity of the hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR). In-situ attenuated total reflection - surface enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR-SEIRAS) is primarily employed to correlate the molecular structure of free and tethered organic cations and their potential-dependent configurations when adsorbed on electrode surfaces.  The chemistry of free and adsorbed organic cations, including their interactions with HOR intermediates and their impact on HOR activity and mechanism, are also investigated.  The structure-activity relations established from this project guides the design of both hydroxide exchange membranes and electrocatalysts for electrochemical energy conversion devices.",
