 "awd_abstract_narration": "High electron mobility transistors (HEMTs) based on nitride material systems feature a unique combination of high breakdown voltage, high output power, high efficiency, wide bandwidth, low noise, and temperature and radiation hardness and have great potential in applications such as wireless communication, homeland security, radar and satellite systems, as well as emerging harsh-environment computing, sensing, cloud-networking and power conversion electronics. However, issues related to long-term reliability of these devices still remain a major concern. Reliability can be defined as the probability of operating a system for a given time under specified conditions without failure. For semiconductor devices, unrecoverable change of a device parameter (such as degradation in the output current) may be considered as a failure. As evidenced in recently reported stress or accelerated tests, high temperature gradients (thermal effect), high electric fields and built-in or induced mechanical stresses (inverse piezoelectric effect), and high current densities (hot carrier effect) may all induce damages or defects in the constituent materials and ultimately lead to device failure. Yet, the exact physical mechanisms governing the defect formation as well as the nature and distribution of these defects are still not clearly understood. This poses a significant challenge to not only interpreting the experimental results but also predicting or extrapolating the device lifetime, tasks that are critical, for example, for devices used in remote applications. It is well acknowledged that to study physical processes that are experimentally intractable, numerical modeling becomes essential. This project sets out to develop a multiscale and multiphysics simulation framework for modeling the time evolution of and the physical mechanisms responsible for AlGaN/GaN HEMT degradation. The developed simulator will enable device design for improved reliability. The simulator and the related instructional materials will be deployed and made freely available on nanoHUB.org for the broader community to use in research and classroom activities. \r\n\r\nThe objective of the proposed research is to develop a multiscale, multiphysics simulation framework (HEMT 3-D) for modeling device degradation mechanisms in AlGaN/GaN HEMTs.  Specific fundamental issues to be addressed include:  a) correlation between metal diffusion, polarization, and induced charge density, b) origin, spatial and temporal distribution of defects, and how they affect electrostatics, band structure, gate leakage, carrier deconfinement and trapping-detrapping and contact resistances, c) correlation between lattice heating and hot-electron injection into the barrier material, d) strain and inverse-piezoelectric effects and their temperature dependence, and e) device optimization through engineering geometry, material composition, channel orientation, and enhancement of heat transfer at barrier-channel and buffer-substrate interfaces via microscopic tuning of the interface characteristics. To properly treat the atomistic symmetry in the nanostructured active region as well as the underlying physical processes that are complex, nonlinear, highly stochastic and dynamically-coupled at different length and time scales, the simulator will employ a modular approach integrating first-principles molecular dynamics, lattice kinetic Monte Carlo, and quantum-corrected electron-phonon transport kernels. Portability and run-time efficiency of the simulator will be achieved through the use of open-source scientific software, compilers and libraries, as well as incorporating optimized models, algorithms and extensions for GPGPU platforms. Verification of the computational results will be considered at every stage of the software development effort against experimental data available in literature as well as through collaboration with experimentalists in research laboratories, academia and industries.",

Among them, three PhD students are employed in industry and three in academic institutions.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>2) <em>Scientific publications</em>: The project has produced 12 peer-reviewed journal articles and seven refereed conference proceedings. Two other articles have been submitted to journals and are currently being reviewed. The dissertations and the thesis of the students involved in the project have also greatly benefited from the project.</p>\n<p>3) <em>Other creative activity/product</em>: A software (HEMT3D) has been integrated to simulate high electron mobility transistors in emerging material system. An educational version of the simulator has been made freely accessible on NSF?s nanoHUB.org. A GUI (graphical user interface) has also been created that greatly simplifies the use of the simulator.</p>\n<p>The following are some of the key scientific/technical findings that address the project's intellectual merit:</p>\n<p>1) <em>Electron-phonon coupling strategy</em>: Electrons and phonons have average velocity about 10<sup>5</sup> <em>ms<sup>-1</sup></em> and 10<sup>3</sup> <em>ms<sup>-1</sup></em>, respectively. In addition, as phonons have much higher relaxation time, they require longer time to reach the steady state. Therefore, using the same time-step for both electrons and phonons in a particle-based modeling framework will make the simulation computationally prohibitive. To solve this problem, a novel three-stage coupling strategy is developed and validated by modeling temperature evolution in a nanoscale tri-gated device.</p>\n<p>2) <em>Emerging channel materials</em>:<em> </em></p>\n<p>a) Two-valley ensemble Monte Carlo simulations coupled with <em>ab initio</em> modeling was employed for the calculation of electron mobility in emerging high-power <em>&beta;</em>-Ga<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> material. The following scattering mechanisms are found to be important: acoustic deformation potential, ionized impurity, and polar optical phonons (POP). In this case, 50 meV of POP energy was found to be sufficient for the Fr?hlich scattering model.</p>\n<p>b) As for &epsilon;-Ga<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, within the GGA approximation of the density functional theory, an inaccurate energy bandgap of 2.13 eV is usually calculated. For accuracy, GGA+U formalism was employed. By fitting the bulk bandgap and the lattice constant, a value of 7 eV for U<sub>O</sub> has been identified, yielding a bandgap of 4.87 eV. The framework is used to calculate the spontaneous and piezoelectric polarization coefficients.</p>\n<p>c) Strain engineering is viewed as an effective way to tune the electronic properties and improve the performance of monolayer MoS<sub>2</sub>. With uniaxial strain, for both <em>E</em><sup>+</sup> and <em>E</em><sup>-</sup> Raman modes, ON current increases for up to ~3.5% of strain and then decreases for higher strain. In contrast, it is found that the application of <em>biaxial</em> tensile strain boosts the ON current by almost 15%.</p>\n<p>3) Regarding self-heating effect in high electron mobility transistors, it was evident that the temperature at the drain end of the gate is high when compared with other regions of the device. Structural relaxations can occur inside the device due to high lattice temperature. This leads to a reduction in the sheet charge density, which is the primary source of channel formation in these transistors. This, in turn, introduces a positive shift in the threshold voltage and results in a gradual decrease in the output current. In addition, heat causes defects and bandgap states in the gate insulator layer. When charges (electrons) are trapped within these states, they cause a further decrease in the drain current. For a nanoscale device, even a few trapped charges can reduce the drain current significantly.</p>\n<p>4) <em>Novel device design</em>:<em> AlGaN</em>/GaN High Electron Mobility Transistors (HEMTs) in the metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) architecture with high-<em>k</em> dielectrics (such as HfO<sub>2</sub> and HfZrO<sub>2</sub>) show promise in reducing gate leakage current. However, these devices are prone to pronounced self-heating effects as compared to conventional HEMTs that employ a silicon nitride (Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>) passivation layer. A proposed <em>asymmetric</em> MOS-HEMT structure exhibits superior thermal performance while maintaining a vanishing gate leakage current.</p>\n<p>5) AlGaN/GaN and InGaN/GaN material systems are excellent candidates for emerging quantum computing and communication systems. Yet for realistically structured devices, the intermedi?ate excitonic state is split by the carrier inter?actions and leads to an undesirable fine structure splitting (FSS). Through atomistic modeling, it is shown that any source of underlying atomistic/interfacial irregularities leads to a pronounced FSS and should be eliminated.</p>\n<p>6) <em>VBAC model</em>:<em> </em>Energy bandgap is highly sensitive to defects and defect energetics. A valence band anti-crossing (VBAC) model is developed to analyze the energy bandgap of III-V binary compound when it is lightly alloyed with anion materials. The overall computational model is based on a coupling of the Hamiltonian of the supercell using a fully-atomistic tight-binding basis set including spin orbital interaction and the Valence Force-Field (VFF) model for strain calculations.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/29/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Shaikh&nbsp;S&nbsp;Ahmed</p>\n</div>\n<div
