 "awd_abstract_narration": "Surface elevation is a first-order reflection of the geodynamic mechanisms that create and sustain large mountain belts and plateaux.  One family of models for surface uplift predicts uplift spatially and temporally associated with crustal thickening during mountain building processes.  In these models, surface uplift keeps pace with shortening of the crust.  Another family of models predicts that surface uplift is the result of removal of a dense subcrustal load accumulated during crustal shortening.  Uplift in these models significantly post-dates upper crustal shortening.  This project aims to test these end-member models in the best modern analog for an oceanic-continental subduction system: the Central Andean Plateau.  Successfully discriminating between these models has implications for the timing and pace of sedimentary basin formation in modern and ancient settings.  Because foreland basins host important hydrocarbon reserves, determining which model best describes their formation has potential implications for hydrocarbon exploration.  Surface elevation also impacts the global climate system and provides barriers to migration that promote the development of new biological species.  This project will promote full participation of women and minorities in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields by supporting at least one female graduate student and at least one minority undergraduate student.  The principal investigator and his graduate students will contribute to STEM education by supporting geoscience outreach to local middle school and homeschool students and by supporting the TerraElm middleschool outreach program.  Funds from this project will support the education of the next generation in a globally competitive STEM workforce through undergraduate and graduate training.  Finally, it will support international collaborations between US and Peruvian scientists.     \r\n\r\nThis project will investigate the timing and mechanism of surface uplift of high elevation terranes in the archetypal ocean-continent subduction setting of the southern Peruvian Central Andean Plateau. Outstanding questions have prevented a systematic identification of the mechanism of basin formation and its relation to exhumation and surface uplift in the Peruvian Central Andean Plateau. Insufficient chronological data prevents a detailed reconstruction of the timing and tempo of sediment accumulation in the Peruvian Central Andean Plateau.  In this study, the principal investigator will develop a detailed chronology of deposition based on multiple intercalated volcanic strata in Neogene deposits and syndepositional volcanic zircons in Paleogene strata. A regional reconstruction of sediment provenance, dispersal systems, and basin geometry through time awaits application of multiple independent techniques will also be produced. The principal investigator will use detrital geochronology coupled with sandstone petrology, conglomerate clast composition, and paleocurrent data to track sediment sources through time. Detrital (Uranium-Thorium)/Helium thermochronology will be used in combination with detrital Uranium-Lead geochronology to track the locus of exhumation through time. Changes in depositional environments and climate are predicted to accompany surface uplift, and this will be demonstrated by documenting changes in depositional environment and climate using a combination of hydrogen and oxygen stable isotopic compositions with paleotemperatures derived from carbonate clumped isotope paleothermometry and by observations of changing sedimentary lithofacies associations. The project will also employ a novel paleoelevation proxy: delta-D values of the waters of hydration of volcanic glass to aid in reconstructing the paleoelevation of the Peruvian Central Andean Plateau.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Andes is the longest mountain chain on continental crust and is formed by the ongoing eastward subduction of the oceanic Farallon plate beneath the western margin of the South American plate.  However, despite this uniform tectonic setting, there is remarkable variability along the north-south length of the Andes.  This variability is most notable in the central Andes, where the mountain belt becomes extremely wide and tall.  The objective of this project was to define how and when the Andes rose to their current elevation by reconstructing the depositional environments, and sediment sources through time. We used zircon U-PB geochronology to determine when sediments were deposited. Finally, we used deuterium isotopes to reconstruct elevation through time. \n\n \n\nExamining sedimentary deposits near Cusco (13.6&deg;S, 71.8&deg;E), we found that sediment was derived from the west throughout the period from 58&ndash;9 million years ago. Sediment sources, rates of sediment accumulation, and depositional environments are consistent with deposition in a retroarc foreland basin.  However, comparison to sites further to the south suggests that there is significant north-south variability in the timing and rate of basin formation as well as potentially tectonic subsidence mechanism.\n\n \n\nIn order to determine the timing and rate of surface uplift, we collected volcanic samples from across the southern Peruvian plateau for deuterium isotopic analysis.  Felsic volcanic glass has &lt;0.5 weight % water when it is erupted.  However, it hydrates rapidly in the presence of environmental water up to 2&ndash;10 weight % water.  Upon hydration, the glass shards develop a dense amorphous rind which inhibits further isotopic exchange, and locks in the isotopic composition at the time of eruption.  The isotopic composition of environmental water is determined by the composition of precipitation, which is in turn largely dependent on elevation.  As water-bearing air masses are lifted to high elevations as a result of interaction with topography, they preferentially lose the heavy isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen as precipitation.  As a result, precipitation and environmental water has a measurable and quantifiable change in isotopic composition with changing elevation.  Using the record of surface water recorded in ancient volcanic glass, we determined that the Western Cordillera was rapidly elevated from ~ 2 km elevation to &gt;4.5 km elevation between 20 and 17 million years ago.  In contrast the Altiplano was similarly rapidly uplifted between 15 and 10 million years ago.  Finally the Eastern Cordillera rose slowly from 2 km to ~4.5 km elevation over a long period from 25 to 10 million years ago. \n\n \n\nWe also developed three software packages for comparing, visualizing, and analyzing detrital geochronology data sets: DZmix, DZnmf, and Density2D.  These software packages are available as free stand-alone executables for MAC and Windows.  We have also made the source code publically available.  \n\n \n\nThe project has supported three graduate students, three undergraduate students, and research facilities at the University of Houston and University of Texas at Austin.  The project supported training and research experience for three Peruvian undergraduate students.  It also initiated a collaboration between two US professors and a Peruvian professor.  Finally, the project supported annual three-day field trips for middle school students to central Texas focused on the geological evolution of Texas. Students were involved in a number of hands on learning experiences including the geological timescale, mineral identification, stratigraphic principles, and astronomy.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/08/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Joel E Saylor"
