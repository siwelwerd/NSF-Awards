 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will acquire measurements of the concentration of beryllium-10 (10Be) from an ice core from the South Pole, Antarctica.  An isotope of the element beryllium, 10Be, is produced in the atmosphere by high-energy protons (cosmic rays) that enter Earth's atmosphere from space.  It is removed from the atmosphere by settling or by scavenging by rain or snowfall.  Hence, concentrations of 10Be in snow at the South Pole reflect the production rate of 10Be in the atmosphere.  Because the rate of production of 10Be over Antarctica depends primarily on the strength of the Sun's magnetic field, measurements of 10Be in the South Pole ice core will provide a record of changes in solar activity.  The South Pole ice core will reach an age of 40,000 years at the bottom.  The project will result in measurements of 10Be at annual resolution for the last 100 years and selected periods in the more distant past, such as the Maunder Minimum, a period during the late 17th century during which no sunspots were observed, or the last glacial cold period, about 20,000 years ago.  A climate model that can simulate the production of 10Be in the atmosphere, it's transport through the atmosphere, and its deposition at the snow surface in Antarctica will be used to aid in using the 10Be data to determine past changes in solar activity from decadal to millennial scale, and in turn to evaluate the role of the Sun in Earth?s climate from a new perspective.\r\n\r\nThe production of 10Be in Earth's atmosphere results from the spallation of oxygen and nitrogen in the atmosphere by cosmic rays.  Cosmic ray variations in the high latitudes are primarily modulated by solar variability. Time-series records of 10Be from ice cores are therefore important for deriving variations in solar activity through time, which is fundamental to understanding climate variability. Deposition of 10Be to the ice surface is also influenced by variability in atmospheric circulation and deposition processes, and South Pole is the best available location for minimizing the influence of variable atmospheric circulation on 10Be deposition. To date, only one record of 10Be exists from South Pole; that record is widely used in solar forcing estimates used in climate models, but covers only the last millennium and ends in CE 1982.  We will obtain 10Be concentration measurements in a 1500-m, 40000-year long ice core from the South Pole.  This will extend the existing record both further back in time and forward to the present, providing overlap with the modern instrumental record of solar and climate variability. High resolution (annual to biannual) measurements will be made in targeted areas of interest, including the last 100 years, the Maunder Minimum (CE 1650-1715), and the last glacial maximum. The novel data will be used in conjunction with climate model experiments that incorporate 10Be production, transport, and deposition physics. Together, data and modeling will create an updated record of atmospheric 10Be production and hence of solar activity.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual merit\n\nThis collaborative project involved the measurement of beryllium-10 concentrations in an ice core from the South Pole, led by researchers at the University of Columbia, and the modeling of  beryllium-10 production in the earth\u2019s atmospheric, led by the University of Washington and University of California&mdash;Santa Barbara. Beryllium-10 (10Be) is a rare isotope of the common metal, beryllium.  It is produced in the atmosphere by cosmic rays &ndash; high-energy particles from outside our solar system &ndash; by spallation of oxygen and nitrogen.  The production rate of 10Be in the polar regions depends primarily on the strength of the solar magnetic field, which is closely related to the heat output (irradiance) of the sun.  As a consequence, the production of 10Be, as well as its fallout onto the snow surface in Antarctica, depends on variations in the solar output.  The solar output also influences climate.  Therefore, 10Be variations in an ice core provide information about variations in solar influence of climate through time.  This project produced a 2000-year long record of 10Be concentrations in the South Pole ice core.  The modeling working shows that South Pole is uniquely situated to record the production rate of 10Be, with little influence from climate variability.  The results is a new, highly accurate, high-resolution record of solar variability through the last two millennia. \n\nBroader impacts\n\nThe results of this research will be of use to solar physicists, climate modelers, and others interested in the influence of the sun on climate.
