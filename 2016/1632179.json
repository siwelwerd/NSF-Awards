The main goal of the University of North Carolina Greensboro (UNCG) Regional Mathematics and Statistics Conference is to provide a venue for students at all levels to share and experience research in the field of mathematics and statistics. The opportunity for personal interaction among students and, between students and faculty is a hallmark of our conference. These interactions enhance the research infrastructure and are essential for the success of student research and for training a new generation of mathematicians and statisticians. Moreover, due to the funding of NSF the principal investigators will be able to focus support on those currently underrepresented in mathematical research. Students from underrepresented groups accounted for about half of the supported participants in prior years.  \r\n\r\nThis conference started as an annual undergraduate student conference in 2005 and has now expanded to include graduate researchers since 2009. The research sessions concentrate on topics in statistics, mathematical biology, graph theory, and computational biology but are open to other topics as well. The conference will entail a faculty development workshop to provide training for faculty to increase their effectiveness at mentoring undergraduate researchers. The conference has established a tradition of attracting active student researchers and their faculty mentors from North Carolina and Virginia. The NSF support will allow the conference to attract participants from the entire Southeastern Atlantic region. The conference website is: http://www.uncg.edu/mat/rmsc/.",
