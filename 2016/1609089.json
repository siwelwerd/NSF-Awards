 "awd_abstract_narration": "To \"Provide Access to Clean Water\" is one of the 14 Grand Challenges identified by the National Academy of Engineering. A recent United Nations report projects that virtually every nation will face a water supply problem within the next 20 years. A key component to any solution to address water-related challenges is to educate our youth about the interdisciplinary aspects of water research to make them aware of water-related issues; and to train them as future professionals who will develop appropriate solutions to meet these challenges. This Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) in Engineering and Computer Science Site, entitled Water ECubeG (Engineering, Ecology, Environment, Geosciences) at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (VT) is targeted at developing a model 6-week professional development program to engage grades 9-12 STEM teachers and community college faculty in Southwest Virginia in interdisciplinary water research. Successful implementation of this RET Site will result in the development of innovative learning modules that will motivate students in grades 9-12 and community colleges to pursue the breadth of water related STEM careers. The proposed region for teacher recruitment will enable many teachers to educate a diverse group of students throughout Southwest Virginia serving high-need rural and urban student populations. The Site's focus on interdisciplinary water research will enable early exposure of future scientists and engineers to critical issues for solving complex water problems such as pollution in the Chesapeake Bay. The goal of this Site is consistent with the priorities identified by the Virginia Governor's office and upon successful completion this Site will serve as an excellent model for teacher and student training in interdisciplinary water research elsewhere. \r\n\r\nOver a three-year period this RET Site will offer an intensive summer interdisciplinary water research experience to a total of 30 STEM precollege teachers and community college faculty. The specific objectives are to: (1) Develop and implement a 6-week research experience program for RET Site participants involving hands-on learning experiences in engineering, ecology, environment, and geosciences, (2) Develop and implement a professional development program for teachers, (3) Guide RET Site participants in developing and implementing STEM-based interdisciplinary water research learning modules for their curricula, and (4) Establish a community of teachers mentored in interdisciplinary water research for support, collaboration, and dissemination of Site activities to a larger group of teachers. Annual workshops will be held by RET alumni to educate and motivate additional 9-12 STEM teachers and community college faculty. RET participants will present their work at K-12 and Community College conferences. The project outcomes will be published through the TeachEngineering digital library.",
