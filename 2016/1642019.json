 "awd_abstract_narration": "A goal of the Tribal Colleges and Universities Program (TCUP) is to increase the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) instructional and research capacities of specific institutions of higher education that serve the Nation's indigenous students. The PEEC-II track provides support for studies or educational research conducted by institutions that have had earlier Pre-Engineering Education Collaborative (PEEC) awards. The intent of PEEC-II is to capture, analyze, and disseminate the impact of these awards on the participating institutions, faculty, or students, and their communities. PEEC and PEEC-II are partnerships between TCUP and the Directorate for Engineering.\r\n\r\nThe College of Menominee Nation (CMN) and the University of Wisconsin Madison (UWM) will build on the results of infrastructure and partnership development funded in their initial PEEC award to strengthen the pathways for students working to earn a bachelor's degree in engineering.  They will address the intriguing question of what factors affect American Indian student educational both decisions to start and motivation to complete a degree in engineering.  The project has three aims that include 1) addressing environmental support for Native students at UWM, 2) building student self-efficacy in areas relevant to engineering degree completion, and 3) improving understanding of how Native American student values influence educational and career development decisions.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit within the collaborative proposal is the investigation of evidence-based interventions for both students (e.g., self-efficacy development, skills training) and institutions (e.g., bias training for faculty).  The project will also investigate the impact of student values on career development decisions, something that could change national models of how these decisions are supported and understood.  This is on top of the development of the capacity to support American Indian students seeking and earning bachelor's degrees in engineering. The broader impact of the project is the potential increase in the number of American Indian students earning engineering degrees, increased awareness of STEM (particularly engineering) careers amongst American Indian K-12 students through outreach activities, and the clear potential impact of this model of student/institution interventions and how they may affect understanding of Native American decision making related to STEM careers.",

Additional goals were (1) to create training modules that would increase knowledge, awareness and skills relating to implicit bias among faculty and staff who teach and interact with indigenous students, (2) to research the individual, family and community values that might encourage or discourage indigenous students from studying engineering.</p>\n<p>The project achieved outcomes related to the broader impact of increasing indigenous students studying engineering, addressing implicit bias in faculty and staff, and researching indigenous values related to studying engineering.</p>\n<p>To support the student-focused climate at CMN and increase awareness of stereotypes and bias that can influence relationships with students, a four-module Breaking the Bias Habit? (BBH) workshop was developed in collaboration with faculty and staff members from CMN in 2017/18.&nbsp; An indigenous graduate student at UW-Madison was hired and trained in doing literature reviews to support the development of the workshop. In August 2018, the BBH? workshop was delivered to 18 faculty members at CMN.&nbsp; Post workshop evaluations (83% response rate) found 86% of the faculty participants found the workshop ?very valuable,? with the rest finding it ?somewhat valuable.?&nbsp; The CMN staff participated in the workshop in May of 2019. Post workshop evaluations showed that 100% of the evaluation respondents (evaluation response rate was 77%) found the workshop to be ?very valuable?. &nbsp;Pre- and post-workshop knowledge and skill evaluations indicated significant changes in faculty and staff knowledge of microaggressions, stereotype threat, stereotype priming, competency bias and expectancy bias.&nbsp; Evaluation also indicated that participants learned strategies for combating bias and microaggressions.</p>\n<p>Our second goal was achieved through qualitative research into the individual, family and community/tribal values that might relate to indigenous students studying engineering. Our research study team consisted of two indigenous graduate program/research assistants, and an indigenous staff member. The research study team was trained in qualitative research, and relevant vocational psychology theory/concepts on educational and work values. The study team developed a participant interview protocol to investigate these questions. Thus, an unanticipated outcome of this project was the training of three indigenous graduate students and one indigenous staff member in research processes including giving a research presentation at a national conference.</p>\n<p>Study participants were recruited (18 indigenous and 16 non-indigenous engineering students) from 18 higher education institutions in 15 U.S. states. Study team members interviewed participants, transcribed interviews, and performed qualitative data analysis. 18 indigenous transcriptions were analyzed for qualitative themes related to the decision to study engineering and how that decision related to individual, family and tribal/community values. Emergent themes included: family influence, encouragement &amp; discouragement, traditional native values around sustainability and land, and future employment values. The main finding of this research is that indigenous engineering students we met with are motivated to study engineers by values of earth sustainability (land, water, and stewardship), responsibilities to their tribe, family &amp; community, and the importance of maintaining and utilizing indigenous knowledge to solve important problems.
