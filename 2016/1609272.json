 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-Technical Abstract\r\nIntercalation reactions lie at the heart of the operation mechanism of lithium-ion battery, which remains the most used energy storage device for portable electronics and electric cars. Intercalation is usually a reversible process that involves the introduction of a guest species into a host electrode material. The realization that lithium is a limited resource, which potentially can result in a significant increase in the cost of lithium-ion batteries, has shifted research directions towards investigation of alternate intercalation systems, such as sodium-ion batteries. However the larger size and higher weight limits intercalation and diffusion of sodium ions through common electrode materials, compared to lithium ion. This results in significant electrode degradation (thereby resulting in capacity loss after the first cycle and reduced cycle life) and limitations in operation at high current rates. With support from the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program of the Division of Materials Research, this project focuses on addressing these shortcomings through chemical pre-intercalation of the specific types and amounts of inorganic ions. The proposed work has the potential to enable the development of sodium-ion battery cathodes that can be used to replace current lithium-ion batteries, providing sustainable energy storage that is cheaper, reliable, and environmentally friendly, contributing to the development of next-generation energy storage systems for transportation, grid-storage and other renewable energy applications. The project offers an excellent opportunity to engage senior undergraduate and graduate students in masters and doctoral-level research in the field of Materials Science and Engineering and its broader impact on Materials Chemistry and Electrochemistry. The principal investigator plans to integrate the results of this research in the course on materials for energy storage applications. This project enhances the dissemination of knowledge to a broad research community and general public through presentations at National/International conferences, refereed journal publications and demonstrations at science events.\r\n\r\nTechnical Abstract\r\nChemical pre-intercalation is a wet chemistry approach, in which the inorganic ions are inserted into the crystal structure of the electrode material in a solution followed by the formation of a gel and/or sol, or another form of a precipitate, with inorganic ions being 'trapped' in the structure of a solid material. The goal of this proposed research is to test the hypothesis that high capacity, long cycle life and high power can be achieved in Na-ion battery electrodes by introducing specific types and amounts of chemically pre-intercalated ions, which enables materials with high specific capacity, enhanced structural stability and fast ionic diffusion. Vanadium oxide, a material with rich crystal chemistry, structural flexibility and morphological architectures, is chosen as a host structure for chemical pre-intercalation. The project seeks a systematic understanding of synthesis - structure - performance relationships for chemically pre-intercalated vanadium oxide electrodes in Na-ion batteries. Electrochemical properties of the synthesized materials are evaluated by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic discharge/charge cycling, rate capability experiments and impedance spectroscopy measurements. The research team plans to determine how changes in the synthesis parameters affect electrochemical performance with the aim to understand fundamental phenomena related to materials chemistry and structure that may lead to larger amount of the stored charge, faster ion and electron transport, and excellent stability during reversible cycling of sodium ions.",

Development of the chemical preintercalation synthesis approach for the synthesis of novel materials with redox activity in intercalation reactions and potential application as electrodes in batteries. The method is based on the low-temperature sol-gel process. Bilayered vanadium oxides (BVOs) have been used as a model material system to demonstrate the versatility of the approach. In this process, vanadium precursor is dissolved in aqueous media using hydrogen peroxide. Through the sequence of hydroxylation and condensation reactions, BVO layers grow and assemble into a structure with lamellar ordering from the solution. Addition of chemically preintercalating species, such as inorganic or organic ions into reaction mixture during solution stage lead to these species being trapped between the growing layers of oxide, producing a wide family of new chemically preintercalated layered materials. In addition, the precipitate obtained through the sol-gel step can be further treated using aging, hydrothermal treatment and/or low-temperature annealing processes, giving another level of control of the chemical composition and structure of the synthesized materials. By altering the nature of the chemically preintercalated species, interlayer spacing of the synthesized materials was varied between 9.62 and 30.5 ?. Because the layered framework of the oxide phase does not substantially change depending on the nature of the species inserted between the layers, and only interlayer spacing and chemical composition of the interlayer region are affected, this synthesis method was called chemical pre-intercalation synthesis approach. This name indicates that expansion/contraction of the layers, typical for layered phases in intercalation reactions, occurs chemically and during material formation, rather than through post-synthesis interlayer exchange process or electrochemical ion cycling.</p>\n<p>2. Demonstration that chemical preintercalation of electrochemically cycling ions can lead to improved electrochemical performance, which was done using K-preintercalated BVO in K-ion cells. &delta;-K<sub>0.42</sub>V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>?0.25H<sub>2</sub>O with the interlayer spacing of 9.65 ? exhibited high initial discharge capacity of 268 mAh?g<sup>&minus;1</sup> at a current rate of C/50 and 226 mAh?g<sup>&minus;1</sup> at a current rate of C/15. K-preintercalated BVO showed capacity retention of 74% after 50 cycles at a constant current of C/15 and 58% capacity retention when the current rate was increased from C/15 to 1C. Analysis of the mechanism of charge storage revealed that diffusion-controlled intercalation dominates over non-faradaic capacitive contribution. High electrochemical performance of &delta;-K<sub>0.42</sub>V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>?0.25H<sub>2</sub>O is attributed to the facilitated diffusion of electrochemically cycled K<sup>+</sup> ions through well-defined intercalation sites, formed by chemically preintercalated K<sup>+</sup> ions</p>\n<p>3. Demonstration of the pillaring (stabilization) effect by cycling bilayered &delta;-M<sub>x</sub>V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>?nH<sub>2</sub>O (M = Li, Na, K, Mg, Ca) electrodes in Li-ion cells. Our analyses indicated that cyclability and rate performance of the chemically preintercalated BVOs improve with increasing interlayer spacing. The highest initial capacity (198 mAh g<sup>&minus;1</sup>), greatest capacity retention (81.8% after 50 cycles at 20 mA g<sup>&minus;1</sup>), and highest capacity retention at higher current rates (74.5% when current rate was changed from C/15 to 1 C) were exhibited by Mg-preintercalated &delta;-V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> with the largest interlayer spacing (13.40 ?). This research demonstrates the efficacy of a facile chemical pre-intercalation strategy to synthesize ion-stabilized layered electrode materials with improved electrochemical stability.</p>\n<p>4. Demonstration that low-temperature annealing (260 ?C under vacuum) can be used to achieve enhanced electrochemical stability of high-capacity Na-preintercalated bilayered vanadium oxide (&delta;-Na<sub>x</sub>V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>?nH<sub>2</sub>O) nanobelts, while preserving its open layered structure with expanded interlayer region available for insertion and diffusion of a large number of electrochemically cycled Na<sub>+</sub> ions. Intriguingly, we showed that using low-temperature vacuum annealing the interlayer water content can be varied in the 0.5 &le; n &le; 1.20 range without a significant change in the interlayer spacing. The improved capacity retention is attributed to the partial removal of the structural water from the interlayer region, formation of additional bonds within the V&minus;O bilayers, and increased stacking order of V&minus;O bilayers. Low-temperature vacuum annealing is proposed as an efficient strategy to control interlayer water and advance electrochemical stability of the growing family of hydrated transition metal compounds used as electrodes in intercalation batteries.</p>\n<p>5.
