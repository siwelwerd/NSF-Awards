 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project funded by the Chemical Theory, Models, and Computational Methods program, Professor Benjamin G. Levine of Michigan State University is developing new computational methods to model non-radiative recombination in semiconductor nanomaterials.  Non-radiative recombination is a fundamental process that converts electronic energy to heat, thus limiting the efficiencies of devices for solar energy conversion, light emission, and other applications.  The methods being developed provide an atom-by-atom, electron-by-electron mechanistic picture of this process, thus informing the design of future materials.  Specifically, the Levine group is applying these new theoretical models to elucidate the dynamics of electronically excited silicon nanoparticles, which show promise as light emitters for solid state displays, biological imaging, and solid state lasers. The Levine group is also working with local high school teachers to develop the High School Computational Chemistry Server (HiSoCCS), which freely serves research-grade computational chemistry capability via a user-friendly web-based interface.  HiSoCCS and associated curricular materials are made available for free to Michigan high schools.  \r\n\r\nThe Levine group's approach is based on the hypothesis that conical intersections, points of degeneracy between electronic states, are introduced by defects in the material, and that these intersections provide efficient pathways for non-radiative recombination.  A new fully quantum mechanical method for modeling dynamics near conical intersections, the diabatized Gaussians on adiabatic surfaces (DGAS) approximation, is being developed.  The DGAS wave function ansatz is designed to handle singularities in the first- and second-derivative nonadiabatic couplings that occur at conical intersections.  The DGAS method is being implemented for high performance parallel computers, and the resulting software will be made freely available to other scientists.  The broader impacts of this work include: a) the development of a new nonadiabatic molecular dynamics method capable of accurately modeling a wide range non-radiative processes, b) new open source software for modeling dynamics near conical intersections, c) a deeper understanding of non-radiative recombination in silicon nanomaterials, and d) new tools and materials that incorporate research grade calculations into the high school science curriculum.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe following outcomes arise from this work:\n1)  The Levine group at Michigan State University developed new methods for computer simulations of the coupled electronic/vibrational motion of molecules and nanomaterials.  These new methods enable more accurate calculations with a smaller investment of computational resources than previously possible.  These methods include: a) mathematical formalisms that eliminate complications arising from divergent terms in the equations that must be solved to model these phenomena; b) numerical schemes that avoid the same complications; c) and software that utilize graphics processing units (computer hardware designed for graphical applications such as video games) to perform quantum mechanical calculations with greater accuracy and speed.\n2)  The Levine group applied the developed methods to understand the nonradiative relaxation processes that limit the efficiencies of molecules and semiconductor nanomaterials for application in solar energy conversion and light emission.  Specifically, it has been found that conical intersections can be associated with specific defects and other local structures in larger materials.  Conical intersections facilitate the fast and efficient conversion of energy from electronic to vibrational motions.  In this way, they can limit the efficiencies of energy conversion processes in applications requiring long-lived electronic excitations.\n3)  The Levine group developed the PySpawn software package (https://github.com/blevine37/pySpawn17), a free and open-source tool for modeling the coupled electronic/vibrational motion of molecules and nanomaterials.
