 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many real-world problems can be modeled by geometric graphs: systems\r\nof vertices that represent geometric objects and edges that represent\r\nconnections or interactions between pairs of these objects. For\r\ninstance, the vertices of a road network may represent intersections\r\nor junctions of roads, while the edges represent the segments of road\r\nbetween two consecutive intersections. Although these graphs are not\r\nplanar (a road can cross a bridge without intersecting the road beneath), such crossings are\r\nuncommon, and the project will investigate ways of exploiting that\r\nsparse crossing structure to efficiently solve problems such as route\r\nplanning on road networks. Similarly, the project will investigate the\r\nstructure of the underlying geometric graphs, and the use of that\r\nstructure to develop efficient algorithms, for other problems that\r\ninclude the visualization of hierarchically clustered networks,\r\npattern mining in social networks, splitting large scientific\r\nsimulations into smaller subproblems with low amounts of interaction\r\nbetween the subproblems, the analysis of mechanical systems of rigid\r\nparts connected by hinges, the design of maps that distort geographic\r\nareas to display other types of quantitative information, and the\r\nvisualization of overlaps between fragments of DNA sequences.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe project proposes attacks on a large collection of problems from\r\napplication areas where sparse geometric graphs naturally arise. The\r\nproject suggests a model for real-world road networks in which a\r\nderived graph of edges and their crossings has bounded degeneracy, and\r\nseeks to investigate how sparsity properties of this crossing graph\r\naffect the underlying road graph. The project seeks to determine\r\nwhether it is hard to recognize the graphs of 4-polytopes and simple\r\n4-polytopes, and whether a recognition algorithm of the investigator\r\nfor a special class of 4-polytopes can be extended to a realization\r\nalgorithm. The graphs in this class have small separators, and the\r\nproject seeks to determine whether this is true more generally for\r\ncertain graphs derived from planar clustered graph drawings. The\r\nproject seeks efficient data structures that maintain low-degeneracy\r\norientations of a dynamic graph and use these orientations to quickly\r\nfind features in the graph, needed when fitting social networks to\r\nexponential random graph models. Finite element meshes with bounded\r\naspect ratio for each element have small separators, but arbitrary\r\ntetrahedral meshes do not. The project seeks intermediate conditions\r\non the shape of the elements in a mesh that would ensure the existence\r\nof small separators. The graphs arising in kinematic analysis can be\r\ncharacterized by linear bounds on the edges in each subgraph, and\r\nrecognized in quadratic time by a pebbling algorithm. The project\r\nseeks more efficient algorithms to test the rigidity or degrees of\r\nfreedom of mechanical structures in subquadratic time. Subdivisions of\r\nrectangles into smaller rectangles have applications in architectural\r\ndesign, cartographic information visualization, and VLSI design. An\r\narea-universal subdivision is one that can fit any assignment of areas\r\nto its rectangles. The project seeks efficient algorithms to construct\r\narea-universal subdivisions as well as subdivisions produced by a\r\nrecursive splitting process. Unit interval graphs arise in modeling\r\nhuman preferences and in DNA physical mapping. Some problems that are\r\nhard on broader graph classes can be solved efficiently on unit\r\ninterval graphs by representing the graph using a binary sequence and\r\napplying a finite automaton to the sequence. The project seeks a more\r\ngeneral explanation of this phenomenon. In graph drawing, styles of\r\ngraph drawing on the basis that are somewhere-dense allow all graphs\r\nto be drawn in that style with constant bends per edge while nowhere\r\ndense styles require an unbounded number of bends per edge. The\r\nproject seeks a theory of sparsity distinguishing nowhere-dense styles\r\nthat require many bends per edge from those that require few\r\nbends. Additional components of the project include questions on\r\ndiameter graphs and book thickness.",
