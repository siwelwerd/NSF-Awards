This topic is linked to profound open problems in condensed matter and statistical physics. Recent technical advances in both experimental and theoretical techniques have led to a spate of exciting developments in this area. The topics covered will include nonequilibrium transitions; dynamics during and after a \"quench\"; thermalization and the approach to steady state; and dynamics in the presence of a driving potential. This workshop, whose results will appear in a formal report, will capture the excitement and promise of this rapidly growing field of research.",

The topic of the workshop was \"Interacting Quantum Systems Out of Equilibrium\".  This is a frontier topic in physics today, and the stakes are high, as the competition between different ordered states can lead to dramatic effects (high temperature superconductivity, unusual magnetism, phase transitions between different quantum states) of fundamental and potential technological interest.   The workshop took place over two days in Houston, Texas, incorporating 30 minute invited speaker talks (13 the first day, 6 the second) and an extended poster and discussion session the second day. \n\nThe intellectual merit of the workshop was in the discussions and scientific cross-fertilzation that resulted from bringing together of both experimental and theoretical experts in this exciting open topic.  Nonequilibrium quantum systems are linked to profound open problems in condensed matter and statistical physics.  Recent technical advances in both experimental and theoretical techniques have led to a spate of exciting developments in this area.  The fifteen invited speakers included experts in electronic measurements, ultracold atomic gases, and ultrafast optical response of materials.
