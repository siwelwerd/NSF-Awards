 "awd_abstract_narration": "Residential networks lack empirical information about service outages and reliability. The absence of clear information, coupled with the relative inexperience of ordinary users combines to hide the sources of connectivity and performance problems.  The goal of this proposal is to provide external measurement of outages in residential Internet connections, empirically determining the reliability of different providers and technologies, and recording outage information suitable for diagnosis.  Although some projects instrument home networks from within the home, this work looks from the outside, searching for rare events across many more networks and countries for comparisons. This work addresses two key challenges in measuring network reliability from the outside.  The first important problem is to determine whether address changes are actually the cause for a network device becoming unreachable to external measurement. The second key problem is in separating individual failures from other failures.  For example, with an approaching storm, many users may disable their equipment to avoid lightning damage, but with a passing storm, an outage may affect many users at once.    Engineering the measurement infrastructure to adapt to these events and identify simultaneous outages will permit classifying outages.\r\n\r\nReliable networks are particularly important as users transition away from dedicated landlines toward voice-over-IP, while still needing the ability to make emergency calls, particularly during events that challenge networks such as earthquakes and severe weather.  Predicting reliability permits informed decision-making about migrating to new network technologies--concretely, whether removing conventional wired lines is safe.\r\nDatasets from this research will be public and we will maintain a website that presents Internet outage data in a manner that is accessible by the general public.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n \nFor increasingly many people throughout the world, their ability to respond to emergency situations and to run even some of the most basic aspects of their home is directly dependent on the reliability of their Internet connections.  With the proliferation of smart homes, the Internet of Things, and digital biomedical devices, every individual's connection to the Internet must be considered ?critical infrastructure?.  Downtime of minutes or hours, particularly in the event of an emergency, brings with it an increasing risk to people's livelihood and security.  Unfortunately, neither researchers nor practitioners had the means by which to empirically reason about the reliability of individual users? Internet connectivity, particularly when it came to residential networks.  As a result, even basic questions like ?does rain make it more likely for a DSL user to experience an Internet outage?? could not be answered with certainty.\nThe goals of this project were to reduce the uncertainty in residential Internet service reliability by developing new techniques for measuring and analyzing residential links in a scalable and statistically sound manner.\nFor collecting measurements, this project saw the completion of a nine-year-long adaptive study of residential links throughout the United States.  We used active pings from multiple vantage points to detect outages during times of forecast severe weather in the U.S., as reported by the U.S. National Weather Service.  Collectively, this dataset comprised 101 billion responsive pings to 10.8 million IP addresses?a dataset uniquely characterized by its geographic breadth, longitudinality, and adaptiveness.\nAnalyzing network outage datasets such as ours has proven technically challenging: although network outages occur frequently, the probability that any given link experiences an outage is very low.  As a result, small sources of error?such as an ISP changing a home?s IP address, or a packet being delayed a few seconds?can result in small but significant changes in conclusions about network outages.\nThis grant funded the development of new techniques to control for potential sources of measurement error, such as IP address changes, packet timeouts, correlated failures, and the variability of outages across geographic locations, link types, and Internet providers.\nApplying these myriad analysis techniques to our nine-year-long dataset allowed us to make statistically significant and surprising observations about weather?s effect on residential links.  For instance, we found that Midwestern U.S. states are more prone to failures in thunderstorms and rain than coastal states, and southern states are more prone to failures in snow.  Perhaps even more importantly, this project has allowed us to empower other researchers and practitioners to reason about network outages?and weather?s effect?in a more robust, statistically sound, and certain manner than ever before possible.  To this end, we make our code and (anonymized) data from this project publicly available.\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/18/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: David M Levin"
