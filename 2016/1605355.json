 "awd_abstract_narration": "1605355\r\nDietrich\r\n\r\nThis proposed project fills a critical knowledge gap concerning human exposure, at the air-water-human interface, to contaminants from aerosols emitted by ultrasonic humidifiers. Typically, consumers purchase ultrasonic humidifiers, fill them with drinking water, and use them in confined spaces such as bedrooms for several hours per day. The resulting inhalation exposure information, from ultrasonic humidifiers, will allow scientists to reasonably assess the human health risks associated with dissolved contaminants in drinking water and subsequently offer recommendations for consumer use.\r\n\r\nThe fundamental characterization of ultrasonic humidifier aerosol composition, fate and transport under realistic living conditions, and propensity for infant, child, and adult inhalation exposure and resulting inhaled dose, will be the first of its kind for assessing this aspect of the air-water-human interface. The description of the relationships between aerosol size - contaminant concentration and aerosol deposition patterns on room surfaces will provide new data and perspective for the health effects of aerosols. This project has implications for human health because of the uncertainty surrounding inhalation exposures from aerosolized drinking water. The experimental research has four objectives and the reseach is guided by four hypotheses: 1) To use particle size and cascade impactor instruments, in conjunction with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, to comprehensively characterize humidifier aerosols in size, distribution, and inorganic chemical composition for varying water qualities representative of realistic drinking waters. Hypothesis 1: Inorganic contaminant concentrations are the same in all aerosol particle sizes for a given water quality. 2) To examine aerosol deposition on surfaces is determined as a function of distance from a humidifier which is situated in realistic indoor living scenario. Sampling locations are both within and outside the humidifier plume. Hypothesis 2: Inorganic contaminant concentrations will be deposited at similar aerial concentrations in all locations of the room. 3) The experimental data are inputs to calibrate and validate the USEPA RISK Indoor Air Quality model for its first application to room-sized ultrasonic humidifiers. Hypothesis 3: The USEPA RISK model can be calibrated to meet ASTM air modeling guidelines (1991) using the experimental data from this study. 4) The data obtained will use the USEPA RISK model to assess the human inhalation exposure to aerosolized contaminants for many realistic exposure scenarios involving infants, children, and adults. Hypothesis 4: The indoor air model confirms that human inhalation exposure to inorganic contaminants in ultrasonic humidifier aerosols exceed health guidelines. The model results will be evaluated with respect to inhalation exposure regulations, existing dose data, and geographically varying water quality. The PI and co-PIs are committed to developing the professional, ethical, outreach, and research preparation of students on this project. The PhD and undergraduate students will be actively recruited from underrepresented groups, as has been done for many years by the faculty involved in this project. This project will recruit underrepresented students and provide them educational, research, and professional experiences, including mentoring grade 6-12 students. The student researchers will communicate their results throughout the globe through blogs at the Water INTERface website (https://blogs.lt.vt.edu/water/), maintained by the Virginia Tech Graduate School for faculty and students in water research and though publication of scientific articles.",

Environmental and health effects of consumer products are an emerging topic of concern. Ultrasonic humidifiers rapidly vibrate water to create fine aerosols that contain minerals and particles present in the fill water, thus creating aerosolized indoor air pollution. The water evaporates swiftly, leaving fine respirable particles that can penetrate deep into the human lung. Natural occurring minerals present in tap water include those essential for health such as calcium, magnesium, and bicarbonate. The combined aggregate of dissolved minerals is measured as total dissolved solids (TDS). TDS can create particle matter pollution that exceeds USEPA ambient air standards or that is equivalent to or worse than polluted industrial or urban air. The excessive concentrations of indoor air particle matter occurs even when the tap water meets all USEPA Drinking Water Standards. This is because while ingesting minerals like calcium and bicarbonate are good for human health, inhaling these same minerals as particles is unhealthy for the respiratory system.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The health burdens are greater for children than adults due to the greater breathing rates of children and their lower body mass. And since children are reported to be more likely to have a humidifier used in their room, children have longer exposure times. The size/volume of the room and the ventilation rate (air exchange rate - AER) affect the indoor air particle concentration. Smaller, less ventilated rooms, such as those that are energy efficient, will have greater particle concentrations than larger, well ventilated rooms for the same ultrasonic humidifier and output rate.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In addition to typical minerals of calcium, magnesium, and bicarbonate, tap waters can contain trace minerals that adversely affect human health, such as lead (Pb) and manganese (Mn). Our research demonstrates that for most situations, Pb presents a greater risk when ingested daily in tap water than when water of the same Pb concentration is used to fill a humidifier and a person inhales the subsequent emitted particle for 8 hours.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Manganese is the opposite. This essential trace element can cause neurotoxicity when inhaled; inhalation of Mn is acknowledged to be a more severe health and cognition threat than ingestion. Consequently, Mn presents a greater risk when inhaled as particles emitted from an ultrasonic humidifier when Mn-containing tap water is used to fill it, than when water at the same Mn concentration is ingested. Neurotoxicity and reduced cognition are more severe effects for the developing brains of infants and children; thus, Mn from an ultrasonic humidifier can be a severe health and developmental concern.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Recommendations from our project include the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Consumers should be aware that using tap water to fill their ultrasonic humidifiers (also known as cool mist humidifiers, will humidify the indoor air but can result in respirable mineral particles from the tap water being transported into their indoor air.
