 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award funds the continued management and operations (M&O) of the IceCube Neutrino Observatory (ICNO) located at the South Pole Station. The core team of researchers and engineers maintain the existing ICNO infrastructure at the South Pole and home institution, guaranteeing an uninterrupted stream of scientifically unique, high-quality data. The M&O activities are built upon eight highly successful years of managing the overall ICNO operations after the start of science operations in 2008. Construction of ICNO was supported by NSF's Major Research Equipment and Facilities Construction (MREFC) account and was completed on schedule and within budget in 2010. Effective coordination of efforts by the core M&O personnel and efforts by personnel within the IceCube Collaboration has yielded significant increases in the performance of this cubic-kilometer detector over time. The scientific output from the IceCube Collaboration during the past five years has been outstanding. \r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of the ICNO/M&O activities are strong, involving postdoctoral, graduate, and (in some cases) undergraduate students in the day-today operation & calibration of the neutrino detector. The extraordinary physics results recently produced by ICNO and its extraordinary location at South Pole have a high potential to excite the imagination of high school children and the public in general at a national and international level.\r\n\r\nThe current ICNO/M&O effort produces better energy and angular resolution information about detected neutrino events, has more efficient data filters and more accurate detector simulations, and enables continuous software development for systems that are needed to acquire and analyze data. This has produced data acquisition and data management systems with high robustness, traceability, and maintainability. The current ICNO/M&O effort includes: (1) resources for both distributed and centrally managed activities, and (2) additional accountability mechanisms for \"in-kind\" and institutional contributions. Both are necessary to ensure that the detector maintains its capability to produce quality scientific data at the level required to achieve the detector's scientific discovery objectives. Recent ICNO discoveries of cosmic high-energy neutrinos (some reaching energies close to and over 2.5 PeV) and oscillating atmospheric neutrinos in a previously unexplored energy range from 10 to 60 GeV became possible because of the \"state-of-the-art\" detector configuration, excellently supported infrastructure, and cutting-edge science analyses. The ICNO has set limits on Dark Matter annihilations, made precision measurements of the angular distribution of cosmic ray muons, and characterized in detail physical properties of the Antarctic 2.5-km thick ice sheet at South Pole. The discovery of high-energy cosmic neutrinos by IceCube with a flux at the level anticipated for those associated with high-energy gamma- and cosmic-ray accelerators brightens the prospect for identifying the sources of the highest energy particles.",

  "por_cntn": "<div class=\"porColContainerWBG\">\n<div class=\"porContentCol\"><p>The <a href=\"http://icecube.wisc.edu/science/icecube/detector\">IceCube Neutrino Observatory</a> at the South Pole is the largest particle detector in the world. It continuously looks for cosmic messengers: high-energy particles from outer space. Among the more than 100 billion particles it detects every year are a few astrophysical neutrinos - neutrinos with the highest energies ever observed, which have been created in the most extreme environments in our universe, like the cosmic accelerators associated with the supermassive black holes at the centers of other galaxies.</p>\n<p>Figuring out what exactly creates these astrophysical neutrinos has long been one of IceCube's main goals, and in 2017, we finally got our first hint. A neutrino arrived at IceCube that we - with the help of other telescopes around the world and in space - were able to trace back to a blazar. The discovery, <a href=\"https://icecube.wisc.edu/news/press-releases/2018/07/icecube-neutrinos-point-to-long-sought-cosmic-ray-accelerator/\">published in 2018</a>, heralded a new era of multimessenger astrophysics. Our observation underscored one of NSF's 10 Big Ideas: \"Windows on the Universe,\" which seeks to discover more about the universe through the observation of different cosmic messengers, including neutrinos.</p>\n<p>Our multimessenger astrophysics efforts continue thanks to IceCube's neutrino alerts and data access plan, which enable collaborative efforts with an increasingly broader user base of participating telescopes. Coordinated searches with leading cosmic-ray, optical, gamma-ray, and gravitational wave observatories have resulted in multiple publications. We recently released \"<a href=\"https://icecube.wisc.edu/news/outreach/2020/10/from-outer-space-to-south-pole-to-your-phone-new-ar-app-for-icecube/\">IceCubeAR</a>,\" an app that allows anyone, even members of the public, to receive real-time alerts about candidate IceCube neutrino events directly to their devices.</p>\n<p>The IceCube Neutrino Observatory's science reach is broad, ranging from studies of the properties of Antarctic ice to searches for the sources of the highest energy particles in the universe. Exciting results have been published in about 100 <a href=\"http://icecube.wisc.edu/pubs\">scientific papers</a> in refereed journals between 2016 and 2021. A recent big breakthrough made by the IceCube Collaboration was the detection of a cosmic antineutrino resonantly interacting with an atomic electron on the \"<a href=\"https://icecube.wisc.edu/news/press-releases/2021/03/icecube-detection-of-a-high-energy-particle-proves-60-year-old-theory/\">Glashow resonance</a>.\" With this detection, published in March 2021, our scientists provided another confirmation of the Standard Model of particle physics in an extreme energy range not previously accessible. It further demonstrated the ability of IceCube to do fundamental physics.</p>\n<p>Significant improvements in all performance areas have produced a stable yet steadily more capable instrument that exceeds design expectations. The detector operates essentially continuously, is able to filter data and send an alert in less than a minute, and has shown that the South Pole is a great place to host an observatory to view the universe.</p>\n<p>The accomplishments of IceCube Collaboration members have been recognized with significant national and international prizes since 2016, including the 2017&nbsp;<a href=\"https://icecube.wisc.edu/news/awards/2017/02/darren-grant-receives-prestigious-prize-to-boost-his-icecube-research/\">E.W.R.

At the start of the 2020 coronavirus pandemic, we held webcasts regularly for the public, including one specifically <a href=\"https://youtu.be/ito1qgK-7nQ\">for young audiences</a>.</p>\n<p>Our high school <a href=\"https://wipac.wisc.edu/learn/connect\">internship programs</a> provide firsthand experiences for students by connecting them with researchers. Over 2,000 high school students have participated in another program, the <a href=\"https://masterclass.icecube.wisc.edu/\">IceCube Masterclass</a>, for one-day research experiences since launching in 2014. K-12 teachers are essential partners in efforts to excite and engage the next generation of STEM professionals; since 2009, seven teachers have deployed to the South Pole with IceCube in conjunction with the NSF <a href=\"https://www.polartrec.com/search/node/icecube\">PolarTREC</a> program.</p>\n<p>We provide a number of free outreach resources to the public on our website, including a six-part <a href=\"https://icecube.wisc.edu/outreach/activities/rosie-gibbs/\">web comic</a>, \"Adventures with Rosie &amp; Gibbs: the lost penguins,\" which has been translated into nine languages. In addition, we have created a series of IceCube-themed <a href=\"https://icecube.wisc.edu/outreach/activities/#:~:text=Printable%20IceCube%20Crafts\">arts-and-crafts</a>, and a popular <a href=\"https://ed.ted.com/lessons/why-neutrinos-matter-silvia-bravo-gallart#review\">TED-Ed</a> lesson we produced has been viewed over 390,000 times.</p>\n<p>The IceCube Neutrino Observatory is operated by an international <a href=\"http://icecube.wisc.edu/collaboration\">collaboration</a> of over 300 scientists in 12 countries.

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe IceCube Neutrino Observatory at the South Pole is the largest particle detector in the world. It continuously looks for cosmic messengers: high-energy particles from outer space. Among the more than 100 billion particles it detects every year are a few astrophysical neutrinos - neutrinos with the highest energies ever observed, which have been created in the most extreme environments in our universe, like the cosmic accelerators associated with the supermassive black holes at the centers of other galaxies.\n\nFiguring out what exactly creates these astrophysical neutrinos has long been one of IceCube's main goals, and in 2017, we finally got our first hint. A neutrino arrived at IceCube that we - with the help of other telescopes around the world and in space - were able to trace back to a blazar. The discovery, published in 2018, heralded a new era of multimessenger astrophysics. Our observation underscored one of NSF's 10 Big Ideas: \"Windows on the Universe,\" which seeks to discover more about the universe through the observation of different cosmic messengers, including neutrinos.\n\nOur multimessenger astrophysics efforts continue thanks to IceCube's neutrino alerts and data access plan, which enable collaborative efforts with an increasingly broader user base of participating telescopes. Coordinated searches with leading cosmic-ray, optical, gamma-ray, and gravitational wave observatories have resulted in multiple publications. We recently released \"IceCubeAR,\" an app that allows anyone, even members of the public, to receive real-time alerts about candidate IceCube neutrino events directly to their devices.\n\nThe IceCube Neutrino Observatory's science reach is broad, ranging from studies of the properties of Antarctic ice to searches for the sources of the highest energy particles in the universe. Exciting results have been published in about 100 scientific papers in refereed journals between 2016 and 2021. A recent big breakthrough made by the IceCube Collaboration was the detection of a cosmic antineutrino resonantly interacting with an atomic electron on the \"Glashow resonance.\" With this detection, published in March 2021, our scientists provided another confirmation of the Standard Model of particle physics in an extreme energy range not previously accessible. It further demonstrated the ability of IceCube to do fundamental physics.\n\nSignificant improvements in all performance areas have produced a stable yet steadily more capable instrument that exceeds design expectations. The detector operates essentially continuously, is able to filter data and send an alert in less than a minute, and has shown that the South Pole is a great place to host an observatory to view the universe.\n\nThe accomplishments of IceCube Collaboration members have been recognized with significant national and international prizes since 2016, including the 2017 E.W.R. Steacie Memorial Fellowship, the 2017 Saruhashi Prize, the 2019 Nishina Memorial Prize, eight Global Neutrino Network dissertation prizes, a 2018 American Physical Society Fellowship, the 2021 Bruno Rossi Prize, two 2021 Sloan Research Fellowships, and multiple International Union of Pure and Applied Physics prizes, including the 2017 O'Ceallaigh Medal, the 2017 IUPAP-TIFR Homi Bhabha Medal, the 2019 Yodh Prize, the 2021 Shakti Duggal Award, and three Astroparticle Physics Young Scientist Prizes (2015, 2019, and 2021).\n\nWebsite and social media platforms - Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter - highlight on-ice activities at the South Pole, summarize recent publications, and describe noteworthy events and accomplishments. Media mentions since 2016 include articles in The New York Times, Science, Scientific American, New Scientist, Inverse, Physics World, Physics Today, Symmetry Magazine, and Nature as well as articles in over a dozen non-English languages.\n\nWe share our South Pole activity with audiences worldwide through real-time webcasts with our scientists stationed there, held several times per year and reaching hundreds of people around the world. At the start of the 2020 coronavirus pandemic, we held webcasts regularly for the public, including one specifically for young audiences.\n\nOur high school internship programs provide firsthand experiences for students by connecting them with researchers. Over 2,000 high school students have participated in another program, the IceCube Masterclass, for one-day research experiences since launching in 2014. K-12 teachers are essential partners in efforts to excite and engage the next generation of STEM professionals; since 2009, seven teachers have deployed to the South Pole with IceCube in conjunction with the NSF PolarTREC program.\n\nWe provide a number of free outreach resources to the public on our website, including a six-part web comic, \"Adventures with Rosie &amp; Gibbs: the lost penguins,\" which has been translated into nine languages. In addition, we have created a series of IceCube-themed arts-and-crafts, and a popular TED-Ed lesson we produced has been viewed over 390,000 times.\n\nThe IceCube Neutrino Observatory is operated by an international collaboration of over 300 scientists in 12 countries. The University of Wisconsin-Madison is the lead institution and through the Wisconsin IceCube Particle Astrophysics Center, WIPAC, is responsible for detector maintenance and operations.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/23/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Francis Halzen"
