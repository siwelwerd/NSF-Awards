 "awd_abstract_narration": "For accurate automated translation of text-to-spoken-word or spoken-word-to-text, it is necessary to understand the prosodic patterning of speech since prosody, i.e. stress, rhythm, and pauses between phrases, is central in conveying meaning and structuring discourse.  In addition, many languages use tone to change the meaning of words but little is known about how prosodic features interact with tone.  Since tone and prosody are conveyed by using some of the same acoustic dimensions (pitch, duration, voice quality), one must know how these two systems interact for automatic speech recognition and translation.\r\n\r\nTo investigate and test hypotheses about the relationship of tone and prosody, Christian Di Canio, along with an interdisciplinary team, will create a database of 30 hours of transcribed narratives from Itunyoso Trique and expand an existing similar database in Yolox\u00f3chitl Mixtec, both both Mixtecan languages from eastern central Mexico.  These transcribed narratives will then be parsed into smaller units applying a  'forced alignment' tool used in automatic speech recognition.   Important results from the project will include the testing and improvement of the forced alignment tool; new corpora and expanded dictionaries for and Yolox\u00f3chitl Mixtec; and an analysis of tone and prosody interactions in these two languages.  The resulting prosodically segmented and tagged corpora will be a first of its kind for an endangered language that will be of use to the speaker-community and the broader scientific community.\r\n\r\nThis project is partially supported by funds from the Robust Intelligence program.",

Yet, for about 50-60% of the world's languages, pitch also distinguishes word meaning. These are called <em>tonal</em> languages. For instance, in Yolox&oacute;chitl Mixtec (spoken in Mexico), the word /nama/ pronounced with a medium level pitch means '<em>to change' </em>but the word /nama/ pronounced with a high level pitch means <em>'to be piling rocks.'</em> There are many well-known tonal languages, like Mandarin Chinese (spoken by over a billion people), Vietnamese, Thai, Yoruba, and Swedish, and several thousand lesser well-known tonal languages that have not been studied as extensively by linguists and speech scientists. Yet, an interesting and open linguistic question is how speakers of languages like these are able to convey things like emphasis, attitude, and emotion since they are already using pitch for distinguishing word meaning. Speakers of English can distinguish questions from statements using pitch alone, e.g. \"<em>Marcus bought roses.\" </em>vs. <em>\"Marcus bought roses?\" </em>but just<em> </em>how do speakers of tonal languages do the same thing?

A team consisting of linguists, students, and speakers of these languages worked together to investigate the scientific questions.

Speakers of this language expand their pitch range when they need to emphasize particular words. In another study, we examined how speakers of this language might control their pitch differently across the span of a sentence. Typically, speakers of non-tonal languages like English will lower pitch gradually in a statement but raise pitch towards the end of the sentence in a question.

Moreover, we found that Triqui speakers do not lower pitch across sentences. This finding was a surprise since linguists have assumed that pitch lowering is a universal pattern in speech.
