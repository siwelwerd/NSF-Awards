 "awd_abstract_narration": "This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award to Clemson University will respond to the urgent need for professionals capable of crossing disciplinary boundaries to assess technological and societal risks, to communicate those risks to decision makers, and to devise strategies that improve community resilience to natural or man-made disasters. The last five decades have seen a sharp increase in the frequency and impact of natural hazards and a significantly higher risk of man-made disasters, particularly since 9/11. Predicting and mitigating such extreme events is difficult due to interactions among infrastructure systems with complex, poorly understood feedback loops. Society needs professionals who can conceptualize complex systems where physical, cyber, and human infrastructure systems converge and who can transform this conceptual understanding into reliable computational models that are validated by data. Moreover, these professionals must be equipped with skills to effectively communicate with their peers in other disciplines and with decision and policy makers to ensure cohesion between science and policy. This NRT award will address these challenges through curriculum development, transformation in graduate education, and research with societal impact. The project anticipates training fifty-two (52) MS and PhD students, including twenty-six (26) funded trainees, from a variety of science and engineering disciplines related to model- and data-enabled infrastructure resiliency. \r\n\r\nThis project envisions a new paradigm of graduate education conducive to training STEM professionals who are transdisciplinary system thinkers capable of crossing disciplinary boundaries and working in a dynamic network of continuously learning individuals and evolving knowledge. It represents a transformation in graduate education through the creation of collaborative research communities with strong peer-learning aspects, resulting in a local scientific community that enables students to learn the ?business? of science (networking, collaboration, communication, etc.). The NRT award will promote an agile, adaptive curriculum structure responsive to the changing needs of students through the development of a modular, personalized training program. It will enhance students? ability to apply academic research to complex, real-world problems with an awareness of societal impacts via a uniquely integrated research, training, and outreach program that studies infrastructure vulnerabilities that disproportionately affect low-income regions. Developed within a logic framework and with a thorough, research-driven evaluation plan, this training program will be reproducible on a larger scale. Student and faculty teams will conduct research in three core model engineering and data science areas: (1) integrating models to models, (2) incorporating data into models, and (3) communicating model predictions to decision makers. Their work in each of these areas will allow them to highlight key model/data science issues, understand how these issues translate to societal impacts caused by vulnerabilities in infrastructure systems, and develop solutions to mitigate damage caused by potential infrastructure vulnerabilities. The research on infrastructure resiliency will result in new approaches for modeling and analyzing coupled systems, enabling scientists and decision makers to come together to better understand interdependent infrastructure systems and their uncertainties.\r\n\r\nThe NSF Research Traineeship (NRT) Program is designed to encourage the development and implementation of bold, new potentially transformative models for STEM graduate education training. The Traineeship Track is dedicated to effective training of STEM graduate students in high priority interdisciplinary research areas, through the comprehensive traineeship model that is innovative, evidence-based, and aligned with changing workforce and research needs.",

Guided by this vision, our project involved 28 faculty across 13 different majors and trained 36 graduate students to conceptualize complex systems where physical, cyber, and human infrastructure elements converge, and transform conceptual understanding into reliable computational models that are validated by data.  The RIES NRT trainees are also equipped with skills to effectively communicate with counterparts in other disciplines and decision makers to ensure cohesion between science and policy. Specific outcomes of the RIES NRT include curriculum  development, transformation  in  graduate  education,  research on complex problems with societal impact, and the creation of the South Carolina Institute for Sustainability and Resilience.\n\n(1)   Curriculum Development: We created a first of its kind MS degree in Resilient Systems, which encompasses the multidisciplinary content of the NRT and focus on Resilient Infrastructure and Environmental Systems.  This is an emerging area of interest and national need but has yet to be developed into degree programs.  Our MS in Resilient Systems is designed as a terminal degree or in-route to PhD. \n\n(2)   Transformation in Graduate Education: We developed and implemented an educational research philosophy that targets both student and faculty development to accelerate the production of highly qualified Ph.D. students needed to address critical challenges in graduate education identified by the U.S. government. One key aspect of this educational research philosophy is the students and faculty working within a community of practice, forming dynamic social network that can formulate and mobilize smaller groups to tackle the problem of infrastructure resilience. \n\n(3)   Research on Complex Problems with Societal Impact: We are fostering a culture of conducting research that is motivated by societal impact within a defined community and addresses complex problems.  The focus on complex interrelated problems necessitates a convergent, interdisciplinary approach to research investigate interdependencies between infrastructure systems and the effects on the surrounding community.\n\n(4) South Carolina Institute for Sustainability and Resilience (SCISR): Sustainability of the RIES NRT will be achieved through SCISR, a newly created institute at Clemson University, which will focus on continued Research, Education, and Community Outreach in the areas of infrastructure sustainability and resilience.  \n\nThe SCISR Research Division consists of a robust group of interdisciplinary faculty and graduate students from 4 different colleges and 13 different departments in a cohesive group of researchers with broad ranging capabilities.  SCISR will provide a network of resources to foster convergent research efforts.  The Education Division will recruit students and administer the newly developed MS degree in Resilient Systems.  We are also developing certificate programs for working professionals and others seeking continuing education in the area of resilience assessment.  The Community Outreach Division is a continuation of our Complex Ventures program developed through the NRT, which is focused on engagement with stakeholders in community non-profits, government organizations, and companies.  The goal is to educate these stakeholders on the topic of resilience and provide with the tools to understand and/or perform a resilience assessment on their organization.  This assessment can then be used to plan for future disruptions and make organizations more resilient.  We will assist these organizations with applying for governmental support to facilitate the assessment and identified improvements.  These efforts will overlap with the educational programs and research efforts associated with data collection, sensor development, modeling of complex interdependent systems with data sets, simulation of keystone events, and assessment procedures to identify nodes with low resilience.  These outreach activities will provide graduate students with experience working with real-world stakeholders and management of undergraduate intern students that will be responsible for data collection and entry. \n\nTo date, SCISR has been awarded more than $10 million in funding to support our research, education, and community outreach.  NSF NRT funding has been instrumental in creating an environment and culture of interdisciplinary, convergent research focused on complex infrastructure systems and community outreach.  Leveraging the outcomes from the RIES NRT, we will continue to impact the next generation of graduate trainees for the betterment of society.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/11/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Christopher L Kitchens"
