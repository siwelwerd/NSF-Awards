 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent technological developments and the increased availability of laboratory, airborne, and satellite hyperspectral imaging (HI) data have led to a growing demand for HI related jobs which calls for greater learning, understanding, and use of HI for various applications. The REU Site - Interdisciplinary Research Experience in Hyperspectral Imaging (IDREHSI) program at the University of Northern Iowa is an 8-week summer school that introduces 10 undergraduate students each year to a highly interdisciplinary research environment with a unifying theme of fundamental and applied research in HI. Student participants will have opportunities to engage in HI based research in various STEM fields such as geographic information science, earth science, environmental science, physics, biology, computer science, and atmospheric science for different applications. Specifically, they will: (1) be exposed to existing scientific approaches and experimental methods in HI, (2) develop skills that make students competitive in academic and professional environments, (3) be involved in scientific investigations that prepares them for graduate studies and/or professional careers, (4) operate in highly interdisciplinary research settings and work across disciplinary boundaries in problem-based research, (5) improve their capability for learning independently, and (6) provide opportunities to discuss ethical issues related to collection and use of data, experimental design, and professional standards. \r\n\r\nThe intellectual core and unifying theme of the IDREHSl REU program is the science of HI that deals with the acquisition, processing, analysis and interpretation of spectra represented by multiple contiguous bands in a wide range of electromagnetic radiation wavelengths. The program builds on years of HI-related research activities by the research-mentors who work in different areas of HI science and will integrate their research with education by developing REU projects that can be completed by undergraduates during an eight week program. These projects are either lab-based (involving microscopic level data spectral analysis of materials such as minerals and chemical contamination, soil cores, photovoltaics, and other electro-optical characterization) or field-based (allowing outdoor data collection including the monitoring and estimation of water quality, crop condition assessment, wetland mapping, soil and sediment mapping, invasive species mapping and modeling, urban planning, and crop yield prediction). Participants will gain professional and personal experiences that are particularly valuable for young scientists.\r\n\r\nThis site is supported by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program.",

A greater understanding of HI, including collection, analysis, and interpretation of its data for different uses, will be an important priority over the next few years. The Interdisciplinary Research Experience in Hyperspectral Imaging (IDREHSI) program at the University of Northern Iowa (UNI) is a renewal of a previously funded REU Site that has continued training 30 undergraduate scientists in a highly interdisciplinary research environment with a unifying theme of fundamental and applied research in HI. During this 8-week summer program, student participants engaged in researcher-directed collaborative interdisciplinary projects and team-based problem-solving activities with faculty mentors from various STEM fields (e.g., geographic information science, geology/earth science, biology/environmental science, physics, computer science, and atmospheric science). The potentials of HI were substantively explored either in the classroom or in the field in students' IDREHSI projects focusing on different topics: Physics (10%), Geology/Earth Science (13%), Geographic Information Science/Computer Science (20%), Artic and Cryosphere Sciences (13%), Atmospheric Science (13%), and Biology/Environmental Sciences (30%). New and unique HI datasets were collected using the state-of-the-art instruments such as the lab-based Hyperspectral Imaging System, field-based Hyperspectral Field Spectroradiometer, and the drone-based Hyperspectral camera; new HI image processing approaches were developed by creating new specialized HI image indexes; new HI image analyses were conducted by integrating laboratory, field, airborne, and spaceborne data; and new HI applications were carried out in areas such as ocean science, environmental hazards, Arctic and cryosphere, hydrology, nanotechnology, and image processing and interpretation where the use of HI was traditionally impeded by the limited access to HI equipment and datasets as well as demanding computer processing required.</p>\n<p class=\"Default\">As the first and the only REU Site at UNI and the state of Iowa in the field of Earth Sciences, IDREHSI successfully created a highly interdisciplinary research environment by involving 9 faculty mentors (3 were women) who were from two colleges and multiple disciplines, 8 graduate students (2 were women) from the host department (Geography), 2 research centers, and 5 laboratories at UNI, 1 state agency in Iowa, 1 major national/international research facility, and 1 private company. Since 2017, the program successfully reached out to 30 students with a wide subject background including those traditional (e.g., chemistry, computer science, engineering, and physics) and non-traditional (e.g., economics, modern languages, and international affairs) STEM majors. Program participants were recruited nationally from institutions ranging from community to private colleges and to public universities as well as groups underrepresented in science or engineering. 90% of participants were from outside of the host institution, 30% were either freshman or sophomore, and 50% were women or from other underrepresented groups (50% women, 13% Hispanics, 7% Native Americans, and 3%African Americans). The program surveys revealed that participants have improved greatly (24% or more in the mean score) from pre- to post-program on the understanding of basic research skills and HI. The tracking of post-REU students indicated that, after leaving the IDREHSI program, more than 40% of students got involved in research-related activities (e.g., participating in research-oriented programs such as other REU sites or interning in academic and federal agencies' research centers like NASA Goddard Institute of Space Science), and still rated the REU experience helped them to decide whether or not to pursue graduate school. So far, five students earned their Masters degree in STEM including one who received the degree from the host department, and four students are currently in a graduate program (Masters and Doctoral).</p>\n<p>All research projects and results were shared at professional conferences in the host institution and at the local, regional, and national/international levels. Before leaving the program, all participants presented their research in both oral and poster format at the \"UNI REU-IDREHSI Student Research Conference\", to which external HI experts from academia (within and outside of the host department and institution) and industry were invited. After returning to their home institutions, students received continued support from the program team. Based on their REU projects, close to 70% of students gave presentations at the local (6%), regional (22%), and national/international (72%) conferences, and two students also received three scholarships from two national conferences. In addition, research projects conducted in the IDREHSI program were incorporated as a critical component in developing an advanced-level remote sensing course offered in the Department of Geography at UNI. Experiences and lessons learned from running the REU program were shared at two professional workshops and presented at two regional and two national/international conferences.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 05/04/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Bingqing&nbsp;Liang</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div
