 "awd_abstract_narration": "This awards funds data expenses for dissertation research. The project focuses on how homeowners who hold 'Option ARM' mortgages make financial decisions. The goal is to determine whether or not these homeowners are using so-called reference points in making their decisions about how to pay down credit card debt while also making mortgage payments. The results of this project are relevant to many issues surrounding financial regulation, and will illuminate debates about whether or not the government should restrict complexity in mortgage products, require certain kinds of disclosure information from lenders, or even ban 'non-standard' mortgages all together. The work will also help educators who work to promote financial literacy; the design of consumer education programs will benefit from better information about the reasons why consumers make certain kinds of financial mistakes.\r\n\r\nThe coPI plans to determine whether borrowers who hold Option ARMs make financial mistakes (a) statically, by holding credit card debt at the same time they make  larger-than-necessary mortgage payments, and (b) over time, by failing to allocate payments over time in response to plausibly exogenous shocks to interest rates. He hypothesizes that these mistakes are due to reference dependent preferences over debts. A natural reference point exists for an Option ARM because the monthly statement includes a non-binding suggestion of 'interest-only' payment. The analysis will first provide descriptive evidence on the importance of the interest only payments by examining the distribution of mortgage payments relative to the reference point. The PI will then explicitly test a model of reference dependence against a standard dynamic model.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe NSF Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant entitled Can Reference Dependence Explain Borrowing High and Lending Low: The Case of Option ARMs has led to the production of two works: an unreleased working paper: Reference Dependence and Imperfect Smoothing: The Case of Option ARMs, and the primary chapter of Christopher Hansman?s PhD thesis: Asymmetric Information and the Link Between Leverage and Mortgage Default.\n\nThe first paper explores the existence of a particular form of behavioral bias exhibited by borrowers with respect to their mortgage payments: reference dependence.  In effect the paper finds that borrowers are---perhaps unsurprisingly---significantly influenced by non-binding suggested payments included on their monthly mortgage statements.  However, this influence displays an interesting asymmetry:  while a substantial number of borrowers choose to make payments slightly greater than those suggested on their statements, virtually no borrowers make payments slightly below the suggestions.  This finding contributes to the academic literature by documenting this behavioral bias in an entirely new context, and provides useful guidance for policy-makers considering regulations that require increased disclosure by banks to consumers.\n\n \nThe second paper, contained within Christopher Hansman?s PhD thesis, examines the relationship between mortgage choice and default for homeowners in the period leading up to the great recession.  In the early 2000s there was a strong relationship between borrowers initial down payments and the probability that they ultimately defaulted on their loans.  This paper asks whether this was because (i) loans with small down payments are inherently risky (one could call this explanation \"risky loans\") or (ii) because the sort of borrower who makes a small down payment is just a riskier type, and would default more frequently no matter what (one could call this explanation \"risky borrowers\").  The paper develops a new empirical strategy to separate these two explanations, and finds that while the \"risky loans\" explanation accounts for 60-70 percent of the relationship between down payments and default, ``risky borrowers?? still played an important role: accounting for the remaining 30-40 percent.  Using these results, the author evaluates the effectiveness of a common mortgage policy used after the crisis---minimum down payments.  He finds that ignoring the role of  \"risky borrowers\" leads regulators to significantly overstate the effectiveness of these minimums.
