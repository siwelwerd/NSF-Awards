 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project concerns low-dimensional topology, which studies the properties of spaces called manifolds that locally look like the world we live in. Many of the mathematical tools successfully used to study high-dimensional manifolds do not apply to manifolds in four or fewer dimensions, and important fundamental problems remain unresolved. This project studies knots and links, knotted circular strings in three-dimensional space. Three-dimensional manifolds can be mathematically represented by framed links, where the so-called framings are instructions to modify the space near the link. As a consequence, the study of knots and links is a fundamental tool in understanding three-dimensional manifolds. In this project, the investigator aims to get a better understanding of how knots behave as they move through time as a fourth dimension. This line of investigation constitutes an important subfield of low-dimensional topology known as concordance. An algebraic operation with properties similar to the addition of numbers can be performed on the collection of knots, and this leads to the construction of an algebraic object known as the concordance group. The concordance group is an extremely complicated entity, which is poorly understood despite great efforts by many mathematicians.  To gain perspective on its structure, the investigator will introduce a notion of distance and investigate how certain geometric operations change this distance.\r\n\r\nThe primary goal of this project is to gain a better understanding of knot and link concordance.  The investigator will do this by studying the concordance group as both an abelian group with associated filtrations, such as the n-solvable and bipolar filtrations, and also as a metric space with discrete and non-discrete metrics. Specific projects are as follows:  (1) show that the \"other half'\" of the n-solvable filtration is nontrivial; (2) determine if successive quotients of the n-solvable filtration of the link concordance group are abelian; (3) understand the relationship between the Milnor invariants of derivatives of a knot and the concordance class of the knot; (4) view the smooth knot concordance group as a metric space and study natural geometric operators acting on it (in particular, show that there is a non-discrete metric on the subgroup of topologically slice knots T and, in addition, show that the successive quotients of the bipolar filtration are nontrivial on T); (5) define the knot complex and study its algebraic topology.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual merit: This award investigates the structure of knot and link concordance, a subfield of critical importance to the field of low-dimensional topology.  Topology is the study of shape and space and it's beginning goes back to Euler who investigated the Seven Bridges of K?nigsberg, a standard problem in graph theory.  In low-dimensional topology, one focuses on spaces that look like Euclidean space (in 4-dimensions or less) and allows them to change by bending or twisting (but not cutting or pasting).  For example, one can show using the standard Euler characteristic of the the surface of a donut and sphere are different so one cannot continuously deform one to the other.  While we understand 2-dimensions (and even 3-dimensions) quite well, less is known about 4-dimensions, which you could think of having a space and time dimension.  In particular, we know little about the types of objects that can be embedded in 4-dimensions.  \n\nWe studied when knots/links in 3-dimensions move in 4-dimensions, forming special surfaces called concordances, both in the smooth and topological category.  If two knots (or links) bound such a surface we say that they are concordant.  To do this, we study the set of concordance classes of knots/links, C,  both as algebraic objects (groups) and non-discrete metric spaces.    Specifically, we put a distance metric on C called the bipolar metric.  This metric is geometrically defined but quite hard to compute, much harder than the metric defined by the PI and coauthors called the grope metric.  We show that the bipolar metric makes C (in the smooth category) into a non-discrete metric space whereas the grope metric only tells one about the topological category.   For links, we are interested in the question of what types of surfaces one can cobound with a boundary link (this is a link that bounds disjointly embedded surfaces in 3-space).  It was known that there are links (with vanishing Milnor's invariants - VMI) that are not concordant to any boundary link.  We show that even if you severly weaken the surface in 4-space (i.e. n-solvably equivalent for n at least 1), there are still links with VMI that are not equivalent to a boundary link.  On the other hand, when n=0.5, we give evidence that every link with VMI is 0.5 equivalent to a boundary link.  This is important since the classification of links (even boundary links) up to 0.5-solvability or algebraic sliceness is not known (though, unlike for knots, these are known to differ).  Related to this, the PI and coauthors started studying the classification of colored boundary links up to 0.5-solvability.  This might make things more difficult, but is actually a more natural category to work in since every (non-colored) link with linking number zero has an associated colored boundary link (not unique).  We conjecture that two are colored-0.5 equivalent if and only if there is a strong double delta move (in three dimensions!) taking one to the other.  \n\nIn addition to study knots and links up to concordance, we also studied the graph Floer homology of a spatial graph in 3-dimensions.  In particular, we tried to find a relationship between the tau invariant of Heegaard Floer Homology of the spine of a Seifert surface and the knot bounding the surface.  We have not solved this problem but have started writing a computer program to compute examples.  Similarly, with Kuzbary, we have been studying the relationship between the derivative of a knot and the knot for genus 1.  Finally, we studied the fundamental group of a homology handlebody and showed that Thurston's tripus is a genus 2 homology handlebody whose fundamental group does not surject onto a non-abelian free group.  We have ideas of how to show that if the genus is always 3 then the homology handlebook will always have a group that is very large (maps onto a non-abelian free group).
