 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation Program (MRI) and support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program (CRIF), Professor William Connick from the University of Cincinnati and colleagues Anna Gudmundsdottir, Jeanette Krause, James Mack II and Hairong Guan have acquired a dual source, microfocus single crystal X-ray diffractometer equipped with a photon detector and a cryogenic device. In general, an X-ray diffractometer allows accurate and precise measurements of the full three-dimensional structure of a molecule, including bond distances and angles.  It also provides accurate information about the spatial arrangement of a molecule relative to neighboring molecules. The studies described here impact a number of areas, including organic and inorganic chemistry, materials chemistry and biochemistry. This instrument is an integral part of teaching as well as research and research training of undergraduate and graduate students in chemistry and biochemistry at this institution and regional collaborators. Additionally, the instrument exposes high school and undergraduate students to crystallography and research. Participation of underrepresented groups is enhanced through the principal investigator's involvement with ACS-Project SEED, Dreyfus, NSF-REU and Women in Science and Engineering programs.\r\n \r\nThe award is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels, especially in areas such as (a) identifying efficient photoprocesses for storing energy via metal-complex photochemistry that releases two electrons per photon absorbed, (b) studying sensor materials to determine the mechanisms of colorimetric and luminescence-based responses of materials to chemical vapors and aqueous ions, (c) preparing and characterizing potential catalysts for chemical transformations and green technologies and (d) characterizing the underlying chemistry of agents that release reactive species that target specific substrates or are themselves components in metabolic pathways or nanostructured materials.",
