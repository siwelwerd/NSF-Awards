 "awd_abstract_narration": "Scientific interest in infrastructure has tried to understand the mechanical, human, and natural forces that impact the flow of information and services. These infrastructures have become increasingly dependent on the global movement of goods and peoples. The global systems that deliver these resources, however, are inevitably funneled through bottlenecks or \"chokepoints\", such as canals, tunnels, maritime straights, border crossings, etc. Constricting the flow of materials and people, such chokepoints are both vital to national and economic interests, and uniquely vulnerable, dynamic, and prone to disturbances. Not surprisingly, governments, corporations, and communities have taken a keen interest in securing and regulating these sites. Little is known, however, about how these passageways actually work. This collaborative project seeks to explore how local communities, environments, and infrastructures interact to allow passage through these sites (or not), as well how ordinary (and sometimes extraordinary) events at chokepoints affect economic systems, security, and lives well beyond these points of passage.\r\n\r\nChristopher Middleton and Gabriela Valdivia of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Ashley Carse of Vanderbilt University, Jatin Dua of the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor, Elizabeth Dunn of Indiana University, and Jason Cons of the University of Texas at Austin, will explore six chokepoints around the world. Each member of the team is an expert in their region of study. Each will focus on a particular kind of chokepoint. These include: the Panama Canal, a tunnel in Russia, a land bridge in India, an oil-refinery and pipelines in Ecuador, a network of rivers in Bangladesh, and a maritime strait leading into the Red Sea. The researchers will utilize extensive interviews, observation, and first-person engagement with officials, workers, and chokepoint residents in order to understand the distinctly human dimensions of these transit zones. Bringing together data from around the world, this study will provide a strategic reassessment of the global movement of goods, information, and people by examining these vital and dynamic points of national and world interest. The results will speak directly to current concerns over migration, security, and economic wellbeing.  In doing so, this project promises to alter the ways governments, industries, and others understand and engage with these critical transit points of the world today.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nHow do some states dominate others, and their populations, using features of the natural terrain?  This research looks at the ways nation-states use chokepoints, or geophysical sites of narrowing, to control the flow of people, goods and money and to dominate territory.   Using the case study of the Roki Tunnel, the only year round passage point between Russia and Georgia, this research documents the emergence of a new form of state power based not on border control, but on the control of strategic passage points.  By striating space, or creating channels for movement that attempt to limit the ways people can move through the chokepoint, states attempt to make easily controllable spatial zones.   Yet, as this research shows, non-state actors can use ties of ethnicity, kinship, and co-residence to create alternate passageways, ones that circumvent existing chokepoints, create new chokepoints outside of state control, and continue the flow of goods and people even when states wish to block it.  Insurgents, smugglers, and others use the same terrain to circumvent state control, importing nuclear material, heroin, fruit, construction materials and other goods.  The existence of chokepoints causes a continual struggle to dominate the landscape which, in some cases, can result in violent conflict.  Theoretically, this research shows the emergence of a new form of power, one that rests on control of strategic points rather than entire borders.  Along with the other papers produced by the research group, it asks anthropologists and geographers to think volumetrically, in three dimensions, rather than only thinking about border control as flat lines on a map.  \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/08/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Elizabeth C Dunn"
