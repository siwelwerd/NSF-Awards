 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-Technical Abstract\r\nThe objective of this project is to reveal and control charge transport in structurally complex semiconductors to ultimately yield the next generation of thermoelectric materials.  The development of advanced thermoelectric materials could have a considerable impact on the nation's energy portfolio through solar thermoelectric generators, cogeneration, and waste heat recovery.  More broadly, this program will lead to a deep understanding of charge transport in complex semiconductors that impacts other applications (e.g. transparent conductors, photovoltaic materials, power electronics).  These research efforts will be integrated into the classroom through data-driven active learning modules.  Community college students will be engaged in solid state materials chemistry and physics through summer research on this project.  \r\n\r\nTechnical Abstract\r\nIn thermoelectric materials, the energy-dependence of charge carrier transport plays a key role in determining the thermopower.  Further, the interplay between solid state chemistry and charge transport in semiconductors is particularly rich due to the profound effects that even dilute chemical perturbations exert on electronic properties.   There is thus a grand challenge to understand and control the energy dependence charge transport. In this project, the goal is to combine recent advances in structural determination and first principles calculations, in concert with single crystal growth and advanced transport measurements, to yield deep insight into charge transport through the careful integration of these measurements.   With the support of the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program, this understanding will reveal the energy-dependence of charge carrier transport and the associated structural perturbations which can dramatically alter these properties.",

As we transition from elemental and binary semiconductors to more exotic compounds, our ability to predict and control electronic mobility is significantly reduced. This is due in no small part to the multitude of phenomena that contribute to mobility.  Mobility is limited by the effective mass of a charge carrier, screening, and the various scattering sources that can impede transport.  Forming solid solutions (i.e., alloying) further complicates the design paradigm for electronic mobility as the underlying crystal is now far from periodic and effective mass becomes increasingly ill-defined.\n\nOver the course of this research, we focused on establishing material design relationships between crystal chemistry and electronic mobility.  These studies included how mobility is affected by a) native and extrinsic point defects, b) order parameter in alloys, c) high entropy solid solutions, d) interfaces, and e) spin disorder.  To conduct these studies, new synthetic procedures were developed to systematically control these structural features.  Such syntheses ranged from solution processed, highly textured arrays of nanoplates to single crystals grown in metal fluxes to combinatorial thin films.  These synthetic efforts involved strong collaborators at national laboratories and other universities.  Mobility is often viewed in the aggregate, but the mobility of electrons can depend heavily on their energy.  Through a combination of density functional theory calculations and experimental measurements, the energy dependence of charge carrier mobility was able to be resolved in a variety of pnictide and chalcogenide semiconductors.  Such resolution inspired the design of materials with strong energy filtering capabilities. Energy filtering allows for the enhancement of the Seebeck coefficient and the reduction of the Lorenz coefficient; both outcomes are desirable for thermoelectric applications.  Ultimately, these efforts led to new materials with excellent thermoelectric performance for waste heat recovery. \n\nInterwoven into these research efforts were significant efforts to train the next generation, broaden participation in science, and foster a thriving solid state chemistry research community.  Concerning this final point, two solid state chemistry conferences totaling more than 300 people were organized. Both of these conferences were focused on providing a platform for students and junior faculty to disseminate their research and to form new collaborations.  In one of the conferences, workshops to foster new collaborations culminated in a pitch session at the end of the conference.  Undergraduate research was a core component of this research program; as one metric of undergraduate engagement, undergraduate researchers were co-authors on seven peer-reviewed publications.

These efforts led to the founding of the Bridge Opportunities for Transfer Students and ultimately to a community college-student focused NSF REU program \"Integrating Computation and Experiment to Create Revolutionary Materials\".  Complementary to these laboratory experiences, we developed a flipped classroom for solid state physics based on pre-class content and hands-on in-class activities; these course materials are publicly accessible and free.    \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/06/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Eric S Toberer"
