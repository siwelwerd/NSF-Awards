MBC living stock collections help advance scientific understanding in numerous fields in biology. The facility provides the most diverse and thoroughly documented collections of palms and cycads in the US, through its historic and ongoing plant exploration fieldwork, as well as its location in frost-free, subtropical South Florida. In addition, to their use in research and education, maintaining these collections reduces the need for field collecting, preventing the extirpation of species from their natural habitats. However, South Florida is prone to more frequent lightning and hurricane strikes and these hazards threaten the security of the collection. Loss of electrical power in Florida is highly correlated with lightning and wind, and such interruptions create dangerous conditions for tender seedlings in the greenhouse, and living stocks in cold storage. Thus, backup power for these facilities will ensure continued and increased service of this collection to researchers and to the public. MBC closely collaborates with local institutions, including some of the most diverse university communities in the US.  MBC also fully leverages its living collection for education, training, broadened participation, and public understanding of science. This is accomplished through programs in service learning, paid fellowships, frequent student fieldtrips, high school internships, volunteer programs, guided tours, and frequent online and printed publications. \r\n\r\n\r\nThis project will ensure continued security of the living collections for further research use. Recent improvements to MBC's living collections propagation and cryostorage environment have improved survivability, leading to greater diversity of the collection. This project will install an automatic backup generator system to ensure uninterrupted electrical power to the propagation and cyrostorage facilities. This will ensure that critical environmental systems (reverse osmosis water filtration, timed mist and irrigation, air circulation, environmental controls, and ultracold freezer systems) can function in the event of a short- to long-term power outage. This upgrade will ensure the long-term security of these living collections, and their future service to the NSF BIO-funded research community. Ensuring a stable environment for cryostorage and propagation facilities will also further increase the potential diversity of the living collections, helping to reach a broader pool of potential users. The outcomes of this project can be found on the Montgomery Botanical Center website (http://www.montgomerybotanical.org/Collection.htm).",

The upgrade consisted of automatic backup power systems for the living collections propagation facility and the cryostorage facility. This one-time upgrade maintains MBC&rsquo;s ability to support NSF research. The propagation and cryostorage facilities and systems at MBC require constant electrical power in order to secure the correct environment for seedlings and cryopreserved collections. Montgomery is a 120-acre living collections facility in Miami, Florida, the mildest climate zone in the continental United States. Montgomery&rsquo;s collection is unique nationally and internationally for the high proportion of wild collected stock and meticulous record keeping and mapping of collections. Montgomery has the largest research collection of palms and the largest research collection of cycads in the US. Montgomery&rsquo;s location provides an ideal climate and environment to curate these living collections and make them available to the US research community. However, South Florida is also prone to more frequent lightning and cyclone strikes than other US regions. Loss of grid power in Florida is highly correlated with lightning and wind events and interruptions in power create dangerous conditions for tender seedlings and cryopreserved collections. Thus, backup power was essential to ensure continued service of this living collection to NSF BIO research.&nbsp; The major goal of the project was to implement the two automatic generator systems to ensure the safety of the collection.&nbsp; During the grant period, we ensured the safety and security of our living collections by having an automatic generator system installed in the nursery complex and a second automatic generator system installed to protect the seedbank.&nbsp; The new generators now protect the young plants in the nursery and the pollen in the seedbank building from surges and power outages.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Intellectual Merit:</strong>&nbsp; Living collections at MBC are a vital research resource, used by over 189 researchers worldwide in the last 5 years. The collections have contributed to 47 known NSF projects.

The upgrade proposed here has ensured continued security of the collections for further research use. Improvements to the living collections propagation and cryostorage environment have allowed better survivability, leading to greater diversity of the collection. The current project ensures the long-term security of these living collections, and their future service to the NSF BIO research community. From 2010-2014, MBC provided nearly 1.5 million samples to users. Montgomery emphasizes taxonomic diversity within the collection, yet places an even greater emphasis on capturing the genetic diversity within a taxon.
