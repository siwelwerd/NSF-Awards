 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project funded by the Chemistry Division (Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms A), Professor Oliver Steinbock (Florida State University) is studying how seemingly simple chemical reactions can form complex life-like patterns. Chemical reactions in a laboratory container can produce macroscopic patterns that include rotating spirals that appear visually as striking blue bands on a red background. Closely related spirals exist as electrical phenomena also in the human heart where they cause life-threatening conditions and are among the leading causes of death in the US.  Professor Steinbock and his students will investigate the behavior of these spiral waves in thick layers that model the heart focusing on specific questions including the effect of height variations. They will also study the pinning of these spirals to inert areas that correspond to anatomical features and scar tissue formed after heart attacks. \r\n\r\nThis project uses the autocatalytic Belousov-Zhabotinsky (BZ) reaction and numerical simulations of reaction-diffusion models to investigate self-propagating concentration waves. In three dimensions, these nonlinear waves can take the form of vortices that rotate around one-dimensional phase singularities called filaments. Filament motion can generate a form of spatio-temporal chaos that shares many dynamical similarities with ventricular fibrillation in the human heart. The effect of non-reactive heterogeneities on periodic and chaotic vortices will be investigated with a focus on the defect-mediated suppression of turbulent states as well as the translational motion of vortices along step edges. Another component is the study of vortex pinning in higher dimensional networks. The outreach program includes the dissemination of key results and pertinent background information to laymen and teachers using YouTube videos and other internet-based resources.",

Despite remarkable and continuing progress on both fronts, living organisms often transcend the structural features of molecules by sustaining intricate dynamic states such as hormonal rhythms, sleep, and blood circulation to name a few. Disorders of these (often oscillatory) states induce dynamic diseases and corresponding treatments require a different understanding of chemical processes. An important example is ventricular fibrillation (VF) in humans, which is a leading cause of death in the industrialized world. During VF, the normal motion pattern of the contraction waves is dynamically altered and creates rotating vortices that fail to orchestrate the proper contraction sequence of the heart muscle. Very similar three-dimensional vortices exist in several other biological as well as chemical systems and hence suggest underlying universalities that relate to the patterns and their specific dynamics. Under this grant, the PI and his group have studied this class of rotating spirals and scroll waves in chemical reaction-diffusion systems such as the Belousov-Zhabotinsky (BZ) reaction and in several mathematical models.</p>\n<p class=\"float-left\">An important target of the project was the study of the rotation backbone of the scroll waves, i.e. the self-organized curves that mark the inner \"end\" of the vortex in analogy to the central edge of a paper scroll. These curves are not stationary, but move according to their local curvature and associated phase gradients. The PI's group discovered that these curves are attracted to heterogeneities in the system and tend to anchor themselves to thin inert objects. The resulting pinned vortices can rotate faster than the surrounding wave field and expel turbulent patterns from the system. These findings were interpreted in the context of cardiac tissue and heterogeneities such as scar tissue from prior heart attacks. It was also found that particular shapes can destabilize the vortex states. In this context, numerical simulations of inert trefoil-knot-shaped inclusion were performed. Other investigations aimed at understanding the interaction of nearby vortex chains and vortex rotation in networks. The latter efforts lead to the discovery of four-dimensional hyperscroll waves and 4D turbulence. As part of a third thrust, the PI investigated wave patterns in small catalyst-loaded beads submerged in BZ solutions. These beads display two distinct dynamic states: global oscillations and travelling waves. Miscellaneous other activities were aimed at clarifying self-organizing forms of corrosion and reaction fronts in precipitation systems.</p>\n<p class=\"float-left\">All of these research activities were closely tied to the training of undergraduate and graduate students as well as postdoctoral scholars. Moreover, the PI and his group engaged in different forms of outreach by using social media and by participating in local community events such as the annual Tallahassee Science Festival and the Filipino Festival. These activities were well received and attracted diverse audiences with some of the PI's videos receiving over 5,000 views. The scientific outcomes were broadly disseminated by publishing peer-reviewed papers and by presenting talks and posters at numerous national and international conferences. The junior team members also initiated the no-cost virtual meeting \"Nonlin21\" for students and postdoctoral researchers that attracted participants from nearly 20 different institutions.</p>\n<p class=\"float-left\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"float-left\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"float-left\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"float-left\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"float-left\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 09/27/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Oliver&nbsp;Steinbock</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1565734/1565734_10452787_1632776085619_bz--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1565734/1565734_10452787_1632776085619_bz--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Spiral waves in the Belousov-Zhabotinsky (BZ) reaction\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1565734/1565734_10452787_1632776085619_bz--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Spiral waves in the Belousov-Zhabotinsky (BZ) reaction\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Rotating spirals and other wave patterns in the Belousov-Zhabotinsky (BZ) reaction.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">D.
