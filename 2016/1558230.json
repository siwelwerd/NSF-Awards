 "awd_abstract_narration": "Numbers are often used in important decisions about health and wealth (e.g., mortgages, health insurance, credit card debt, medical treatment options). Policy makers and others generally assume that if you provide the appropriate numbers, people will understand and use them. Previous research, however, has shown that individuals differ in how well they understand and use numbers and how much they rely on different sources of information in decision making. Individuals lower vs. higher in objective numeracy (numeric literacy) comprehend less and generally make poorer decisions when numbers are involved. This research has largely ignored two other numeric competencies: subjective numeracy and approximate number sense. In this project, the Principal Investigator will test how each of the three numeric competencies is related to decision processes and whether enhancing two of the competencies (objective numeracy and subjective numeracy) can subsequently improve judgments and choices.  This research will lead to better interventions to improve decision making about health and wealth.  \r\n\r\nIn eleven studies, the Principal Investigator will test correlational and/or causal impacts of the numeric competencies on ten decision processes identified as important to judgments and choices. The results will enhance our understanding of the correlational and causal roles of multiple numeric competencies in judgments and decisions.",
