 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study is focused on improving the understanding of the interactions between soluble iron (Fe) and organic material in fine particles in the atmosphere.  This research is relevant to the larger question of how atmospheric iron affects the processing and aging of the organics in atmospheric particulate matter.  The results will provide information useful to atmospheric chemists and to environmental health professionals.\r\n\r\nThe project will examine the importance of the Fe-assisted oxidation route of water-soluble organic carbon. It consists of three tasks: (1) field sampling, (2) characterization of the particulate matter, and (3) photochemical laboratory experiments.  The field samples will be analyzed to assess the sources of the atmospheric Fe, since the source of the Fe may determine its chemical speciation and, thus, its solubility and availability to chemical reactions.  Aqueous extracts of the field samples will be subjected to an artificial aging process and undergo analysis for oxidation state and the chemical speciation of total iron, and the production of reactive oxygen species will be quantified. By investigating the role of transition metals and taking into account aqueous chemistry, this project will offer a more complete picture of how organic compounds are \"aged\" in the atmosphere.  The results will provide useful information on the role iron plays in the processing of organic compounds in atmospheric particulate matter and the potential impacts of these mixed particles on human health.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nAirborne particulate matter (PM), specifically that PM that is smaller than 2.5 microns in diameter (PM2.5), negatively affect human health as well as impact climate.  A significant portion of the PM2.5 is organic matter that is emitted directly from combustion sources or formed in the atmosphere via oxidation of organic gases.  The organic PM2.5 ages as it moves through the atmosphere.  We explored this aging process specifically for when water is part of the mixture. Our exploration involved the use of real-world PM2.5 and simulated sunlight. The real-world PM2.5 covered varying real-world conditions.  Specifically, we collected PM2.5 during both the winter and summer in an urban area as well as in two areas downwind of urban area, 10 km and 100 km downwind.  These PM2.5 samples were analyzed for their organic characteristics and were shown to include some samples that were mostly freshly emitted PM from typical US urban sources, some that were predominantly secondary organics formed during winter conditions, some that were predominantly secondary and formed during summer conditions, and some samples that were a mixture.  In addition, we also looked at the inorganic character of the samples, specifically looking at nitrate, sulfate and iron. \n\nWe found that the simulated sunlight did affect the water-soluble organics from those PM samples, and longer aging times did cause larger effects.  This was true for all PM2.5 samples so it didn\u2019t matter if the PM2.5 was already aged or fresh emissions.  The aging can be described as photobleaching as there was reduction in light absorbance between 250-400 nm as well as a reduction in fluorescence.  Interestingly, we did see that the PM2.5 from the downwind site started with lower light absorbance, likely due to the fact that it had already been photobleached in the real atmosphere.  We looked for correlations between PM2.5 characteristics and the photobleaching processes.  We did find that OH radical formation linked to nitrate in the PM was an important factor. Also, we found that the atmospheric iron was not an important factor. \n\nIn summary, we observed that aging of water-soluble PM2.5 in sunlight reduced light absorbance regardless of the origins of the PM2.5.  This aging affect was linked to OH radical production pathway that was primarily being driven by the nitrate in the PM2.5.  The implications are that the aged PM2.5 will have smaller climate impacts than fresh PM2.5 and that the aging process might increase if we increase the nitrate levels in the PM2.5. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/06/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Michael P Hannigan"
