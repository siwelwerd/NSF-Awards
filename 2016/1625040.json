 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Trisha L Spanbauer has been granted an NSF EAR Postdoctoral Fellowship to carry out research and education plans at the University of Texas at Austin. This project seeks to assess the evolution and differentiation of microorganisms by using modern and fossil genetic material. While doing so, this study will also investigate hidden phytoplankton diversity with ancient DNA (aDNA) analysis and test the preservation of aDNA in large freshwater lakes. This interdisciplinary project combines paleontological methodology to investigate morphological changes with next-generation molecular genetics tools to explore past evolutionary changes in a recently diverged species of diatom. To engage the public in the outcomes of this project, outreach will be provided through the University of Texas at Austin's Texas Memorial Museum at special events throughout the year. The projects educational goals include free workshops for middle school teachers, learning modules for undergraduate classes, engaging undergraduates in the research, and lectures on paleoecology and paleoclimatology for upper-level undergraduate classes.\r\n\r\nThe evolution of \"Stephanodiscus yellowstonensis\" from a \"Stephanodiscus niagarae\" predecessor in Yellowstone Lake is an excellent documented case of diatom speciation.  This project will investigate the evolution of \"Stephanodiscus yellowstonensis\" through maximum likelihood modeling of the valve morphology through time, and exploring the genetic evolution through aDNA. In tandem, these analyses will elaborate on the mode and pace of both morphological and molecular evolution in diatoms. In addition, this project will use aDNA to explore hidden phytoplankton diversity in Yellowstone Lake and to determine any issues with the preservation and degradation of aDNA. The former will allow for expanded understanding of the paleoecological freshwater community during the Holocene and the latter will help to delineate the benefits and limitations of aDNA as an emergent proxy of environmental change. This transformational combination of approaches allows for the linking of microevolutionary changes to macroevolutionary outcomes. The historical framework provided by the morphological evolution will enrich the ability to interpret the aDNA of a recently diverged microorganism. Additionally, the proposed project has the potential further develop aDNA as a paleolimnological proxy and molecular evolutionary tool.",

Most species of diatoms are common globally with their locations dictated by environmental conditions. However, some diatoms are only found in single localities. One such diatom, <em>Stephanodiscus yellowstonensis, </em>has only been found in Yellowstone Lake (Wyoming, USA). It is a planktic species with disc shaped valves, and it has a known morphological evolutionary record recovered from lake sediments. Using a modeling approach, I found that the most likely mode of evolution was rapid directional change in morphology following colonization of Yellowstone Lake. At ~10,000 ybp the morphology of <em>S. yellowstonensis </em>became stable and exhibited stasis until the present. This species is part of the larger <em>Stephanodiscus niagarae </em>species complex, of which, <em>S. niagarae</em> is common across North America. Prior to our research, there were no known genetic differences in this species complex, even though there were diagnosable morphological differences. Here, I used the genome of the chloroplast to differentiate species and populations within the <em>S. niagarae </em>species complex. I found abundant informative genetic difference (polymorphisms) between <em>S. niagarae </em>populations and between <em>S. niagarae </em>and <em>S. yellowstonensis. </em>These results showed that strains of <em>S. niagarae</em> within the same lake are more similar to each other than to strains from other lakes. This is important given the 'ubiquity hypothesis', which states that if an organism is small enough it will be continually dispersed leading to migration. It appears that even given lakes in the same general area (Wyoming), each population retains a lake or region-specific chloroplast genome. In addition, I carried out sedimentary ancient DNA extraction from Yellowstone Lake sediments to better understand the non-fossilizing microbial community that was present during the Holocene. We recovered microbial communities from the last ~4,000 years that appear to be influenced by environmental change. This NSF postdoctoral fellowship was interdisciplinary, in that it combined molecular phylogenetics and paleoecology while taking advantage of emerging technologies, such as high-throughput sequencing. The fellowship resulted in two manuscripts published or in review, one NCBI BioProject to include molecular datasets and links to future publications (PRJNA557047), and several national and international presentations. Fellowship activities were focused on the training and professional development of one postdoctoral scholar, but also provided training for one graduate student, and two undergraduate students.
