The planning process includes development of an infrastructure based on best practices and research in a coordinated, effective and efficient process to reduce barriers for underrepresented minorities in STEM-related fields.    \r\n\r\nThe expected outcome of the planning process will be strong established and coordinated partnerships from high school to university to employment in STEM. The model, with its multi-tiered approach including implementation of best practice pedagogy, social and/or financial supports, will result in increased enrollment and graduation from STEM majors as well as a diversification of the STEM workforce. The partnership structure also provides for future expansion of the high school-college-industry network to improve outreach and strengthen the overall academic foundation for underrepresented minorities in STEM programs.",
