 "awd_abstract_narration": "This renewal collaborative research project supports an ongoing US-Turkey pilot program.  Investigators from the City College of New York (CCNY) in the U.S. and Istanbul Technical University (ITU) in Turkey will investigate and compare the potential for, and impacts of, using RCA in concrete in both countries. The project plan includes reciprocal visits by the U.S. and Turkish PIs to each other's laboratories as well as a six month graduate student exchange during the life of the project. The close working environment will expose individuals in both teams to very different cultural and scientific environments and foster closer relations between US and Turkish researchers. \r\n\r\nA main goal of the research project is to develop, based on scientific findings, a systematic procedure for producing reliable structural RCA concrete that will be cost-competitive with conventional NA concrete and will reduce the environmental impact of concrete production. Experimental facilities needed to study materials at the micro-scale are at CCNY while facilities for full-scale macro-scale structural testing are at ITU. Working with recycled concrete aggregate producers and manufacturers of structural concrete in these two markets will provide a unique opportunity to develop solutions across a wide spectrum of real-life conditions and constraints.",
