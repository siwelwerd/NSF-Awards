 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports graduate-student participation in the Summer Research Conference in Statistics and Biostatistics, held June 5-8, 2016 in Bentonville, Arkansas.  The meeting, part of an annual research conference series sponsored by the Southern Regional Council on Statistics, is designed to encourage the interchange and mutual understanding of research ideas in statistics and biostatistics, and to give motivation and direction to further research progress, particularly for young researchers, in a manner not ordinarily possible at other meetings. The meeting is particularly valuable for graduate students and faculty from smaller regional schools in the South. Each year, the location of the conference is chosen to be within driving distance for researchers in the southern region, thus affording them the opportunity to participate and interact closely with internationally-known leaders in the field without the cost of travel to distant venues. Speakers present formal research talks with adequate time allowed for clarification, amplification, and further informal discussions in small groups. Senior participants make themselves accessible for informal discussions of their research as well.\r\n\r\nThis year's Summer Research Conference centers on five topical areas: Measurement Error Models, Visual Analytics, Alzheimer's Disease Modeling, Survival Analysis, and Big Data Prediction Modeling.  In addition to two plenary speakers for the conference, each topical area features talks by one senior speaker and two junior speakers. A poster session for graduate students will be held on the second day. This award provides travel funding for graduate students who are making poster presentations and in need of support.  For more information, see the conference web page: \r\nwww.stat.missouri.edu/~srcos/",

The Student Poster Session includes a competition, with student posters judged by leaders in the field.  The Student Poster Session provides an excellent opportunity for the young scholars to gain experience and obtain feedback.  Awards in honor of SRCOS founders are presented that evening at the conference banquet.  A separate poster session for young faculty and isolated statisticians allows them a means of participation.\n\nThe 52nd Annual Summer Research Conference (SRC) was held June 5 &ndash; 8, 2016 in Bentonville, AR at the DoubleTree Suites hotel.  It was organized by the Southern Regional Council on Statistics (SRCOS) and co-hosted by the University of Missouri Department of Statistics and the University of Kentucky Department of Statistics.  Seventy-four scholars from institutions across the country (Michigan to Florida, the Carolinas to California) participated.  The website for the meeting is http://stat.missouri.edu/~srcos/, and it contains program details, abstracts, and photos of conference activities.\n\nThe research program was anchored by two internationally-renowned keynote speakers: Terry Therneau of the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota and Naisyin Wang from the University of Michigan.  Discussants for these keynote speakers were Richard Kryscio of the University of Kentucky and Elizabeth Slate of the Florida State University, respectively.  Eugene Huang of Emory University and Jacqueline Hughes-Oliver of North Carolina State University organized five additional stimulating invited oral sessions, each featuring one senior and two additional outstanding faculty speakers.  James Cochran of the University of Alabama gave a thought-provoking banquet talk on his experiences with Statistics Without Borders, emphasizing the difficulties of obtaining relevant data in extreme situations. \n\nThe NSF/R.L. Anderson Student Poster Session featured poster presentations from 23 graduate students, representing 15 graduate programs across the Southern Region.  Travel awards were provided by funding from the National Science Foundation, with additional support from the American Statistical Association (ASA) and SRCOS.  These awards enabled students, in many cases representing programs with limited travel budgets, to experience a significant scientific conference firsthand.  They interacted closely with leading researchers in the field in a manner that is not possible at larger national or international meetings (which would also be prohibitively expensive for many of these students to attend).   Their posters were judged by a panel selected by D?Arcy Mays of Virginia Commonwealth.  The panel of faculty judges was composed of Terry Therneau, Julia Crook (Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville), Kathy Ensor (Rice University), Arny Stromberg (Univ. of Kentucky), Huybrechts Bindele (Univ. of South Alabama), Rajan Lamichhane (Texas A&amp;M University, Kingsville), Justin Sims (Francis Marion University) and Eugene Huang (Emory University).  The M. Clinton Miller award for Best Student Poster went to Qiwei Li from Rice University.  R. L. Anderson poster awards went to Ziyi Li, Emory University (second place), and honorable mentions Gabirel Odom, Baylor University and Lei Zhang, University of Texas at Dallas.\n\nThe 2016 SRC featured the fourth annual ASA / Mike Kutner faculty poster session, with 13 contributions.  In addition to a generous contribution from Mike Kutner, funds from ASA, SRCOS and the National Institute of Statistical Sciences (NISS) Affiliates Fund helped defray the cost of attendance for these faculty participants.  NISS funds were also used by other participants from NISS member programs.\n\nThe co-chairs of the scientific program were Eugene Huang of Emory University and Jacqueline Hughes-Oliver of NC State University, together with SRCOS officers.   The faculty and student poster sessions were coordinated by Ed Boone and Qin Wang, respectively, both from Virginia Commonwealth University.   Lori Thombs from the Department of Statistics at the University of Missouri coordinated all local arrangements in Bentonville, and Arny Stromberg from the University of Kentucky provided additional administrative support.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/07/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Arnold J Stromberg"
