 "awd_abstract_narration": "The International Computer Science Institute proposes SInRGI (a Shared, Integrated Resource for Global Impact), a collaborative effort among AP\u00ae Computer Science Principles (CSP) projects that will curate and develop teaching resources for CSP's \"Global Impact\" learning objectives. As the first official CSP courses roll out in Fall 2016, teachers will be looking for creative, engaging instructional materials to cover the learning objectives detailed in its curricular framework. That framework is organized around seven Big Ideas, including Global Impact (GI). For most of the CSP Big Ideas, there is already a wide range of solid instructional materials available, but that is not yet the case for GI. At the same time, the GI learning objectives are furthest from the programming core\r\nthat has traditionally been the focus for many high-school CS teachers.\r\n\r\nThe SInRGI resource will be developed as a collaboration between the International Computer Science Institute (ICSI) and seven of the groups that have been developing content aligned to the CSP framework: The Beauty and Joy of Computing (BJC), CISS (Computing in Secondary Schools), Code.org, CS4Alabama/CSP4HS, CS Matters, Mobile CSP, and Thriving in Our Digital World: AP. Each group will each contribute materials, and then they will all work together to identify the best combination of approaches, and to create any new materials that are needed to fill gaps. This combined resource will then be distributed via the NSF-supported CS10K Community of Practice and other outreach channels. Finally the project team will work with providers of CSP professional development to\r\nincorporate the new material.",
