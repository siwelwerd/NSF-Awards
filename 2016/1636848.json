 "awd_abstract_narration": "Protecting the environment is among the biggest challenges facing our society. As the effects of environmental degradation, global warming and climate change continue to grow, there is an increasingly urgent and critical need for research and education in biological diversity, ecological modeling and environmental sustainability. On one hand, professional and citizen scientists need ready access to large-scale biological, ecological and environmental data for modeling, simulation and analysis. On the other, college teachers and students in biology and ecology need to access large-scale data in a form meaningful to them. The various audiences will engage with big data in different ways and so a variety of knowledge-building tools are needed. This project brings together two dozen scientists from a dozen institutions in academia, government and industry to address the problem of translating big data into meaningful knowledge in support of research and education in environmental sustainability.  \r\n\r\nEncyclopedia of Life  (EOL) is the world's largest database of biological species and other biodiversity information. EOL also works closely with scores of other biodiversity datasets such as BISON, GBIF, and OBIS. This project seeks to make EOL and related biodiversity data sources accessible, usable, and useful, by integrating extant artificial intelligence tools for information extraction, modeling and simulation, and question answering. The focus of this project will be on the data engineering required for this integration and construction of a resulting EOL+ system. The project team will provide access to EOL+ such that users can build their own tools and services on top of EOL+. The team will work with the NSF South Big Data Hub to organize yearly workshops for building and supporting a community of users of EOL+. Professional and citizen scientists, and teachers and students alike, will be able to access EOL+ through NSF's South Big Data Hub webportal, and use it for modeling and analysis, explanation and prediction, as well as education and workforce development in biological diversity, ecological modeling and environmental sustainability.",

The main award was supplemented by a PPSR grant engaging Colorado State University and a REU grant to Georgia Tech. The full interdisciplinary multi-institutional team including researchers from several other institutions such as IBM and the University of North Texas at Denton, Texas. Due to the COVID-19 global pandemic at the start of 2020, completion of the project was delayed until the end of 2021.</p>\n<p>The scientific goals of the project were to study (i) the cognition of college students in addressing ill-defined problems pertaining to complex biological and ecological systems and (ii) the college students' behaviors in learning about complex systems and the process of scientific thinking. The main technological goal of the project was to develop the Virtual Ecological Research Assistant (VERA), a platform leveraging artificial intelligence, machine learning, biodiversity knowledge, and other computational tools to support our target users in studying biological or ecological systems through iterative modeling and simulation. Our target user is an interested learner without advanced training in simulation modeling or the biological system of interest, for example, an undergraduate student, a middle school or high school teacher, a citizen scientist or a natural resource management professional.</p>\n<p>VERA enables a user to easily build conceptual models of ecological phenomena as well as develop agent-based simulations of the phenomena to validate the conceptual models. One of the major innovations in VERA is that an AI agent automatically compiles the agent-based simulations from the conceptual models, thereby absolving the user of the responsibility. Thus, a user can conduct ?What-If? experiments, observe the simulation results graphically, and revise the conceptual model if needed.&nbsp; Thus, VERA supports the user through the whole process of model construction, evaluation, and revision.</p>\n<p>As part of the project, we created VERA's artificial intelligence and interactive technologies for modeling and simulation of ecological systems and provided the user access to biodiversity knowledge in Encyclopedia of Life (EOL) as and when needed in the context of his/her work with VERA. VERA is web accessible. Indeed, VERA is freely available at vera.cc.gatech.edu. In a major development, the 1 million users of EOL each year too can directly access VERA through the EOL website (eol.org). In another development funded by the PPSR grant, VERA is also accessible through citsci.org maintained by the Colorado State University.</p>\n<p>We introduced VERA in several undergraduate biology classes at Georgia Tech, analyzed the data, and built information-processing models of students' cognition and learning. Given that VERA is now available through EOL for general use, Georgia Tech has also analyzed the data collected on self-directed learning from the use of VERA. We found that VERA helps biology undergraduate students acquire knowledge of ecological systems. In particular, we found that VERA?s just-in-demand contextualized access to EOL?s large biodiversity knowledge helps students with information about biotic components in the conceptual models as well as with estimation of parameter values of the agent-based simulations. We also found that students who received minimal guidance in using VERA generated more varied and complex models of the<br /> given ecological phenomena.</p>\n<p>In regard to self-directed learning using VERA through EOL, we found that learners manifest three types of modeling behaviors: observation (simulation focused), construction (construction focused), and full exploration (model construction, evaluation and revision). While observation was the most common behavior among all learners, construction without evaluation was more common for less engaged learners and full exploration occurred mostly for more engaged learners. Learners who explored the full cycle of model construction, evaluation and revision generated models of higher quality.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;This project has helped train more than a dozen doctoral, masters, and undergraduate students at Georgia Tech, Colorado State University, and University of Tennessee at Chattanooga. Ph.D. student Sungeun An is writing her doctoral dissertation at Georgia Tech based on this work. In addition, a few dozen citizen scientists, a few hundred undergraduate and graduate students at Georgia Tech, and few thousand users across the world have benefited from using VERA.</p>\n<p>This project has resulted in more than half dozen publications. We have also created a series of ten short YouTube videos on the scientific process supported by VERA (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn5e9fWmPqI&amp;list=PLwXogtSxXaLCP4AXU_VFUP92TVmotGLMv\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn5e9fWmPqI&amp;list=PLwXogtSxXaLCP4AXU_VFUP92TVmotGLMv</a>).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 06/20/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Ashok&nbsp;K&nbsp;Goel</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1636848/1636848_10451846_1655778853865_ScreenShot2022-06-20at10.31.25PM--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1636848/1636848_10451846_1655778853865_ScreenShot2022-06-20at10.31.25PM--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"VERA models ecological phenomena\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1636848/1636848_10451846_1655778853865_ScreenShot2022-06-20at10.31.25PM--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"VERA models ecological phenomena\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">VERA was developed by Georgia Tech's Design & Intelligence Laboratory in collaboration with Smithsonian's Institution's Encyclopedia of Life</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Ashok Goel</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Ashok&nbsp;K&nbsp;Goel</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">VERA models ecological phenomena</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1636848/1636848_10451846_1655778374836_ScreenShot2022-06-20at10.22.35PM--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1636848/1636848_10451846_1655778374836_ScreenShot2022-06-20at10.22.35PM--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"VERA videos\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1636848/1636848_10451846_1655778374836_ScreenShot2022-06-20at10.22.35PM--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"VERA videos\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Ten videos on scientific modeling using VERA available on YouTube</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Sungeun An</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Ashok&nbsp;K&nbsp;Goel</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">VERA videos</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1636848/1636848_10451846_1655778575861_ScreenShot2022-06-20at10.27.25PM--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1636848/1636848_10451846_1655778575861_ScreenShot2022-06-20at10.27.25PM--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Accessing VERA through EOL\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1636848/1636848_10451846_1655778575861_ScreenShot2022-06-20at10.27.25PM--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Accessing VERA through EOL\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">VERA can now be accessed directly through Smithsonian Institution's Encyclopedia of Life (eol.org)</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Ashok Goel</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Ashok&nbsp;K&nbsp;Goel</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Accessing VERA through EOL</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1636848/1636848_10451846_1655778220931_ScreenShot2022-06-20at10.20.28PM--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1636848/1636848_10451846_1655778220931_ScreenShot2022-06-20at10.20.28PM--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Modeling using VERA\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1636848/1636848_10451846_1655778220931_ScreenShot2022-06-20at10.20.28PM--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Modeling using VERA\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">An example of a conceptual model created by a learner using VERA.
