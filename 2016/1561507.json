The shortage of engineers in the US weakens the country's position as a leader in the global market and restricts our capacity to solve infrastructural challenges.  This project involves research in four countries (Jordan, Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, and Tunisia) to assess the contextual factors that encourage women's participation in engineering in tertiary education and as a career. In three of the four countries identified (Jordan, Malaysia, and Tunisia), women's participation in engineering is much higher than in the US, despite social, political, and economic restrictions on women's participation in public life.  In the fourth country (Saudi Arabia), women's engineering participation is also on the rise. This project seeks to understand the links between cultural context and expanding women's STEM participation by studying the drivers of women's participation in these contexts. The research is significant because it promises to document factors that encourage women's successful participation in STEM in social, political, and cultural contexts that are very different from the US. These explorations of women's success, in turn, promise to shed light more generally on how context shapes women's participation in STEM in ways that inform our efforts to broaden participation in the US.\r\n\r\nTechnical Abstract\r\nWomen's participation is engineering is a crucial national priority.  The shortage of engineers in the US weakens the country's position as a leader in the global market and restricts our capacity to solve infrastructural challenges. This project entails conducting research in four countries (Jordan, Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, and Tunisia) to assess the contextual factors that encourage women's participation in engineering in tertiary education and as a career.

In the fourth country (Saudi Arabia), women's engineering participation is also rising. This project seeks to understand the links between cultural context and expanding women's STEM participation by studying the economic, educational, socio-cultural, legal, and political drivers of women's participation in these contexts.  This project will apply case study methods to collect rich data from focus groups and in-depth interviews in each country with female engineering undergraduate students, faculty members, and practicing engineers (total N=208-325). The research is significant because it promises to document factors that encourage women's successful participation in STEM in social, political, and cultural contexts that are very different from the US. With its cross-national, in-depth exploration of women's curricular and career choices and its attention to mechanisms producing gender-differentiated curricular and career decisions, this project promises to shed light more generally on how context shapes women's successful participation in STEM in ways that inform our efforts to broaden participation in the US.\r\n",

We worked with women in three predominately Muslim Countries (PMCS) &ndash; Jordan, Malaysia, and Tunisia &ndash; first to develop a thoughtful set of focus group interview questions. These protocols are available in multiple languages as open-access resources on our project website (womeninengineeringpmcs.org). We studied the individual, social, and conditions that shaped women&rsquo;s choices to enter and continue in engineering degree programs, university instruction, or industry/government jobs. In total, we conducted focus groups with 168 women across the three countries &ndash; in sessions that took approximately 3900 minutes of recorded time. We used the Constant Comparative method and a multi-site case study approach to transcribe and translate when necessary, code, categorize, identify themes, and member check the responses across the three most prestigious public higher education institutions in three countries (ENIT in Tunisia, UTM in Malaysia, and JUST in Jordan) and the three embedded units of analysis (students, faculty, practicing engineers). We generated organized category books that describe the categories, clusters of categories (sub-themes), and themes that capture the engineering-related experiences of women in each of the 9 EUA/case units. We include example refined category books as open access resources. In so doing, we generated a broad taxonomy of our findings, with three overarching themes Application of these themes will inform theory in sociology and engineering education about the significant role that gender plays in relation to engineering involvement in places where there is high women&rsquo;s participation. Our findings will also inform broader impacts for women&rsquo;s engagement in the USA by suggesting previously understudied areas for research and practice whose goal it is to increase women&rsquo;s engineering participation in the USA. First, we find that women in these PMCS demonstrate high self-efficacy in engineering, or confidence in their abilities to &ldquo;do&rdquo; engineering, that is not at odds with the ways that they think about themselves as women and as engineers. For women in the PMCS, the identities of being a woman and being an engineer can co-exist in ways that are challenging for women in the USA. Second, curricular structures shape opportunities for women, including early opportunities for STEM learning, in ways that support early trajectories and success towards an engineering path. Third, family plays an important supportive role, including and often through the roles of male parents and partners, in facilitating and encouraging women&rsquo;s choice and ongoing pursuit of engineering. These findings suggest new ways of thinking about broadening women&rsquo;s participation in engineering in the USA. Specifically, our emergent themes will influence future work on women engineering student recruitment and retention, women faculty support, and recruitment and retention in engineering industry in the USA. We have shared our outcomes through 6 conference papers and 8 invited presentations. Our final project output is an overall manuscript that describes our cross-cutting findings and is under preparation for submission to a widely read journal.
