 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Wyoming will host a summer REU (Research Experiences for Undergraduates) site in Astronomy. Each summer, eight students will work together on the same research project, mentored by the entire astronomy faculty.  In addition to the research experience, this will promote teamwork, leadership, and peer teaching skills.  They will also attend presentations or short courses on research techniques and results, preparing for graduate school, writing and speaking in science, exploring ethical issues in science.  Students will develop broadly-applicable skills in computer programming and image analysis.  This program will benefit society by enhancing the education of undergraduates through research and professional development programs and by extending these opportunities to students from institutions otherwise unable to offer such experiences.  Recruiting will focus on students with little to no research experience, mainly freshmen and sophomores from liberal arts colleges and smaller public institutions, including community colleges. \r\n\r\nStudents will have full access to the 2.3-meter and the 0.6-meter telescopes. The specific project and lead faculty member will rotate each summer.  Other faculty will play supporting roles and conduct professional development programs for the students.   REU students will have an opportunity to gain valuable outreach experience by assisting with AstroCamp, a 10-day residence camp for middle-school students.",
