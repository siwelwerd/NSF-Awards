The PI and Co-I plan to give public talks on topics related to the science of this proposal, and will develop an interactive GigaPan panoramic imaging program for the public with simulation data and Sloan Digital Sky Survey images.  Broader impacts of the work also include training of graduate students.\r\n\r\nThe investigators will compare state-of-the-art simulations with observational data on the quasar luminosity function and correlation function. This information will be used to estimate cosmological parameters such as primordial non-Gaussianity and normalized growth rate of structure based on the quasar correlation functions.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nTo unlock the elusive 95\\% of the Universe in the form of dark matter and dark energy, cosmologists look to precision measurements from space-based telescopes like the James Webb Space Telescope, and use the largest galaxy surveys with hundreds of millions of galaxies to infer the Universe?s composition and growth. With many aspects of the cosmological standard model that remain deeply mysterious, cosmology requires theoretical efforts to continue to push the boundaries of the field.\n\nSome of the  most extreme events in the Universe are also yet to be explained.  How black holes (BHs) form, mathematically the simplest and yet through their effects the most complex objects, responsible for some of the most energetic events in our universe, and how they become some of the fundamental players  in our Universe are not yet understood.\n\nIn this program, we have developped some the most sophisticated cosmological simulations, physics-based models that start from the smooth initial conditions constrained through the observations of the cosmic microwave background to issue predictions for the galaxy and black hole population at different epochs of the Universe.\n\nThis project has also established a framework that takes advantage of the opportunities  of data-driven ML approaches and applies them to our direct cosmological simulation data.  We have accelerated the process of producing suites of physics-based, traditional cosmological simulations, using AI/ML to tackle the biggest  bottleneck, and the most expensive computational cost,  We have demonstrated that ML  offers the promise of efficiently and accurately representing the high-dimensional parameters of the cosmological models.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/21/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Tiziana Di Matteo"
