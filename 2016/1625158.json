 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Alexander B. Michaud has been granted an NSF EAR Postdoctoral Fellowship to carry out research and education plans at the Center for Geomicrobiology at Aarhus University in Denmark and Stony Brook University in New York.  Dr. Michaud will investigate the role of Arctic fjords as a source or sink of iron and manganese to the Arctic shelf environment under current and future climatic conditions. Sediment cores from the fjords of Svalbard (an archipelago in the Arctic Ocean, between Norway and the North Pole) will be used to measure rates of metal and sulfate reduction and to analyze aqueous and solid-phase geochemistry. The investigation will link data on active microbial populations with biogeochemical rates in Arctic fjord sediments, integrating multiple disciplines (geomicrobiology, geochemistry, glaciology, oceanography and geology). In addition to research, Dr. Michaud will develop interactive, standards-based Earth and life science lesson plans based on Arctic biogeochemistry and glaciology. This lesson plans will be used at Hardin High School, a rural school in southwestern Montana with high enrollment of Native American students. Dr. Michaud will interact with the students via Skype. \r\n\r\nThe fjords of Western Svalbard are a biogeochemically active interface between the subglacial and shelf environments. The rates and interactions between microbially mediated Fe, Mn and S cycles within the fjord sediments ultimately influence the concentrations of metals exported to the shelf environment. The impact of increased organic carbon input to the sediments on biogeochemical cycles will be assessed by RNA stable isotope probing which labels the active microorganisms. These experiments will allow the rates of Fe, Mn and S transformations in fjord sediments to be linked with the active microbial populations. The investigation will integrate geobiological and geochemical methods to understand how terrestrial subglacial processes influence microbial communities in permanently cold (<5\u00b0C) marine sediments. \r\n\r\nThis award was supported with funding from the Office of International Science & Engineering.",

The extent of glaciers is decreasing quickly, especially in the Arctic. Many times we think of decreasing ice in the Arctic impacting polar bears and other animals, but shrinking glaciers also impact the microorganisms that keep our planet healthy by cycling elements and nutrients. In fact, microorganisms commonly live on, in, beneath, and around glaciers. As glaciers change, it will impact the microbial inhabitants. Arctic fjord sediments are strongly impacted by the glaciers flowing into the fjords. Microorganisms are particularly important in these fjord sediments because they cycle nutrients and elements from the glaciers and provide them to the phytoplankton in the marine environment, which form the base of the marine food web. The microorganisms in the fjord sediments are crucially important to transforming carbon, iron, and sulfur. My project studied how runoff from melting glaciers impacted these microorganisms and how they cycled elements in the fjord sediments. We hypothesized that melting glaciers change where and how microorganisms cycle these important elements, like iron. The results of our field studies and experiments show that the amount of glacial influence in a fjord does impact the microorganisms and how they cycle elements. The amount of glacial influence actually changes the community of microorganisms present and the function of that community. Different microbial communities can perform different functions, similar to how different communities of people within the United States provide different services for the rest of the United States and world (e.g., compare the function of a coastal Maine town providing lobsters by lobster fishing to a car manufacturing center like Detroit). As glaciers shrink, their influence on the sediment decreases, the sediments become more similar in the microbial communities and biogeochemical conditions present in temperate latitude marine shelf sediments. In temperate latitude marine shelf sediments, away from the influence of glaciers, Fe and S are preferentially buried, whereas in glacially-influenced fjord sediments, Fe is more likely to be cycled back to the water column. Thus, glacially-influenced fjord sediments contain the microorganisms and geochemistry to provide more of the raw materials essential for phytoplankton. These fjord sediments may be a larger source of Fe to marine waters than previous considered.</p>\n<p>The knowledge gained from this project and the experiences of conducting polar research were passed on to K-12 students through several classroom lectures (~250 students), undergraduate students by guest lectures (~50 students), the general public (~50 people) through a public lecture at an art gallery opening, and to other scientists through peer-reviewed publications (4) and conference presentations (6). In conclusion, my project helps to show that changing glaciers impact not only the large animals we see, but also the unseen microorganisms that are vital to our planet.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 08/26/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Alexander&nbsp;B&nbsp;Michaud</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1625158/1625158_10444743_1566829349977_IMG_2006--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1625158/1625158_10444743_1566829349977_IMG_2006--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Dicksonfjorden sediment core transect\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1625158/1625158_10444743_1566829349977_IMG_2006--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Dicksonfjorden sediment core transect\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Sediment core transect from Dicksonfjorden, Svalbard.
