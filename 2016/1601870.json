Organized by the African-MRS with strong support of the Materials Research Society (MRS), the heart of the Conference is to build knowledge, foster relationships and promote action to further the knowledge and understanding in the broad fields associated with materials science and technology. Central aspects of the conference include increasing the scope, involvement and capabilities of Africa's materials research community, and to link it more closely with it's US and other non-African counterparts. Although Africa is rich in materials resources, it has not taken appropriate advantage of its resources to develop its regional economies to their fullest potential. The growth of science, technology and education are recognized as essential components of the economic and social development of Africa. With an eye toward increasing understanding and awareness of how materials impact development, a key goal of the Conference is to bring together leading scientists from around the world to interact with leading African researchers.  Another key goal is capacity building, part of which involves helping educate the next generation of African scholars and technologists. The conference will also inform US and other non-African participants about the current state of materials science and education in Africa, including research needs and opportunities for development and collaboration. Bringing African students, African academic and industrial leaders, and internationally acclaimed scientists together with students from the United States, Europe, Asia and South America offers a unique opportunity to promote information and resource sharing. Participation by governmental and non-governmental organizations will ensure that the materials topics discussed will be addressed by wider audiences following the Conference.  The conference will include a special session on women in science and engineering, led by the US-based COACh group. \r\n\r\nTechnical Abstract\r\nThe African-MRS Conference will play a vital role to help unify the rapidly growing materials research community in Africa, and help couple it to the broader materials research world outside of Africa. Themes of the Conference reflect both needs of the global research community such as energy and health, as well as needs specific to Africa such as appropriate construction materials and sustainable biomaterials. The primary themes of the Conference are Energy and Sustainability, Health and the Environment, Basic Nanoscience, Computational Materials Science, Manufacturing and Innovation, Infrastructure, Education, Petrochemistry, Mining, and Agricultural Materials and Chemistry. The Conference adds unique value by bringing together leading international scientists and engineers to present and discuss recent advances in several broad areas of materials research and to help define future research priorities. The African-MRS, and the Conference in particular, is deeply committed to education and capacity building, and provides a unique platform for students to directly interact with each other as well as with national and international leaders.",
