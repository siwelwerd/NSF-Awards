 "awd_abstract_narration": "Due to fast-paced technological advances and competitive global economy, engineering education in the US must impart competencies and skills at all cognitive levels to an increasingly diverse population. Educators must not only strive to enhance learning in engineering and the preparedness of our graduates, but also strive to diversify the engineering workforce. This project, housed at a Hispanic-Serving Institution, draws on a population of first-generation, academically-disadvantaged, and economically-disadvantaged students to explore the relationships of metacognition practices on learning and retention. It is known that many freshmen students do not fully comprehend the importance of effective strategies for college and lifelong learning. The proposed research will develop and study growth in metacognitive self-awareness, and self-study strategies of freshmen engineering students in the College of Engineering at New Mexico State University. This project has the potential to positively impact student retention in engineering, especially with many under-represented populations, through the investigation and dissemination of effective metacognitive practices.\r\n\r\nThe goal of the proposed research program is to enhance student academic performance and improve retention in engineering. The objectives are to (1) investigate and implement metacognitive strategies and study practices leading to increased learning and critical thinking, (2) Investigate the impacts of metacognitive study practices engineering student retention, and (3) disseminate and provide awareness of such strategies among engineering faculty. The project will involve activities such as: (a) the use of a Metacognition Awareness Inventory (MAI) and study practices self-assessment survey, (b) employment of instructional content and tools to support freshman engineering students with understanding fundamentals of metacognition, (c) investigation of correlations between metacognitive strategies and academic achievement, (d) evaluation of instruments and interventions for validity and reliability using quantitative and qualitative research methods, and (e) provision of annual faculty development workshops on metacognitive practices. Findings on the relationships among student study practices, learning performance, retention and metacognition in engineering, as well as validated instruments will be of value to STEM education in general.",
