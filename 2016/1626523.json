 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation Program (MRI) and support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program (CRIF), Professor Adam Mosey from Lake Superior State University and colleagues R. Marshall Werner, Steven Johnson and Martha Hutchens have acquired a 400 MHz NMR spectrometer. This spectrometer allows research in a variety of fields such as those that accelerate chemical reactions of significant economic importance, as well as the study of biologically relevant species. In general, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the study of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution or in the solid state.  The results from these NMR studies have an impact in synthetic organic/inorganic chemistry, materials chemistry, forensics and biochemistry. This instrument is an integral part of teaching as well as research performed by undergraduate students via independent student research and traditional academic coursework as well as researchers and students from the Bay Mills Tribal Community College that has a large Native American enrollment.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe award is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels, especially in areas such as (a) characterizing the products and mechanism of an enantioselective imadazoline annulation reaction; (b) characterizing Evans-based chiral auxiliary enolates and their resulting aldol reaction products; (c) investigating the anti-microbial properties of 3,4-dihydroquinazolines and (d) exploring the forensic chemistry of compounds, and (e) preparing isotopically-labeled synthetic cannabinoids.",
