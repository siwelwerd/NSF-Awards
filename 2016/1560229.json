 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research Undergraduate Experience (REU) program provides students the opportunity to perform interdisciplinary research in WPI's Department of Computer Science and in particular in the Data Science program focusing on societal challenges in cyber security, healthcare, and sustainability - all interlinked concerns of critical national importance. Cities in the 21st century, including the City of Worcester and its surrounding communities, are plagued by many urban challenges from pollution to traffic congestion.  This project will drive the vision of empowering citizens and organizations by supporting data-driven policy making. We will provide a unique educational research experience for undergraduate students from under-represented groups by exposing them to projects through which they tackle critical societal challenges via data science. By giving students the opportunity to apply their education toward improving the quality of life for individuals in their community, we will show them the power of data science in the real world. This will pique their interest in pursuing further education in this important STEM discipline, thus contributing to the STEM workforce and the US economic prosperity.\r\n \r\n\r\nThere are limited undergraduate research opportunities in Data Science despite its recognition as a critical STEM skill set criteria. The goal of our REU program is to fill this gap by engaging underrepresented undergraduate students in data science research in solving the most critical problems faced by our communities: from cyber-security and safety analytics, to data-driven healthcare, and sustainability. REU participants will work in interdisciplinary research teams, mentored by WPI faculty advisors and graduate students, and have ownership of a project for the duration of their summer.  The students will learn about and apply data science techniques from data mining, data bases, machine learning, statistical learning, to business intelligence. To supplement the educational and research skill development of students, a weekly seminar series on professional development covering topics such as research inquiry, data interpretation and visualization, scientific writing, communication skills, to career opportunities afforded by data science will be held.  At the conclusion of the program, students will present their results via an oral presentation in a conference-like format.  By empowering students to solve pressing problems in their communities via data science, students will be compelled to seek advanced degrees and promising careers in data science.",

Our REU site has made WPI's unique research and mentorship resources available to students who would otherwise not have access to such research opportunities. REU participants have performed interdisciplinary research at WPI's Department of Computer Science (CS), particularly in the Data Science program, focusing on societal challenges in areas critical to assuring the health and wellbeing of our increasingly connected communities.</p>\n<p><strong>Research Impact and Intellectual Merits. </strong>This project contributed intellectually by training students to design innovative data science solutions essential for data-driven smart communities. Innovations in the data science from machine learning to big data processing are one of the most important enablers to tackle critical challenges facing our digital communities. Working in an interdisciplinary team, students at the WPI REU site integrated mathematics, statistics, and computer science towards improving the state-of-art in data mining, machine learning, statistical analysis, prediction, and modeling. An impressive outcome of this project is that our REU students have co-authored 16 research papers and posters published in diverse scientific conferences -- a major success for all our participants for their first time contributing to scientific advances.</p>\n<p><strong>Regional and Economic Impact: </strong>This REU site has had a broad impact from the national level to the professional lives of the REU participants. Nationally, our project contributed to sustaining our community's innovation-based economy by training students to acquire data science skills desperately needed throughout the full spectrum of national, and even international institutions. &nbsp;Regionally, our research partnership with the city of Worcester positively has impacted the city's digital infrastructure, creating a safer, smarter, and more sustainable community for all residents.</p>\n<p><strong>Student Impact: </strong>It is well known that students with access to undergraduate research opportunities are more likely to remain in the STEM profession. The REU site has provided students with access to vibrant scientific research projects and undergraduate mentorship at which WPI excels. Participants in the WPI REU site have researched the fundamental scientific principles governing analytics in impactful projects. Comprehensive support for the REU participants from close research mentoring to professional development was provided. Students have had the opportunity to network with professionals at various industry network events, thereby encouraging them to pursue Data Science in their careers. Thus, the professional lives of the REU participants have been enriched, as the program has encouraged students to more seriously consider graduate studies and/or advanced degrees in STEM fields. Several students took up internships in the STEM companies we visited through our REU field trips the subsequent summer.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Impact on Diversity and URM Representation</strong>. &nbsp;This site has aimed to boost retention of URM members, especially of Hispanic, African American, female students and members of other under-represented groups in STEM professions by inviting students to become part of a thriving research community for a summer, while also observing a variety of different STEM pathways. &nbsp;Within these three years from summer 2016 to 2018, 783 students have applied to our REU program. More than 40% of the applicants were female; showing robust interest from female students. 28.35% of the applicants were URM members, including African American, Hispanic, Latino, Native American, and Pacific Islander. Among 783 applicants, 30 highly qualified students (10 each year) were chosen to join our summer program. Of these 30 students, 15 were female; of the 15 males, two were African American and one Hispanic. Thus, 18 of our 30 REU students (60%) were underrepresented in STEM, i.e., female, African American or Hispanic. Students were recruited from local institutions as well as national level universities to assure geographic diversity, with our 30 students coming from 27 institutions spread across 13 distinct states. &nbsp;We offered the participants professional development activities to facilitate future entry into rewarding professional careers. Our program improved their communication skills, professional networking skills, broadened their knowledge base, helped them become self-directed researchers, and encouraged students to better find their interest and more seriously consider graduate studies. In an exit survey, the vast majority of participants indicated that our site met or exceeded their expectation both professionally and personally.</p>\n<p>In summary, this DS REU Site has addressed a critical need to give talented students, including female and URM, the opportunity to engage in state-of-the-art research in a STEM field of great importance and with the potential for discovering future leadership career opportunities.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 06/30/2020<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Elke&nbsp;A&nbsp;Rundensteiner</p>\n</div>\n<div
