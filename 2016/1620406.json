 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computational fluid dynamics has emerged as a powerful tool to study the physiopathology of the cardiovascular system and for patient-specific Surgical Planning (SP) for cardiovascular diseases. Recently, clinical trials - the standard procedure for understanding diseases and assessing the impact of therapies and devices in the clinical practice - have been supported by a massive use  of numerical simulations to improve the knowledge extracted from measured data, leading to Computer Aided Clinical Trials (CACT). For a large variety of pathologies involving the aorta - the major artery of the circulation - this requires to work with turbulent flows. While Direct Numerical Simulation in this context can be appropriate for a proof of concept, for the large number of patients involved in CACT and SP we need different numerical tools to provide the appropriate trade-off between accuracy and reliability needed by clinical applications and computational efficiency needed by tight deadlines. As CACT and SP are new emerging concepts in cardiovascular mathematics, an appropriate numerical modeling of turbulent physiological flows for clinical applications is now an unmet need that we intend to solve in this proposal.\r\n\r\nA possible way to limit the computational costs associated with Direct Numerical Simulations without sacrificing accuracy is to solve the flow average and model properly the effects of the small scales (not directly solved) at the medium and large scales (solved). We intend to investigate carefully new cutting-edge methods for disturbed flows based on Large Eddy Simulation (LES) Deconvolution filtering techniques with the ultimate goal of enabling practical use of numerical tools to improve knowledge extraction and clinical practice through CACT and SP. The main objective of this research is the development and the analysis of a robust and accurate LES based approach requiring no or minimal user's set-up for realistic incompressible flow problems with application to computational hemodynamics. We articulate the project in the following points: (a) Sensitivity analysis of key parameters involved in the method to understand their impact on the solution, leading to an automated parameter set-up through physical and numerical arguments. (b) Development and analysis of high-order in time methods, particularly for the computation of the pressure, with consequent improvement of the mass conservation properties. (c) Analysis of the impact of our LES approach on non-Dirichlet boundary conditions and the possible backflow stabilizing effects.  We plan to test the method on both academic and real bioengineering problems. Finally, we plan to deliver a finite element open source library incorporating the findings of our research, available for CACT and SP.",

For instance, some <em>cardiovascular diseases</em> lead to the formation of turbulent patterns in the blood flow. Understanding these patterns can significantly benefit from reliable numerical solvers. However, the mathematics behind modeling and solving turbulent fluids is not trivial. A sentence attributed to the famous physicist Heisenberg (who introduced the Indetermination Principle in Physics) says, \"<em>When I meet God, I am going to ask him two questions: Why relativity?

These methods combine different ideas that go under the name of \"deconvolution operators\" and \"Evolve-Filter-Relax\" schemes. These schemes are pretty complicated and feature several parameters to be tuned for the best performances. In this project, we <em>(i)</em> analyze theoretical aspects of these schemes, <em>(ii)</em> elucidate the features of the method and <em>(iii)</em> discuss the choice of the parameters, <em>(iv)</em> optimize its implementation, and <em>(v)</em> apply it to problems of interest in thoracic surgery.</p>\n<p>The <em>solvers were developed in C++ and Python</em> (available in an online repository).</p>\n<p>The reference application is a severe pathology of the circulatory system called <em>Type B Aortic Dissection</em>. This is a dangerous condition where an abnormal pocket (called \"false lumen\") in the aorta undermines the functionality of the system and put the patient in danger of hemorrhage. When a patient presents to doctors with a dissection, doctors have to decide whether using drugs or performing surgery. This decision is based now on a morphological analysis of the false lumen (size and position). However, the prediction is often inaccurate. A significant advancement would be the addition of information relative to the blood flow in the false lumen. We applied our numerical methods to provide an efficient and accurate representation of a patient-specific case, elucidating the interplay between the morphological features and the hemodynamic conditions. The latter cannot be quantified by imaging tools, while they can be reconstructed by solving the differential equations describing the hemodynamics. <em>Our method demonstrated to be a reliable tool to support clinical activity and the decision-making process of doctors</em>.
