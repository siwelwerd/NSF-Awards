 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project addresses a need to educate more information assurance/cyber defense (IA/CD) professionals to counteract the growing risk of cyber-attacks. The project does so by developing and implementing an IA/CD after-school program for high school students and assessing its effectiveness as a launchpad for IA/CD careers. The program goals are to raise awareness of high school students about IA/CD careers; generate their interest in those careers; and solidify and enhance the preparation of participating students to pursue the education required to succeed in one of those careers. Once fully implemented, the program will annually enroll up to 50 students from five local rural high schools. Because of high demand for IA/CD specialists, those who continue on to complete the degree program will be able to secure well-paying jobs, which will have economic impact not only on them, but also on their families and communities.  The program will also train teachers in participating schools to become more knowledgeable and aware of information security issues. The teachers will pass this knowledge on to their students and families, thereby improving information security among the general public.\r\n\r\nThe project will advance both knowledge and education in the field of cybersecurity by examining the conditions that impact high school students' decisions to pursue IA/CD careers and their success in an academic program that leads to these careers. The evaluation will also examine the project's ability to attract students underrepresented in the profession-female, first-generation, and low-income students. The rigorous evaluation plan will gauge the effectiveness of specific components, particularly the modular after-school academic program, the hands-on cyber competitions, Penn College student mentoring and coaching provided by professionals in the field. By documenting all project elements, publishing and presenting program results and lessons learned, and making program information available on the project website and via seminars and webinars, the Project Team will make this model available to institutions interested in replicating or adapting it. The specific objectives of the project are to: (1) develop an after-school college credit-bearing program in IA/CD for high school students; (2) provide the after-school program to 8-10 students in Year 1, 24-30 students in Year 2, and 40-50 students in Year 3; and (3) research the impact of the proposed model on students' educational and career choices/paths.",
