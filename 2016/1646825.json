The topics discussed are comprehensive and address the major needs and questions necessary to realize the envisioned benefits of plastid biotechnology. The meeting will host graduate students, postdoctoral scientists and junior academics together with an international cadre of leading experts in the field. The emphasis on sharing previously unpublished information enables the cultivation of innovative approaches to address the most important challenges facing the field.\r\n\r\nPlastid engineering is driven by the expectation that plastid transgene expression precludes transgene flow vial pollen, because the inheritance of the transgene is limited to maternal parent.  The conference will be focused on topics such as: (1) expression of recombinant proteins for industrial and pharmaceutical applications; (2) engineering the plastid genome to improve photosynthetic efficiency and plant productivity; (3) engineering novel metabolic pathways and structures into chloroplasts; (4) engineering novel agronomic traits into chloroplasts for gene stacking and transgene containment.",
