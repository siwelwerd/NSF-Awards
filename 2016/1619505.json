 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to improve our understanding of avalanches in a plasma, a cloud of ionized gas, that is permeated by a magnetic field.  Avalanches are sudden events that cause major changes over an extended region of a physical system. Although the concept is commonly associated with catastrophic \"snow avalanches\", the general phenomenon occurs widely in both natural and artificial systems. A typical driver and source of energy for an avalanche is a sharp change in one of the parameters that describes the underlying system.  This project is a synergistic experimental and theoretical study of avalanches triggered by a steep slope in plasma temperature and density across a magnetic field.  This is a situation widely encountered in natural plasmas, such as in magnetic field structures on the Sun and around the Earth, and has to be accounted for in any design of a magnetic fusion device. The project will involve a graduate student who will gain a unique perspective on modern experimental techniques and will also participate in theoretical and numerical modeling work.\r\n\r\nTo date, the majority of experimental information about avalanche transport in a magnetized plasma has been obtained in devices designed for fusion studies. However, due to the complexity of these devices, it has proven difficult to unravel the underlying physical mechanisms of the process. This project aims to significantly expand the experimental knowledge base by exploring the behavior of a well-defined plasma configuration that exhibits repeatable, controllable avalanche events.  The data obtained in the experiments will provide quantitative information about the role of self-organized criticality dynamics, the formation and evolution of streamers, the effect of flows and flow shear, and the manifestation of nonlocal transport of both temperature and density. These topics are at the frontier of plasma science and are the subject of numerous ongoing theoretical and computational studies.",

Although the concept is commonly associated with catastrophic snow avalanches, the general phenomena occurs widely in nature and in devices built by humans. Avalanches result from steep gradients in the parameters of the system. Often, there is a threshold value for the gradient; when it is exceeded, a complex sequence of processes is triggered that relaxes the gradient below the threshold value. In several environments, such as in an externally heated or fueled plasma, the sources of mass and energy can reestablish the gradient and further cause it to exceed the threshold value. A sequence of avalanches can then occur, but the actual time of appearance of an individual event displays a degree of unpredictability. The behavior is intermittent and causes the parameters of the system to evolve from place to place, i.e., there is an associated transport of energy and mass that occurs. It is this type of phenomena that has been studied in this project.</p>\n<p>Significant progress in the study of avalanches by the geosciences community has resulted from&nbsp; a concerted effort to compare theoretical models with data obtained in controlled laboratory experiments.

A key new element found is that magnetized plasmas support flows across the direction of avalanche progress. To understand these flows a new model for thermionic injection into a magnetized plasma was developed.
