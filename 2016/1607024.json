 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cells live in a world full of motion and physical strain, and therefore they must have mechanisms to react to these stresses.  One platform cells use to sense and respond to stretch is the cytoskeleton.  This meshwork of multiple different proteins gives a cell its shape, yet is constructed in a way that allows flexibility and motion.  This research is focused on the role that the cytoskeletal protein obscurin plays in stretch response and recognition.  Obscurin acts like a tether, connecting far-away segments of the cell to each other.  Due to its shape, obscurin has the capacity to expand and contract.  There are two possibilities of how obscurin could move like this.  Obscurin could behave like a rope, and only resist stretch when significantly elongated, or obscurin could behave like a spring, and resist an ever-increasing amount of force as it is stretched.  Obscurin also can propagate biochemical signals, and there is circumstantial evidence that this function could be activated by stretch.  The PI will test both facets of obscurin function - stretch response and signaling.  Together, these studies will provide insight into how cells passively and actively respond to physical stretch. This work will be conducted primarily by undergraduate students, in an effort to train the next generation of scientists.  The data accrued here will be incorporated into a free education website, where others who do not have access to significant research support can also learn the technical skills of how to do this kind of research.  Additionally, the PI will develop a scientific ethics curriculum for undergraduates.\r\n \r\nSpecifically, the investigator will study how obscurin reacts to physical stretch using both cellular and in vitro models.  Obscurin is composed of multiple stand-alone domains.  Many of these individual domains have been characterized extensively.  In Aim 1, the PI will characterize how these domains act in groups of two or three.   Using protein NMR techniques, the cross-talk between neighboring domains will be measured.  Small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) provide a dynamic model of obscurin's overall shape.  These experimental approaches will be complimented through computer simulations to test how these multi-domain systems respond to stretch.   Together, these experiments will detail how obscurin resists force.  In Aim two, the PI will test what effect obscurin has on the whole cell when the cell is stretched.  Cells with and without obscurin will be stretched, and the biochemical consequences of obscurin's presence in these conditions will be analyzed.  Together, these two aims will help define how obscurin behaves as a stretch resistor, and will answer the question of whether or not obscurin is a mechanosensor.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n            This proposal began with the observation that cells act different when they are attached to dishes than when they are free-floating.  Cellular machinery that senses physical force is called mechanosensors.  While several are known, the protein obscurin is understudied but is well-positioned to be one of these mechanical sensors.  It is a long protein, and links the cellular membranes to the surrounding cytoskeleton.  We hypothesized that this protein is a novel mechanosensor.\n\n            To test this, we did two kinds of experiments.  First, we used computation and a suite of experiments (NMR and SAXS) to characterize how obscurin behaved in solution.  We found that 80% is relatively extended, and 20% is flexible enough that it could form a tangle.  Next, we stretched obscurin.  We found that obscurin can tolerate a significant amount of stretch without breaking, and that at first obscurin can stretch without putting any work into the system.  After a certain amount of stretch, it begins to behave like a spring, requiring progressively more work to stretch it further.\n\n            The other kind of experiment was inserting a FRET-based tension sensor into obscurin and observing how obscurin acted in a cell.  To our surprise, we fond that cells that are lying flat on a surface keep obscurin under significant amount of tension.  This is enough tension to keep obscurin straight, but not enough to unfold it.  When the cells are relaxed, or when the cytoskeleton is ablated, then this tension goes away.\n\n            Together, these findings show that obscurin is involved in mechanosensation.  These experiments lay the groundwork for the next step- figuring out the biochemical signaling that results from obscurin?s unique physical status of being under tension in the cell.\n\nWe also have done three broader impact projects for this grant.  First, my lab trained 15 undergraduate students how to do this kind of research.  Teaching undergradautes how to do high-tech research is central to my lab?s mission.  Second,  many of the techniques we did in this grant involve complex NMR, which is expensive to do.  In order to train others at places without access to this kind of instrumentation, I created a website with all our raw data on it, along with tutorials to help those who want to learn the technique.  Last, this grant allowed to me create an Ethics in the Sciences curriculum.  Students in my department now do ethical reasoning training once a year, and have ethical reasoning prompts scattered through their other classes, and are assessed about their ability to reason through an ethically fraught situation once a year.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/08/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Nathan T Wright"
