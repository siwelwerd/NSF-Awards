This project addresses the question of how cloud microphysical properties respond to and alter aerosol properties.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:\r\nThe work will be carried out in the Pi Chamber, a laboratory cloud chamber capable of sustaining steady-state cloud conditions for long time periods (hours to days). The Pi Chamber has recently been developed with support from the NSF Major Research Instrumentation program, and this will be the first focused scientific research project utilizing the facility. The ability to study transient cloud responses to sudden changes in aerosol properties was noted during the initial characterization of the chamber, and therefore this work is exploratory in nature.\r\n\r\nIt is potentially transformative because of the unique ability to isolate aerosol indirect effects by maintaining constant thermodynamic cloud forcing conditions throughout the study.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:\r\nThe project provides a special opportunity for students and visiting middle/high-school teachers to gain experience with a large experimental facility.",
