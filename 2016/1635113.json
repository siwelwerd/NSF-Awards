 "awd_abstract_narration": "Extremely small diameter fibers can be formed into inexpensive, lightweight, ultra-porous materials which are crucial to the ongoing development of myriad, diverse applications including energy storage, ultra-high efficiency air/water filtration, drug delivery, wound healing, and artificial tissue engineering. Current approaches use solvents to process ultra-small diameter fibers that have insufficient mechanical strength to act as stand-alone filters and unintentionally leach harmful residual solvent during fabrication and/or biomedical applications. This award supports fundamental research to enable a significant increase in the number of processable materials including relatively insoluble thermoplastics, as well as the fabrication of higher quality (i.e, smaller diameter) fibers. The new open geometry electrospinning process creates many closely-packed parallel fibers resulting in a substantial increase in the production rate enabling commercial manufacturing.  This method is \"green\" (solvent-free and compatible with recyclable plastics), results in nano- to micro-scale fibers having improved mechanical properties, and allows manipulation of the electrospinning process to create smaller fiber diameters than can typically be achieved using traditional processing routes. Substrates made from these fibers can be used in the many different technology fields described above, consequently benefitting the U.S. economy and society. Involving several disciplines including materials science, polymer and fiber processing and manufacturing, fluid physics, and electrical systems, this research will broaden participation of underrepresented groups in research and positively impact engineering education.\r\n\r\nThe objective of this work is to develop fundamental understanding to enable a robust, green fabrication methodology to produce thermoplastic meso-fibers. Traditional needle melt electrospinning is difficult due to processing issues (i.e., frequent clogging). Melt electrospinning from an unconfined surface of molten polymer is a new paradigm. This transformative approach removes the fundamental incompatibility between melt electrospinning and confined feed geometries while promoting scale-up to fabrication rates necessary for commercial viability.   The scientific hypothesis to be tested is that control of the flow rate via the electric field, polymer temperature, and melt conductivity (tuned via additives or by controlled electrical discharge) will produce previously unattainable small jet diameters to form nanofibers. The unconfined geometry enables control of low flow rate and local conductivity not readily achievable in confined schemes.  The explicit role of conductivity has not been previously explored in melt electrospinning. This work addresses the mechanistic effects of conductivity on melt electrospinning, the ability to tune melt conductivity via controlled discharge, alteration of flow rate due to changes in melt conductivity, the mechanics by which this occurs, and the fundamental limits to electrospinning using melts.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual merit: This project tested the hypothesis that the limiting factor in producing mesoscale fibers from thermoplastic polymer melts with electrospinning was the fluid's low ionic conductivity rather than their high viscosity and that fiber diameter of thermoplastic electrospun fibers could be tuned (relatively easily) by using additives to enhance ionic conductivity.  4 publications have resulted from this work, with two additional manuscripts in preparation.\n\nSignificant scientific contributions due to this research include:\n\nPolyethylene melt conductivity was increased by four orders of magnitude by adding a commercial anti-static agent, resulting in a 20? decrease in electrospun fiber diameter and formation of a significant fraction of sub-micron diameter fibers. \nMultiple formulations, melt temperatures, and additives were utilized to span the parameter space of conductivity and viscosity. \nThe key role of conductivity in determining the jet radius (which sets the upper limit on the fiber size) was explained in the context of fluid mechanics theory and previous simulations.  Parameters which affected the conversion of the liquid jet to a solid fiber and the pertinent theory were outlined in a comprehensive publication.  The extensive experimental data and detailed theory considerations resulted in a holistic understanding of the interactions between flow rate, viscosity, conductivity, and the resultant jet and fiber size. Schemes for theoretically predicting the cone-jet density, cone size, and flow rate are compared to experimental results.\nThis work utilized  a simple unconfined apparatus (molten polymer on a flat, sharp-edge plate with a second flat plate acting as a collector), demonstrating that high viscosity fluids could facilely be electrospun with such an approach, which avoids common parasitic effects associated with melt electrospinning such as needle clogging.\nThe unconfined electrospinning apparatus also enabled direct observation of important characteristic length scales related to the interaction of the fluid and the applied electric field.    Information about the fluid viscosity and conductivity gained by observing the electrospinning process was delineated. \nA variety of imaging and heating techniques were developed to characterize and manipulate the transition from jet to ultimate fiber.\nAn alternative strategy to temporarily tune (enhance or decrease) local conductivity at the electrospinning site by creating a controllable, intentional discharge near the plate edge was demonstrated, resulting in decrease in fiber size by an order of magnitude without the use of additives. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBroader impacts:  Two female students (Elnaz Shabani Ph.D., Fiber and Polymer Science, December 2020 and Neelam Sheoran Ph.D., Physics, May 2022) received interdisciplinary professional training and obtained their degrees as a result of this grant.
