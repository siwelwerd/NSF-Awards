 "awd_abstract_narration": "The experience of chronic pain is associated with lower quality of life and impacts an estimated 20% of adults worldwide. With reports of pain being more prevalent and widespread in Japanese individuals than both non-Hispanic whites and other ethnic minority groups, it is important to identify protective factors that can lower the experience of pain cross-culturally given its precipitating effects on psychological, social, and physical well-being. The proposed study will test whether nostalgia, a sentimental longing for the past, reduces perceptions of physical pain in both American and Japanese samples. Data in support of these hypotheses will provide evidence that nostalgia can also serve as a potential pain intervention among Asian cultures that have a higher prevalence of pain-related disabilities and are more resistant to using medication to remedy their pain. This research project will be carried out in collaboration with Dr. Takashi Kusumi, an expert in nostalgia and cross-cultural research at Kyoto University in Japan.\r\n\r\nAlthough the experience of pain is universal, cultural differences in pain tolerance is a topic of concern for many researchers and physicians. Despite evidence demonstrating that individuals from Asian countries have higher pain sensitivity than those from European countries and the United States, research has yet to examine how psychological resources can be utilized to decrease perceptions of physical pain cross-culturally. Several studies have shown that the pancultural emotion of nostalgia, a sentimental longing for the past, offers many psychological benefits (e.g., optimism, positive affect, social connectedness), with other research linking these same outcomes with greater pain resilience. Building on this work, this fellowship will allow the proposed research to (a) examine whether nostalgic thinking can lead individuals to be less sensitive to experimentally-induced pain, (b) identify potential mediating variables that may explain the relationship between nostalgia and higher pain thresholds, and (c) examine whether there are cultural differences between American and Japanese participants on the experience of pain following a nostalgia manipulation.\r\n\r\nThis award under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science.",

Although the experience of pain is universal (Hobara, 2005), there is a body of work suggesting that cultural differences exist with respect to pain sensitivity. Several studies have shown, for example, that people from Asian countries (generally) and individuals living in Japan (specifically) report a greater prevalence of and a more widespread tendency for musculoskeletal pain than people in the United States and European countries (Allison et al., 2002; Johannes, Le, Zhou, Johnston, &amp; Dworkin, 2010; Macfarlane et al., 2005; Nakamura, Nishiwaki, Ushida, &amp; Toyama, 2014; Palmer et al., 2007; Rowelll, Mechlinl, Jil, Addamol, &amp; Girdlerl, 2011; Woodrow, Friedman, Siegelaub, &amp; Collen, 1972). Further, regarding the experimental manipulation of pain, individuals from Asian cultures have been shown to have reduced pain thresholds and a lower tolerance to heat pain (Watson et al., 2005), cold pain (Hsieh, Tripp, Ji, &amp; Sullivan, 2010), capsaicin pain (Gazerani et al., 2005), and pressure pain (Komiyama, Kawara, &amp; De Laat, 2007; Woodrow et al., 1972) compared to both non-Hispanic Whites and other minority groups (e.g., African Americans). Despite evidence demonstrating that individuals from Asian countries have higher pain sensitivity than those from other societies, research has yet to examine how psychological resources can be utilized to decrease pain sensitivity cross-culturally.</p>\n<p class=\"CommentText1CxSpMiddle\">A growing body of work has been interested in identifying psychological forms of treatment in the management of physical pain. For example, mind-body practices such as mindfulness (McCracken et al., 2007; Morone et al., 2008), guided imagery with relaxation (Menzies &amp; Kim, 2008), various forms of meditation (Carson, et al., 2005; Daks, 2013), and Tai Chi have been found to be effective methods of reducing perceptions of pain for individuals with chronic disabilities (Hall, Maher, Lam, Ferreira, &amp; Latimer, 2011; Song, Lee, Lam, &amp; Bae, 2003; Wang et al., 2010; also see Peng, 2012 for a review). The purpose of the present research was to example whether <em>nostalgia</em>, a sentimental longing for the past, can also help to attenuate perceieved pain sensitivity. This is based on several studies which have found that nostalgic reverie results in psychological, emotional, and social well-being (Routledge, Wildschut, Sedikides, &amp; Juhl, 2013; Wildschut, Sedikides, Arndt, &amp; Routledge, 2006), with more recent work demonstrating the health-promoting effects of nostalgic reflection (Kersten, Cox, &amp; Van Enkevort, 2016).</p>\n<p class=\"CommentText1CxSpMiddle\">Eighty-one Japanese participants from Kyoto University were recruited to participate in the proposed experiment. Individuals were exposed to a nostalgia manipulation used in previous research (e.g., Wildschut et al., 2006), in which participants were randomly assigned to write about a nostalgic event or an ordinary event. Following this, everyone completed a pain pressure task used in prior psychology research (DeWall &amp; Baumeister, 2006). Specifically, pain tolerance was measured before (baseline) and after participants completed the nostalgia manipulation using a pressure algometer (Wagner FPX 25). This device assessed the amount of pressure applied perpendicularly at the first dorsal interosseous muscle of the participant&rsquo;s non-dominant hand. The results revealed that individuals evidenced a greater pain tolerance after writing about a nostalgic (versus ordinary) event.</p>\n<p class=\"CommentText1CxSpMiddle\">Given the prevalence of different pain disabilities, the precipitating effects they have on well-being, and the proclivity that such conditions will remain unrelieved (Breivik, et al., 2006; Morone &amp; Greco, 2007; Sessle, 2011; Takai et al., 2015), it is especially important to identify protective factors that serve to modulate how individuals perceive the severity of physical pain. Similar to how other psychological resources (e.g., McCracken et al., 2007; Menzies &amp; Kim, 2008; Morone et al., 2008) and mind-body techniques (e.g., Hall et al., 2011; Michalsen et al., 2012; Peng, 2012; Saper et al., 2017; Song et al., 2003) have been found to be impactful therapies for people seeking to help with their pain conditions, the outcomes of this project suggest that nostalgia can serve as a cost-effective, internally-generated resource that is available to everyone regardless of age, gender, and culture (Sedikides et al., 2015). With the increasing need to find effective ways to address the silent epidemic of chronic pain conditions worldwide, the present work suggests that one method in which suffers may find solace is by attenuating pain with the past.</p>\n<p class=\"CommentText1CxSpLast\">This EAPSI fellowship has also presented several additional outcomes.
