 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project examines how markets in a post-financial crisis economy are remade through legal interventions and how, when mortgages are the key object for intervening, local understandings of property impact those interventions. The project focuses on property repossessions, examining, in particular, the role of local courts.  Courts are a key local stage where new property relations are contested and authorized.  While lenders may take courts for granted as rubber stamps for repossessions, judges and registrars may hesitate to repossess homes.  Exploring emerging practices and theories of law and economy in the context of property repossessions, the research asks how formal legal institutions and players define property, property rights, and legal responsibility. The project also examines lay understandings of property, asking how homeowners and business owners define property and respond to repossessions.  In addition to advancing knowledge on the interplay between law, markets, courts, and the economy, this project has broader impacts that include graduate student training.\r\n\r\nThe rural Irish border region serves as the site for the research project.  The Irish border counties, where formal law and markets have often had to coexist with significant shadow organizations and economies, have become a dynamic area where North American hedge fund investors have bought thousands of defaulting mortgages from Ireland?s weakened financial institutions, and where rural homeowners contest them in the courts with defenses that appeal to \"sovereign citizen\" discourse. The research will use ethnographic field methods of participant observation, direct observation, semi-structured interviews, and archival research to analyze how the economic recovery practically unwinds at the local level and in the context of bureaucratic registration, court proceedings, and actual repossessions.",

The project sought to examine the social and legal transformations that people in Ireland experienced via their changing relationships to real property after the unprecedented real estate, financial, and banking crash of 2008. The lens through which transformations were studied was in and around courtrooms where applications for repossessions (essentially foreclosures in the American context) were made by lenders against borrower defendants, the great majority of whom were unrepresented.<br /><br />The methods Coben used were qualitative, relying predominately on observation and interviews. He observed courtroom proceedings, and interviewed practitioners, advocates, public servants, and, especially, borrower defendants. From October 2016 to April 2017 he took trips from Dublin to Circuit Courts across the country. He returned to Ireland for July and August of 2017 to conduct interviews and attend more Circuit Court Civil Motions Lists, the hearings in which County Registrars hear applications for repossessions to borrowers&rsquo; residential real property, which in most cases are owner-occupied homes. In total, he visited and observed at least one hearing, often more, in 17 Circuit Courts across the country (there are 26 counties in the Republic of Ireland, with 26 Circuit Courts). At these hearings he would typically interview one or two borrower defendants outside of the courtroom after their mention in the hearing.<br /><br />As an observer and interviewer Coben accomplished his goals and found that the associations that borrower defendants formed around these legal proceedings are a central, but overlooked, part of how Irish society has reconstituted its property market, its economy, and its political landscape. He collected extensive data on the very ad hoc practices of adjournments, renegotiations, delays, and other similar tactics that public servants, money and budget advisors, and lay litigants use to forestall repossession. The intellectual merit of this project is rooted in the finding that while many of these courts are provincial, and viewed as legal afterthoughts to the fiscal and financial fortunes of the post-crisis state, they are, in fact, intensely experienced and engaged interactions in which people come to understand and articulate themselves in new ways in relation to a changing economy (as financial subjects), to an largely unfamiliar legal system (as legal persons and subjects), and to a state that seems to them increasingly distant (as political subjects). This process of repossession of real property is marked by deferral, delay, and inaction, such that nine years after the crash many unsustainable mortgages in arrears are still only just being brought into the legal system. What is unique about the findings of this study is how particular they are to Irish history, local jurisdictions, and moral economy in Ireland.</p>\n<p>This recent history of looming repossession, which for many borrower defendants is almost purgatorial in its non-resolution, has actively facilitated the growth of new political formations in which, for instance, some challenge the legitimate sovereign authority of the state and, in fact, adopt North American Sovereign Citizen movement rhetoric to do so. Coben&rsquo;s interviews revealed that while that rhetoric was a novelty in Ireland, and was being used to respond to a relatively new and unfamiliar phenomenon of the crash and the repossessions that followed, people tended to draw on and extend familiar local social networks and associations, with some uneven reciprocity, to navigate their vulnerable financial and legal positions.</p>\n<p><br />One of the unanticipated developments that took place during Coben&rsquo;s study was the introduction of the so-called Abhaile Scheme, which advertised a form of legal assistance to borrower defendants.In his observations of courtroom proceedings and interviews with borrower defendants and independent state agents involved in the scheme, Coben found that rather than provide legal representation, as it tenuously suggested, the scheme offered a quasi-formal recognition of the ad hoc practices that were already happening in some counties. In other counties, the scheme tended to produce more, new legal ambiguity into the repossession proceedings. The broader impacts of the study, then, include producing a better understanding of how state interventions into the sociolegal experience of economic crises actually work in practice versus the state intentions of those interventions.<br /><br />Coben found that the space between those two dimensions of law&mdash;between law on the books and law in action&mdash;is in this case a socially produced, and socially productive, space, in the sense that contending figures around mortgage debt anticipate the ambivalence of that relationship, and try to effect it so they can use it to different goals. Though typically not thought of enough with regards to real property or conveyancing matters, Coben found that the ambivalent space between law&rsquo;s stated intentions and its actual practices relating to real property have the potential to become sociolegal breeding grounds for new social and political movements.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/06/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Nathan&nbsp;Coben</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1627793/1627793_10446549_1507276954269_IMG_20160218_115958271--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1627793/1627793_10446549_1507276954269_IMG_20160218_115958271--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Bulletin Board Advertising\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1627793/1627793_10446549_1507276954269_IMG_20160218_115958271--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Bulletin Board Advertising\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Posters and pamphlets advertise an independent state agency's services for distressed mortgagors, bottom left, while a pamphlet for a lay litigant organization, top right, says it can fight the banks and win.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Nathan Coben</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Nathan&nbsp;Coben</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Bulletin Board Advertising</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1627793/1627793_10446549_1507277130993_IMG_20150523_134530403--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1627793/1627793_10446549_1507277130993_IMG_20150523_134530403--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Avoid the Sharks\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1627793/1627793_10446549_1507277130993_IMG_20150523_134530403--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Avoid the Sharks\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Credit union advertising offers a dim view on the interests of non-local financial institutions</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Nathan Coben</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Nathan&nbsp;Coben</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Avoid the Sharks</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
