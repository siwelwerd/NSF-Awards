 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Melting of the Greenland ice sheet is not a simple issue of warmer air temperatures melting the surface ice, which then flows into the ocean.  Surface meltwater can flow deep into the glacier through natural pipes known as moulins.  These subsurface channels not only transmit water to some outlet, where it flows into the ocean, but may also influence the downslope sliding of the glacier toward the ocean.  To better understand the controls that govern glacier sliding, the PI?s propose to conduct field and model studies on the Greenland ice sheet.  The PI?s will instrument a number of moulins with pressure sensors.  Glacier velocity will be measured with GPS sensors.  Discharge will be monitored through dye tracing.  Simulations will be conducted to integrate the observations with a number of simple ?conduit? models in the hope of providing a better and more comprehensive understanding of the processes that govern glacier sliding.\r\n\r\nBeyond the training of graduate and undergraduate students, the PIs will work with a journalism student at the University of Arkansas to produce a documentary about their field experience. This collaboration provides a unique opportunity to communicate to the general public.\r\n\r\nIt is thought that increased channelization reduces subglacial water pressure act to buffer the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) against large increases in ice velocity. However, few measurements of water pressure have been made in channelized subglacial drainage systems to test this hypothesis. The PI?s will obtain synoptic supraglacial stream discharge data, moulin water level and ice velocity at two moulin sites along an ice flow line in the Paakitsoq Region of the GrIS.  Data will be analyzed, and used to parameterize model experiments, to determine the degree to which: 1) local versus regional inputs of melt water control moulin water levels; 2) changes in effective pressure that occur along ice flow paths affect local relationships between subglacial water pressure and ice velocity.\r\n",

Prior observational studies have suggested that increases in meltwater can have a double effect on loss of ice by lubricating the bed of the ice sheet and increasing the rate of glacier sliding. These studies raised the concern that feedback between increased melt and increased sliding might lead to runaway loss of ice. Later modeling studies indicated that meltwater pulses should only have a transient influence on ice speed, as the subglacial drainage systems becomes more efficient in response to increased flow. This increase in efficiently ultimately reduces water pressure beneath the ice and consequently reduces sliding speed. However, the models on which these predictions are based were very poorly constrained with data, since few measurements have been made of subglacial water pressure within the efficient portions of the drainage system. While data on ice sliding near the margins of the ice sheet support this idea of reduced sliding due to increased drainage efficiency, it is less clear how these interactions will play out beneath thicker ice, where subglacial drainage pathways can quickly squeeze shut under the pressure of the ice. In this study, we collected simultaneous measurements of meltwater flowing into moulins (large holes in the ice that funnel water to the bottom of the glacier; see image), subglacial water pressure, and ice sliding velocity. These data provide some of the first field constraints on the interactions among meltwater, subglacial pressure, and sliding, including sites that are relatively far inland from the ice sheet margin.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Our first major observation is that daily variability in water pressure was much lower than observed previously closer to the ice margin. This has important implications, as pressure variations drive the evolution in efficiency of the subglacial drainage system. Comparison with a model of subglacial drainage suggested that large storage volumes in the ice were needed to account for the low variation in pressure. Later exploration of moulins confirmed that some moulins have much larger volumes than previously appreciated, potentially containing large chambers beneath the ice that were much bigger than the openings at the surface (see image). However, only two moulins were entered and mapped, so our understanding of how these volumes vary, and why, is limited. We developed a model of moulin evolution that was coupled to a subglacial drainage model. Results from this model suggest that it is difficult to keep large moulin volumes open at sufficient depth to strongly influence storage of water. Here, we demonstrate that interactions between multiple moulins across a network can also reduce pressure variation.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>By comparing sites that were different distances from the ice margin, we found that further from the margin, where moulins are not as close together, the response of ice sliding to changes in water pressure was substantially delayed. The few past observations of this relationship, closer to the margin, displayed nearly simultaneous peaks in water pressure and sliding. We also observed changes in sliding velocities after a large lake drainage event. However, this did not coincide with changes to the efficiency of the subglacial drainage system that is directly connected to the moulins. Together, these observations suggest that the efficient (channelized) portion of the subglacial drainage system may be less important in determining ice sliding velocities under thicker ice. If channelization in subglacial flow cannot offset the effects of increased melt, then this may strengthen feedbacks between meltwater and ice sliding beneath thicker ice, potentially producing more rapid loss of ice than currently predicted by models.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Predicting ice loss from the Greenland Ice Sheet, and how it will change in warmer climate, is key to making predictions of sea-level rise. Our work provides a rich dataset that can be used to improve models of ice loss and lead to better predictions of rising sea-level.
