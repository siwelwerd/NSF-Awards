The Center consists of an interdisciplinary endeavor to help achieve an affordable, sustainable and clean supply of global energy. The Center will develop advanced materials and devices for renewable energy, such as solar, thermoelectric, battery and high-performance low-energy-consuming devices and sensors.\r\n\r\nCenter activities are comprised of three research thrusts (i) Renewable energy harvesting, (ii) Energy storage, and (iii) Low energy consumption and high performance electro-optic and sensor devices. Renewable energy harvesting efforts are devoted to the development and fundamental study of nanostructures based energy materials such as semiconductor nanocrystals, perovskite organic-inorganic lead iodide-based solar cells, organic-inorganic thermoelectric materials, magnetoelectric composites and their measurements of all physical properties, including transient and intensity decay of time-resolved spectroscopy, and simulation and modeling in order to understand the mechanism. These efforts will advance several major energy applications, in particular, solar cells, thermoelectric generators, and other optoelectronic applications.\r\n\r\nEnergy storage research efforts focus on the development and computational study of nanomaterials based Li-ion battery, supercapacitors, and bimetallic cellulose embedded energy storage device and high-performance energy storage devices. Research on the development of energy or power-efficient devices, will focus on biosensors, as well as optoelectronic and energy conversion devices based on artificial nanostructures.\r\n\r\nThe Center for Renewable Energy and Advanced Materials will develop educational materials for the high school, community college, science museum and university levels to advance understanding of sustainable energy technologies, practices and clean energy alternatives to shape the work force and talent pool of the future. Center activities will also enhance the quality of training for a large number of African Americans in this interdisciplinary area.",

CREST CREAM's goals include developing renewable energy materials, energy storage solutions, and energy-efficient devices. It also aims to infuse cutting-edge research into educational curricula, fostering synergy between academia and the world of STEM. CREST CREAM seeks to forge dynamic partnerships with K-12 institutions and informal learning centers, empower underrepresented undergraduate and graduate students through comprehensive education and training in renewable energy, support the career growth of underrepresented postdoctoral research associates and emerging junior faculty members in renewable energy, and serve as a conduit, seamlessly guiding students from K-12, community college, undergraduate, and graduate levels into diverse and promising STEM careers in renewable energy.</p>\n<p>The center's <strong>intellectual achievements</strong> include the development and enhancement of courses in renewable energy, benefiting over 160 students. Research efforts have yielded substantial outcomes, including two books (with one under review), 133 peer-reviewed journal articles with 2,324 citations, 179 conference presentations, and three invention disclosures. Additionally, the center has produced 18 Ph.D. dissertations and 12 M.S. theses.</p>\n<p>In the <em>Renewable Energy Harvesting Thrust</em>, the center has made groundbreaking strides. It demonstrated a microscale vibration energy harvester with a low resonance frequency and high power density, holding promise for various energy harvesting devices. The center also pioneered a hybrid energy harvester, utilizing thermoelectric and thermomagnetic effects to generate power from wrist motion and body heat. Furthermore, the center introduced a magnetoelectric coupled magneto-mechano-electric generator with a remarkable 400% higher output power at low magnetic field levels.</p>\n<p>The <em>Energy Storage Thrust</em> has achieved success in developing lithium-ion batteries and solid-state electrolytes, enhancing the conductivity of supercapacitor electrodes, and advancing next-generation hybrid supercapacitors. These achievements have led to a collaboration with Sandia National Laboratories and opened up career opportunities for CREST CREAM scholars in advanced materials and lithium-ion battery research.</p>\n<p>In the <em>Energy Efficient Devices Thrust</em>, the center has made significant advancements. It has synthesized metal oxide nanostructures with applications in various fields, such as gas sensing, solar cells, batteries, and biosensors. Innovative methods have been developed for detecting heat-stressed biomolecules and molecular contaminants on spacecraft. Additionally, the center has created a plasmonic pixel biosensor capable of detecting single monolayer molecules without the need for specific spectrometers. The center's efforts have also resulted in the development of smart window coatings and transparent heaters with broad applications.</p>\n<p>The <strong>broader impacts</strong> of CREST CREAM have been substantial. The collaboration involved faculty from multiple departments and universities, promoting diversity in STEM. CREST CREAM's recruitment, retention, and graduation activities have consistently increased, with 88 students directly involved in research activities, over 95% of whom are from minority groups and 36% are females. Additionally, the center's outreach activities, including workshops, seminar series, and STEM events at the Children&rsquo;s Museum of Virginia and K-12 institutions, have benefited over 8,000 K-12 students and Children&rsquo;s Museum visitors.</p>\n<p>Out of the 43 undergraduate students directly supported or involved in research activities, 51% have continued into M.S. and/or Ph.D. programs in STEM, with another 19% choosing careers in industry. Among the 38 graduate students directly supported or involved in research activities, 61% entered the industry, and 8% were recruited by government agencies. The Center has made significant contributions to human resource development in STEM, particularly in materials science and engineering, having trained a total of 96 individuals, including 8 high school students, 42 undergraduates, 38 graduate students, and 7 post-doctoral research associates. Of these individuals, 97% of graduate students, 95% of undergraduates, and 100% of high school students belong to underrepresented minority groups.</p>\n<p>CREST CREAM scholars have received prestigious scholarships and fellowships, such as GEM, SMART, and COVES, and have won multiple awards and honors, including the Dr. Charles Stein Outstanding Scholar Award, the Technology Rising Star Award at the 23rd Women of Color STEM Conference, and the 2017 American Chemical Society Student Exchange Award, as well as several 1st place awards at national conferences.</p>\n<p>Through the acquisition of new equipment, the center has enhanced its research capabilities. This equipment, including a 9 Tesla Physical Property Measurement System, a Spectroscopic Phase Modulated Ellipsometer, and a sputtering system, has become integral to the university's resources and is now maintained within the university's budget.</p>\n<p>The center's faculty's success has extended beyond CREST CREAM, securing additional grants totaling $5.5 million, including a new CREST Center for Research and Education in Quantum Leap Science and Technology.
