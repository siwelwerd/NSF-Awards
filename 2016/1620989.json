 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the United States, an estimated 52.5 million adults have doctor-diagnosed arthritis, and 22.7 million report limitations due to their arthritis. In addition, the market landscape of assistive devices for seniors is growing. According to the Transparency Market Research Group, this market is expected to reach an estimated value of almost $20 billion by 2019. Seniors with Arthritis suffer muscle deterioration over time, have pains, aches, stiffness, and swelling in or around the joints, as well as many other afflictions that effect motor skills and strength. For them the process of pouring out liquid from heavy containers such as milk jugs, water pitchers or large bowls can cause fatigue, pain and even physical harm by causing damage to joints in the fingers and hands. The proposed project 'enPour' will target individuals who suffer from disabilities which hinder their daily activities, independence, or quality of life. enPour is a superior solution that is intuitive, easy to use, and adaptable for a wide range of container sizes and shapes which sets it greatly apart from anything that is currently on the market. \r\n\r\nenPour has been developed, and validated through rounds of prototype testing. An evidence of market interest for this product has been established and recognized through focus group studies conducted with the Houston local office of Arthritis Foundation. Through NSF I-Corps program, this team will conduct a nation-wide consumer research under the guidance of I-Corps instructors. Through this training, the team's rimary goals can be summarized as: 1) identify and expand the core customer segments and the key value propositions of enPour, 2) attract third party investment and partners through product testing and demonstration, and 3) connect and establish a partnering relationship with a number of specialized healthcare institutions through the team's connections. The methods will primarily include onsite interviews, survey, prototype testing and demonstration. The I-Corps program will be a stepping stone for the team to gain an in-depth understanding of the targeted consumers, market and the potential sales channels.",
