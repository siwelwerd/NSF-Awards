 "awd_abstract_narration": "Large amounts of data have become available across fields in science, industry, government, healthcare and pharmaceuticals. Big data analytics and technologies hold tremendous promise to boost economic productivity, enhance national security and improve the quality of life. Recognizing the acute need for big data technology, the aim of this proposal is to create a national model by developing multi-year curricular material that allows course content in separate classes to be naturally inter-connected. In collaboration with industry (Lockheed Martin Inc. and HP Enterprise), this project designs a series of laboratory experiments in big data analytics and technologies that become more complex from the freshmen to the senior year. The proposed approach will cut across artificial course boundaries and introduce fundamental, contemporary and multidisciplinary big data concepts through a series of problem-oriented laboratory experiments. Students will also gain a better knowledge of policy, ethical, and societal impact issues of big data.\r\n\r\nThe collaboration with Palmyra Cove Education Foundation will bring big data activities to K-12 and further evaluate the educational impact and increase related dissemination efforts. The activities run at Cove will excite K-12 students about engineering and enhance teacher expertise in mathematics, science and technology. Palmyra Cove will reach out to local underrepresented K-12 school districts targeting women and minorities. The Foundation will also organize a workshop for undergraduate students, university faculty and K-12 students and teachers on big data as applied to environmental engineering and the geosciences. The results will be disseminated through technical and educational conferences and journal articles.",
