 "awd_abstract_narration": "A request is made by the University of Hawaii to fund additional and replacement instrumentation for the R/V Kilo Moana, (KM), a 185? general purpose research vessel. The vessel is owned by the Navy and operated by the University of Hawaii as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) research fleet.\r\n  \r\nBecause of the unique SWATH design, the Kilo Moana is a very stable and comfortable platform from which to conduct oceanographic research. The ship was designed as a multi-purpose oceanographic research vessel with extensive equipment for geophysical (2 multibeam echo-sounders, sub-bottom profiler, gravimeter and magnetometer), physical oceanographic (Doppler current profilers, CTDs, pCO2); meteorological and radioisotope research. Over 2500 sq. ft. of space is provided in 8 different laboratories and over 4000 sq. ft. of exterior working space is available on the aft main deck and the forward 01 deck. The Kilo Moana was built in 2001 and commissioned in 2002. The vessel operates out of Honolulu, Hawaii, and works throughout the Pacific. In 2015, the vessel completed 191 days. Of these, 131 days (69%) were for NSF. In 2016, she is currently scheduled to sail 186 days of which 138 (74%) are funded by NSF.\r\n\r\nOceanographic Instrumentation requested in this proposal includes:\r\n\r\nDesign and Engineering Services for A-Frame Stand-Alone Hydraulic Power Unit\t$27,560\r\nAcquisition of System Components\t$37,899\r\nInstallation/Commissioning Services\t$74,000\r\nPost-install Noise Mitigation Analysis\t$17,000\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t$156,459\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\t\t\t\r\nThe principal impact of the present proposal is under Merit Review Criterion 2 of the Proposal Guidelines (NSF 13-589). It provides infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF).  The acquisition,  maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe UH Marine Center submitted and was awarded this SSSE grant in CY2016 for a backup hydraulic system for the R/V Kilo Moana A-frame. The proposal was for the design, acquisition and installation of a new electric motor-driven hydraulic power unit (HPU) and associated system components, to provide independent operating power for the ship\u2019s A-Frame.  After an in depth analysis of the hydraulic systems onboard the ship, it was proposed that the new HPU not only could provide hydraulic power for just the A-frame, but also for the two main winch systems (main deck traction/storage winch and the 02 deck storage winch), as there is currently no redundancy for any of these systems, thus the scope of the project increased.  It was also proposed to place the redundant HPU skid on the main deck, more close to the existing HPU and to use an Integrated Motor Pump system (IMP). The IMP is a unique combination of a conventional AC induction motor cooled with system hydraulic oil and a Vickers hydraulic pump string, housed in a special sound reduction enclosure. This combination provides an exceptionally quiet and small pumping package for application of continuous hydraulic power.  The new Hydraulic Power Unit (HPU) was integrated into the existing science hydraulic systems, to perform as a backup unit in case of failure of the existing one.  The traction winch system is a cable handling system designed to deploy, tend, recover, and store up to 10,000 meters of two different cable systems, each of which have separate storage winches and Levelwind assemblies.   The traction winch system performs all pulling functions associated with each cable.  The main storage winch is in the space adjacent to the traction winch and stores the 0.681 inch diameter electro-optical cable.  This cable is used for remotely operated vehicle (ROV) operations as well as for lowering instrumented packages to depths up to 6,000 meters, and for towing certain scientific packages.  Other components include a low tension turning sheave and a high tension turning sheave.  The second storage winch is located on the next deck up and can be used for either 0.680 coax or for 9/16 3x19 trawl wire.  The 9/16\" wire is generally used for coring work.  In addition to supplying the hydraulic power to both winch systems described above, both the main and backup system now feeds the new Hawboldt CTD launch and recovery crane installed at the same time resulting in a fully redundant hydraulic power unit allowing for continued operation of all three of these systems in the event of a failure in any component on one of the hydraulic power units. \n\nThe new HPU and IMP was installed in the shipyard period; February 2020-June 2020.  Both the new and existing HPU\u2019s were operationally tested prior to leaving the shipyard, and both are fully functional resulting in the ship having full redundant hydraulic power on the back deck for scientific operations. \n\nThe original grant proposal was simply for a basic means of recovering the A-frame back into an onboard position, in case of a pump failure as experienced onboard the R/V Kilo Moana in 2015 leading to severe disruptions to science expeditions.  However, with exceptional support from our funding partners, additional time, resources, and vision we were able to successfully add a fully redundant source of hydraulic power for critical ship systems thereby allowing the R/V Kilo Moana enhanced capability to continue scientific operations and data collection while underway. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/09/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Anita L Lopez"
