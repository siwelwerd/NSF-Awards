ICIBM 2016 promotes the education of next generation of bioinformatics, systems biology, and intelligent computing scientists with frontier technologies and knowledge, as well as advances informatics research in complex biological systems and translational, agricultural, environmental, pharmaceutical, zoological, and data sciences. In the era of big data, it is the time to promote the fundamental concepts of data science, molecular biotechnology, genomics, and systems biology for researchers seeking to understand living organisms at multiple levels, to explore complex and dynamic functions and regulation in cellular systems, and to improve algorithms, computational tools, knowledgebase, and biotechniques for better diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of diseases. Support of ICIBM will fund opportunities that include the promotion of interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary education and research, especially for underrepresented groups, such as women, minorities, and students with disabilities, and the introduction of new initiatives and cutting-edge collaboration.  The commitment to education and diversity through the inclusion of underrepresented students and other trainees, as well as the conference?s unique training opportunities, drives the establishment of a culturally and professionally diverse Trainee Committee comprised of minority students. This dedication, in combination with the conference?s unique training opportunities, makes ICIBM 2016 an unprecedented platform for higher education of diverse students in interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary scientific fields.",
