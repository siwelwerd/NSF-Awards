 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Principal Investigators will organize the conference \"Frontiers in Applied and Computational Mathematics 2016\", to be held at New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT), Newark, New Jersey, June 3-4, 2016.  Contributions from all areas of applied mathematics and statistics are welcome.  The main conference themes will be on mathematical and computational aspects of materials science, mathematical biology, wave propagation, biological and microscale fluid dynamics, statistics, and biostatistics.  Each of these topics is at the forefront of current developments of mathematical and computational techniques.  Together they have practical applications that include the understanding and development of new materials, the central nervous system, acoustic and electromagnetic wave phenomena, the behavior of cellular and other soft matter, and improved analysis of data from clinical studies and spatial and societal statistics.  The conference participants will include mathematicians, statisticians, scientists and engineers from academia, industry, and government laboratories.  The conference will bring together students, junior researchers, and leaders in their field from the US and other countries to interact and exchange ideas in an informal and approachable setting.  A goal of the organizers is to introduce future leaders of applied mathematics and statistics to established investigators and emerging research areas.  Participation among graduate students and postdocs is greatly encouraged through selected contributed talks being given in minisymposia alongside leading scientists.  For students and postdocs, this will be a learning and networking experience that will help them with their research and career paths.  Special efforts will be made to continue the participation of underrepresented groups.\r\n\r\nThe two-day conference will include four plenary talks, one in each of this year's focus topics: materials science, the interface between statistics and neuroscience, wave propagation, and biologically motivated fluid dynamics.  Morning and afternoon minisymposia will be given in three parallel sessions: one in an area of statistics or biostatistics, and two in this year's focus areas of applied mathematics.  Poster presentations will be actively encouraged from all areas of applied mathematics and statistics.  The conference is expected to attract 140-160 participants.  Substantial funds will be devoted to support the participation of students, postdoctoral fellows, junior researchers, and underrepresented groups.  The Department of Mathematical Sciences at NJIT has hosted a conference of this type on different focus areas each year since 2004.

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe conference Frontiers in Applied and Computational Mathematics 2016 was held at New Jersey Institute of Technology, in Newark, on Friday June 3rd and Saturday June 4th, 2016.  The conference was hosted by NJIT?s Department of Mathematical Sciences and Center for Applied Mathematics and Statistics.  Contributions from all areas of applied mathematics and statistics were welcomed but the main themes of the conference were, in applied mathematics: (i) mathematical and computational aspects of materials science, (ii) wave propagation and scattering, (iii) topics in mathematical biology, including the dynamics and neural control of animal locomotion, and (iv) biofluids and microscale fluid dynamics.  In statistics, the main theme was biostatistics, and, at the interface between applied mathematics and statistics, the conference featured contributions in optical imaging data analysis and the statistical analysis of neural data.  Researchers in these areas addressed the development of mathematical and computational techniques for application to challenging current problems.  \n\n \n\nThe conference combined a broad cross-section of participants at different stages of their career paths.  Participants were drawn from universities, government laboratories, and industry, and had a wide range of interests in science, technology, engineering, and mathematical fields.  The combination promoted an active cross-fertilization of ideas between researchers with different but complementary backgrounds and interests.  The conference atmosphere was intentionally kept informal so as to encourage the interaction of students and junior researchers with more established experts.  \n\n \n\nThe conference had a total of more than one hundred and fifty participants.  Four invited, one hour plenary lectures were given by recognized leaders in the conference themes.  Morning and afternoon minisymposia were given in three parallel sessions consisting of talks of either thirty or fifteen minutes.  Many of the more than forty five minisymposium speakers were early-career faculty who were presenting their work alongside more established researchers.  Some postdoctoral fellows and graduate students also presented their work in the same minisymposium sessions.  More than forty contributions were made in poster format, many of which were presented by graduate students.  \n\n \n\nMore information about the conference together with an archive of previous FACM meetings can be found on the web at https://m.njit.edu/Events/FACM17/archive.html or by links from the NJIT Department of Mathematical Sciences homepage at http://math.njit.edu\n\n\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/18/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Michael Booty"
