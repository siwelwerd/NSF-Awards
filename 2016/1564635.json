The \"Winning Approaches for Talented Transfer Scholars\" (WATTS) project will support 51 academically talented students from feeder Community Colleges (CC) to pursue degrees as full-time students.\r\n\r\nThe project will include a research study on the implementation and effectiveness of new strategies to recruit and support transfer students through successful STEM degree completion. The study and the project evaluation will examine the role of alumni and peers as mentors; the role of corporations as partners in education and the development of workforce-ready graduates. The effectiveness of practices for comprehensive institutional alignment and communication on behalf of the specific needs of STEM students, transfer students, and the larger undergraduate student population will be studied to promote the preparation of students for careers in science through rigorous course work and independent/collaborative research projects. The WATTS program will provide crucial transitional counseling, mentoring, and peer/buddy support before, during, and after transfer. Graduating biology majors will meet the growing demand by area employers for STEM expertise in the St. Louis region workforce, where biotechnology is among the area's most prominent industries.  Conclusions drawn from the results of the research study and the evaluation will be used to inform decisions on the institutionalization of effective components.",
