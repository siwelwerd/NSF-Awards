 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will study how people reflect on personal informatics data by designing, building, and deploying novel tools for exploration of personal data. Fitness tracking devices, smartphone applications, and other tools based on computer technology that help people automatically track data about every facet of their lives are becoming increasingly prevalent. Despite considerable progress in improving how people collect data for self-tracking, there has been little research on how technology can help people reflect on the collected data. Consequently, people often are overwhelmed by the data they collect, do not know what conclusions to draw, and become frustrated or discontinue use. The research will study approaches to reducing barriers to making sense of tracked data, both individually and in collaboration with friends, family, peers, and experts. To understand and enhance practices for reflecting and acting on personal informatics data, the research will build and deploy tools that help people explore their data and identify opportunities for change. The project includes integrated outreach and educational activities for high school, college, and graduate students and the community.\r\n \r\nThe initial focus will be on designing tools that support exploration of tracked data from several sources - such as physical activity, mood, sleep, location, weather, weight, and personal finances - and evaluating how these tools augment abilities to reflect and to identify opportunities for change. The research will survey existing practices for sharing data among family and with experts, friends, and peers. Interviews with financial planners, life coaches, and personal trainers will document how they engage with client data. What data and views does each audience need, and how should this be integrated into their process for reflecting and acting? What tensions arise when sharing? How can personal informatics records help bridge different levels and types of expertise? Results will lead to new design approaches that make personal informatics data more valuable to people who already track and that will make self-tracking accessible to more people. The research will improve systems that help people make sense of their tracked data, which will lead to better personal informatics systems and, more broadly, improved practices for open-ended exploration of large, disparate data streams. Results will also contribute to theory about how people reflect on personal data individually and collaboratively, particularly among people with different levels of expertise.",

For example, someone might use a wearable to monitor their physical activity levels and work toward their goals. Another person might track food and symptoms to figure out potential causes of gastrointestinal symptoms. The study of how people use these tools and how designers can make tools that better support people?s goals is known as <em>personal informatics</em>. <br /><br />Despite potential and many successful uses, personal informatics tools also fail to deliver on their promise for many people who try to use them. In this project, researchers examined people?s use of personal informatics tools to identify ways in which the design of the tools gets in the way of success. The research identified common assumptions embedded in personal informatics design, such as assuming that people will continue to track in perpetuity and without lapses, even though this is unrealistic for most people or not aligned with their desire to use the tool briefly to gain insight or tune their habits and then stop its use. Additionally, the design of many tools assumes that just because someone is tracking a certain kind of data, they must have a certain goal (e.g., that people tracking period are seeking to become pregnant or avoid pregnancy, or that anyone tracking food seeks to lose weight), creating unpleasant and potentially harmful experiences for the people who use them. Project publications describe these and other assumptions, as well as potential approaches to design that can address them, and results have catalyzed changes in the design of commercially available personal informatics apps.<br /><br />The researchers additionally examined ways that personal informatics tools can better support people?s goals. This included developing a concept of <em>goal directed self-tracking</em>, showing how apps can elicit people?s goals and then support configuring a corresponding tracking plan and analyzing the data according to their goals. Tracking needs vary by type of goal; for example, people seeking to generate hypotheses, such as about potential contributors to their symptoms, benefit from different tools designs than people seeking to test hypotheses. Results also demonstrate that, with appropriate scaffolding and when grounded in their own data, people can learn from more complex visualizations than designers often assume. <br /><br />Despite the term <em>personal</em> informatics, many people also use these tools in collaboration with experts, such as healthcare providers, peers, their family, or friends. Researchers examined each of these collaborative uses. After learning about people?s experiences and goals, the team built prototype applications that tested new designs for people with irritable bowel syndrome to collaborate with their clinicians, for families to collaborate around sleep and managing chronic conditions, for storytelling among peer hobbyists and friends, for memorializing a loved one, for passing along digital legacies, and among college athletic teams. The last of these settings, college athletics teams, highlighted a use case where people can have some goals that are aligned and some that are divergent, and where the introduction of personal informatics tools can both reinforce and disrupt existing power dynamics and ways of navigating those dynamics. <br /><br />To further investigate the relationship between power dynamics, privacy, and personal informatics data, researchers also examined two settings in which there is incidental use or reuse of personal informatics data. The first of these is smart home cameras and other devices, which may be adopted for security or convenience, but also can capture lighthearted memories, support coordination and awareness, and create privacy violations. Researchers also examined ways in which people reuse personal data traces, such as their music listening history, to enrich their profiles and perceived authenticity or interest on online dating and other intimate platforms. This work also highlighted the extent to which some people may to go learn more about a potential match from their online data traces, even when those traces are not linked, and the associated tensions and risks.<br /><br />Overall, this project advances our knowledge of how to design personal informatics tools that support people?s goals and fit into their lives, whether they use them alone or in collaboration with others. It also highlights ways the adoption of personal informatics tools can create privacy violations, exacerbate power imbalances, or change current ways of doing things. <br /><br />To share results, research team members hosted week-long activities on personal informatics design in the UW Math Academy, for high school students from around Washington. Researchers contributed an exhibit to UW?s Engineering Discovery Days introducing 4-8th grade students, families, and educators to personal informatics. In addition to sharing research results at conferences and workshops, researchers presented to leading tech companies and developed design cards on considerations for personal informatics design.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 08/24/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Sean&nbsp;Munson</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1553167/1553167_10415613_1692931017562_livedinformatics--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1553167/1553167_10415613_1692931017562_livedinformatics--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Lived Informatics Model\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1553167/1553167_10415613_1692931017562_livedinformatics--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Lived Informatics Model\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The Lived Informatics Model of personal informatics oriented much of our research.
