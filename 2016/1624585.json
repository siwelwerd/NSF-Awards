 "awd_abstract_narration": "Rapid urbanization of lands and the challenge to maintain a high quality of life for people in urban environments requires leadership and innovative research.  Situated within the commercial and cultural hub of the mid-South region, The University of Memphis and Meeman Biological Station (MBS) are in a unique position to provide essential guidance related to natural resources management and sustainability.  Toward that goal, this project facilitates development of a 5-year plan that will enable fuller and broader utilization of MBS with the intent to conduct and contribute to world-class ecological research and education.  Including minority representation in research and educational pursuits will be a primary objective of the plan. The planning process consists of visits to existing field stations, workshops focused on research, education and community engagement, and an online survey targeted at local and regional stakeholders.  Distillation of gathered information will help identify important research directions, expand educational opportunities for undergraduates and teachers in training, increase outreach to K-12 students and the community through targeted environmental education programming and elaborate a solid path toward advanced operational and fiscal management of MBS.  This is an ideal time to address long-term planning, as the appointment of new administrative leadership at the University of Memphis and hiring of new faculty interested in using MBS has resulted in a drive to increase programming.  \r\n\r\nThe University of Memphis Edward J. Meeman Biological Station (MBS) is two miles east of the Mississippi River on the third Chickasaw Bluff (formed from Pleistocene loess) and lies in the narrow transition zone between the Mississippi River Valley and the West Tennessee Coastal Plain physiographic regions.  This location provides a biodiversity rich area for terrestrial as well as big-river and associated habitats research.  The goal of this project is development of a 5-year strategic plan for MBS that would advance future research direction, educational programming and community engagement to ensure its regional and national relevance, vitality and sustainability.  Three approaches will be used to gain insight and gather information: 1) visits to select Organization of Biological Field Station locations that have similar missions, are regionally relevant and are in urban environments; 2) hosting three workshops focused on research direction, educational programming and community outreach; and 3) creation of an online questionnaire, based on information garnered from field station visits and workshops, that will be widely disseminated to regional stakeholders for additional input and feedback.  A document compiled from collected data will guide MBS long-term direction and programming.  As the only urban field station on the lower Mississippi River and located in the heart of the tristate, 10 county Mid-South region, this is an opportune time to advance capabilities at MBS.  Situated within a majority minority 1.3-million person metropolitan area, MBS is well positioned to engage students that are typically underrepresented in science.  Existing collaborations with local underperforming middle schools, a community college feeder school for the University of Memphis, the HBCU Lemoyne-Owen College and non-profit organizations present opportunities to introduce multiple cohorts of students to the natural environment in a way that many have never encountered.  Such collaborations could form the basis for broader community awareness and appreciation of science, the environment and the role humans play in shaping it.
