 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports research in algebraic geometry, a central area of mathematics. The investigator will study certain geometric properties of spaces that parameterize mathematical objects characterized by algebraic properties. One such space parameterizes one-complex-dimensional sub-objects in an algebraic space; the other space parameterizes fields on an algebraic space. These are important constructions to study in mathematics, in part due to their intrinsically beautiful structures and the applications of these structural results to geometry, topology, and representation theories, and in part due to the fact that these spaces are mathematical analogues of objects (fields, strings) in theoretical physics. The completion of this project will improve our understanding of mathematics and of theoretical physics in general. This research project addresses the long-term goal of broadening mathematical research by understanding new ideas from theoretical physics, and contributing to the development of theoretical physics by providing the mathematical foundations vital to its advancement. \r\n\r\nThis research project will develop a new theory to study all genus Gromov-Witten invariants of the quintic Calabi-Yau threefolds. This theory is a geometric realization of that envisioned in superstring theories. It will provide new avenues to study similar moduli spaces in algebraic geometry. The investigator will further develop a theory to understand the generalized Donaldson-Thomas invariants of Calabi-Yau threefolds through the angle of Kirwan desingularizations, and to make an inroad to understand the recently constructed perverse sheaves on the moduli of sheaves on Calabi-Yau threefolds.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nWhen considering some sort of mathematical object of interest, in a very broad sense, often such objects come to us in a \"family\", and the right way to study such objects is all together in this family. For example, when understanding lines in the plane, we learn early that they are classified by their slope (which might be infinite), as well as (usually) where they meet one of the axes. This notion of \"family\" is what is more formally called a \"moduli space\", and this is setting in which which this grant's work takes place.\n\n\nAlgebraic geometry is the field of mathematics which as its name suggests, brings to bear algebraic and geometric methods on problems, and deals with problems in those arenas. But it is also well-suited by its generality to problems related to many fields of mathematics, including topology, number theory, combinatorics, and mathematical physics. The modern incarnation of the field, developed in the middle of the twentieth century, is seen to be quite abstract and technical, but the philosophy behind this grant is that one should not shy away from the formidable technicalities, but instead try to digest and understand them in conceptually clear and hands-on ways.  The nature of the objects addressed in the grant are then quite general and applicable (moduli of curves, of vector bundles, of sheaves, of maps; and not restricted to any one field or characteristic). A central part of the grant (and indeed the PI's career) is developing a new generation of mathematicians who are able to think cleanly and powerfully and broadly. The location of the grant gives particular access to students with outstanding potential.  A particularly important outcome of the grant, then, is the success of PhD students (and to a lesser extent, those in postdoctoral positions), who are widely recognized to be among the best in the field, and who work across all aspects of the subject. They have gone on to excel in academia, in industry, and in government.\n\n\nAs a snapshot of the type of work involved in this grant, consider moduli spaces related to \"curves\". Felix Klein famously said \"Everyone knows what a curve is, until he has studied enough mathematics to become confused ...\" and indeed the right thing to abstract about the definition of a curve leaves on seemingly far removed from intuition. But a curve, for us, will be in some sense a one-dimensional smooth \"thing\". Put this way, the integers are a sort of a curve, and then number theorists' results on the integers can be metaphorically transported into geometry. In this setting, the homological stability style results introduced by the PI and Wood can be applied to get geometric analogues of Bhargava's earlier famous results, as described in the paper of Landesman, Wood, and the PI. Or spaces of sheaves on generalized curves have been shown to have particularly strong properties previously conjectured, as shown in a paper of Bejleri, Ranganathan, and the PI. Or vector bundles on the simplest curve (the Riemann sphere) lead to moduli spaces, which have suggested a new understanding of Bott periodicity, the foundational result in K-theory, which is work of H. Larson and the PI, and leading to new work of Bryan and the PI. Or the space of maps from curves, and variants thereof leads to the field partly pioneered by the original PI on the grant, and developed in work with many others including Kiem, Greer, and more.\n\n\nThe broader impacts of developing such theoretical tools transcend the short-term direct mathematical applications. The quest for a clean introduction to the field, in particular to bring bright young minds to the field, led to the writing of The Rising Sea, a freely available introduction to a very advanced topic that is nonetheless widely read even outside academia (see math216.wordpress.com), and will shortly be published by Princeton University Press. Other broader impacts include the founding and support of intellectual infrastructure (listed in terms of increasing ages reached) including National Math Stars, Proof School, MathOverflow, and more.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/29/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: RaviVakil\n"
