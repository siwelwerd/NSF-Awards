At these ultra-small sizes, the precise ordering of the atoms at the interfaces is of critical importance for determining these nanoscale properties. A promising approach for controlling these precisely-ordered interfaces is to connect together the nanoscale materials the same way that lego toys are connected; i.e., with their periodic lattices snapped together. To make these nanoscale ?lego-snapped? interfaces of use requires that they be reproducibly and controllably achievable between technologically-relevant materials. Achieving this goal, however, requires a fundamental understanding and control of the relevant interactions at the interfaces of nanomaterials. As an important step in the long-term goal of understanding and controlling the relevant interactions at such interfaces, lego-snapping will be investigated between two of the most promising and important nanomaterials ? these being graphene and carbon nanotubes. The investigation of lego-snapping between these nanomaterials will be achieved in an innovative method that tunes the interactions between the graphene and the carbon nanotubes through the use of a third adjacent material. This innovative investigation should provide fundamental insight into the mechanisms of forming lego-snapped interfaces that could be of use in engineering nanoscale alignments with mass-scale reproducibility and specificity ? results that would be of tremendous technological use in the fabrication and synthesis of future nanoscale technologies. \r\n\r\nAs nanoscale systems are reduced in size, the relative crystallographic orientations of materials? lattices should become increasingly important to their interfacial properties. Utilizing nanoscale components that consist of well-ordered lattice-matched nanomaterials is a novel and promising avenue for achieving these highly crystalline interfaces. Atomically-thin nanomaterial components, like carbon nanotubes and graphene that consist of the same lattice back-bone are ideal for achieving such lattice-matched interfaces. Moreover, the fact that these materials are atomically-thin permits a new innovative method for probing their interfaces via the use of additional adjacent ?substrate? materials. These adjacent ?substrate? materials will provide a route to control the localized strain of the nanotube-graphene system and, thus, provide a method to modify, probe, and enhance the lattice matching of their interface. Through the use of this external strain control, a fundamental understanding of the relevant interactions at the interfaces of these atomically-thin nanomaterial systems will be obtained.",
