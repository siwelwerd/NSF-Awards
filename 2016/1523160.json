 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will explore the question of the origin of Inupiaq culture in northwestern Alaska at the end of the first millennium AD. The project will document the cultural histories, social interactions, population diversity and dispersal, and environmental changes from data collected at Cape Espenberg and in relation to the greater Bering Strait and Arctic regions.  The research team will work together with community members in Shishmaref to conduct archaeological excavation, paleoecology and ancient DNA research to better understand who were the people that first settled the area around AD 1000, when and from where they came, and in what environmental conditions these events took place. At the same time they will work with cultural advisers and Shishmaref community members who have ancestral ties to the area to explore how material culture and landscape is interpreted to talk about the past and tell history.  The project will promote progress of science and education by conducting basic research and developing new methods in the several research fields involved. By insuring and promoting proper conservation of artifacts the project, will increase awareness and capacity to preserve the growing catalog of perishable organic artifacts, increasingly exposed due to eroding coastal and thawing permafrost. By including indigenous perspectives on material culture, the research will promote an archaeology that is more receptive to multiple voices. The project will also foster national and international collaborations between four US research institutes, a French University (U. of Panth\u00e9on Sorbonne), a rural Alaska community and a regional non-profit corporation. Associated with the project a variety of initiatives represent opportunities in research, education and training for a number of underrepresented Alaska minorities, women, and undergraduate and graduate students. \r\n\r\nThe aims of this multidisciplinary program of research is to explore human interaction, settlement history, climate and landscape dynamics in relation to the Birnirk archaeological complex at ca. AD 1000. After a period of hiatus, Birnirk site KTZ-304 at Cape Espenberg (Inuigniq) was occupied at a pivotal cultural and environmental moment in Northwest Alaska and the larger Bering Sea region, just before AD 1000 and prior to the emergence of Inupiaq culture around AD 1300. Cape Espenberg is a key location for this cultural history both because of the presence of Ipiutak, Birnik and Thule archaeological sites and as ancestral land of today's Kigiqtaamiut of Shishmaref. Interrelated and integrated analytical approaches involving cultural and physical anthropology, archaeology and paleoecology will (a) form the framework for continued excavation at site KTZ-304 (b) contribute to study architectural features, archaeofauna, ceramics, and artifacts in order to elucidate social networks, subsistence systems and technology, and to understand the impact of climate and resource availability on peoples activities, decisions and movements; (c) guide the collecting of paleoenvironmental data through targeted sampling of swales and ridges to date dune ridge stabilization, reconstruct terrestrial vegetation and map the location of the ocean relative to the site; (d) integrate ancient DNA (aDNA) studies to establish the broader genetic relationships of Inuit societies in the region and beyond; (e) explore how Kigiqtaamiut interpret material culture to understand the past, narrate history and generate knowledge (f) foster a dialog on the role of material culture today in the community of Shishmaref and in between the Kigiqtaamiut and the scientists to construct more reflexive interpretations of the past, and thus (g) advance understanding of the origin of Inupiaq culture through the development of a high-resolution chronology of settlement and landscape formation, cultural shift and climate variation.",

The research team together with participants from the local community of Shishmaref conducted three seasons of field research at the Cape Espenberg KTZ-304 site (also called Rising Whale) within the Bering Land Bridge National Preserve. They produced and analyzed a unique set of archaeological and paleoclimate data about two abandoned houses occupied between 900 and 700 years ago. They organized several workshops and meetings in Shishmaref, Nome, Kotzebue, Fairbanks and Lawrence, Kansas to present, discuss and integrate project results and knowledge. They produced a film documentary on the project directed by S. Betcher.</p>\n<p>Key findings and outcomes:</p>\n<p>1. The careful uncovering and exposure of two ancestral Inupiaq semi-subterranean houses related to archaeological entities known as Birnirk and Thule.</p>\n<p>2. The successful, careful excavation of a burial inside the Thule house, in the presence of community designated spokesperson for Inupiaq families with ties to Cape Espenberg.</p>\n<p>3. The use of refined excavation and recording techniques including photogrammetry coverage and 3-D modeling, establishing a high standard for recording and preserving architectural wood and whalebone, and artifact remains which included many organics.</p>\n<p>4. the presence of a professional conservator in the field and in the lab to stabilize fragile excavated artifacts and uncovered materials (i.e. skins, feathers, wood, etc.).</p>\n<p>5. Conservation to protect the site consisted in preserving the local environment from potential overuse and included a revegetation protocol established together with the NPS to counter the effect of trampling.</p>\n<p>6. The use of non-destructive survey techniques (GPR and magnetic survey) that guided excavation decision-making and improved understanding of site extension.</p>\n<p>7. The two excavated houses showed clear differences in architectural forms, arrangement of space. Analyses of plant and insect remains proved key in identifying occupation levels.</p>\n<p>8. The occupation of the two houses did not overlap. They were precisely dated using radiocarbon and tree-ring, respectively in the early and later part of the 13th century: there may be as little as 20 years and as much as 80 years between the abandonment of the older Birnirk house and the occupation of the younger Thule house.</p>\n<p>9. Consequently, there is evidence for a transition from Birnirk to Thule in the second half of the 13th century. This is consistent with first entry of coastal people into interior Alaska and start of the Inuit Eastern migration to the Canadian Arctic and Greenland.</p>\n<p>10. Additional radiocarbon dates from the unexcavated house mounds at the site also suggest two main times of occupation, in line with the chronological placement of the two houses.</p>\n<p>11. Artifact analyses show strong connection with Chukotka in the Birnirk house (i.e. Krasnoye Lake obsidian, harppon head types and decorative stule reminiscent of Cape Baranov and St Lawrence Island) and stronger connection to interior Alaska in the later house (i.e. first appearance of Kobuk Jade-nephrite).</p>\n<p>12. The paleoecology team collected a number of sediment cores distant and close to the archaeological mounds and, by identifying and dating changes in the sediment and/or peat formation, produced a model of landscape evolution which includes the development of Cape Espenberg spit between ~AD 1000 and 1400.</p>\n<p>13. The houses were likely located seaward of a lagoon filled with sandy brackish water, especially during the occupation of the oldest house. The presence of a lagoon on the Kotzebue Sound side of the spit would have been ideal for inhabitants in their use of boats (umiaq and kayak) of which several remains were uncovered.</p>\n<p>14. Last but far from least, research on old tools, landscape and place names led to infornation about the community's perception of the past and how people may connect to ancestors by reference to landscape features and through previously used tools. Collecting <em>navraat</em> (artifacts found in the ground) provides daily material reminders of a flourishing Inupiat&nbsp; society prior to the reliance upon western materials and institution.</p>\n<p>15. the project collections was the basis of several master's and PhD studies and offered opportunities to many underrepresented groups.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The impact of the project on the development of Arctic archaeology is 1) promoting the value of detailed and well-contextualized and dated recorded data and 2) the importance of working hand in hand with communities and conservator in the field and the lab for sites where a large part of the preserved remains are organic. Such sets of data contribute to refining the understanding of past construction, life and abandonment process of archaeological mounds of the last thousand years along the coast of Alaska while providing information about local and supra local climate conditions.</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 10/10/2024<br>\nModified by: Claire&nbsp;Alix</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1523160/1523160_10404102_1728581479407_NSF_OR_Figure1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1523160/1523160_10404102_1728581479407_NSF_OR_Figure1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"3-d model of Birnirk House\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1523160/1523160_10404102_1728581479407_NSF_OR_Figure1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"3-d model of Birnirk House\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Photogrammetry recording of large multiroom Birnirk house at KTZ-304 Cape Espenberg site</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">L.
