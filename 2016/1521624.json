 "awd_abstract_narration": "A goal of the Tribal Colleges and Universities Program (TCUP) is to increase the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) instructional and research capacities of specific institutions of higher education that serve the Nation's indigenous students. Expanding the STEM curricular offerings at these institutions expands the opportunities of their students to pursue challenging, rewarding careers in STEM fields, provides for research studies in areas that may be culturally significant, and encourages a community and generational appreciation for science and mathematics education. This project aligns directly with that goal, and moreover will increase the body of knowledge on the effects of unremediated mining operations on water health.\r\n\r\nA'aniiih Nakoda College (ANC) will conduct a comparative analysis of the health of two types of streams, impacted and non-impacted by the lingering contamination of two cyanide-leech gold mines in central northern Montana.  This will be accomplished using state-approved rapid bioassessment protocols for benthic macroinvertebrates and periphyton.  Using samples collected from five reservation streams on a periodic basis, project personnel will sort, identify, count and analyze samples using a multi-metric approach that will include indices for taxa richness, community composition, pollution tolerance/intolerance, and other parameters.  Split samples will be analyzed at a certified independent laboratory to ensure quality control.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe three main goals of this project include the following: (1) assess the residual impacts of mining activities on aquatic life in selected streams on the Fort Belknap Indian Reservation; (2) provide students from Aaniiih Nakoda College with place-based research opportunities investigating relevant environmental issues of concern among reservation residents; (3) the project will enhance scientific research capacity at ANC, and improve collaborations with partners.\n\nThroughout the life of the project, nine macroinvertebrate and diatom samples were collected by the PI and ANC students from three streams flowing in the Little Rocky Mountains on to the Reservation in north-central Montana.  Two of the streams were impacted by the closed Landusky gold mine and the third stream has not been impacted by mining.  Two (split) samples from each stream were collected during each sample event.  For each sample event, one of the split samples was kept at ANC for analysis by ANC students and the other split sample was sent to Rhithron Associates, Inc, a contract laboratory in Missoula, MT, for analysis.  The four ANC students who worked on the project were trained by the PI and all participated in the following activities; sample collection, sample processing (sorting and identification of macroinvertebrates to family level), data analysis, and dissemination.  Three of the four students presented their findings with poster and/or oral presentations at seven different conferences or research symposia. \n\nMacroinvertebrate data produced by students and Rhithron Associates, Inc. indicates impairment in two of the streams (South Bighorn Creek and King Creek) sampled.  Data for South Bighorn Creek indicated that it was the most impaired of the three streams and it had the lowest scores of the three streams sampled for the following metrics; total number of organisms, lower diversity, more pollution tolerant organisms, and less pollution sensitive organisms.   \n\nAll of the data that has been produced by Rhithron Associates, Inc. has been shared with the Fort Belknap Indian Community Environmental Protection Program.    Also, the findings were presented during a Water Forum that was held at Aaniiih Nakoda College that included members of the Fort Belknap Indian Community Council and other policy makers and local community members in attendance.  Data from this project has also been shared on a national level by the PI during a TCUP Research Symposium held at the NSF Headquarters and at an Indigenous Water Symposium held at Salish Kootenai College during the 2018 summer.\n\nMaterials that were purchased by project funds included several sophisticated microscopes.  These microscopes will be continued to be utilized for ongoing and future research projects and for teaching purposes in the fields of biology, ecology, and microscopy.  The activities of this project will be on going thanks to a new NSF TCUP Tribal Enterprise Advancement (TEA) Center award that Aaniiih Nakoda College received during the Fall of 2018.  Also, the sample collection protocols and data analysis methods that were used for this project were passed on by the PI to a fellow ANC faculty member who traveled in December of 2018 with two students to Costa Rica and conducted a similar research project.\n\nThis project and other research projects involving ANC students have shown positive impacts on student retention and graduation rates.  Three of the students who worked as student researchers on this project have graduated from ANC with Associate of Science Degrees and one student matriculated to Montana State University to major in a botany degree.  Also, one of the students will be continuing to attend ANC to participate in the Aaniiih Nakoda Ecology Bachelor of Science degree that is currently being developed.\n\n  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/19/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Dan Kinsey"
