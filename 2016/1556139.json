 "awd_abstract_narration": "A major goal of botanists is to describe and name the vast diversity of plant species found on our planet and to understand how, when, and where plants evolved.  This is particularly challenging for groups with very large numbers of species, especially when they are difficult to observe because they grow in hard to reach places.  Tropical trees are among the most under-studied plants, creating a significant gap in our knowledge.  To overcome this gap, an efficient and effective strategy is needed to discover, describe, understand and conserve this large and important part of the world's biodiversity.  This research project will develop a streamlined strategy, using the genus Schefflera (a member of the ivy family, Araliaceae) in tropical America as a model group.  More than 400 species of Schefflera occur in this vast region, especially in the very mountainous areas of the northern Andes.  Many of these species have only been seen by scientists once or a few times, and almost half do not yet have scientific names.  Moreover, very few tools are available to recognize and identify these ecologically important plants, and we know almost nothing about how they evolved into so many different forms, or how they were able to adapt to the wide range of habitats.  The strategy of this study, which includes field work in four Andean countries (Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru), aims to improve our understanding of these evolutionary processes.  It will also focus on identifying and naming the species that occur in a limited number of places and are most threatened with extinction (mostly by tropical deforestation) so that they can be targeted by conservation efforts.  The information generated by the project will be made available on-line to a wide range of users, both within and beyond the scientific community.  To help develop the next generation of plant systematists, undergraduate students will be trained in summer internship programs at the Missouri and New York Botanical Gardens, and more advanced students will participate in a tropical field botany program, joining the project scientists to gain hands-on experience during field work in South America.\r\n\r\nThe research will involve constructing phylogenies for the species of Andean Schefflera using DNA-based evidence, taking advantage of recent advances in technology, especially high-throughput approaches to DNA sequencing.  The phylogenies will provide a greater understanding of the major lineages of these 400+ species, which in turn will provide a framework for classifying and naming them, and for understanding their evolutionary and geographic relationships.  A streamlined 'green-listing' approach to assessing conservation status of the species that are most likely to be threatened will inform priorities for naming and conserving new and rare Andean members of Schefflera.  Intensive herbarium studies will provide sources of geographic, morphological, and molecular data, and will guide field work in the countries of the central and northern Andes, targeting sites with the highest concentration of species that remain unsampled, and focusing on areas in southern Ecuador and northern Peru where the group appears to have undergone exceptional diversification.  Time-dated phylogenies will be used to explore biogeographic scenarios and to test for correlations among morphology, ecology, geography and evolutionary history, providing insights into the evolution of plant diversity in the Andes.  These studies will be conducted with the collaboration of local botanists and students from each of the four South American countries where field work will be done. This will  promote a long-term network of international researchers capable of sustaining the long-term goals of fully documenting and understanding the tremendous diversity of Schefflera in the tropical Andes.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nUntil recently, Schefflera (estimated at over 1,000 species) was the largest genus of Araliaceae (the ivy family) and among the largest genera of flowering plants. Earlier work by the project team demonstrated that Schefflera is unnatural, meaning it does not represent a single evolutionary lineage, but rather comprises five distinct groups spread across the Araliaceae family tree. This NSF-funded project focused on one of the two largest groups, formerly known as \"Neotropical Schefflera\", which occurs throughout the New World tropics and is especially diverse in the central and northern Andes mountain range. The principle investigators (PIs) used a combination of extensive field expeditions in Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru, and studies of pressed specimens of \"Neotropical Schefflera\" in major Andean, North American, and European herbaria to recognize and describe species, along with laboratory-based studies that generated molecular (DNA) data to reconstruct the group's evolutionary relationships and interpret its biogeographic history and evolutionary trends in its morphology. The PIs established an international network of collaborators, including in the targeted Andean countries, who contributed to these studies and are now poised to continue working into the future. The project developed, tested, and successfully implemented an efficient, effective strategy to discover, describe, understand, and inform the conservation of \"Neotropical Schefflera\" that can be applied to other groups of poorly-known tropical trees with large numbers of species that are undescribed and/or are insufficiently documented.\r\n\n\nPhylogenetic results demonstrated that \"Neotropical Schefflera\" forms a single evolutionary group but can be divided into five smaller, morphologically and geographically delimited lineages. Each was recognized as a separate genus, formally named Cephalopanax, Crepinella, Didymopanax, Frodinia, and Sciodaphyllum, and 182 new taxonomic combinations were published to transfer all of the species formerly placed in Schefflera in the appropriate genus. While each of these five genera is morphologically distinct, they exhibit frequent instances of convergent evolution (related especially to habit, leaf structures, and floral features) both within and between them, and also compared to other \"Schefflera\" groups, particularly \"Asian Schefflera\", now formally recognized as Heptapleurum (which required 246 new species combinations).\r\n\n\nA total of 16 field expeditions generated 641 new collections of these large, structurally complex plants from the four target countries, and more than 3,000 specimens in 24 herbaria were examined by the project team, enabling them to assess the 203 known species comprising the five genera of \"Neotropical Schefflera\" and to discover about 160 new species, nearly doubling the known diversity. To date, 17 new species have been published and another 17 will be shortly, and 24 more have been described and are awaiting submission. An additional 117 well delimited new species have been recognized and will be described in the coming years. Through these efforts, the project also generated many new, high-quality collections and significantly increased the number of databased and digitized specimens, now publicly available on-line. This work has also profoundly improved the level of identification in key herbaria in the United States, as well as in Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Europe (Denmark, France, and the UK).\r\n\n\nThe project provided training experiences for students across a wide range of skill levels. Through an innovative six-week workshop held at the New York and Missouri Botanical Gardens, in-depth, hands-on training was provided to six undergraduate students from the US, and a field-based tropical botany program was held in Ecuador during three successive years for a total of 34 graduate students (17 from the US, paired with 17 from the target Andean countries).

An innovative project website, Araliaceae Central, was also created to deliver a detailed, up-to-date, authoritative synopsis of the family and its constituent genera and species.\r\n\n\nFollowing the completion of the collection and analyses of phylogenetic data, additional papers on the evolutionary history of Cephalopanax, Crepinella, Didymopanax, and Sciodaphyllum will be prepared. As this work progresses, additional data, descriptions, and photos will be incorporated into Araliaceae Central, and a paper will be prepared summarizing the work conducted over the last decade that has resulted in the transformation of Schefflera from the largest genus of Araliaceae into a total of 10 more manageable genera that are geographically and coherent.
