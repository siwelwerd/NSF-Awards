 "awd_abstract_narration": "There is a growing recognition of the importance of cilia/flagella (hair-like projections on cell surfaces) in sensing extracellular information in multiple organisms.  In order to understand the role cilia/flagella play in cellular signal transduction processes, the transport mechanisms of flagellar membrane signaling proteins and their intraflagellar transport (IFT) machinery will be examined at  three parts of the intraflagellar transport cycle: (i) flagellar entry, (ii) intraflagellar motion, and (iii) flagellar tip remodeling in the model organism Chlamydomonas.  For each part of the transport cycle, this project will use quantitative single-molecule fluorescence imaging methods to test competing models:  (i) In the flagellar entry region, it will be determined whether  flagellar membrane signaling proteins synthesized in the cytoplasm enter the flagella by diffusion or if they are carried into the flagella by IFT machinery.   (ii) Inside the flagella, the project aims to elucidate the IFT carrier and quantitate the trafficking kinetics for selected flagellar membrane signaling proteins.  (iii) At the flagellar tip, it will be resolved whether the IFT machinery components dissociate from microtubules and each other and reassemble for the retrograde trip, or whether the reassembly occurs without dissociation of the IFT transport machinery.\r\n\r\n\r\nBROADER IMPACTS\r\nThis project is a multidisciplinary joint effort between laboratories with expertise in single-molecule imaging method, and Chlamydomonas (algal) IFT genetics. This merger of genetics and imaging biophysics will benefit both the flagellar and single molecule imaging fields.  It will allow for the application of advanced imaging tools to questions addressing fundamental aspects of cellular signal transduction, while offering students exciting opportunities to carry out interdisciplinary training in physics and biology.  In particular, the project will aim to support the training of female graduate and undergraduate students, including students recruited from regional primarily undergraduate colleges. The success of the proposed investigation will strengthen collaborations among members of the Imaging Sciences Pathway, a biological imaging program that includes faculty from the Schools of Arts & Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine at Washington University.  In addition, for the broader local community, the project's hands-on outreach activities to high school students in the St. Louis region are designed to entice young minds to choose science as a career.",

These studies aimed to (i) determine the assembly and entry mechanisms of intraflagellar transport (IFT) machinery proteins into flagella, (ii) develop a new assay to monitor and even regulate IFT activities of flagellar transmembrane signaling proteins, and (iii) determine the remodeling mechanism of IFT machinery proteins at the flagellar tip.  The PI conducted educational and outreach activities at Washington University in St. Louis, Princeton University, Bright Horizon at Carnegie Center, and West Windsor-Plainsboro school district.\n\nIntellectual merit:  Cilia/flagella are increasingly being recognized as an important organelle for their sensory functions orchestrated by protein transport from and back to the cell body.  However, these transport mechanisms are largely unknown.  In order to understand cilia's role in cellular signal transduction, we have studied the transport mechanisms of intraflagellar transport (IFT) machinery proteins and flagellar transmembrane signaling proteins (FTSP) at three stages in their transport cycle in Chlamydomonas flagella -- (i) Flagellar entry, (ii) Intraflagellar motion, and (iii) Flagellar tip remodeling.  For each stage, we used single-molecule fluorescence imaging methods to test competing models or hypotheses. (i) Flagellar entry.  In Entry Model I,  IFT machineries assemble near the basal body and pass through transition fibers and transition zone into flagella.  In Entry Model II, IFT machineries assemble in proximal flagellum, beyond the transition fibers and transition zone.  Using our total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy setup that images the whole flagellar base region, we aimed to differentiate the two mechanisms of IFT machinery components (IFT particles, BBSomes, and kinesin-2 and dynein-2 motors) by their separate localizations in the imaging plane.   (ii) Intraflagellar motion.  We predicted that the IFT train loading and unloading of FTSPs, which may represent flagellar signaling activities, can be detected as an IFT speed change of approximately several hundred nm/sec.  Using simultaneous two-color imaging measurements, we aimed to validate this prediction by observing for simultaneous IFT machinery speed change with dissociation from or association of FTSPs onto their IFT train carriers.  (iii) Flagellar tip remodeling.  We aimed to determine the flagellar tip remodeling mechanisms of two IFT machinery components -- BBSomes and kinesin-2 motors -- using Reticello.\n\nBroader impact: This project represents a timely application of new single-molecule imaging tools in significant research topics by enabling real-time determination of protein localization and dynamics in previously inaccessible places.  In contrast to conventional methods that had only obtained limited IFT mechanisms for a handful of proteins,  we envisioned to provide fully annotated IFT trajectories for all flagellar proteins.  With that, a flagellar signaling pathway map would ensue.   This interdisciplinary proposal assembles knowledge and techniques at different levels from physics, material science, and biology to construct an ideal science training platform for graduate students, K-12 children of all ages, and high school science teachers. Example activities include participating in laboratory teaching of theoretical physics graduate students during their experimental projects, and reaching out to Bright Horizon at Carnegie Center children ages 4-12 in their 2016 Summer Explorations Camp program, \"The science of gross things\" week, by showing them the growth and lifecycle of Chlamydomonas.  \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/02/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Yan Mei Wang"
