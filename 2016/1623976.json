 "awd_abstract_narration": "A team of scientists from the Chicago Botanic Garden, The Morton Arboretum, and partner institutions will conduct research at the intersection of evolutionary biology and ecological restoration -- the repair of damaged and degraded habitats. Their research investigates the practical implications of a fundamental finding of evolutionary biology: plant species that are less closely related to each other tend to be more distinct in their traits and in the ecological roles they perform. This is important, as groups of plants that encompass greater trait diversity better support key goals of conservation and land management, such as carbon storage and support of wildlife. This project will test whether selecting an unusually diverse (evolutionarily unrelated) set of plant species to use in prairie restoration is a good rule-of-thumb for achieving better outcomes in restoration of degraded ecosystems. In addition, the project will contribute to scientific engagement of high school and college students and the training of early career scientists. Outreach to the public will be performed through the lead institutions? broad networks of members and visitors.\r\n\r\nA key challenge for restoration science is to guide the development of diverse, resilient systems that provide the full suite of services associated with natural communities. Incorporating phylogenetic diversity into restoration is an underexplored, potentially powerful tool to help meet this challenge. This project will address questions important to both basic and applied ecology through observational and experimental approaches that test the influence of phylogenetic diversity on restoration outcomes in prairie ecosystems. Decision analysis will be used to determine how restoration managers can incorporate phylogenetic considerations into multi-objective restoration efforts. Results will be translated into practical tools for restoration, including web-based tools for guiding species-selection decisions.",

Unfortunately, restored sites often fall short of delivering their intended ecological benefits. The goal of this project was to test how key aspects of the biological diversity of plant communities?a major focus of restoration activity?influence restoration outcomes. In particular, we tested how two dimensions of diversity rarely considered in restoration design and implementation (phylogenetic and functional diversity) affect establishment and performance of restored prairie vegetation. Phylogenetic diversity is a measure of the evolutionary history represented by the species in an ecological community (how broadly from across the \"tree of life\" co-ocurring species are drawn from). Functional diversity is a measure of how different in their biological traits co-occurring species are. Answering this applied question involved testing key questions in fundamental plant ecology.

A key challenge for ecological restoration is to guide the development of diverse, resilient systems that provide the benefits to humans and nature found in natural, remnant habitats. Incorporating phylogenetic and functional diversity is a potentially powerful but understudied tool to help meet this challenge. This project addressed questions important to both basic and applied ecology by integrating multiple research approaches, including assessing the current status of existing restored prairies, performing laboratory and greenhouse experiments to study key aspects of plant species biology and interactions, conducting a large-scale restoration experiment, and developing decision models to assist restoration practitioners with species selection. We found that (1) Restored prairies had lower phylogenetic diversity than remnant, reference prairies, which could help explain some of the shortcomings found in restorations. (2) Incorporating evolutionary information and understudied seed functional traits can improve prediction of seed germination, a critical biological limit on restoration success. Evolutionary relationships among species can help explain (3) patterns of invasion in restored prairies and (4) the intensity of competition and other interactions between different plant species.
