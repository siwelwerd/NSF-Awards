Undergraduates who are presenting work at the conference and/or who are from underrepresented groups (including ethnic/racial minorities and first generation college students) will receive a subsidy to attend the meeting and will participate in professional socialization activities during the meeting. Promotion of undergraduate research experiences will help to cultivate the next generation of infancy researchers. \r\n\r\nFunds will offset travel expenses for undergraduate attendees per meeting.  Efforts to disseminate information about this opportunity will focus on developing a diverse applicant pool.  In addition to learning about new research in infancy science, undergraduate attendees will be mentored at the meeting to ensure that they make the most of their conference experience. Supported students will participate in networking opportunities to learn about graduate school and post-college employment in research venues.",

The initiative was co-funded by NSF and NICHD.  All of the funds supported a total of 55 travel grants to attend the meetings of the International Conference for Infancy Studies in 2016, 2018, and 2022.   Our efforts were successful.  In 2016, 2018, and 2022, 74%, 84%, 88% of the awardees, respectively, reported under-represented race/ethnicities, and more than half of the White recipients were first-generation-to-college or low-income students.  Most of the students reported that they would not have been able to attend the conference without the financial support for travel.  In the short term, awardees said that attending the conference increased their awareness of infancy science and the questions researchers are pursuing, they were able to meet researchers and have meaningful conversations, and they could see how the study of infancy fits into their post-college/university plans.  In addition, they learned how conferences worked, and they gained validation of themselves as scientists.  Many of the award recipients from 2016 and 2018 matriculated in graduate programs: Seventeen awardees we were able to follow up with four or six years later (81% of respondents) completed or are currently completing an advanced degree (M.A. or Ph.D.), with 14 awardees (67% of respondents) pursuing developmental psychology or allied disciplines.  Others found employment in sectors that work directly with children and families. \n\nThe broader impact is diversifying the field of infancy science.   Our goal was to create a pipeline of individuals from under-represented groups from undergraduate through graduate training that will result in a more diverse developmental research community.  Diversity of individuals is needed as role models for future generations, and diversity of researchers leads to diversity of research topics.  To truly understand infant development and how best to support families of all types, we need this diversity.  In short, promotion of undergraduate research experiences enhance the breadth and quality of the next generation of infancy researchers, who will provide empirical answers to basic and applied developmental questions for the benefit of society at large.   \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/30/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Martha E Arterberry"
