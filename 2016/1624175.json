PACT is the premier event that brings together researchers from architecture, compilers, applications and languages to present and discuss innovative research of common interest. \r\n\r\nThe students receiving travel support will benefit from the opportunity to engage in the technical, professional, educational and social exchanges that PACT fosters. The conference serves as an open forum to exchange research results and develop new ideas, as an educational platform to expose students to new research methodologies, tools, and infrastructures, and as a social event to network and prepare students as future researchers. More broadly, this travel support will increase the attendance of under-represented minorities and talented undergraduate students, attracting them to graduate schools.",
