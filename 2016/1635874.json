 "awd_abstract_narration": "Reconstruction of the chemical and physical conditions of Earth's early history is often accomplished by analyzing the chemical composition of shallow water sediments.  A critical assumption made in such studies is that there have been no significant modifications of the sediments/rocks after they were deposited, and that whatever is measured represents the original conditions present when the sediments were formed. This project aims to test this critical assumption through the use of a relative new and novel geochemical technique, namely the clumped isotope method.  Clumped isotopes are combinations of two or more of the rare isotopes of an element.  This project will use the clumped isotope method to investigate modern marine sediments and the conditions under which these modern sediments are changed to rock. This will allow previously unavailable information to be obtained from the system under study, namely the temperature of formation.  It will also allow an assessment of the chemical records that are used to interpret the early history of Earth. This project provides training for a graduate student as well as research opportunities for undergraduate and high schools students.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, the researchers will measure clumping of C and O isotopes (delta47) in a variety of different types of modern carbonate sediments and trace this signature through recrystallization in the marine burial realm.  Significant headway has already been made into characterizing the clumped isotopic signal in modern carbonate sediments of differing types, and preliminary data suggest a difference between skeletal and non-skeletal dominated sediments.  The goals of this work are to: (i) examine in more detail the difference in the delta47 of various type of modern allochems and how these control the delta47 of the bulk sediments, and (ii) study the diagenetic behaviour using delta47 along transects at two different carbonate margins, one dominated by non-skeletal production (ODP Sites 1003, 1005, and 1006) located off the western margin of the Bahamas), and one dominated by skeletal sediments (Maldives (IODP Sites U1466-68) and/or the Great Barrier Reef (Sites 819- 823).  These data will be compared with a pelagic site (Site 807).  The rates of diagenesis using the delta47 will be modelled and compared with rates determined from other geochemical proxies, including Sr, Ca, and O isotopes.  This work will build on 30 years of ODP cruises (Legs 101-359) and interactions and collaborations with young scientists using other novel tracers of diagenesis.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe recognition that deviations of the abundance of the isotopologues of CO2  at mass 47 (13C18O16O), derived from the dissolution of carbonate, from that predicted using the rule of means, was dependent upon the temperature of formation, has been a major advance in the utilization of oxygen isotope systematics to the geological record.  In this project we have (i) applied the D47 proxy to marine sediments which have been converted from their original mineralogy (aragonite and high-Mg calcite) into a more stable form calcite during burial, (ii) investigated rates of exchange of the D47  with CO2 and artifacts during the dissolution of carbonate by phosphoric acid, and (iii) started development of the new D48 method for measuring temperature.\n\nThe first set of projects which has resulted in two papers studied and model the behaviour of the D47 proxy during burial and the recrystallization of marine carbonate sediments.  The data was able to faithfully predicted the depth of recrystallization and mimic the geothermal profile experienced by the sediments  (See the attached figure).\n\nThe second project involved investigating the processes of exchange between of 13C18O16O with HCO3 and with phosphoric acid.   The later is important because this acid is the one used to release CO2 from carbonate for subsequent clumped isotopic analysis.  We found that there was exchange during the reaction with carbonates and this resulted in samples with low D47  values giving temperatures which were too cool.  This also produce a difference between samples reacted in a closed vessel system, in which the CO2 is constantly in contact with the acid, compared to the common acid bath system.\n\nThe last aspect of this work involves the development of the D48 value as a temperature proxy.  We have analyzed samples precipitated in the laboratory and calibrated these values to temperature.  The attached figure shows the relationship between D48 and temperature.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/04/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Peter K Swart"
