 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to enable more effective design and use of virtual worlds. Virtual worlds are important in many domains, including architecture, education, medicine, simulation, and training. However, when compared to the real world, virtual worlds are hard to move through effectively, and pose challenges to effective navigation. If virtual worlds are going to be widely deployed - particularly for applications in education, training, and simulation - then these problems must be solved. This work will generate essential discoveries improving the process of wayfinding (orienting and navigating from place to place) and locomoting through immersive virtual worlds. It thus provides a critical and synergistic complement to the recent advent of low-cost commodity-level virtual reality equipment.\r\n\r\nThis research is multi-disciplinary and employs methods from computer science, cognitive science, and geographical information science in accomplishing these objectives. A transformation of wayfinding and navigation for large immersive virtual worlds can be accomplished by studying locomotion modes in conjunction with the spatial characteristics of virtual worlds and individual differences and abilities of the users of the virtual environments. In this work, virtual worlds are described and analyzed in terms of their connectivity, visual access, and integration using formal measures summarized as space syntax. Likewise, individuals traveling through virtual worlds may navigate and reason about space quite differently, and these differences can be quantified and measured. The goal is to develop locomotion modes that take into account both characteristics described by space syntax and individual attributes of users.  Truly effective design and use of virtual worlds depend on an understanding of how an individual's abilities relate to the characteristics of the virtual world and the mechanisms for moving about in them. This interdisciplinary approach examines wayfinding and navigation in a multi-factor way, combining a focus on locomotion modes, a focus on spatial syntax (characteristics) of the virtual world, and a focus on the abilities and differences of individual users. In addition to improving the design and use of virtual worlds, this work will impact multiple  disciplines: it not only advances computer graphics and virtual reality, but also informs the fields of cognitive science and geographical information science.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nLeveraging technology to understand and improve human performance is at the heart of this collaborative project.  This portion of the project was designed to address how individual differences are measured using virtual environments and what those differences might tell us about how to design and implement tools.  We looked at the extant literature to gain a better understanding of how people measure navigational or wayfinding ability and why so many of the research findings come up with different answers about what affects this ability.  The results revealed that one of the major challenges to understanding individual differences is the fact that there are many different definitions of navigation/wayfinding ability and many different ways of measuring those abilities.  Our work now attempts to categorize those different definitions and measures in more specific categories?explicit knowledge of spatial locations and directions, processing different kinds of information, taking certain kinds of paths, etc.  With this new framework, we can begin to carve the individual differences space into important components and ask how those elements might influence interactions in and learning from virtual environments. \n\nIn addition to this theoretical work, we have leveraged several experimental efforts to better understand what people can do and what they prefer to do when navigating in virtual environments.  In one line of work, we observed that some people may prefer to do a particular type of wayfinding (e.g., using familiar paths) but are capable of performing other types (e.g.,. taking shortcuts) when required to do so.  By contrast, some people are largely restricted to their preferred approach.  For example, some people appear to encode the global structure of a space at the expense of learning specific paths. As a result, they appear to be good at efficient paths but may not be able to reproduce a specific path taken.  In additional lines of work, we examined how measuring wayfinding early versus late in learning paints different pictures of what people prefer to do, and we observed how the simple act of framing the question can influence how people behave.  Taken together, this work provides several insights into the need to develop more nuanced approaches to testing individual differences and illustrates how even the simplest use of virtual environments can be powerful tools for understanding human behavior.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/24/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Amy Shelton"
