 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will investigate theoretical properties, computational methods, and applications for a particular method of graph partitioning. Generally speaking, graph partitioning is the mathematical problem of subdividing a set into smaller components with desirable properties. This problem has diverse applications in image analysis (medical, satellite, and material), surveillance, social network analysis, and topic modeling, among many others. The results of this project could significantly impact these areas and due to the multidisciplinary nature of this activity, all involved parties will gain awareness and literacy outside their own respective fields. The project provides opportunities for the principal investigator to continue advising and mentoring students. \r\n\r\nThis project will prove fundamental theoretical results and develop computational methods for the Dirichlet graph partitioning problem, formulated as minimizing the sum of the principle Laplace-Dirichlet eigenvalues for each partition component. This graph partitioning problem has rich and exploitable mathematical structure: it is motivated by a geometric problem and has both a variational characterization and an associated stochastic process. The project will have three goals. The first goal is to prove, via Gamma convergence with a suitable metric, the consistency result that Dirichlet partitions of geometric graphs, obtained by sampling from a probability space, converge to Dirichlet partitions of that probability space as the number of sampled points tends to infinity. This result will yield a better understanding of the relationship between the graph and continuum partitioning problems as well as possibly suggest subsampling strategies for extremely large datasets. The second goal addresses important computational aspects of the Dirichlet graph partitioning problem. Although two different relaxations of this problem have been identified, computational methods based on these relaxations necessarily have increased computational complexity. The PI will seek provably convergent new methods that combine variational arguments with ideas from geometry, partial differential equations, and Markov processes in order to extend and overcome these shortcomings. The third goal is to address concrete, real-world problems and to engage the developed algorithms in practical applications.",

As illustrated in a supporting image, we consider a data collection process where we uniformly sample n points, x_1, x_2, ... x_n, from a Euclidean set U and construct a geometric graph, G_n. We then consider continuum and discrete partitioning problems on U and G_n, respectively. In this context, we say that a partitioning method is consistent if the optimal partitions for G_n converge (in the appropriate sense) to the optimal partition for U in the large sample limit (n tends to infinity). Using Gamma convergence with a suitable metric, a consistency result was established for Dirichlet partitions.

These methods extend existing diffusion generated and sharp interface methods. To illustrate the efficiency of these methods, we computed Dirichlet partitions of the periodic cube and tesseract (dimensions three and four). For the cube, we found as local minima the rhombic dodecahedral honeycomb, the Weaire-Phelan honeycomb, and Kelvin?s tessellation by truncated octahedra. Computational evidence suggests that the Weaire-Phelan structure is optimal, which is an important theoretical question for Dirichlet partitions in three dimensions. For the tesseract, computational evidence suggests the 24-cell honeycomb is optimal; see the supporting image.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br />Finally, we studied several problems in an effort to better understand how diffusion generated methods could be applied in more general settings. In particular, we considered the situation where the field takes values in a specified target set, such as the semi-positive definite matrices, the cube, the sphere, the orthogonal matrices, and the real projective line. For example, when the field takes values in the orthogonal matrices, we described how a free interface can develop that is not only driven by mean curvature (as in the original Allen-Cahn equation), but also by surface diffusion. As an example application for this work, we considered the inverse problem of denoising an image where each point (pixel) is an element of the target set, which we refer to as a target-valued image. We established several theoretical results for the inverse problem, including well-posedness and the stability and convergence of the numerical method. In a supporting image, we illustrate how these methods can be used to denoise a fingerprint image.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 08/18/2020<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Braxton&nbsp;R&nbsp;Osting</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1619755/1619755_10438462_1597340576007_ConsistencyPartitioningProblem--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1619755/1619755_10438462_1597340576007_ConsistencyPartitioningProblem--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Consistency of geometric graph partitions\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1619755/1619755_10438462_1597340576007_ConsistencyPartitioningProblem--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Consistency of geometric graph partitions\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">We consider a data collection process where a geometric graph, G, is constructed by sampling points from a set, U.
