 "awd_abstract_narration": "Micro aerial vehicles (MAVs) have gained importance in a wide range of applications over the last decade, such as search and rescue, reconnaissance and surveillance, asset inspection, and delivery services. The economic impact of integrating unmanned aircraft systems into the national airspace is predicted to be significant. By providing rigorous theoretical analysis and solid design tools for securing consistent MAV navigation, this research has the potential to significantly impact our lives, from pushing our knowledge boundary of scientific understanding to protecting people from malicious attacks.\r\n\r\nThis research project advances science at the intersection of (nonlinear) estimation consistency and security under resource constraints and seeks to design resource-aware, attack-resilient, consistent MAV navigation. To that end, an analytical study of the effects of sensor system properties such as noise characteristics and sensing frequency on the attainable estimation performance is being conducted to determine the best sensing parameters to use. The integrated outreach program attracts underrepresented minority students to STEM through comprehensive, innovative hands-on teaching and learning of robotics programming for K-12 students.",
