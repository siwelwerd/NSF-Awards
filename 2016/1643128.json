 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective this Nona Talks conference is to bring together a panel of leaders from academia and industry in the cross-disciplinary field of synthetic biology. The specific goal  is to discuss the feasibility and implementation of open source software in synthetic biology; and to identify the needs for new enabling tools that will advance this field in significant ways.  The conference organizers make every effort to bring together a balanced cadre of participants in terms of gender, cultural and educational backgrounds. Junior researchers from the field of computer science, bioinformatics, and synthetic biology and engineering will contribute to the discussion:as well.  \r\n\r\n\"Nona Talks\" is focused on community building, idea generation, and education. The specific focus will be (1) to be proactive in developing software resources that are properly managed, documented and curated. (2) link to major synthetic biology conferences such as the Engineering, Evolution & Design (SEED) conference to be held in Chicago on July 18-21.  As such, Nona Talks is a venue designed to fill a gap between the practitioners and the software engineers and computer scientists to brainstorm on how to streamline the design-build-test-implementation cycle, which is an integral part of academic and industrial Synthetic Biology applications.",
