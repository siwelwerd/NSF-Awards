 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cell shape is intimately tied to cell function.  The skeleton of a cell, called the cytoskeleton, is made of a network of polymers, which drive shape changes. The dynamic assembly and rearrangement of the cytoskeleton allow cells to react in both time and space to specific signals.  A fundamental challenge for a cell is that the molecules of the cytoskeleton are much smaller than the size of the whole cell.  A goal of this project is to understand how information about scale is transmitted in a cell so that small building blocks (nanometer in size) can carry out shape changes that are orders of magnitude larger.  This work will reveal the scaling blueprint for one part of the cytoskeleton. The experiments will determine how structures built from filaments coming together in different arrangements and patterns leads to differences in cell shape and function.  This work is important because it will reveal basic principals of self-assembly in living systems.  Understanding these principals is essential to design synthetic cells that will likely be used for solving a variety of current and future problems such as in computing, bioenergy or bioremediation.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe septin cytoskeleton is an especially powerful polymer network to analyze how cells scale and shape protein structures because septins assemble into diverse forms in cells.  Septin filaments can be knit together into bundles, gauzes, rings and lattices depending on the cell context. These different forms can be hundreds of nanometers to micrometers in size.  In many cases these assemblies form on membrane surfaces where they function as scaffolds and membrane barriers.   It is not understood how assemblies of such varied geometry and size can be built out of the same fundamental building block of a septin filament.  The objectives of this study address how cells regulate septins to build structures of versatile form and function. These objectives will be achieved through biophysical approaches, optogenetics and cell-free reconstitution.  Cutting-edge, quantitative imaging will be employed including single-molecule and polarization fluorescence microscopy, high-speed atomic force microscopy together with cell free reconstitution and mathematical modeling. Septins are nearly ubiquitous in eukaryotes and yet there are major gaps in understanding how cells construct higher-order structures from septin filaments. The ultimate goal is to understand how variable function emerges from this variation in form.  The experiments here address problems that are fundamental to how all cells are spatially organized as there are many examples of micrometer-scale assemblies that are built from nanometer-sized building blocks.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nCells change shape in response to cues from the environment and their intrinsic growth and division programs.  Cell shape is governed by dynamic, filamentous networks of proteins called the cytoskeleton.  The physical properties of the cytoskeleton are essential for how they perform specific functions in the cell.  This project focused on a component of the cytoskeleton called septins that are very understudied proteins that associate with both the membrane of the cell and other cytoskeletal elements.  \n\n \n\nThe intellectual merit of this project is that we have laid a quantitative and mechanistic foundation for understanding the assembly process of this important and mysterious cytoskeletal protein family.  In this project, our goal was to determine how cells control the physical properties of septin filaments such as their length, flexibility, ability to bundle, elongate and fragment. To do this, we applied innovative imaging of single molecules of proteins, developed image analysis tools and a computational model that allowed us to simulate the assembly process with the aid of a computer.   These combined approaches allowed us to discover how septins assemble on lipid surfaces that mimic the membranes that surround the cell.   In a second area of work, we addressed how cells may tune these physical properties of septins depending on the cell context.  We found that very small changes in the sequence of the protein that have changed during evolution can generate septin filaments that have different physical properties.  This reveals a possible basis for functional specialization in the course of evolution in the septin gene family.  Finally, we also began to develop some new model fungal systems to study the septin cytoskeleton.  These extremophile fungi were isolated from the ocean and have highly varied shapes and division patterns.  These properties make them powerful comparative systems to the conventional fungi more typically used in lab experiments.  Future work on these marine fungal systems will give insight into how the biophysical properties of septins can evolve to support cell growth in extreme environments. \n\n \n\nThe broader impacts of this work involved the training of multiple students and postdocs coming from historically under-represented groups in science, outreach to local middle schoolers with hands-on microscopy, engagement with UNC non-science undergraduates where movement was used to model physical principles of cells, and outreach via skype-a-scientist to K-12 classrooms across the USA.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/05/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Amy S Gladfelter"
