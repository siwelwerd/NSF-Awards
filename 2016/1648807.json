 "awd_abstract_narration": "This INSPIRE project is jointly funded by the Quantum Information Science (QIS) Program in the Physics Division in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate, the Atomic Molecular and Optical Physics Experiment (AMO-E) Program in the Physics Division in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate, the Algorithmic Foundations (AF) Program in the Computing and Communications Foundations Division in the Computer and Information Science and Engineering Directorate, the Electronics, Photonics and Magnetic Devices (EPMD) Program in the  Electrical, Communications and Cyber Systems (ECCS) Division in the Engineering Directorate,  and the NSF Office of Integrative Activities (OIA).   A revolutionary approach to computing is under development using quantum information processing.   However, there is still a gap between the testbeds for quantum information processing that exist today, and the more perfect hardware needed for an ideal quantum computer.  This project seeks to fill this gap by finding ways to use variable amounts of quantum behavior to incrementally improve computing systems.  The project will examine how to use quantum effects in order to provide benefits in terms of speed, energy, and hardware efficiency for applications in signal processing and machine learning.  The project will produce open source software for modeling quantum networks and will train graduate students to develop quantum information processing systems.\r\n\r\nThis effort builds on work designing circuits for autonomous continuous-time quantum error correction and ultra-low power information processing systems in photonic architectures.  The theoretical component of the project will provide tools to study quantum feedback in various computer architectures operating with open quantum systems.   This will be done using quantum stochastic differential equations (a form of quantum field theory that is adapted to resemble ordinary stochastic differential equations that are widely used in modern engineering) in order to improve the publicly-available open source software package (Mabuchilab/QNET on GitHub)  and explore ways to extend these methods to nano-optomechanics and superconducting circuit QED.  The experimental component of this project will complement the high-level study by testing lower-level architectural principles based on coherent-feedback quantum control, going beyond previous work by incorporating nonlinear controller dynamics and pulsed signal fields. Together, the theoretical and experimental parts of this project will advance the quantum information community's ability to rapidly construct rigorous quantum-optical models for complex coherent networks/circuits, facilitating the exploration of new high-level architectural principles.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual Merit\n\nThis project has encompassed a broad portfolio of research activities addressing open questions about information processing in quantum systems.  We have worked to open new perspectives beyond mainstream quantum computing, for example by developing new ideas related to the \"Coherent Ising Machine\" architecture for solving hard optimization problems.  We have worked on several distinct hardware platforms including nonlinear photonics, ultrafast nonlinear optics, silicon photonics, and monolayer active optical materials.  We have developed new methods for modeling the quantum signal processing behavior of nonlinear devices with ultrafast pulsed signal formats, pushing beyond the frontiers of established quantum optics theory.  Many of our results have been captured in new software connected to our QNET toolkit, which is freely distributed on GitHub.  In the course of this work we have peripherally developed new instrumentation for studying the low-temperature behavior of complex oxide materials; investigated post-von Neumann computational architectures based on oscillator synchronization; developed a new approach for reducing the complexity of simulating quantum optical networks/circuits; and experimentally demonstrated a novel approach to shifting the strong, resonant nonlinear optical response of a device to arbitrary wavelengths.\n\nBroader Impacts\n\nTwo graduate students have received Ph.D. degrees based primarily on their work performed for this NSF project, and a third is expected within the next six months.  Several additional students who participated in aspects of the work have been receiving highly interdisciplinary training in quantum optics, computational physics, physics of computation, and nonlinear dynamics.  The reseults of this project provide material for the PI's classroom teaching and for research seminars given at a wide range of venues.  During the performance period the PI has engaged in innovative undergraduate teaching aimed at bridging STEM fields with the arts and humanities.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/09/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Hideo Mabuchi"
