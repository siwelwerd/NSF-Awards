 "awd_abstract_narration": "Energy consumption has become the bottleneck for many emerging applications such as wearable electronics and biomedical devices.  The conventional low power design methodology has reached its limitation, bounded by the fundamental tradeoff of performance and power.  Given that hardware design and software development  are conventionally performed separately and treat each other as blackboxes, this project aims at creating a \"greybox\" methodology where the information from hardware design of a microprocessor are visible to the higher level software compilers and vice versa.   The additional information from different layers of the design space can be used to establish a real-time power optimization technique based on advanced power and clock management circuitry developed in recent years.  By breaking the boundary of the traditional design space, it is possible to achieve significant energy savings that are beyond the reach of conventional schemes.  The \"greybox computing\" methodology proposed in this project can overcome the limitations of existing low power technology and provide a new design paradigm based on joint hardware and software optimization.     \r\n\r\nThe proposed project will yield several key enabling techniques to achieve ultra-energy saving including (1) a comprehensive associative mapping between software instruction and hardware performance, (2) high efficient power and clock management circuitry design, (3) hardware and software collaborative calibration scheme. This project seeks to develop a new paradigm for low-power system design that would have profound positive impact in a wide range of applications that rely on battery powered or energy scavenging electronics.  The project promotes an interdisciplinary collaborative design methodology that could create strong impact on the development flow of current computer design.  The project also includes plans for integrating research with education through graduate student training, course development and workshop organization.  Outreach activities inspired by this project will encourage underrepresented students to pursue graduate studies.",
