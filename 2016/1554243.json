Using this data to advance our knowledge about fundamental biological processes and improve human health requires novel computational models and advanced analysis algorithms. IEEE ICCABS (International Conference on Computational Advances in Bio and Medical Sciences) aims to bring together leading academic and industry researchers to discuss the latest advances in computational methods for bio and medical sciences.  The award would provide funding for students and junior researchers to participate in this international meeting that covers a range of topics from structure bioinformatics to systems biology and high performance Biocomputing.  The conference proceeding ae made available both online and in special journal publications.",
