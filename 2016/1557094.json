 "awd_abstract_narration": "Human activities are profoundly altering ecosystems worldwide through changes to natural disturbance regimes and the availability of nutrients. The ability to predict the effects of human activities on biodiversity remains poor because biodiversity responds differently to similar changes in environmental conditions. This project tackles an unexplored mechanism for observed highly variable responses among communities, which is the diversity of species traits in a region.  The project will contribute new insights into the responses of biodiversity to human perturbations. It will simultaneously advance conservation, management, and restoration of human-altered ecosystems both through application of research results and through new educational and training programs. Activities will include a workshop to bring together land managers and scientists from local, state, and federal institutions to identify and discuss key challenges in conservation and restoration; training of high school students, teachers, and undergraduate students in science and field research; and dissemination of a classroom module to high school teachers focused on environmental restoration and sustainability.\r\n\r\nThe researchers will conduct a landscape-scale field experiment to examine why the diversity and composition of plant communities change in response to fire and nutrient availability in Ozark forest ecosystems. Within this large-scale experiment, plant communities will be assembled from pools of species that vary in diversity of seed, root, stem, and leaf traits. Experimental data will be combined with spatial analyses and simulation models to test how trait diversity influences the relative importance of ecological processes underlying plant community assembly. This multi-scale approach will advance our understanding of how regional variation in species-trait diversity, landscape-scale disturbances, and local variation in environmental conditions independently and interactively shape patterns of biodiversity.",

The ecological impacts of human activities are challenging to predict because biodiversity often responds very differently to similar changes in the environment. Such variable responses present major obstacles to understanding the variation in biodiversity that we observe in nature, as well as the impact of that biodiversity on the services that ecosystems provide. In this project we explored a key ecological mechanism to explain the variable responses of biodiversity to environmental change: the diversity of species traits in the region from which local ecological communities assemble (regional trait diversity). Our project combined field experiments in forest-plant communities, comparative studies across temperate and tropical forests, and syntheses of ecological concepts and data.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For our principal experiment, we tested how regional trait diversity influences responses of forest-plant communities to environmental change (fire disturbance) in the Missouri Ozarks. As in many other ecosystems worldwide, prescribed fires have become an important tool used by land managers to restore plant and animal diversity in habitats where historical fire regimes have been altered or suppressed by humans. We established a landscape-scale field experiment consisting of pairs of large forest plots, each containing a plot burned with prescribed fires and an unburned control plot. In each burned and unburned plot, we used a seed-addition experiment to assemble woody plant communities from treatments containing species with either low or high diversity of seed and seedling traits that influence plant regeneration. Our experiment supported the hypothesis that regional trait diversity determines how plant communities respond to environmental change. Seedling communities assembled from the high trait-diversity treatment had the highest variation in community composition across habitats, especially in burned forests. Fire also increased the number of species in seed-addition plots, likely by increasing resources and space for seedling establishment. These findings suggest that fire disturbance is most likely to increase biodiversity when post-fire environments are assembled from landscapes or regions that contain a high diversity of species traits.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In a companion experiment, we explored the interplay of fire disturbance, seed dispersal, and predation on plant species diversity. In each burned and unburned forest plot, we excluded predators (mammalian herbivores &amp; seed predators) using fences and compared these plots to unfenced control plots. The effect of seed dispersal on plant diversity was mediated by both fire and predation. Seed dispersal increased species diversity more in burned communities and when predators were excluded. These findings provide insights into ecological processes that can guide restoration of plant communities following fires, a topic of widespread interest among land managers using prescribed fires to conserve and restore human-altered ecosystems.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We have disseminated our results through:&nbsp;27 publications in 16 scientific journals; 2 PhD theses; 4 undergraduate honors theses;&nbsp;15 presentations at scientific conferences; 18 invited research talks; and 14 high school and undergraduate student presentations at midwestern research symposia at Washington University in St. Louis, the University of Chicago, and Indiana State University.
