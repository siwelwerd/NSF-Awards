 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is focused on developing an entirely new paradigm for auroral arc formation that, if correct, will be groundbreaking for auroral physics.  The dynamic auroras that appear in the polar regions are visual indicators of energy flowing into the atmosphere from disturbances raging in near-Earth space.  Electrons and ions, that power the auroral emissions, travel down magnetic field lines from these disturbances and must be further accelerated along the way. For several decades, the majority of the acceleration was thought to be the result of electrons and ions traversing quasi-static potential drops while moving down magnetic field lines.  These potential drops are created when two parallel oppositely-charged layers form in the plasma setting up an electric field and an associated voltage drop.  The auroral electrons are accelerated through the voltage drop creating a single energy peak. Recently the significance of time dependent acceleration of electrons by kinetic Alfven waves has become clear. Kinetic Alfven waves are formed under certain circumstances when Alfven waves (traveling along the magnetic field communicating the effects of changes elsewhere in the field) develop an electric field parallel to the background magnetic field.  In contrast to the previous mechanism, the parallel wave electric fields accelerate electrons over a broad energy range.   However, neither of these processes is well understood.  To complicate things, both processes are influenced by coupling and feedbacks with the ionosphere.  The PI has developed a compelling new theory that the two processes are related (i.e., that kinetic Alfven waves transition to a quasi-steady state forming parallel potential drops).  The focus here is on testing this theory.  Broader impacts of the work include the training of a graduate student and communication of results through public outreach. The research is expected to be of broad interest to other plasma physics communities. In the longer-term, it will contribute to better understanding of the space environment, resulting in improved forecasts, and the development of efficient mitigation strategies to protect vulnerable technologies of value to society.  \r\n\r\nThe approach combines theory and modeling with the goal of including a large range of temporal and spatial scales involved in the transition from time-dependent to quasi-steady conditions, a large parameter range, feedbacks through ionospheric reflection of the Alfven waves and by modifications of the ionospheric conductivity due to the precipitating electrons, as well as by the formation and effects of density cavities along the auroral field lines.   The primary tool is an already developed linearized two-fluid model, which will be modified to include: nonlinear electron dynamics along the magnetic field line and a realistic dipole magnetic field geometry.  This model combined with a kinetic electron model will be used to investigate the acceleration of electrons and their self-consistent interactions with the kinetic Alfven waves.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nUltra-Low-Frequency (ULF) waves are oscillations in the Earth's magnetic field that have periods ranging form 0.2 seconds to 15 minutes.  These waves are produced by the interactions of the Earth's magnetic field with the solar wind, a flow of charged particles emitted by the Sun.  One type of ULF wave can be likened to waves on a stringed instrument, like a guitar or violin, where each string has its own characteristic frequency.  Others are more like the oscillations inside a drum, filling a volume of space.  Our research shows how these waves can make an impact on the upper atmosphere of the Earth by providing the energy to accelerate charged particles tha impact the atmosphere, producing the aurora.  These waves accelerate electrons much like a surfer can gain energy by riding an ocean wave.  Some electrons can \"surf\" more efficiently than others, producing a wide range of electron energies.  This is in contrast to other processes that accelerate electrons all to almost the same energy.  The propagation of these waves is impacted by the structure of the Earth's magnetosphere, the region where the Earth's magnetic field dominates.  We have developed a model of the inner magnetosphere that accounts for these waves and describes their evolution.  We have focused in particular on the effects of the Earth's ionosphere, the upper atmospheric region in which the atmospheric gas becomes ionized.  The state of the ionosphere depends on the amount of sunlight it receives, being denser and more conductive to electrical currents during daylight as opposed to darkness.  These features might help understand the differences in the waves and in the aurora between northern and southern hemispheres.  Finally, we have begun to extend our work to the magnetosphere of Jupiter, which is now being measured by a NASA satellite called Juno that allows us, for the first time, to compare auroral acceleration processes in two different environments.  In the future, we might some day be able to observe these auroral processes happening in planets that orbit around other stars, which would indicate the presence of a magnetic field on these exoplanets.  Such a magnetic field might indicate an environment suitable for the development of life, although these considerations are very speculative at this time.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/06/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Robert L Lysak"
