(See http://www.bigdatau.org/innovationlab/.) This workshop will help generate research ideas and build teams of researchers to explore the challenges associated with big data generated by mobile sensors.  The development of these teams has the potential to transform the use of mobile devices in the biomedical sciences using science driven knowledge. \r\n\r\nThe 2016 Innovation Lab on Interdisciplinary Approaches to Biomedical Data Science will bring together researchers in quantitative and biomedical sciences with a goal of developing new research teams to work on problems in biomedical data science. The teams that are developed will pursue research in the use of mobile devices to collect health data, to deliver health care data to patients and practitioners, and to assist in the monitoring of health care patients. Funds from this award will support travel for participants to attend the workshop.",
