 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests continued support for the highly-successful Undergraduate ALFALFA Team (UAT), which has over the past 8 years provided research-based educational opportunities for 253 students closely collaborating with 25 faculty from a diverse range of universities.  Astronomy faculty from 20 institutions, predominantly small colleges in the northeast, carry out several related scientific programs that involve a radio survey of hydrogen in and around nearby galaxies.  They obtain new data at several observatories and analyze catalog data obtained at Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico.  Undergraduates will be intimately involved in all aspects of the scientific program, including planning and carrying out the observations. They will attend an annual workshop at either Green Bank Observatory or Arecibo Observatory. This program serves as a prime example of the value of scientific collaboration, particularly for faculty and students at isolated schools, and of the importance of research as a component of undergraduate education.  This exposure to front-line astronomical research enhances the educational infrastructure and the quality of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) at a large number of schools.  The program has an even wider impact through the curriculum and outreach materials they produce and share, and through broadening the participation of groups underrepresented in STEM.  Most students who go through the program continue in STEM-related careers.\r\n\r\nUAT projects will address major outstanding problems in astronomy and cosmology, such as the number and origin of optically-dark dwarf galaxies, the structure of large-scale filaments, pre-processing of HI gas outside clusters, and star formation in low-metallicity systems.  All of these programs are enabled by and make use of the ALFALFA (Arecibo Legacy Fast ALFA) HI survey, as well as new observations.  The main components of the program are (1) an annual workshop at either Arecibo Observatory or Green Bank Observatory; (2) observing runs at these and other radio and optical facilities; (3) summer and academic year undergraduate research projects; (4) collaborative research among faculty and students at the member schools.  The broader impact also has 4 main components: (1) enhancement of undergraduate education through direct involvement in research; (2) enhancement of educational infrastructure; (3) broad dissemination of curriculum and outreach materials; and (4) broadening participation of underrepresented groups.",

The objective of the UAT is to provide opportunities to undergraduate students and faculty at undergraduate-focused institutions to develop expertise in observational radio observations and its motivating science.

Partnering with Arecibo and Green Bank Observatories, we have offered opportunties to undergraduates and faculty to attend undergraduate workshops at national observatories and, via the normal proposal and awarding of observing time, participate in galaxy observations. We have worked with more than 450 undergraduates and 26 faculty to date, including 8 workshops onsite at Arecibo (148 undergraduates) and 5 workshops onsite at Green Bank Observatory (111 undergraduates), observing runs onsite at Arecibo (111 undergraduates), remote observing runs on campus, undergraduate research projects (226 academic year and 254 summer projects), and presentation of results by students and faculty at national meetings such as the AAS. <br /><br />The annual workshop fosters interactions and collaborative learning with faculty mentors, peers at other institutions, observatory staff, and ALFALFA scientists via lectures, observing sessions, and group work.

Tours and workshop observing sessions allow the students to gain an understanding of radio astronomy observations that they would not have achieved working in isolation at their home institutions. The workshop experience inspires further research participation by students: more than 80% of workshop attendees carried out a summer or academic year project and more than 40% were involved in more than one project.
