 "awd_abstract_narration": "The North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences (NCSM), the largest natural science museum in the Southeast, maintains a regionally significant and globally unique fossil collection that is growing in number, reputation, visibility, and usage. These paleontological specimens are currently housed in metal-sheathed wooden cabinetry that is structurally unsound, off-gases acidic byproducts of decay, and possesses deteriorated felted door-gaskets that prevent an air-tight seal. Such conditions pose an immediate security and conservation risk to NCMS fossil specimens, particularly to scientifically significant holdings that are deteriorating from pyrite disease. This project will rehouse the NCSM paleontological holdings into museum-grade steel cabinets with archival materials following best practices in specimen conservation. The project will also introduce underserved public school students to citizen science where they will improve open-access natural history specimen data via measurements and 3D models and will integrate deeply with multiple existing NCSM programmatic efforts including a youth science communication opportunity to document and broadcast the project in action to public school audiences. \r\n\r\nRehousing will greatly increase the security, value, and long-term research and educational viability of the NCSM Paleontological Collection, which includes significant holdings in Ediacaran invertebrates, Cretaceous - Cenozoic echinoids, and one of the most extensive collections of Late Triassic vertebrates from eastern North America. The Paleontological Collection is an active resource for research and education, including public university courses taught annually by museum staff either inside the museum's on-exhibition Paleontology Research Lab or in the collections area. These activities regularly engage graduate and undergraduate students, and museum visitors with specimen-based paleontological research. NCSM receives about 1 million visitors each year and is free to the public, engaging culturally and socio-economically diverse audiences. This project capitalizes on specimen rehousing to broadly impact existing NCSM programs as well as create new STEM opportunities targeted for pre-professionals at multiple levels (underserved 9-12, undergraduate, and graduate students). Initiatives include the launch of a new citizen science program - Junior Curator: Fossil Collections - designed to increase open-access morphological data from NCSM paleontological specimens and engage local underserved students. Other goals are aimed at garnering community engagement with natural history collections by broadcasting a behind-the-scenes peek at collections care via live, scientist-to-classroom connections within the North Carolina Public School System; new content creation via NCSM's digital media production program TeenTV; monthly presentations in the NCSM's free Daily Planet Theater; and established NCSM social media platforms (e.g., multiple blog sites, Twitter, and live expedition websites.) Planned professional deliverables include iDigBio webinars. Results can be viewed at (collections.naturalsciences.org). This project will also support NCSM's demonstrated commitment to increasing accessibility of the Paleontological Collection as an external research resource.  All paleontology collections at NCSM were recently registered with GRBIO and Earth Cube, and can be accessed via the Museum's website, The Gobal Biodiversity Information Facility, VertNet (invertebrate and vertebrate paleontology collections only) and iDigBio (idigbio.org).",

NCSM began housing paleontological collections in the early 1900?s and currently maintains a regionally impactful and globally unique fossil collection that is growing in number, reputation, visibility, and usage. Prior to this award, fossil specimens were housed in historical cabinetry that was rapidly deteriorating and posed an immediate security and conservation risk and the fossil cabinetry was overloaded, such that NCSM researchers could not continue to collect and properly house important fossil specimens. As a result of this award, staff at the NCSM conducted a 3-year comprehensive inventory of all fossil specimens, conserved and repaired specimens that were breaking apart due to environmental conditions, updated and corrected specimen databases, and rehoused the three NCSM fossil collections--Paleobotany, Invertebrate Paleontology, and Vertebrate Paleontology--into museum-grade steel cabinets with archival materials that will ensure the long-term conservation of specimens.&nbsp; Collections spaces in the NCSM now include room for several decades of growth in fossil holdings.  The project team also tested and refined new approaches to caring for fossil specimens deteriorating from Pyrite Disease and Byne?s Disease, presented these techniques at several international conferences, and held workshops in both the US and abroad training other museum professionals in the treatment of these common conservation issues.  As a result of this award, the newly updated NCSM paleontological collections databases were enhanced with 2D &amp; 3D image galleries, which are now freely accessible online and thus available for researchers, educational institutions, and public audiences to explore and enjoy.  Finally, the project team also spearheaded several initiatives designed to increase public access to the NCSM paleontological collections and provide STEM opportunities for underserved communities.  These included: 1) the design and launch of a new citizen science program dubbed FossilPhiles that introduced middle and high school students to the value of natural history collections and provided an open-access, 3D model gallery for the public including many of our most significant fossil holdings; 2) internship experiences for minority undergraduate students who were trained in advanced visualization technologies and natural science careers; and 3) teen engagement in STEM through the production of media content that documented and broadcast the project in action including social media posts, videos, and blogs. </span><span>Results can be viewed at </span><a href=\"http://collections.naturalsciences.org/\"><span>http://collections.naturalsciences.org/</span></a><span> and </span><a href=\"https://fossilphiles.wordpress.com/3d-fossil-database/\"><span>https://fossilphiles.wordpress.com</span></a><span>.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 11/27/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Lindsay&nbsp;Zanno</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1560871/1560871_10448375_1574901557395_screen-shot-2016-11-10-at-3-48-33-pm--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1560871/1560871_10448375_1574901557395_screen-shot-2016-11-10-at-3-48-33-pm--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"3D Dromicosuchus\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1560871/1560871_10448375_1574901557395_screen-shot-2016-11-10-at-3-48-33-pm--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"3D Dromicosuchus\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">3D model of the holotype specimen of Dromicosuchus, an extinct crocodile relative known only from the Triassic of North Carolina.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Lindsay Zanno</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Lindsay&nbsp;Zanno</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">3D Dromicosuchus</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1560871/1560871_10448375_1574901898053_c1geztoxcaa3uwz--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1560871/1560871_10448375_1574901898053_c1geztoxcaa3uwz--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"FossilPhiles team 2016\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1560871/1560871_10448375_1574901898053_c1geztoxcaa3uwz--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"FossilPhiles team 2016\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Middle school students create digital models of important fossil specimens to be uploaded into the public NCSM 3D fossil gallery</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Lindsay Zanno</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Lindsay&nbsp;Zanno</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">FossilPhiles team 2016</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1560871/1560871_10448375_1574902090133_fish--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1560871/1560871_10448375_1574902090133_fish--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"visitors watching project\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1560871/1560871_10448375_1574902090133_fish--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"visitors watching project\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Over 1 million visitors per year watched the conservation of fossil specimens at the NCSM supported by this award</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Lindsay Zanno</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Lindsay&nbsp;Zanno</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">visitors watching project</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1560871/1560871_10448375_1574902261384_20170313_1500031--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1560871/1560871_10448375_1574902261384_20170313_1500031--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"osteoderm model\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1560871/1560871_10448375_1574902261384_20170313_1500031--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"osteoderm model\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A unique specimen representing the bony neck armor of a Triassic animal is readied for photogrammetry by the FossilPhiles team.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Lindsay Zanno</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Lindsay&nbsp;Zanno</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">osteoderm model</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
