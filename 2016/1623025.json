The Interdepartmental Hurricane Operations/Research Forum is sponsored by the National Science Foundation, NOAA Office of Atmospheric and Oceanic Research, and the Office of Naval Research.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:\r\nAt the Interdepartmental Hurricane Operations/Research Forum, representatives from the academic research community, industry and Federal agencies will have the opportunity to discuss the latest research on tropical cyclone observing, forecasting, and warning such as:\r\n1. Review of the 2015 hurricane/typhoon season to gauge current capabilities, progress toward addressing operational challenges, and priorities for future research.\r\n2. Research priorities of the operational centers\r\n3. Observations and observing strategies\r\n4. Tropical cyclone model development\r\n5. Transitioning research to operations\r\n6. Advances in tropical cyclone forecast and warning products and services, including social science applications\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:\r\nThe workshop is important to the Nation because it brings together the academic research community, industry, Federal agencies and other user communities such as emergency management, to prepare for the upcoming hurricane season and make improvements to the Nation's hurricane forecasting and warning program.",
