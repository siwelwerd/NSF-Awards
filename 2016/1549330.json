 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this project lies in the accessibility and accuracy of the proposed system. By eliminating the hurdle of using Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) for farmers, agricultural field scouting becomes more accessible and will lead to wider adoption, which will lead to significant new market for UAS in agriculture. This system will provide significant savings to crop-growers by allowing targeted application of chemicals. More than $8 billion dollars are spent on herbicide and pesticides in US annually, and the high quality data from the proposed system will lead to a more efficient use of resources in agriculture, which will provide significant savings to farmers, while at the same time, help reduce the release of chemicals and other pollutants into the environment. Wide spread usage of this system will also allow greater data accumulation from a wider geospatial, higher temporal spectrum that is desperately needed for the agricultural Big Data efforts aimed at further advancements in the precision farming decision support systems.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will examine the feasibility of developing a system that will have near real time agricultural data collection/processing capabilities using Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) and tablet computers. The lack of a high-resolution data collection system is a great stumbling block to current precision agriculture technology. Existing methods of data collection are time consuming and yield low-quality data. Current aerial data collection methods (include some that utilize UAS) preclude on-site image processing, and delays the delivery of time-sensitive field situation reports. The proposed system will test novel data collection and data pre-processing methods that eliminate computationally expensive algorithms thereby allowing on-site data processing using tablet pcs. This goal will be reached by utilizing over a decade worth of accumulated crop data to develop the optimum data collection processes and data processing algorithms. The end result will be a prototype system that will provide high-quality agricultural data that meet the farmers? requirement in spatial and temporal resolutions.",

By providing farmers and agricultural companies a way to collect real-time data regarding their crops and fields, improved management decisions can be made that will increase the overall efficiency of field operations, reduce the use of excess resources and chemicals without negatively impacting yield, and save on costs of operation. The goal of this project was to develop a comprehensive and easy-to-use data-to-solutions &ldquo;Precision Farming Operating System&rdquo; (PFOS). This system will enable a crop grower to deploy a fully automatic unmanned aerial system (UAS) in day-to-day field operations and retrieve data in real-time. Despite the resources devoted to develop agricultural UAS platforms over the recent years, there has been a significant void of a knowledge-based and user-friendly interface that will anchor this exciting technology to real-life farming applications. The proposed system will provide the missing link that will enable farmers to unlock the full potential of UAS in agriculture operations. The system was developed using research findings from the Illinois Laboratory for Agricultural Remote Sensing (ILARS), which is a renowned precision agriculture and remote sensing group at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. ILARS is a pioneer in research utilizing unmanned aerial systems for precision agriculture applications, and their real-time field tower systems have been continuously collecting remote sensing data from crop fields since 1999. Ag-Sensus, LLC is the brainchild that emerged from this project and has an exclusive license with the University of Illinois to access and use decades worth of research data from this laboratory in the product development.</p>\n<p>Using aerial imagery for precision agriculture purposes is not a new concept, and the use of unmanned aerial vehicles to collect images has become increasingly prevalent. Despite the adoption of this promising technology, current uses are severely limited by traditional image processing techniques, which takes significant time before providing useful data. As a farmer, quick decisions are vital to protecting crops and guaranteeing the highest yield possible. The Ag-Sensus Precision Farming Operating System allows the autonomous control of the UAS and &ldquo;knowledge-based data collection and image processing&rdquo; to be completed on a tablet computer, thus providing time-sensitive information that can be used by farmers immediately after data collection. The proposed activity has the potential to revolutionize data collection by eliminating the need for off-site processing thanks to cloud computing and a robust image processing algorithm. In-person demonstrations with farmers and agriculture companies were conducted to present the beta version of the system that has been developed thus far, and positive feedback and interest were received. During the 2016 growing season, almost 100 test or demonstration flights were performed, with over 3,000 images taken that covered over 25,000 acres of farmland in more than 15 primary locations, mostly in central Illinois. A functional beta version of the Precision Farming Operating System was created which generated significant interest and excitement from farmers and companies for the upcoming growing season. A handful of the beta units were sold. One of the major digital agriculture companies in the industry has initiated a project with Ag-Sensus to provide a special licensed version of the software for their customer base. Besides the support from university of Illinois, the investigators have also received support from major players in the industry who have expressed interest in collaborative projects.</p>\n<p><span>The industry understands that smarter decisions need to be made sooner rather than later, and having real-time, actionable data is the future of farming. The ability to collect high-quality field data in real-time is the first critical step for agriculture big data research efforts. In the long run, a successful outcome will be determined by the ability for farmers to improve their management practices based on real-time results from the proposed system, whether by saving money, resources, and time, or by increasing their yields. Additional success will be achieved through the development of additional partnerships and collaborations with businesses and organizations in the agriculture industry. By streamlining the process between having relevant information and putting it into action, the Precision Farming Operating System by Ag-Sensus can help tie precision agriculture processes together to truly improve the efficiency of farming, help the environment, and feed the world. </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/30/2016<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Lei&nbsp;F&nbsp;Tian</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1549330/1549330_10429554_1483121318600_Outcomefigure3--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1549330/1549330_10429554_1483121318600_Outcomefigure3--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Ag-Sensus Outcome Figures 3\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1549330/1549330_10429554_1483121318600_Outcomefigure3--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Ag-Sensus Outcome Figures 3\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Image processing examples from the field trials (the top raw is raw mosaic images and the bottom crop indices maps) of the near-real-time remote sensing system.
