 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this award, funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms (CSDM-A) Program of the Division of Chemistry, Professor Arthur G. Suits of Wayne State University and his graduate student, undergraduate student and post-doctoral researcher colleagues are investigating the physical and chemical properties of important small molecules. The ultimate goal of the work by Professor Suits and his group is to develop a better understanding of the reactivity of atmospherically important or chemically interesting molecules.  The young researchers working on this project will receive training in state-of-the art methods from a leader in the field of physical chemistry.\r\n\r\nProf. Suits and his research group will use imaging of spin-polarized hydrogen atoms produced from excited polyatomic molecules to unravel the details of the photochemistry of important molecules, including water and methane.  The results from work like this will help scientists understand the photochemistry of planetary atmospheres.  In further experiments, the Suits Group will use a chirped-pulse, uniform flow spectrometer to study the reaction kinetics of unstable chemical intermediates, including exotic species like HOONO.  The goal of this study is to understand the important role that these fleeting intermediates play in complex, real-world reacting systems.",
