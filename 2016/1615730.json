 "awd_abstract_narration": "The team will study the gaseous outflows, or winds, from about 500 galaxies.  Winds are thought to cause important changes in galaxies.  The team will use ultraviolet observations to examine the properties of the winds.  They will look for so-called scaling laws, a powerful approach that could not be taken before because not enough observations were available.  The team will use models and simulations to try to mimic the properties of the winds.  Senior team members will train junior members.  The team will bring Latino students and families to Lick Observatory.  During these visits, talks and displays for the public will be presented in Spanish.\r\n\r\nThe team will investigate galactic winds at redshifts of 0.7 to 1.5, a key cosmic era during which galaxies assumed their modern forms.  Their goals are to (1) use rest-frame ultraviolet spectra to conduct a census of the properties of galactic winds; (2) establish scaling laws for galactic winds, aided by abundant ancillary data; and (3) use models and simulations to mock the observations and thus identify viable theories for galactic winds.",

Advances in our knowledge and understanding of the origin, nature, and evolution of galaxies reveal the earliest chapters in human history and our cosmic roots. Our NSF research grapples with two basic questions:</p>\n<p>1) Galaxies come in a myriad of shapes, forms, sizes, and colors (see Fig.1). How many properties are enough to accurately characterize a galaxy?&nbsp; These numbers and their relationships (scaling relations), are key inputs that theorists need to build and test their models of galaxies.</p>\n<p>2) Galaxies evolve through a life cycle, forming stars from fresh gas in their youth but fading into quiescence in their old age. How does this \"quenching\" happen? One way says that supernovae explosions from new stars heat and expel the surrounding gas in galactic \"winds\", thereby cutting off the gas supply. Another says that winds are powered by black holes growing at the galaxy centers. Each process (feedback) predicts different winds and scaling relations. Our efforts focus on understanding both.</p>\n<p><strong>WHAT DID WE DISCOVER?</strong></p>\n<p>A) We assembled among the deepest set of spectra to study outflowing galactic winds. One important result is that some winds are driven from across the face of a galaxy, not just its center, as some had thought. Thus outer new stars might also be important agents driving such winds. Fig. 2&nbsp; shows one example, where a wind appears to emanate from an outer blue arc of young stars. A second, but still tentative, result is that winds have the same speed in both low- and high-mass galaxies. This also counters prevailing theories and is an important new datum for wind models.</p>\n<p>Our comparison of galaxy properties and scaling laws yielded several new conclusions:</p>\n<p>B) Two long-standing parameters used to describe galaxies are mass and star-formation rate.&nbsp; In previous NSF grants, we pioneered a third parameter, central stellar density (&Sigma;1),&nbsp;and showed that &Sigma;1 is the most accurate predictor of quenching (when combined with mass). In the present grant, we explored 63 additional parameters using data from a local galaxy survey (SDSS). We found that one more number, the color change/gradient (G) from center to outskirts, is needed to describe a galaxy. In other words, each galaxy can be represented as a point in a four-dimensional parameter space consisting of mass, star-formation rate, central density &Sigma;1, and color gradient G. Any successful theory of galaxy formation needs to explain the distribution of galaxies in this basic space.</p>\n<p>C) The color gradient G measures the difference between the star formation rate in the center of a galaxy and the rate in the outer parts. We find that G changes as galaxies evolve and that galaxies of different masses follow different tracks in G versus star-formation rate (SFR).&nbsp; Furthermore, G plus SFR can be used to link galaxy progenitors with their descendants over time, which &nbsp;has been a long-sought goal of galaxy studies over decades. We are now exploring whether advanced computer techniques, such as cluster analysis, can improve finding these evolutionary tracks.</p>\n<p>D) The star-formation rate is an important barometer of how far galaxies have progressed in their life cycles, being higher for younger galaxies. We discovered two important results for youthful galaxies in the active star-forming phase. First, the best, single predictor of SFR (besides mass) is the presence of distortions, lopsidedness, and tails in images of galaxies. Such irregularities suggest that star formation may be stimulated by galaxy collisions. At the same time, we found that the star-formation rate for galaxies of the same mass does NOT appreciably depend on galaxy radius (see Fig. 3) and argued that this negative result has deep implications for how gas falls into galaxies and is ejected in galactic winds.</p>\n<p>E) In addition to its role in quenching, &Sigma;1 is also seen to correlate with black-hole mass. These two facts together point strongly to the conclusion that black-hole feedback is the central agent causing galaxy quenching. We used that idea to construct a toy model for how galaxies build their black holes and quench over time. The model matches the boundary between quenched and star-forming galaxies in the space of &Sigma;1<sub>&nbsp;</sub>versus mass. Additional implications are that denser galaxies with high &Sigma;1 build their black-holes faster (Fig. 4) and that star-formation stops when ejected black-hole energy exceeds four times the amount of energy needed to unbind the gas from a galaxy's halo. The model is being used by our group and others to test more realistic simulations of galaxy formation.</p>\n<p><strong>BROADER IMPACTS</strong></p>\n<p>This grant inaugurated&nbsp;<em>La Noche de las Estrellas,</em>&nbsp;a field-trip to Lick Observatory program mostly in Spanish&nbsp;for local Latinx high school students and their families.&nbsp; It is now a regular donor-supported program.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 06/06/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: David&nbsp;Koo</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1615730/1615730_10432115_1654420305023_HST_StephanQuintet--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1615730/1615730_10432115_1654420305023_HST_StephanQuintet--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Fig. 1  Myriad of  Galaxy Types\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1615730/1615730_10432115_1654420305023_HST_StephanQuintet--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Fig. 1  Myriad of  Galaxy Types\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Note the variety of shapes; presence of bars (upper right), spiral arms and loops; smoothness (lower left is a smooth red -thus quiescent - elliptical shaped galaxy); colors; and sizes (the upper left  blue galaxy is 7 times closer and thus 7 times smaller than others in this group).</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Hubble Space Telescope</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">David&nbsp;Koo</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Fig. 1  Myriad of  Galaxy Types</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1615730/1615730_10432115_1654417766623_IMG_0402--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1615730/1615730_10432115_1654417766623_IMG_0402--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Fig. 3  Diverse Sizes for Galaxies of Same Mass\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1615730/1615730_10432115_1654417766623_IMG_0402--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Fig. 3  Diverse Sizes for Galaxies of Same Mass\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Boxes shown with 4 masses and at 5 recent (top) to older times (redshift).
