 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award, the Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Chemistry Division is funding Dr. Christopher Calderone from Carleton College.  Small molecules, produced by microbial cells and known as non-ribosomal peptides are the source of dozens of clinically useful medicines, including antibiotics and anticancer drugs.  The structures of these molecules is incredibly complex and diverse, but they are all produced by \"assembly lines\" that are made up of only a handful of different types of repeating biological machinery.  This research is identifying new types of biological assembly line machinery that can explain the origins of a large number of non-ribosomal peptides and ultimately allow the design of new varieties that are not currently accessible.  The new varieties could have valuable therapeutic potential.  An additional important component of this project is the development of the LearningWorks program in downtown Minneapolis to teach underserved middle-school students molecular biology concepts and techniques. \r\n\r\nThis research is aimed at characterizing a predicted subclass of condensation domains involved in non-ribosomal peptide biosynthesis.  Though non-ribosomal peptide synthetases have been extensively studied over the past decades, mechanistic reasoning and bioinformatic analysis suggests that there is a broadly distributed, but as-yet uncharacterized, subclass of the condensation domain involved that is able to catalyze dehydration in addition to canonical amide-bond formation.  These experiments are aimed at reconstituting the biosynthetic pathway from Pseudomonas aeruginosa that leads to aminomethoxy-trans-butenoic acid (AMB) in vitro, the centerpiece of which is a predicted condensation domain-catalyzed dehydration.  In addition, this funding supports the development of educational modules for incorporation into the undergraduate teaching lab and the curriculum of LearningWorks, a public-private partnership in downtown Minneapolis that serves middle-school students from underserved populations.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOverview:  In this award, Dr. Chris Calderone (Carleton College) proposed the existence of a new class of enzyme involved in the production of complex molecules by bacteria.  Many of these ?natural products? have therapeutic value, and increasing our understanding of the types of enzymes involved in their production could lead to identification of new natural products with potential therapeutic value or the engineering of novel ?unnatural? products.  Key components of this work included the training of undergraduates both in the research laboratory and in the teaching laboratory, as well as development of outreach activities in collaboration with the LearningWorks program in Minneapolis.\n\n \n\nIntellectual Merit:  Non-ribosomal peptides (NRP) are a class of natural products made up of several amino acid subunits linked together.  Examples of NRP include antibiotics, antifungals, and chemotherapeutics.  The NRP are produced by a class of enzyme known as a non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS).  NRPS are made up of multiple modules that are arranged linearly and act as an assembly line, with each module adding a single amino acid to the NRP as it is produced.  Because of this assembly-line-like architecture, it is possible to link a particular NRPS module with the amino acid it incorporates.  However, there are many instances where this relationship breaks down, revealing gaps in our understanding of NRP production.  One such gap is exemplified by the chemotherapeutic bleomycin among others including syringomycin and syringopeptin.  Specifically, it appears that modules within these assembly lines incorporate hydroxylated amino acids, but in the actual products these amino acids contain alkene bonds instead of hydroxyls, suggesting that there is a previously unknown activity within NRPS capable of converting hydroxylated amino acids to alkene-containing amino acids.  At one of these predicted sites in bleomycin, we confirmed that an alkene-containing amino acid is in fact generated from a hydroxylated amino acid, confirming the existence of this novel enzymatic activity.\n\n \n\nBroader Impacts:  A key component of this award is the development of course laboratory modules that would involve undergraduates in Carleton?s biochemistry course sequence in this research.  Over the course of the award, these modules have been implemented in five offerings of the course, involving over 100 undergraduates.  The award also supported three Carleton undergraduates who served as faculty members in the LearningWorks college preparatory program.  LearningWorks serves high-potential middle-school students from the Minneapolis Public Schools, and the collaboration between Carleton and LearningWorks initiated by this award not only supports LearningWorks?s mission but also provides the Carleton student-faculty the opportunity to be trained as educators.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/28/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Christopher Calderone"
