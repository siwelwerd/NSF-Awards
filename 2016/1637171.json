 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will develop SKOPE (Synthesizing Knowledge of Past Environments), a freely available Web site that will provide easy access to state-of-the-art measurements and reconstructions of long-term environmental data, such as rainfall, temperature, plant and animal distributions, streamflow, and soils. Given a time period and a location, it will display the data graphically and will permit users to download the original high-resolution environmental data. By enabling scholars to easily discover, explore, visualize, and synthesize knowledge of environmental stability and change over centuries or millennia, SKOPE will empower reproducible research on the effects of climatic variation on human societies and the substantial impacts of humans on ancient and modern environments. It will also facilitate ongoing improvement of paleoenvironmental reconstructions. SKOPE will transform vast amounts of prior data collection, modeling, and research into usable environmental knowledge, enhancing the infrastructure of scientific research in such diverse disciplines as agronomy, anthropology, archaeology, ecology, economics, geography, political science, sociology, and sustainability. SKOPE will also make available publicly funded paleoenvironmental data and models to users in industry and government. For example, planners will be able to use SKOPE?s long-term environmental reconstructions to investigate vulnerabilities in infrastructure not revealed by historical experience (for example, streamflow or rainfall regimes outside the ranges of those documented historically). Students will have free access to high-quality environmental scenarios in which to situate their studies. Members of the general public will be able to see how ancient environments differed from those of today. Expanding the community able to obtain and use paleoenvironmental information will increase public scientific literacy and public engagement with science and technology.\r\n\r\nRecent research has demonstrated that investigations of contemporary societal problems can benefit from the use of long-term environmental data and from comparisons with cases in which the interactions of human societies with their environments is well-documented over centuries. By providing easy access to time- and place-specific long-term environmental data, this project seeks to facilitate those efforts. SKOPE addresses two critical challenges to contemporary science: increasing access to publicly funded research; and ensuring that scientific results are transparent and reproducible. SKOPE will enable users to easily discover, download, visualize, and explore many sources of paleoenvironmental data that resulted from publicly funded research that are now difficult (at best) to find and use. SKOPE will also provide robust support for reproducible scientific research. Datasets provided by SKOPE will be accompanied by a systematic, comprehensible record of their origin and computational derivation, giving researchers an unprecedented ability to understand how the data were obtained.",

Consequently, numerous scholars who are not experts in reconstructing past environmental conditions require environmental knowledge specific to their spatial and temporal research contexts.&nbsp; By enabling such scholars to easily discover, explore, visualize, and synthesize knowledge of environments in the recent or remote past, SKOPE aims to enhance research and education in such diverse disciplines as anthropology, archaeology, ecology, economics, geography, political science, sociology, and sustainability.</p>\n<p>Many sophisticated reconstructions of past climate have been created and some of these are available online. However, most are impossible to access and use without highly specialized knowledge lacked by most potential users. Our previous project (SKOPE I) aimed to understand scholars' needs for paleoenvironmental data and the technical challenges they face in finding, accessing, and making effective and meaningful use of such data in their research. SKOPE II builds on the understanding so gained to (1) deliver a web-based application that addresses the most critical requirements of scholars who need to find and employ paleoenvironmental data, and to (2) begin to address the fundamental technical challenge of making extremely diverse data sets available through a unified user interface and web application.</p>\n<p>Fully understanding the technical requirements for the SKOPE web application entailed evaluating a number of distinct architectures and developing multiple, working prototypes of the overall application over the course of the SKOPE II project. The final, production-ready implementation of the SKOPE web-application front end employs industry best practices and is based on NuxtJS, a modern, well-documented and maintainable open source software framework for building pure JavaScript rich web applications. Careful attention was placed on usability, high-quality geospatial visualizations, and streamlined analysis workflows for viewing a dataset, visualizing data across different spatio-temporal contexts, and performing basic statistical queries on time series data. The web application employs a single Python FastAPI-based backend service that handles requests for metadata, time series data, and summary statistics with a documented OpenAPI compatible interface (<a href=\"https://api.openskope.org/docs\">https://api.openskope.org/docs</a>). The SKOPE application integrates with the industry-standard GeoServer service to provide geospatial visualizations of data. Public access to the final version of the SKOPE web application is provided at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://app.openskope.org/\">https://app.openskope.org/</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This&nbsp;final version of SKOPE makes four datasets available to users: Two versions of PaleoCAR (V2 and V3), both of which provide yearly high-spatial-resolution reconstructions of climate parameters relevant to biotic production on landscapes of the US Southwest derived from tree-ring analyses using techniques based on Bocinsky and Kohler (2014).</p>\n<p>V2 reconstructs&nbsp;May-Sept growing degree days, net water-year precipitation, and the direct precipitation maize farming niche for the period from 1 to 2000 CE. V3 reconstructs &nbsp;net growing season growing degree days, net calendar-year precipitation, net water-year precipitation, and net growing-season precipitation from 103 to 2000 CE.</p>\n<p>The Living Blended Drought Atlas (LBDA) Version 2, which provides a yearly reconstruction for the Continental United States of the Summer Modified Palmer Drought Index at .5 degree (~55.5km) spatial resolution from 1 ? 2017 CE, based on Cook et al.
