 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project funded by the Environmental Chemical Science Program in the Chemistry Division at the National Science Foundation, Professor Young-Shin Jun of Washington University in St. Louis examines changes in manganese compounds on exposure to the environment.  The natural abundance of manganese is a primary motivation for studying its roles in natural and man-made environmental processes.  Many manganese-contaminated lands result from human activities (e. g., acid mine drainage and contamination from urban atmospheres).  Understanding the changes in various manganese-containing species on exposure to the environment is crucial to controlling manganese concentrations in drinking water.  With support from Washington University's Institute for School Partnership (ISP), Professor Jun develops an \"Environmental Chemistry and Energy\" themed lecture series, with experimental chemistry and computer modeling experiments. Professor Jun's research findings are incorporated into university courses in Environmental Nanochemistry and Aquatic Chemistry. These educational activities provide development opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students. The educational activities are evaluated periodically by faculty from the ISP.\r\n\r\nThe rich redox reactivity of manganese is of interest in engineered systems, such as in batteries and catalyzed water oxidation. This project provides fundamental thermodynamic and kinetic information about manganese (Mn) oxidation and subsequent manganese oxide (delta-MnO2) nanosheet nucleation and growth. The research project utilizes multidisciplinary tools to investigate the early stages of delta MnO2 nanosheet nucleation and in situ growth at the molecular scale. Small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) / grazing incidence SAXS provides real-time information. Changes in mineral phases and mineral morphologies are studied with various X-ray techniques and electron microscopies. Fluid chemistry and electrochemical measurements are also be made. Furthermore, the synthesized delta-MnO2 is tested for its applications as an effective, environmentally-abundant cathode in a lithium-ion battery. This project provides useful information for developing sustainable energy materials.",
