 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is focused on developing the next generation of ultra-precise atomic clocks, and using these clocks for fundamental physics applications. It is expected to advance the frontiers of modern time-keeping technology. Historically, the exquisite precision of atomic clocks has enabled both foundational tests of modern physics, e.g., testing hypothetical variations of fundamental constants, such as the strength of electromagnetic interactions, as well as practical applications, such as the construction of the Global Positioning System. This research program will also investigate the use of precision devices, such as atomic clocks and atom interferometers, to probe the nature of dark matter. Revealing the microscopic nature of dark matter, which has been discovered through astrophysical observations on a galactic scale, is one of the grand challenges of modern physics. This theoretical and computational program will be conducted by the Principal Investigator in collaboration with a Research Assistant working toward a doctoral degree, thereby contributing to graduate education. Additionally, the research will be carried out in Nevada, a state which is historically underrepresented in the scientific enterprise. \r\n\r\nVirialized ultralight scalar fields are cold dark matter candidates which, if detected, could also solve the hierarchy problem of the Standard Model of elementary particles. Detecting such fields requires using low-energy precision measurement devices such as atomic clocks and matter wave interferometers primarily developed by the atomic physics community. The goal of this work is to analyze the sensitivity of precision measurement tools to virialized ultralight scalar fields and to identify dark matter signatures, with a specific focus on atomic clocks and matter wave interferometry. Another goal is to reach the next level of accuracy in atomic time-keeping by exploring atomic properties of highly-charged ions. As previously shown by the Principal Investigator, suitable candidate ions must satisfy criteria set by experimentalists. This research will use tools of theoretical and computational physics, including relativistic atomic structure codes and various techniques from atomic physics, quantum optics, quantum field theory and cosmology.",
