This project has the potential to create an appreciation in a wide audience of the history of science on the Antarctic and the contrast with contemporary scientific infrastructure that makes science possible.\r\n\r\nThe artist's goal is to make a visual connection between the historic huts of the first scientific explorers--as the earliest occupied 'scientific structures' on the continent--and current field stations and science stations, by photographing the architecture of Antarctica and presenting it in a chronological way.\r\n\r\nThe photographer will seek out buildings and structures which represent various time periods, to show the transitions over time. He also hopes to document how the functions of various buildings have evolved, how the extreme weather is accommodated, how people shape their living and work space, and look at details of materials and how they have withstood the extreme weather.\r\n\r\nSecondarily, he wishes to visit scientists in the field who are working in the same locations as the early scientists and explorers. With an eye to the \"continuity, or discontinuity of the science being done in the places that were first studied 100 years ago.\"\r\n\r\nThis architectural and archival record will include a comprehensive look at McMurdo Station, the nation's largest Antarctic research station, capturing the facilities as  moment in time, which will have value for future generations.\r\n\r\nThe National Science Foundation provides access to US Antarctic Program activities in Antarctica but does not provide funding for this work.",
