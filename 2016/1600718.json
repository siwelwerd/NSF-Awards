 "awd_abstract_narration": "The repeated application of a function produces sequences of values whose behavior can be quite surprising.  Such discrete dynamical systems occur as models throughout science and engineering.  Polynomials and rational functions of a single variable provide basic examples of non-invertible, algebraic, discrete dynamical systems by iteration. Even the simplest families of examples exhibit complicated and chaotic dynamical behavior; the most famous is the family of quadratic polynomials where a point x is mapped to x \"squared\" plus a constant. The constant can be a real or complex number. This family gives rise to the Mandelbrot set, which continues to baffle researchers. A fundamental problem in the mathematical study of these systems is to characterize their stability: under what circumstances -- and by how much -- can we perturb a system while maintaining its long-term dynamical features? The primary goal of this research project is to explore connections between the stability of algebraic dynamical systems and the algebraic or geometric structures that are preserved under iteration. The first connections between the algebra and dynamics of these models were discovered in the 19th century. This project will exploit modern tools from arithmetic geometry and dynamical systems to strengthen these connections and deepen our understanding of the systems themselves. \r\n\r\nThe project studies: (1) the arithmetic properties of elliptic curves and abelian varieties, with dynamical methods; (2) a series of substantial conjectures about \"unlikely intersections\" in moduli spaces of dynamical systems; and (3) the 3-dimensional Euclidean geometry of a rational function, with curvature form equal to its measure of maximal entropy. The main goal of this project is to build relations between the algebra and the geometry of dynamical systems on algebraic varieties, with an eye towards applications in Diophantine geometry. The second goal of the project is a study of rational maps in dimension one, particularly an exploration of the canonical shape of the dynamical system and its stability properties. In recent work, the investigator and collaborator developed new methods of proof incorporating tools from both complex and non-Archimedean analysis and formulated a conjecture about the dynamics of rational maps that encompasses known results about elliptic curves. This project aims to investigate particular cases of this conjecture while developing the theory to connect these results to the study of the symmetries and stability and invariants of complex dynamical systems in dimensions one and two.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe goal of this project was to explore connections between the theory of dynamical systems and the geometry and arithmetic of solutions to certain polynomial equations.  The focus was primarily on the dynamics of polynomial and rational functions with complex coefficients, viewed as maps from the Riemann sphere to itself.  Repeated iteration of the function corresponds to the passing of time, and dynamical systems theory has the goal of describing the long-term behavior of orbits (the motion of a single point under repeated application of the map).  These systems are the most basic, being models for more complicated dynamical systems, with features that arise universally.  Yet, even in this simplest of settings, there is much we have not yet understood.  The primary link between the dynamical systems and the algebraic objects comes through the study of elliptic curves; these are geometric objects that form the set of solutions to certain cubic polynomial equations in 2 variables.  These curves have a group structure, and fundamental questions remain open about the geometric configuration of the torsion points on these curves.  \n\n \n\nThe main achievement of this project was the successful application of dynamical systems theory to the study of the torsion-point configurations on elliptic curves, via a study of particular maps on the Riemann sphere called Latt&egrave;s maps which arise as quotients of endomorphisms of elliptic curves.  \n\n \n\nA secondary goal of this project was to explore features of the dynamical systems themselves, with the ultimate aim of obtaining a complete description of their geometry and possible orbit types, especially when the map or a point is defined over certain restricted types of fields, such as a number field or the function field of a curve. \n\n \n\nSupported by this grant, I published 7 articles, and 3 more articles were accepted for publication.  The results supported by this grant are published in peer-reviewed journals.  The articles are also available on my webpage.  To share these results, I gave regular lectures in seminars, departmental colloquia, and conferences around the United States and the world.\n\n \n\nBroader Impact.  The research involved is fundamental to our understanding of complex dynamical systems and related questions in arithmetic geometry.  It is connected to many areas of pure mathematics, including complex analysis, dynamical systems and ergodic theory, geometric topology, and number theory.  Outside of pure mathematics, there are also interesting computational and algorithmic questions that arose and were addressed in certain components of the project.  One of my graduate students completed her PhD degree during this 3-year period, working on arithmetic properties of orbits for polynomials with rational coefficients.  I currently have 3 PhD students continuing towards their degrees under my supervision.  I have also supervised 4 postdoctoral researchers while supported by this grant.  Outside of my home institution, Northwestern University, I am lecturing all over the world, and I have repeatedly given lecture series at special week-long schools.  I have also given a number of public lectures on this work and how it fits into a broader, historical mathematical context.\n\n\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/21/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Laura Demarco"
