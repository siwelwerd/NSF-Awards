 "awd_abstract_narration": "Water plays a unique role in the planetary evolution of Earth, particularly at subduction zones.  The recycling of oceanic water into the mantle at subduction zones, the tectonic setting where continental crust forms, triggers partial melting and the formation of hydrous basalts, which differentiate to form continental crust, unique to Earth within our solar system.  One of the many challenges associated with the study of hydrous basalts is that current thermometers cannot be accurately applied to them.  The goal of this project is to calibrate a Ni-based olivine-melt thermometer, which is independent of melt water contents and can thus be applied to hydrous basalts to obtain accurate temperatures of formation.  It will also allow the concentration of water in basaltic liquids to be determined at the onset of crystallization.  This project will engage two Ph.D. graduate students and at least three undergraduate students, who will be trained in the operation of various experimental apparatus and analytical techniques, as well as thermodynamic modeling; all of these tools and skills have important applications in material science.  The project will support students from underrepresented groups in a research team that has demonstrated a commitment to expanding the diversity of those in the sciences.\r\n\r\nThe specific goals of this proposal are to perform hydrous phase-equilibrium experiments in a cold-seal apparatus under controlled fO2 and fH2O conditions on a variety of natural basalt and basaltic andesite liquids over a range of temperature and pressure, which will enable calibration of how these parameters, together with melt composition, affect the partitioning of Ni between olivine and liquid.  In addition, the depression of the olivine liquidus as a function of melt water content (up to \u00a1\u00dc 8 wt%) will be experimentally mapped out for several melt compositions.   Once a well-calibrated thermometer and hygrometer are in hand, it will be applied to >100 basalts from the Mexican and Cascades volcanic arcs and compared to results from olivine-hosted melt inclusions.  Two additional experimental goals are to measure crystal growth rates of olivine phenocrysts under hydrous melt conditions, especially for natural samples that contain olivine with diffusion-limited growth textures, and to test whether Fe-Mg KD values obtained in hydrous olivine-melt experiments can be used to place constraints on the oxidation state of natural basalts.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nBasalt is the most primitive silicate magma type on Earth and provides a direct window into the temperature, oxidation state, and water content of the underlying mantle from which it was formed.  Basalts erupted at subduction zones (the tectonic setting where continental crust is formed) contain significantly more dissolved water than those erupted at mid-ocean spreading ridges (the tectonic setting where oceanic crust is formed).  This prevents the successful application of thermometers based on the partitioning of Mg between olivine and melt because these thermometers are strongly dependent on the amount of water in the melt and require prior knowledge of melt water contents in order to obtain correct temperatures.  The goal of this project was to test whether a new thermometer based on the partitioning of Ni between olivine and melt is independent of the water concentration in the melt phase.  Several experiments were conducted (Pu et al., in review) and the results confirm that there is no dependence of the Ni-based olivine-melt thermometer on melt water contents at crustal depths.  Moreover, there is no dependence on pressure over this crustal depth interval (&le;30 km).\n\nIn this study, two olivine-melt thermometers were developed, based on the partitioning of Mg and Ni, respectively (Pu et al., 2017). The Mg-thermometer provides the temperature at the onset of olivine growth if no water was present (anhydrous), whereas the Ni-thermometer provides the actual temperature at the onset of olivine growth.  In all subduction-zone basalts, it was found that the Ni-thermometer provides lower temperatures than the Mg-thermometer, consistent with high water contents in the basaltic melts, thus lowering the temperature at which olivine crystallizes.  In contrast, there is no resolvable difference between the temperatures obtained from the Mg- and Ni-thermometers when applied to mid-ocean ridge basalts, which are known to contain little dissolved water. Thus, the difference in the thermometry results (&#8710;T = TMg-TNi) provides a qualitative constraint on the amount of water in basalt melts during olivine crystallization. \n\nA third key outcome of this study is the documentation that most basalts that erupt from small-volume, monogenetic vents crystallized their olivine phenocrysts over a period of days during ascent, and not over 10?s-1000?s of years in crustal magma chamber.   In most cases, the most Mg-rich olivine in each sample closely represents the first olivine to crystallize from a melt with a composition that matches the whole-rock sample.  The most Mg-rich olivine crystals in basalts nearly always display cryptic evidence of rapid, dendritic growth, which is revealed by phosphorous element maps.  This allows the composition of the most Mg-rich olivine in each sample to be paired with the whole-rock composition in the application of both Mg- and Ni-based olivine-melt thermometry.\n\nThe Ni-thermometer developed in this proposal is currently being applied to several dozens of high-MgO basalt samples that have erupted in different tectonic settings (e.g., mid-ocean spreading ridges, intraplate, subduction zones) and from different mantle sources (subduction-modified lithosphere, asthenosphere, Yellowstone mantle plume) in order to explore and document any systematic variations in the temperature and water content of the mantle during formation of these diverse suites of basalts.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/22/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Rebecca Lange"
