 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project investigates the role of landscape and planning in creating long-term solutions for the prevention and mitigation of domestic violence and violence against women. Domestic violence is a significant barrier to the economic and social development of women, families and communities across the globe and is a key area of concern for US policy makers.  The project focuses on an urban community in Costa Rica that was planned and designed 20 years ago as an innovative solution to the problem of domestic violence.  The planning process at its core was informed by anti-violence organizing.  As such it offers an opportunity to look at the relationship between the built environment and the social milieu surrounding violence across generations.  This project is thus a reflective study on how successful a design approach is for addressing domestic violence. By studying the effects of design on the behaviors and attitudes of a residential community this project will connect community, home and interpersonal practices to regional and national policies.  A key output of this project will be a set of resources for creating community level responses to domestic violence that can be taken up and employed by both policy makers and local organizations within the US and other countries. These resources, in addition to the oral histories and case study data, will be made available to the public in both English and Spanish through an online portal.  This portal will also be valuable for engaging undergraduate students in courses on urban planning, politics and gender.\r\n\r\nThis project will contribute to scholarship on the relationship between urban planning, vernacular landscapes, and everyday practices.  The study brings together literatures on geopolitics, social movement organizing, feminist planning, landscape analysis and memory studies in a conceptual framework that enables the exploration of how anti-violence organizing can be sustained across generations. The central goals of this project are to (1) trace the ways the ideologies of anti-violence organizing might be embedded in the built environment through intentional urban planning; (2) how those ideologies are then experienced and internalized by inhabitants of those places; and (3) if this process works inter-generationally.  Ultimately this project seeks to understand to what extent a particular built environment informs the decision making and perceptions of individuals.  These goals will be accomplished by evaluating a urban community in Costa Rica, where domestic violence was a driving factor in the original design process, using a short term cohort study with the \"builders\" (people who participated in the design and construction of the community 20 years ago) and the \"second generation\" (people who grew up there).  The empirical data will consist of (1) life history interviewing; (2) participant photo documentation; and (3) semi-structured follow up interviews.  This innovative combination of visual and textual methods speaks to the study's conceptual landscape analysis component as well as enabling the investigators to analyze participants' understanding of domestic violence and the sustainability of anti-violence organizing across generations in relation to the built environment.",

The self-help housing movements of the 1980s and 90s in Costa Rica were hybridized grassroots movements that linked concerns with housing and tenure insecurity, to those of violence against women.&nbsp; Members of housing committees were expected to contribute 600-800 hours of labor to qualify for a prefabricated house, financed through governmental and non-governmental organizations. Conducting fieldwork in 2016, 28 years after the first houses were built, allows for an inter-generational analysis focused on the ways the original members of the housing committees and their children mobilize and reword the values of the housing movements as the experience of violence in the community has changed.</p>\n<p>During six months of fieldwork, the project utilized a short-term cohort study with seventeen participants from across the life-course, representing individuals involved in the housing movements as children and adults, those that were born after construction, and individuals who moved into the community later.&nbsp; The phases of the short-term cohort study included: (1) a life history interview; (2) photo elicitation; and (3) a follow-up interview with the photo essays.&nbsp; Interview and visual data was analyzed across individual narratives, between generations, and within the ten households represented by the participant sample.&nbsp; Results have shown that (1) by centering the household as a scale of analysis, rather than the individual, narratives of household choices around movement exposes the ways in which the political significant of these movements overflows the construction of a house for women, to include place-specific community networks; (2) movement values around the ways self-improvement, fighting for a better life, furthers participation, working with and for others towards communal well-being, are in tension with contemporary ideas of responding to increasing concerns of intrafamilial violence based in drugs, poverty, and gang violence, by disconnecting from community responses and closing oneself off in the security of the home; and (3) how government and local organizations use movement values to address this disconnection and seek to reengage residents to address ongoing forms of political, and economic violence.</p>\n<p>Extending this work, the researchers co-produced two community murals with local artists in the community. We used preliminary results from the short-term cohort study as a base for a series of workshops on themes of (1) violence and empowerment, and (2) identity and place. The first mural, is a 15x5 m mosaic that reads, &ldquo;<em>Mariposas Contra La Violencia&rdquo; (</em>Butterflies Against Violence) and contains five female silhouettes, two holding banners that span the full length of the wall, surrounded by dozens of butterflies. During nine workshops over five weeks, 50-75 community members (predominantly women) learned the ceramic technique to build the butterflies and discussed healthy relationships and communities. The second mural, titled &ldquo;<em>Celebremos Nuestra Cultura&rdquo;</em> (We Celebrate Our Culture), will be installed in a community center where local artists and young people can hold meetings or workshops. The mosaic mural will contain a history of the community illustrated in the letters of its name, and seven masks designed and constructed by 15-20 adolescents during four workshops where we discussed themes of identity, social engagement, and place. Through these murals and online galleries, this project connects intellectual understandings of memory and violence with practices that engage memory to build peaceful, nonviolent communities.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 04/29/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Jennifer&nbsp;L&nbsp;Porter</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1557621/1557621_10414284_1525031651440_MClV_1_adjust_2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1557621/1557621_10414284_1525031651440_MClV_1_adjust_2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Mariposas Contra La Violencia\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1557621/1557621_10414284_1525031651440_MClV_1_adjust_2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Mariposas Contra La Violencia\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">15x5 m mosaic mural built in collaboration with ANCORArte Mosaicos.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Jennifer Porter</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Jennifer&nbsp;L&nbsp;Porter</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Mariposas Contra La Violencia</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1557621/1557621_10414284_1525031818773_20161104_135002--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1557621/1557621_10414284_1525031818773_20161104_135002--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Celebremos Nuestra Cultura\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1557621/1557621_10414284_1525031818773_20161104_135002--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Celebremos Nuestra Cultura\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A mosaic mask produced as part of the workshops with adolescents.
