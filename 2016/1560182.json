 "awd_abstract_narration": "This REU Site award to the Ohio State University, located in Columbus, OH, will support the training of 10 students for 9 weeks during each of the summers of 2016- 2019. This program provides research experience in the broad area of Molecular Biology (including fields such as cell biology, genetics, biochemistry and biophysics), with specific research opportunities chosen to match students' own interest and experience. Scientific mentors from the departments of Molecular Genetics, Chemistry and Biochemistry, and Microbiology are internationally recognized scientists with strong interests in mentoring research-oriented undergraduates and facilitating success in their future research careers. The cornerstone of the program is the individual research experience, with student participants engaging in individually mentored projects that utilize model organisms to address fundamental scientific questions. Students also take part in professional development activities designed to enable future research success, including training in ethics, scientific communication, and writing skills. Group social activities highlighting Columbus attractions enhance the collegial and supportive atmosphere of the program.  \r\n\r\nIt is anticipated that a total of 40 students, primarily from schools with limited research opportunities, will participate in the training program. Participants are selected by the PI and co-PI, with a focus on inclusion of students with limited research opportunities and students from groups underrepresented in the sciences. The program has a demonstrated record of success, with the majority of past participants continuing in science careers. \r\n\r\nA common web-based assessment tool used by all REU programs funded by the Division of Biological Infrastructure (Directorate for Biological Sciences) will be used to determine the effectiveness of the training program. Students will be tracked after the program in order to ascertain student career paths and effects of the REU program on their career progression. Students will be asked to respond to an automatic email sent via the NSF reporting system. More information about the program, including application materials, is available by visiting https://molgen.osu.edu/research-experience-undergraduates, or by contacting the PI (Dr. Cole at cole.354@osu.edu) or the co-PI (Dr. Jackman at jackman.14@osu.edu).",
