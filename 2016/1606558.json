 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the NSF Division of Chemistry supports this project to design and synthesize new carbon-based molecules for potential use in flexible, high performance electronic devices. The study of these molecules may lead to a better understanding of how to design desirable properties as well as how these materials function. For example, the ability to control molecular conformations in conjugated monomers, oligomers, and polymers is not only important for manipulating their electronic properties, but also for optimization of the bulk electronic properties of a material. While free rotation within a material can lead to a variety of unpredictable, and perhaps undesirable, molecular packing arrangements, strategies for enforcing planarity can provide increased order and enhanced electronic properties. Arylene ethynylenes that are conformationally constrained are, therefore, important targets in the development of photovoltaic, thin-film transistor and light emitting devices. Similarly, with their rigidity and predictable geometries, arylene ethynylene structures can serve as hosts for guests of specific sizes and shapes. Complete understanding and optimization of the geometric parameters of these systems may lead to new sensing capabilities. Undergraduates responsible for synthesizing and characterizing these novel compounds gain hands-on experience in the laboratory, preparing them for careers in chemical industry or additional study in graduate programs.  This project is conducted on two different campuses, University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point and Missouri State University.  The participation of professors from these campuses in meaningful research enhances the education of not only the students working directly on the research projects, but also students who benefit from the transfer of knowledge and skills in the classroom.\r\n\r\nThe scientific objective of this project is to design and prepare novel arylene ethynylene structures with features that allow molecular level control over electronic properties, crystal design, and host-guest activity.  Specifically, incorporation of pyridinyl groups within conjugated systems offers an opportunity for structural control via halogen bonding, hydrogen bonding, and transition metal coordination.  These interactions provide avenues for the generation of novel liquid crystals, the enhanced effective conjugation of unsaturated backbones, and highly specific host-guest pairing.",

Understanding these interactions simultaneously helps us understand the world around us and provides a foundation for generating new materials with desirable properties. Through an NSF-funded collaborative research grant (CHE-1606556, CHE-1606558), researchers at the University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point (UWSP) and Missouri State University (MSU) have incorporated novel design elements into organic molecules and discovered how different molecular structures influence molecular properties. The class of organic molecules studied, arylene ethynylenes, is well known to display interesting electronic properties. Devices made from these materials include light emitting diodes (LEDs), organic transistors, and sensors for trace environmental hazards. The discoveries produced from the collaborative work between UWSP and MSU will inform the future designs of materials based upon this class of compounds.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This work has been performed by 22 students (21 undergraduates, 1 Masters) over three years in laboratories on both UWSP and MSU campuses. In the process of generating novel molecules for this study, students have gotten hands-on experience performing chemical reactions, purifying compounds from complex mixtures, and characterizing the desired compounds using modern instrumentation, such as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and mass spectrometry (MS). Once the desired compounds were generated and characterized, students evaluated how the design elements of the molecules influenced the electronic and solid-state packing properties via UV-vis/fluorescence spectroscopies and X-ray crystallography, respectively. Additionally, to enhance understanding of how different molecular features are responsible for the properties observed, students performed high level computations establishing why certain behaviors are energetically favored while others are disfavored.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Two significant developments from this research provide unique strategies for the future design of organic materials. First, indications of charge-transfer within some of the targeted compounds suggest facile electronic communication between neighboring molecules within the materials produced. The most striking evidence of this phenomenon was the appearance of an intense red color when select compounds were crystallized together. Computational chemistry was used to explore the most likely avenues for electronic communication between molecules. The information gleaned from these combined studies provides insight into how electronic charge is transported in materials of this type, perhaps opening new doors for design. Second, novel molecules have been designed such that their electronic properties can be manipulated via external stimuli. This result may prove valuable in the production of next-generation sensors where a response to trace levels of an unwanted substance is desired.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This collaborative work has generated six journal articles (5 published, 1 pending) and several student and faculty presentations at national, regional, and local conferences. Many students who have worked on these projects have carried, or intend to carry, the skill sets they have developed into chemical or biochemical graduate programs. Others are pursuing careers in chemical or biochemical industries. In addition to communicating scientific results to chemistry communities, the PI, co-PI, and students at UWSP have made efforts to promote science to the general public. The most prominent example of this effort is the annual STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, Math) Days on the UWSP campus in which 7<sup>th</sup> and 8<sup>th</sup> grade students from the surrounding area come to campus to take part in science-based experiences. The PI and co-PI have been active in organizing and leading chemistry-related experiences for these visiting students. Undergraduates working on the research projects described above are happy to take a few hours out of their day on occasional Friday afternoons to volunteer as STEAM Day assistants and share their passion for chemistry with junior high school students.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/30/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Nathan&nbsp;Bowling</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1606558/1606558_10421850_1572460473100_IMG_0062--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1606558/1606558_10421850_1572460473100_IMG_0062--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Thin-Layer Chromatography\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1606558/1606558_10421850_1572460473100_IMG_0062--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Thin-Layer Chromatography\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Thin-Layer Chromatography of a mixture of highly fluorescent compounds</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Nathan Bowling</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Nathan&nbsp;Bowling</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Thin-Layer Chromatography</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1606558/1606558_10421850_1572460570537_IMG_0250--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1606558/1606558_10421850_1572460570537_IMG_0250--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Bowling Research Group\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1606558/1606558_10421850_1572460570537_IMG_0250--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Bowling Research Group\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The Bowling research group on the first day of summer research, 2019</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Nathan Bowling</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Nathan&nbsp;Bowling</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Bowling Research Group</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1606558/1606558_10421850_1572460960188_IMG_0280--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1606558/1606558_10421850_1572460960188_IMG_0280--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"National Organic Symposium\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1606558/1606558_10421850_1572460960188_IMG_0280--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"National Organic Symposium\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The Bowling group at the National Organic Symposium in Bloomington, IN</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Nathan Bowling</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Nathan&nbsp;Bowling</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">National Organic Symposium</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1606558/1606558_10421850_1572461072894_IMG_0598--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1606558/1606558_10421850_1572461072894_IMG_0598--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Interpreting Spectra\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1606558/1606558_10421850_1572461072894_IMG_0598--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Interpreting Spectra\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Prof. Bowling assisting a research student with interpretation of spectra</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Nathan Bowling</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Nathan&nbsp;Bowling</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Interpreting Spectra</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
