 "awd_abstract_narration": "Invasive cane toads (Rhinella marina) in Australia have been expanding their range since they were first introduced in 1935. Their inherent toxicity has resulted in dramatic population crashes of dozens of native species. Based on temperature and water characteristics of their native habitats, it was assumed their invasion would be restricted to tropical areas of Australia. However, their invasion is rapidly expanding beyond the presumed limits, and this may be a result of progressive adaptation to drier conditions. If cane toads can rapidly evolve to new climatic conditions, then their range expansion might exceed well beyond previously thought limitations and thus threaten a greater portion of the continent. Through a combination of field and laboratory studies, this project will focus on the immune system to evaluate the adaptability of cane toads by testing the hypothesis that cane toads at the dry invasion front are adapting a tolerance to water limitations in order to maintain effective immune function. This project will be conducted in collaboration with Dr. Rick Shine, a noted expert on the ecology of reptiles and amphibians, at the University of Sydney, Australia.  \r\n\r\nThis project will take an ecoimmunological approach to assess the distribution potential of cane toads in Australia. This study will compare naturally occurring hydration states and immune performances of toads from the arid invasion front with those from the mesic range core. These results will be complemented by a laboratory study that will experimentally manipulate the hydration state of animals from both sites to determine whether toads from semi-arid portions of Australia will have less suppressed or even enhanced immune function when dehydrated compared to toads found in more mesic areas of Australia where they were first introduced. The results of these experiments would transform the way distributions are predicted for this, and likely other, invasive species. \r\n\r\nThis award under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the Australian Academy of Science.",

My dissertation  research is focused on physiological trade-offs in organisms inhabiting  resource-limited environments. I&rsquo;ve been working with two different snake  species to examine the relationship between hydric state and immune function,  an almost entirely unexplored area. My EAPSI research, conducted in the  laboratory of Dr. Rick Shine of the University of Sydney, broadened the scope  of my dissertation research by incorporating both ecological context and  conservation implications. In Australia, I took an ecoimmunological approach  to assess the distribution potential of the cane toad (Rhinella marina), a highly  invasive species that has been wreaking havoc on native Australian wildlife  since its introduction in 1935. I tested the hypothesis that cane toads at the  invasion front in arid regions are adapting a tolerance to water limitations  to maintain effective immune function. If true, the expansion of toads may  progress well beyond the anticipated boundary based on known species  tolerances to aridity. I tested this hypothesis through a combination of lab  and field experiments that compared immune function and hydration state  between toads from the xeric invasion front and ones from the mesic invasion  starting point. The results of these experiments may transform the way we  predict distributions of this, and likely other, invasive species. I collected  fresh plasma samples from wild animals at four different sites to quantify  naturally occurring osmotic state and immune performance. In the laboratory, I  experimentally manipulated the hydration state of animals from all sites to  determine whether toads from semi-arid portions of Australia will have less  suppressed or even enhanced immune function when dehydrated compared to toads  found in more mesic areas of Australia where they were first introduced.  Participation in the EAPSI fellowship enabled me to improve my dissertation by  adding a translational component that will apply my research to conservation  efforts in Australia. In addition to my originally proposed research, I also  conducted two other experiments. I collected plasma from water pythons (Liasis  fuscus) throughout the dry season to quantify natural variation in immune  performance and hydration state. I also experimentally manipulated water  python hydration state for ~5 weeks in the lab to examine trade-offs between  increased plasma osmolality and innate immune function. The third project I  conducted examined natural variation in osmotic state and immune performance  in children&rsquo;s pythons (Antaresia childreni) throughout the dry season.
