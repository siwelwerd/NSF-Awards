 "awd_abstract_narration": "\"Divide and conquer,\" a time-honored technique in computer science and\r\nmathematics, partitions a problem into smaller pieces to make it\r\neasier to solve. This project deepens the study of partitioning in two\r\ndirections, both in the context of semi-algebraic geometry -- which is\r\nthe study of geometric and topological properties of sets defined by\r\nreal polynomial equalities and inequalities.\r\n\r\nThe first direction is to systematize polynomial partitioning, which\r\nhas recently become a powerful tool capable of tackling many\r\nlong-standing open questions in the area of incidence geometry. In\r\ncomputational geometry, the space or sets being partitioned are often\r\ncomplex but partitioning is by simple objects: splitting by planes or\r\ncutting into trapezoids.  Polynomial partitioning allows high degree\r\ncutting polynomials, necessitating more precise degree-based upper\r\nbounds on the topology of semi-algebraic sets and real varieties than\r\nthe ones known before, and leading to a very fruitful interaction\r\nbetween the fields of real algebraic geometry and discrete geometry.\r\nThe PI will develop new techniques in semi-algebraic geometry to meet\r\nthe new demands imposed on the field by the developments in discrete\r\ngeometry, and develop a new theory of polynomial partitioning that can\r\nsystematize their study and lead to new applications as well.\r\n\r\nThe second is to generalize quantitative and algorithmic\r\nsemi-algebraic geometry to a much more general and geometric setting\r\n-- the category of constructible sheaves.  Constructible sheaves come\r\nwith an underlying semi-algebraic partition (on whose elements the\r\nstalks of the sheaf are locally constant).  Kashiwara and Schapira\r\nproved a fundamental theorem on the stability of this category under\r\nthe six standard sheaf operations (analogous to Tarski-Seidenberg\r\nprinciple for semi-algebraic sets). The PI will study the quantitative\r\nand algorithmic questions related to constructible sheaves. The\r\ncomplexity upper bounds and algorithmic results would have wide\r\napplications.\r\n\r\nThe project will have impact in several areas of mathematics and\r\ncomputation -- including quantitative and algorithmic semi-algebraic\r\ngeometry, discrete and computational geometry, computational\r\ncomplexity theory and quantitative study of the solutions to linear\r\nsystems of partial differential equations.  The project will train a\r\ngraduate student and a postdoctoral researcher in quantitative and\r\nalgorithmic real algebraic geometry and its modern applications.",
