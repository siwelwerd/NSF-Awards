 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will take important steps towards developing a new instrument that can perform spectrum analysis considerably faster, with lower power, and with a physically smaller size than any current technology. This science and engineering research will be conducted in collaboration with Dr. Zhongming Zeng, a noted expert in experimental magnetization dynamics research at the Suzhou Institute for Nano-Tech and Nano-Bionics (SINANO) in central China. This collaboration will accelerate progress in this research program by providing access to cutting-edge experimental nanotechnology facilities and leaders in experimental nanotechnology techniques.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project will be to develop a prototype ultra-fast broadband spectrum analyzer using a nano-sized spin valve or magnetic tunnel junction as a Spin Torque Nano-Oscillator (STNO). The project will leverage two important properties of STNOs: firstly, that they can serve as extremely sensitive, frequency selective microwave detectors, and secondly that their selective frequency can be tuned by varying the STNO bias current. The PI will develop theoretical and numerical models to describe the dynamic properties of STNO microwave detectors when influenced by a linearly modulated bias current. As Dr. Zeng is a world leading specialist in experimental spin torque microwave detection and SINANO has extensive experimental resources, collaboration between the host and the EAPSI fellow is well justified. This project has the potential to advance understanding of dynamic magnetization in magnetic nanostructures through investigating the phase locking properties of an STNO in the presence of a modulated bias current. Currently, understanding of phase locking in non-isochronous systems presents a challenge to scientist in many fields, including biology, chemistry, medicine, geology, astronomy, etc. As this STNO study represents a unique opportunity to discretely study synchronization in non-stationary systems, the analytical and experimental results will likely provide new universal insights into physical synchronization mechanisms.\r\n\r\nThis award under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the Ministry of Science and Technology of China.",
