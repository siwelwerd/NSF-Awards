The fellowship supports a research and training plan for the Fellow to take transformative approaches to grand challenges in biology that employ biological collections in highly innovative ways. The title of the research plan for this fellowship to Manuela Dal Forno is \"Using museum specimens to explore the diversity and variation of lichen microbiomes in space and time.\" The host institution for this fellowship is the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History, and the sponsoring scientists are Drs. Eric Schuettpelz and Martin Grube.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this research is to evaluate whether biological collections can be used to study characteristics of the microbiome (microbial communities composed of many species, living within plants, fungi and animals). This research is important because if microbiomes do not change significantly over time while housed in museum specimens (i.e., they represent microbiomes found in living organisms at the time they were collected), this opens up a remarkable opportunity to analyze the microbiomes of millions of samples already deposited in museums worldwide, facilitating the study of many biological questions. This research explores this question using lichens and their microbiomes as a model system. Lichens were long thought to be symbiotic associations of just two organisms (or rarely three), fungi plus photosynthetic algae and/or cyanobacteria. However, we now realize that lichens harbor diverse microbiomes, which may vary over space and time. The Fellow is examining museum lichen collections and testing the hypothesis that observed microbiomes represent those living in the lichen when it was collected (i.e., when it was alive), utilizing new and existing collections of tropical lichens from Brazil, Panama, and Jamaica. The research is risky to the extent that the Fellow may find that microbiomes cannot be adequately characterized from collection specimens, but whether or not this is the case, the findings have broad implications for future research on the microbiome dynamics of lichens and other organisms (e.g., plants) that are maintained under similar museum conditions. The results will also be used to determine how microbiomes vary within and among lichen species, and how they vary with changes in the environment. \r\n\r\nThe Fellow is acquiring valuable training in areas such as comparative microbiome analyses, bioinformatics, and the handling of large data sets and data layers from collections portals, ecological statistics, and the establishment of novel pipelines. During a visit to the Institute of Plant Sciences, University of Graz, Austria, the Fellow will learn the fluorescence techniques and use it on selected samples. All of these new skills are important for developing a strong interdisciplinary research program that merges traditional taxonomy with modern molecular techniques and data analyses. The Fellow is mentoring high school and undergraduate students of historically underrepresented groups, while also creating opportunities for the inclusion of lichens in all levels of education. Internships and public outreach activities are utilizing existing programs available at the National Museum of Natural History, and being expanded to local citizen science communities and institutions in the greater Washington DC metropolitan area. Educational products include protocols, portfolios and field guides for lichen identification.",

Under this fellowship, the PI performed research primarily in the United States, but also in Austria, Brazil and Jamaica, and traveled to Finland and Puerto Rico to present results at international conferences.</p>\n<p>Researchers have known for some time that lichens are much more than simply a fungus (mycobiont) and alga and/or cyanobacteria (photobiont). They also include complex microbial communities that, together with the mycobiont and photobiont, produce the lichen thalli we see in nature. Previous studies have revealed a variety of possible factors that influence the bacterial profile associated with a lichen symbiosis, such as geographical location, habitat, mycobiont and photobiont identity, and substrate. However, such research was mostly restricted to lichen-forming fungi in the Ascomycota (i.e., ascolichens), with very little information available concerning the microbiomes of lichen-forming fungi in the Basidiomycota (i.e., basidiolichens). This award allowed the PI to examine bacterial profiles in basidiolichens, focusing specifically on bacterial changes over time and space utilizing biological collections. Including 1400 samples and 800 new DNA extractions, this project resulted in the largest microbial dataset for lichens generated to date.</p>\n<p>The primary findings of this research are that lichen collections deposited in natural history collections can still carry a considerable amount of information regarding their microbiomes. High throughput sequencing (HTS) and fluorescent <em>in situ</em> hybridization (FISH) revealed a very high diversity of bacteria in the studied lichens, with most samples containing around 200 bacterial lineages and some with up to 700. Different lichen growth forms showed clear differences in their bacterial communities. Basidiolichens were found to have microbiomes similar to those of ascolichens at higher hierarchical taxonomic levels (i.e., from the same groups of bacteria), but they differed at lower levels (i.e., the types of bacteria belonging to the groups were unique). Additionally, there is a distinct pattern in the bacterial communities present in different lichen genera, suggesting a phylogenetic component in the diversity and structure of these microbial communities, beyond the ecological preferences and growth types. Overall, the results advance our understanding of lichens harboring unique bacterial communities with demonstrated high genetic diversity, adding to the value of lichens for the ecosystems to which they belong.</p>\n<p>Training in lichen identification, curation, and molecular systematics was provided to three students during the PI&rsquo;s tenure at the host institution. The PI offered over ten outreach activities in the same period, and delivered eight invited talks, two additional oral presentations, and one poster. The PI participated in five workshops and offered a workshop on molecular resources. Results were disseminated at three international meetings, through a total of nine presentations in collaboration with 13 colleagues. The PI participated in three field expeditions focused solely in collecting target lichen taxa, with five colleagues (two from Brazil, one from Puerto Rico, one from Switzerland, and one from Jamaica). The PI will continue to work with students and collaborators (nationally and internationally) as a result of this project.
