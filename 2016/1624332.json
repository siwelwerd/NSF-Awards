The workshop will be held the first day of the Annual Meeting, 14 February 2016. Current and former NSF Program Officers will provide an overview of the proposal review process.\r\n\r\nThe award will support workshop registration and travel for approximately 10 participants in the workshop.  The registration and travel support for this workshop will be prioritized for researchers from underrepresented groups as well as early career researchers to help encourage greater participation by these groups in the minerals, metals and materials fields. Ultimately, the goal of the workshop is to help foster future generations of materials scientists and engineers by further increasing PIs' preparedness in the proposal development and submission process.",
