 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project funded by the Environmental Chemical Sciences Program, Professors Krishna Foster and Matthias Selke of California State University, Los Angeles are investigating the impact of urban particulate matter on the lower atmosphere of Earth. The project is performed in collaboration with Professor Donald Dabdub of the University of California at Irvine. Urban particulate matter contains polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) generated from incomplete combustion processes, including motor vehicles fueled by gasoline and diesel.  Although some PAHs are known to transfer energy to oxygen forming more reactive molecules, it is hard to know which PAHs are responsible for this energy transfer and how many times this occurs in the environment.  The scope and accuracy of these energy transfer measurements is being improved with this project. Success in this research may improve air quality models and that are used to understand the impact of pollution on people, especially those living in urban areas.  The students assisting in this research reflect the diverse population of southern California. Consequently, this project has the potential to increase the number of underserved students that select careers in the chemical sciences and pursue graduate education, addressing the nation's need for students preparing for chemical sciences careers.\r\n\r\nThe investigators work to identify PAH and oxygenated-PAH that are net sources of singlet molecular oxygen in solution by measuring singlet oxygen quantum yields and quenching rates. Alkene oxidation products formed from reactions with singlet molecular oxygen are characterized using multiple analytical techniques.  Both laboratory experiments and air quality models are used to determine the potential role of PAH photoexcitation on oxidation in emission plumes and at the air/particle interface.",

Urban particulate matter contains polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) generated from incomplete combustion processes, including motor vehicles fueled by gasoline and diesel. Although select PAH are known to transfer energy to ground state oxygen molecules forming singlet molecular oxygen, a very reactive oxidant, the breadth and accuracy of measurements necessary to model the impact of this chemistry on the atmosphere was improved by this work. These measurements can be used to improve air quality models, and consequently, impact millions of people, especially those living in urban areas. Several photophysical and photochemical measurements were conducted. We studied pyrene, benzo[a]pyrene and oxygenated derivatives of each representative of compounds found on both fresh and aged urban particulate matter. We measured the singlet molecular oxygen quantum yields and quenching rates in various solvents using laser induced near-infrared phosphorescence techniques. Other experiments were performed to demonstrate that solutions of PAH with dissolved oxygen oxidize alkenes in a manner specific to singlet molecular oxygen. To expand the applicability of these studies to other potential sources of singlet molecular oxygen, we performed computational analyses of the excited states of oxidized PAH derivatives and calculated energy gaps to predict efficiency of energy transfer to ground state oxygen. Together these results suggest that PAHs and their oxidized derivatives are a very efficient source of the highly reactive oxidant singlet molecular oxygen. To test the implications of this chemistry on the atmosphere, these new photochemical parameters were placed into the UCI-CIT three-dimensional air quality model of the Los Angeles air basin.
