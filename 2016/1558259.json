 "awd_abstract_narration": "Emissions, transport and transformations of aerosols and trace gases from Asia increasingly impact local, regional and even global environments. The chemical and physical mechanisms by which atmospheric processes change the properties and concentrations of trace gases and aerosols remain challenging questions in tropospheric chemistry research. \r\n\r\nThrough partnerships with Peking University, Beijing Normal University, and the Hebei provincial weather service, this collaborative study, Air Chemistry Research In Asia (ARIAs) will facilitate concurrent aircraft and ground measurements, aerosol optical properties and trace gas composition over the North China Plain (NCP). Ultimately, the results from this project will improve theory and predictive capability of environmental models, used to develop mitigation strategies for air pollution from the Asian continent and to better understand the fate of short-lived climate forcers such as ozone and aerosols in these high population, high emission environments. \r\n\r\nThe project will also serve to further educate a research associate, and graduate and undergraduate students and, through its outreach component, K-12 students. The project will also renew collaborations with leading Chinese research groups.",
