 "awd_abstract_narration": "This NSF Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (S-STEM) project will contribute to the national effort to produce more STEM graduates by establishing a cohort of 15 academically strong scholars with demonstrated financial need.  The project will build on Linfield College's robust interdisciplinary STEM programs, which emphasize experiential learning through a student-centered approach.  Scholars will participate in new and existing curricular and extracurricular programs along with the broader STEM student population. Such programs include (a) student-led learning communities organized around intellectual topics, (b) an interdisciplinary science and mathematics seminar, (c) career development, and (d) one-on-one student and faculty mentoring.\r\n\r\nThe theory of action for this project is based on research that shows that cultivating communities in which students connect to one another while engaging in science can foster their STEM identities and aid in their retention and persistence as STEM majors.  Building upon the success of and expanding on a prior interdisciplinary initiative at Linfield, this project will support student collaboration on real-world problems that cross several disciplines through the science and mathematics seminar.  The research team has developed a modified version of the Colorado Learning Attitudes in Science Survey to assess students' beliefs about the nature of science and the way it is conducted, as well as their attitudes about their own abilities to learn science before and after this intervention.  Student interest surveys, participation in project activities, and monitoring of student retention and graduation rates will be performed as part of formative and summative project evaluation.  Results from the project will be disseminated via education journals such as the Journal of Higher Education and the Journal of Science Teaching and at national conferences sponsored by Mathematical Association of America, American Chemical Society, and Project Kaleidoscope.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Linfield College scholarships in STEM project had the following specific goals:\n\n1.  To use scholarship funds and a faculty liason model to enhance recruiting in STEM and increase the overall number of STEM majors at Lifnield so it is comparable to peer institutions.\n\n2. To offer new and continuing support programs that will improve the progress toward degree completion of students in STEM fields at Linfield.\n\n3.  To increase the number of STEM graduates at Linfield by providing career guidance and support.\n\nOver the course of the grant period (2016 - 2022) fifteen students were awarded scholarships and ten of these students graduated with a STEM major.  Students who switched to non-STEM majors were no longer eligible for the S-STEM scholarships.\n\nThe grant period occured at a time of declining enrollments at Linfield.  These declines were observed in all of the STEM fields as well.  Enrollment of first year students in introductory STEM courses peaked in 2015 (prior to the beginning of the grant), the percentage of Linfield students graduating with a STEM degree peaked in 2019 (corresponding to the 2015 peak) and the number of students with a STEM major peaked in 2014.  Each of these metrics has declined since their peaks.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/11/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Brian D Gilbert"
