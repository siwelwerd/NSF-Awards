 "awd_abstract_narration": "High-performance Phase Locked Loops (PLLs) for frequency synthesis are critical and are often performance-limiting components in nearly all modern electronic communication systems. Despite their many advantages, digital PLLs have not replaced analog PLLs in present-day high-end frequency synthesis applications such as in 4G mobile systems, and fall far short of anticipated 5G requirements. The new generation of mobile communication systems will require PLLs to have higher accuracy, lower power dissipation, greater re-configurability, greater immunity to interference, and lower costs. Towards this goal, this project will explore novel techniques for development and design of Digital PLLs. Successful completion of the project will not only have a strong technical impact on the communications industry, but will also educate the next generation of design engineers for the industry by training them to join the workforce.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe primary research focus of this project is theoretical and is the development and optimization of enabling new signal processing techniques and their rigorous mathematical analyses. Additionally, a digital PLL prototype IC enabled by the new techniques will be developed that targets best-of-class 5G RF frequency synthesis performance. This experimental work will provide feedback that will guide the theoretical work as well as a definitive means of evaluating the success of the project in achieving its objective.",
