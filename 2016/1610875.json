 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-technical abstract\r\nLiquid crystals are fluids composed of rod-shaped molecules.  The molecules arrange themselves to be more ordered than in an ordinary liquid but less so than in a crystalline solid.  Nematic liquid crystal are an important example of this.  The molecules in nematics all orient along a common direction.  Impurities, like small particles, can disrupt this order and introduce important new effects.  These can include important new optical and magnetic properties that potentially enable new technologies.  The behavior becomes even richer when the order in the fluid is spatially patterned or changes with time.  This project will investigate experimentally several classes of spatially or temporally varying nematic liquid crystals. They include 'active' nematics that undergo internally driven perpetual flow and that are seeded with magnetic particles and nematics with a striped pattern of ordering that should cause particles to sort themselves spontaneously by size.  Among the broader impacts of the project will be research training and education for graduate and undergraduate students. The project will also enable a partnership with a local majority-minority magnet science high school to provide talented Baltimore City students with opportunities for research internships.\r\n\r\nTechnical Abstract\r\nThe study of inclusions suspended in liquid crystals can lead to important new insight about the viscoelastic and interfacial properties of these materials and can further create novel platforms for manipulation of colloids through unique anisotropic interactions engendered by the fluids. Further, particle-dispersed liquid crystals hold technological promise as composite materials with enhanced properties deriving from coupling of the particles to the liquid crystalline order. This work will seek to advance substantially the understanding of the nature of dynamics in liquid crystalline materials and how the dynamics relates to colloidal transport. The particular goal will be to interrogate fluids with nematic order that are driven from equilibrium, either by internally generated flows in the case of active nematics or by externally imposed electric or stress fields, and to investigate how the spatiotemporal response to this driving couples to the particle motion. The research will focus on three thematically linked projects: (i) active nematic films containing magnetically actuated nano- and micro-particles that will provide new insights into the viscoelastic and hydrodynamic properties of active matter on key intrinsic lengthscales and timescales; (ii) colloidal dynamics in patterned and dynamically modulated liquid crystals configured to test striking predictions for colloidal transport in such environments; and (iii) nanoparticle dynamics in fluids with shear-induced nematic order, where new x-ray scattering techniques can enable novel microscopic perspectives on the structural dynamics of such out-of-equilibrium, driven systems. Broader impacts of the work will include research training for graduate and undergraduate students in physics that will prepare them for careers in academia and industry. The project will also enable a partnership with a local majority-minority magnet science high school to provide talented Baltimore City students with opportunities for research internships.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nLiquid crystals are fluids composed of rod-shaped molecules in which the molecules arrange themselves to be more ordered than in an ordinary liquid but less so than in a crystalline solid.  An important example that is employed in a variety of technologies is a nematic liquid crystal in which the molecules orient along a common direction.  When impurities like small particles are suspended in a nematic liquid crystal, they can disrupt this order leading to novel effects, such as the spontaneous assembly of the particles into patterns or the deflection of a particle away from the force causing it to move.  The impurities can also endow the fluids with enhanced characteristics, such as unique optical and magnetic properties, that could potentially enable new technologies.  The behavior of particles in liquid crystals can become even richer when the fluids are made to flow or when the order in the fluid is spatially patterned or changes with time.  This project investigated experimentally several classes of spatially or temporally varying nematic liquid crystals containing small particles that promise potentially significant impact on research and technology but that had been the subject of limited previous study.\n\nAs one example, we investigated the motion of spherical particles undergoing sedimentation through an array of obstacles within a nematic liquid crystal.  Because of distortions to the order in the nematic imposed by the particles and by the obstacles, the particles followed trajectories as they sedimented that were significantly different than those they would follow in an ordinary liquid.  Further, because the distortion created by the particles depended on the interactions between the liquid crystal molecules and the surfaces of the particles, particles with different surface properties followed different trajectories.  These findings thus introduce a potential new approach to expand technologies used to separate particles in suspension to include separations based on particle surface chemistry.\n\nAs another example, we investigated \"active\" nematics, which are liquid crystals that consume chemical energy to produce internally driven perpetual flows that disturb the nematic order and keep the fluid from reaching a steady, equilibrium state.  The unique properties of these self-generated flows make active nematics an exciting platform for new technologies and a fruitful model for exploring fundamental scientific questions about the nature of out-of-equilibrium systems with relevance to biology.  A central challenge, however, is the need to develop methods to couple to active nematics in order to influence these flows in a controlled manner.  To address this issue, we seeded active nematics with microscopic, disk-shaped particles that we rotated with externally applied magnetic fields.  The forces imposed by the disks generated organized flow patterns within the fluid that stabilized ordered configurations of the nematic.  These observations hence open a new direction for manipulating the flows in such active fluids and ultimately for controlling their behavior.\n\nAs part of the broader impacts of the project, two PhD students completed their dissertations conducting research supported by the grant, and three undergraduate physics students obtained significant research experience.  In addition, a public high school student from Baltimore City conducted a two-year-long research internship under support by the grant.  As another part of the broader impacts, the PI and co-PI helped organize the Johns Hopkins University \"Physics Fair\", which is held annually in April.  This event attracts more than 500 people to the JHU Department of Physics &amp; Astronomy for a day of interactive demonstrations, contests, physics shows, and other activities.  The students supported by the grant served as docents at the Fair, explaining to attendees various interactive demos related to sound, surface tension, angular momentum, and other physics concepts.  The fair draws people from throughout the Baltimore area, offering a diverse group exposure to science in a fun and entertaining format.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/13/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Robert L Leheny"
