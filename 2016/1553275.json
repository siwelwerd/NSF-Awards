 "awd_abstract_narration": "PI:  Mani, Ali\r\nProposal Number: 1553275\r\n\r\nThe proposal is focused on the computational study of elctroconvection. This term is used to describe the fluid dynamics phenomena that are precipitated by electrokinetic forces.  Electroconvetion is important for flow close to surfaces like electrodes or membranes, where the surfaces interact with the ions of the fluid. The results of this research could have a strong impact on many engineering and technology applications, starting from water desalination, molecular separation, battery design, lab on a chip systems, etc.\r\n\r\nExperimental and theoretical investigations have revealed that electroconvection can lead to highly chaotic flows with remarkable resemblance to turbulent flows. These effects are shown to drastically impact mixing, ion transfer rates, and thus energy and throughput efficiency in these systems. Therefore, it is of crucial importance to develop modeling capabilities that can quantitatively predict EC effects in such systems. A multiscale approach is proposed that borrows concepts and tools reserved for turbulent flow analysis. Preliminary results with 2D direct numerical simulations (DNS) are available. These will be used to obtain boundary conditions for a spectral, high resolution 3D DNS. The 3D results will be used to develop a reduced order that can provide results faster than the DNS. Finally, experiments at collaborating laboratories will be conducted to validate the models. Plans for the development of a web based learning tool (based on Brownian dynamics simulations) for high school students are described.",
