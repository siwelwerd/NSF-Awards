 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many of the secrets to life lie outside the cell. The extracellular matrix (ECM), consisting of primarily proteins supports the cells within a tissue. While the ECM has long been viewed as a static \"home\" for cells, we are starting to understand how the stiffness of the extracellular matrix changes cell activities in ways that are similar to how dissolved signaling molecules control cell behavior.  In other words, the ECM helps determine what the cell does during development of a baby, and during adulthood, wound healing, and cancer invasion. Support from this grant for the conference \"New Advances in Probing Cell-Extracellular Matrix Interactions; Berlin, Germany; October 21 - 22, 2016\" will enable young investigators to meet senior scientists and to understand technologies at the cutting edge of the field.\r\n\r\nRecent progress in cell mechanotransduction research has been facilitated by advances of experimental tools. Microtechnologies have enabled the design and fabrication of controlled physical microenvironments for the study and measurement of cell-ECM interactions. Advances in engineered biomaterials have allowed researchers to develop synthetic ECMs that mimic tissue microenvironments and investigate the impact of altered physicochemical properties on various cellular processes. Finally, advanced imaging and spectroscopy techniques have facilitated the visualization of the complex interaction between cells and ECM in vitro and in living tissues. This meeting will highlight the application of recent innovations in these technologies to probing cell-ECM interactions with an aim to inspire new combinatorial experiments from the interaction of these sub-disciplines.",
