 "awd_abstract_narration": "This NSF award provides partial support for U.S. based mathematicians to participate in an advanced school and workshop on \"Geometric Group Theory and Low-Dimensional Topology: Recent Connections and Advances,\" to be held at ICTP, Trieste, Italy, 23 May - 3 June 2016. The proposed activity is a mix of \"hot topics\" that would afford tremendous opportunities to mathematicians at all career stages to interact and generate new ideas.  The advanced school will expose graduate students to a diverse array research topics.  Introducing both US based and international students to leading experts from across the globe should have a profound effect on cultivating mathematics in the US and in the developing world. The potential for fostering initial contacts and interactions that lead to closer connections between US based mathematicians and those in the developing world is a long term benefit for faculty and students.\r\n\r\nThe main topics to be covered at this advanced school and workshop include character varieties and deformation of geometric structures, effective geometry and topology of hyperbolic 3-manifolds, left orderability and Heegaard Floer theory, the mapping class group action on Teichmuller space and the curve complex, dynamics on these spaces and virtually special cube complexes and groups. There have been important developments in these areas recently, for example: the impact of geometric group theory in the work of Wise and subsequently Agol's resolution of the famous \"virtual conjectures\" in 3-manifold topology.

The activity was funded by ICTP, The Clay Mathematics Institute and the\nNational Science Foundation.  The organizing committee consisted of Michel Boileau, Dick Canary, Bruno Martelli, Maryam Mirzakhani and Alan Reid. All but Mirzakhani were present for most of the\ntwo weeks.

The second week had 22 talks (6 by women) and all lectures were videotaped and are available at the ICTP website.  Central objects of both of these two weeks were  surfaces, whose properties, or analogues, were presented, studied and used in many different  contexts and circle of ideas.\n\nBroader Impact:  The two weeks afforded the opportunity for many students and researchers with different interests to gather together around challenging problems arising from the connections between low-dimensional geometry and\ntopology and geometric group theory.  Graduate students from across the globe were exposed to background courses, as well as cutting edge research, and connections made.\n\nAs well as talking in the workshop in the second week, Agol gave the ICTP school colloquium based on the background and ideas in his proof of the virtual Haken conjecture.  For many of the students\nattending the first week, this was a highlight as it brought to conclusion the ideas and results described by Sageev in his lectures.\n\nThe organizers believe that this was a very successful event, both mathematically and culturally.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/01/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Alan W Reid"
