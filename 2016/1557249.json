 "awd_abstract_narration": "With funding from the National Science Foundation's Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship program, the \"Strategies to Increase the Size, Efficacy, and Retention of the Math and Science Teaching Workforce in High-Need Minnesota Districts\" project will recruit undergraduate majors in mathematics, biology and chemistry and prepare them to become grade 7-12 mathematics and science teachers. The project will fund 34 scholarships over 5 years. In this project, College of Saint Scholastica will collaborate with partners, including Duluth Public Schools, Proctor Public Schools, Lake Superior College, Duluth Children's Museum, and the Great Lakes Aquarium. This project will advance knowledge and understanding of the impact of implementing innovative strategies designed to increase the size, efficacy, and retention of the mathematics and science teaching workforce in high-need Minnesota districts. Early recruitment efforts undertaken by The College of Saint Scholastica, in collaboration with partner institutions, will be aimed at increasing recruitment of populations that are underserved or underrepresented in teaching and in STEM disciplines. Scholarships and targeted activities will be implemented to support students through teacher education program requirements, applying for licensure, and securing mathematics and science teaching positions in high-need Minnesota schools. In order to promote retention in STEM teaching workforce, the College of Saint Scholastica education faculty will pair new graduates with experienced mathematics and science mentor teachers in high-need schools and will actively support mandatory induction activities for at least one full academic year after graduation.\r\n \r\nThe project will provide comprehensive services for prospective mathematics and science teacher candidates and Noyce Scholars, with special emphasis on attracting and retaining individuals from underrepresented groups. Project objectives include: 1) Increase the number of mathematics and science teachers for high-need schools through recruitment and support of 34 Noyce Scholars; 2) Enhance prospective teacher candidates' interest in mathematics and science teaching with assistance from local partners; 3) Promote retention of newly-graduated Noyce Scholars in their early teaching years by providing mandatory induction support, pairing new graduates with mathematics and science teacher mentors; and 4) Increase the knowledge and understanding of the outcomes and challenges in recruiting mathematics and science teachers and of implementing induction supports promoted in the Minnesota Educator Induction guidelines. The project will employ research-based strategies to increase recruitment of talented and underrepresented teacher candidates, help improve pedagogy and knowledge-building, and promote retention of new mathematics and science teachers. Throughout the project, multiple types of qualitative and quantitative data will be collected for program improvement and for advancement of knowledge regarding effective strategies to increase the size, efficacy, and retention of the math and science teaching workforce in high-need schools.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n \nThe principal goal of this project was to increase the size, efficacy, and retention of the math and science teaching workforce in high-need Minnesota school districts. In that regard, we have been successful.  There are 16 Noyce Scholars currently employed in such districts.  They are all ?highly qualified? as was defined by the Federal Government under the No Child Left Behind Act.  These requirements framed our definition of efficacy, and are more stringent than current requirements for teachers.  Our Noyce Scholars have also had induction support in their first two years of teaching which has been proven to contribute to greater retention of new teachers.  \n\nThe impact of this project is two-fold. Minnesota school districts that previously had underqualified math and science teachers or experienced a high attrition rate of teachers now have highly qualified teachers who will likely remain at that school district for several years. Students learning in classrooms with highly qualified teachers in the discipline area may contribute to higher academic achievement for students. \n\nThe efficacy of the Noyce Scholar Teachers will also be impacted by the immersion experiences in which they participated.  They either worked with an organization or completed a Citizen Science Project that utilized math and/or science processes and skills.  They then reflected on how they can tie those experiences into their teaching to offer relevance and concrete examples of ?doing? math or science  to their students.  Providing this relevance may also lead to more interest and greater achievement in math and science from the middle and high school students. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/28/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Brenda Fischer"
