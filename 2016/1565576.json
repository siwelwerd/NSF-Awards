 "awd_abstract_narration": "Pettit/1565576\r\n\r\nThis award supports a Rapid Response Research (RAPID) project to observe the current weakened state of the Scar Inlet Ice Shelf, and potentially capture data during its anticipated disintegration. The Scar Inlet Ice Shelf (SIIS) is the southern remnant of the former Larsen B Ice Shelf, which disintegrated in March of 2002. Since then, the SIIS has weakened significantly but has not yet broken up. Cooler conditions than those seen prior to 2006 have reduced the chance of a disintegration in recent years, although a single warm season is likely to be enough to trigger such an event. The predicted \"Super El Nino\" for this austral summer may have significant effects on Antarctica's weather, potentially leading to a break-up or disintegration this year.  Given the very weak state of the SIIS, it is urgent that we act now to better understand the processes involved in shelf disintegration or break-up of ice shelves. The goal of this work is to collect several key data sets, publish initial observations and preliminary conclusions, and then make the complete data record available to all scientists.\r\n\r\nExtreme changes in the stress conditions on the SIIS resulted from both the loss of the Larsen B ice plate and the continued inflow of ice from three large glaciers (Flask, Leppard, and Starbuck). The SIIS now has a number of large rifts and it is expected to break up or disintegrate in the very near future. Past research has made use of satellite data and weather instruments, establishing many of the current ideas regarding ice shelf break-ups and ice shelf weakening. Additional ground-based data to be collected under this study will test a number of hypotheses regarding pre-disintegration characteristics, triggering mechanisms, fracturing processes, runaway feedback effects, and stabilizing mechanisms. The project will collect extensive multi-instrument field observations of the SIIS and possibly capture a major disintegration event. In collaboration with the British Antarctic Survey, a team of 4 people will be deployed via Twin Otter for up to 4 weeks to a site with a broad view of the shelf and will install several temporary observing instruments there. The study derives its intellectual merit from the role of the Antarctic Peninsula as a microcosm of how other parts of Antarctica might evolve and de-glaciate in the next few centuries. The broader impacts include an opportunity to educate the public about the anticipated collapse of this remnant ice shelf and its relationship to future changes in Antarctica. The potential for wide media coverage (through a connection with the National Geographic) will underscore the critical changes scientists are observing in the crysophere driven by climate change.  This proposal requires field work in Antarctica.",

The Antarctic Peninsula is particularly susceptible to change for two reasons. First, its position on Earth is at a latitude (~63-73S) where the regional climate is undergoing both increasing circumpolar winds and increasing temperatures. Second, its east coastline has several ice shelves (floating extensions of the ice sheet glaciers) that are already at the edge of survival (there are no other extensive ice shelves on Earth at lower latitude in either hemisphere). Over the last two decades, several of the largest and most northerly ice shelves have collapsed leaving large embayments where there once was thick ice cover. Two recent large collapse events were the Wilkins Ice Shelf in 2008 and the Larsen B in 2002. After looking at the weather trends and the surface structures, we determined that the most likely one to disintegrate next is the Scar Inlet Ice Shelf which flanks the area of the Larsen B shelf collapse of 2002 (Figure 1 shows the change in the Larsen B and Scar Inlet region). Scar Inlet Ice Shelf has shown a progressive evolution towards weakening and intensive crevassing.

The Scar Inlet Ice Shelf has progressively retreated and weakened since the 2002 Larsen B collapse, with increased shear along the margins, new internal rifts, and a doubling of ice-flow speeds. In March 2012, the open water of the Larsen B became covered in sea ice, and the inner 2/3rds of the embayment has remained covered since then, a type of sea ice called &lsquo;landfast ice&rsquo; or &lsquo;fast ice&rsquo;. Fast ice has typically been thought to have a negligible effect on ice shelf behavior because it is just 2 to 4 &nbsp;meters thick, whereas the ice shelf is ~240 m thick.
