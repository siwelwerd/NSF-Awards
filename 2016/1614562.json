 "awd_abstract_narration": "How would you measure the closeness of two signatures or two clay\r\nfigurines?  This project explores the mathematics and computation of\r\nmeasuring similarity between curves or 3-dimensional objects --\r\nwhether to compare GPS tracking data to road maps, or medical scans of internal organs to\r\nreference models of healthy organs. While some well understood comparison methods simply\r\nlook at how close the objects are, this project aims to design more\r\nsophisticated measures that take into account the underlying structure\r\n(or topology) of the curves and surfaces.  The PI plans to collaborate\r\nwith applications areas that use these measurement algorithms to\r\ndevelop measures that best fit the areas, in addition to continuing\r\nher work in a larger network of shape analysis and computational\r\ntopology communities, including organizing workshops focused at\r\nmentoring junior women in these areas.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis project generalizes notions of similarity from curves to graphs, meshes, or\r\n3-manifolds.  The primary problems and techniques come from the\r\nemerging field of computational topology, which combines algorithms\r\nand computational geometry with mathematical foundations and tools\r\nfrom the area of topology.  In particular, the PI proposes to examine\r\nfundamental topological notions of similarity between curves and\r\nsurfaces in some ambient space, based on computing optimal homotopies, homologies, or isotopies. Each\r\npossibility offers a different notion of what it means for two things\r\nto be equivalent in the ambient space, and each can be optimized based\r\non the notions of area, \"height,\" or \"width.\" While several initial\r\nalgorithmic results on these measures have been published, there are\r\nmany open questions that remain. In addition, recent mathematical\r\ndevelopments indicate many potentially tractable and feasible areas\r\nthat are yet to be explored from the algorithmic perspective. Some of\r\nthese measures are likely to be hard to compute, which is of interest\r\nto the theoretical community, and approximation or fixed parameter\r\ntractable algorithms may prove practical in applications areas. The\r\nproject will also include collaborations in applications areas for\r\nthese measures, in order to better evaluate their utility.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nAn increasing amount of geometric data is being captured by a wide range of new technology, ranging from GIS trajectories to 3d scans of objects.  While such data is ubiquitous, it is also notoriously hard for computers to work with, as well as being prone to errors and noise.  This proposal funded the investigation of mathematical approaches formalize distance measures which enable analysis and comparison of such geometric data.  The PI drew primarily upon concepts from topology, an area of mathematics that studies underlying structure and patterns in shapes, in order to define new ways to analyze such data and study the limits of what is computable under these measures.  In addition to computability, the PI considered which definitions or algorithms were the most practical for different types of data, working with a collaborators in more applied domains where possible to test the practicality of the developed distance measures.  During the course of the project, the PI organized workshops and led collaborations to bring together interdisciplinary groups that could bring both practical insight and theoretical background to bear on the problems; she also gave talks at a variety of seminars and conferences, disseminating the work to a range of communities that utilize such approaches.\n\nThe proposed work resulted in core theoretical developments which were published in a range of venues spanning both mathematics and theoretical computer science, as well initiating several more applied and experimental investigations with collaborators from domains that utilize these measures for clustering and comparison.  In addition to the PI's work, the project funded one postdoctoral scholar, several graduate students, and an undergraduate researcher, all of whom published and were able to present their results or attend workshops related to their work.
