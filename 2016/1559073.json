 "awd_abstract_narration": "Governments at all levels make decisions about spending that have long-term effects. For example, governments committed to large pension payments may have difficulty in meeting debt obligations. The results can be serious: for example, in the United States cities such as San Bernardino and Detroit have defaulted on their debts. Understanding the interplay between the incentive to accumulate debt and to promise entitlements is of crucial importance for understanding these actual and possible future episodes. In this project, the investigators use economic theory to analyze the political determinants of debt and entitlements and the relationship between these two components of governmental, fiscal obligations. \r\n\r\nDespite a large literature on the political economy of debt and many papers on pensions, there is almost no work that studies the political economy of the interaction between debt and entitlements. This project aims at developing a new framework to fill this important gap. This research contrasts debt and entitlements in resource allocations: debt transfers resources across periods, whereas entitlements directly target the future allocation of resources. The investigators introduce the study of entitlements into a dynamic political economy models, and analyze the impact of entitlements on debt. The research also examines how the levels of debt and entitlements change as the persistence of political power changes, or as the political system becomes more unstable. The project further investigates the determinants and the consequences of the joint growth in government debt and entitlements since the 1970s. Moreover, this research develops a novel way to evaluate fiscal rules that constrain the growth of debt and entitlements.",

Fiscal stress is usually blamed on government debt and, indeed, debt has ballooned in the U.S. and other OECD countries in recent decades. To tame this trend, more and more countries have put in place fiscal rules that limit government debt. Similar rules also exist in many U.S. states. However, fiscal rules often do not target other spending obligations (most notably pensions and health care) that are major determinants of fiscal sustainability: the so-called entitlement programs. Entitlements are a major determinant of fiscal sustainability in many jurisdictions because they are large (on a flow basis, larger than interest payments on debt) and because, by definition, they cannot be compressed easily. In the United States, entitlements have grown rapidly since the 1960s and have long overtaken discretionary spending. A similar pattern in the growth of entitlements holds across OECD countries.

In fact, recent research argues that the European Union Stability Pact has caused de-funding of pensions, and that U.S. states with stricter fiscal rules have less-funded pensions. And yet, while leading academics have long pointed out that debt and entitlements should be recognized as a combined fiscal burden for the government, there is no academic work that studies the political forces that jointly shape debt and entitlements.</p>\n<p>This study provides a politico-economic model in which debt and entitlement levels are jointly determined.

Political power changes over time, as for instance in an intergenerational setting. The group that is powerful in period 1 (we call it \"young generation A\") can use debt to leverage future resources to finance higher current consumption. In addition, young generation A can set entitlements, which we model as \"pre-committing\" some fraction of future resources to a desired allocation. Thus, both debt and entitlements are tools for the temporarily powerful group to extract resources from groups that will be more powerful in the future.</p>\n<p>The main results of the analysis concern whether fiscal rules are effective in protecting future generations. In a world with frictionless capital markets, debt limits have no real effects. For example, forcing a reduction in debt by some amount will cause young generation A to increase both its entitlements and private borrowing by the same amount, such that young generation A's private and public consumption levels, and indeed all agent's consumption levels in both periods, are unchanged. Thus, tightening a debt limit results is neutralized by a combination of less government debt, more entitlements, and more private borrowing. The same neutrality property holds for limits on entitlements. When, instead, capital market frictions are so large that agents do not participate in private capital markets, fiscal rules are partially effective in protecting the future generation: they reduce total government obligations, but less than one-for-one because group A partially substitutes debt with entitlements. Strikingly, however, when capital market frictions are in an intermediate range such that agents actively participate in capital markets, fiscal rules have perverse effects. In such a setting, if entitlements are unconstrained, tightening a debt limit leads to an increase in total government obligations and to worse outcomes for all groups.
