 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will be to develop odorant receptor function bioassays to provide services for companies that develop and formulate odors used in many kinds of commercial products.  These services identify the biological sensors responsible for specific odor sensations and determine how these sensors are involved in interaction effects between odors.  Armed with this knowledge, several things become possible.  The sensors associated with desirable smell sensations can be directly targeted, facilitating the formulation of odors designed to please, sooth, or stimulate.  The sensors that respond to repulsive odors can also be identified, opening the way to develop specific blockers of these offensive stimuli.  Furthermore, the highly unpredictable interactions that happen between odors can be characterized, and the sensors affected by these interactions can be identified.  This makes it possible to predict the outcome of mixing odors, facilitating the development of new odors designed for specific purposes.  In the same way that understanding the actions of signaling molecules in the body led to the development of better pharmaceutical drugs, these services will allow better manipulation of odor environments and experiences.   \r\n\r\nThis STTR Phase I project proposes to complete the development of two biological assays capable of identifying and characterizing the sensors that respond to any odor.  Humans and animals employ hundreds of odor sensor proteins, but which respond to any given odor is unknown.  One major objective is to improve an in vivo assay that identifies which sensors respond to an odor, increasing its sensitivity and capacity for screening odors rapidly.  This objective tests new assay conditions designed to reduce variability and new ways to quantify the responses of the sensors.  Also important is a proof-of-concept experiment designed to demonstrate that interactions between odors at specific sensor proteins can be measured in vivo.  Preliminary results support the expectation that achieving these results will be possible.  Another objective is to convert a cell culture assay for drugs into an assay capable of measuring the sensitivity of individual sensor proteins to odors.  This objective tests new ways to facilitate the function of these sensors in the cell culture environment.  Successful conversion of the cell culture assay depends on finding the right combination of accessory factors from among a few dozen candidates.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nPhase I STTR Award 1549650: Odorant Receptor Identification Transforms Odor Design\n\nOdorcept is developing technology that improves the formulation of new fragrances and also allows, for the first time, the identification of true odor blockers.  These advances will transform the ability to control the smell experiences of consumers, a need that is widely underappreciated.  Few people realize that fragrances are added to most consumer products to enhance their appeal.  In a few products the fragrance is obvious and the sole source of the product?s appeal, as in perfumes or colognes.  In many others, fragrances add secondary appeal to a product?s main purpose, as in moisturizing creams, sunscreen lotions, and even automobiles.  In yet others, fragrances are added primarily to mask or neutralize unpleasant natural odors of products.  Fragrance designers, called perfumers, have the task of formulating a distinct fragrance for each product that not only distinguishes the product from its competitors but also generates a perception appropriate for the product?s purpose.  For example, fragrances that evoke perceptions of cleanliness or freshness are critical for cleaning products.  Unfortunately, the development of new fragrances is difficult.  The mixing of odor chemicals is more of an art than a science for two main reasons: The biological responses that produce specific smell sensations are not sufficiently understood, and odor chemicals interact unpredictably.  Odorcept?s technology provides a way to gain the knowledge needed to solve both of these problems.\n\nOdorcept?s technology simultaneously measures the responses of all of the hundreds of receptor proteins that serve as detectors of odor molecules.  This has significant practical utility.  In the same way that being able to measure the function of other kinds of receptors in the body has transformed the pharmaceutical industry?s ability to develop better drugs with fewer side-effects, measuring responses of the odor receptor proteins is transformative for the ability to formulate new fragrances and identify odor blockers.  Even more fundamentally, Odorcept?s technology provides information critical for understanding how odors are perceived and discriminated.\n\nDuring Phase I, Odorcept converted an academic laboratory assay into a commercial-scale assay.  Odorcept demonstrated that this technology is capable of measuring the pattern of odor receptor responses and can identify interactions that occur when one species of odor molecule blocks the responses of another.  This measurement is the only way to prove that a molecule is a true odor blocker.  In addition, the improvements made to the technology during Phase I identified simple ways to increase both throughput and sensitivity even further.  Implementing these additional advances will maximize Odorcept?s capacity to provide testing services to the industries that develop fragrances, flavors, and odor blockers.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/24/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Tomoko Sengoku"
