 "awd_abstract_narration": "A wide array of new sensing technologies are being envisioned and developed for modern engineered systems, which provide operators with unique abilities to monitor or estimate the systems' state.  Once sensors are in place, state estimates can be obtained by analyzing data gathered from the deployed sensors together with mathematical models of the system.  However, as systems increase in scale and complexity, the deployment of sensors for high quality state estimation remains a bottleneck in a broad spectrum of applications ranging from microprocessors to power distribution networks and societal-scale Internet-of-Things.   This project supports the creation of new sensor placement (deployment) algorithms with rigorous performance guarantees.  The research will produce a new understanding of the fundamental limitations and achievable performance of sensor placement algorithms, and formulate efficient placement algorithms that perform well in the presence of sensor faults and external attacks.   In addition to the creation of new methods and theories, the research will have broader impact on industrial research-and-development as well as education.  Specifically, the research will directly support design of multi-processor systems and energy-efficient buildings via the transition of research results to industrial partners.  The outcomes will also be used to increase undergraduate participation in research, and will be incorporated into courses to expose students to cutting edge techniques for the complex systems that they will encounter after graduation.\r\n\r\nThe project will be focused on the budget-constrained design-time sensor placement problem.  Motivated by fundamental open problems in this space, this research will establish new algorithms for placing sensors in order to facilitate state estimation with optimality, robustness and resilience guarantees, while meeting sensor budget constraints.   To do this, the sensor placement problem is framed as an optimal resource design problem for a dynamical system subject to disturbances, wherein expensive or constrained discrete sensing resources are deployed to optimize an estimation performance metric. The research agenda is organized around five comprehensive and complementary tasks: (1) sensor placement in systems with stochastic disturbances, (2) sensor placement in systems with deterministic (but unknown) disturbances, (3) fault- and attack-tolerant sensor placement, (4) graph-theoretic rubrics and algorithms for sensor placement and (5) sensor placement for heterogeneous dynamics and sensors.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nModern society is increasingly dependent on a variety of complex engineered systems, including microprocessors, intelligent transportation systems, power systems, and city-scale Internet of Things.  In order to obtain desired behavior from these systems, controllers must first estimate the underlying state of the systems based on measurements provided by sensors deployed on those systems.  However, as systems increase in size and complexity, the critical question is how to deploy a limited number of sensors in order to optimally estimate the system state. \n\nIn this project, we took a significant step towards addressing this problem.  For a variety of different settings, we showed that the problem of optimally selecting sensors is inherently computationally complex, meaning that there is unlikely to be a fast algorithm that finds the optimal solution for all possible systems.  Furthermore, we showed that there are certain types of systems where it is computationally challenging to find a solution that is even close to optimal.  These insights effectively answered an open question that researchers have been investigating for years, namely whether there exist fast algorithms that find optimal (or near-optimal) sensor selections for large-scale systems. \n\nAlthough we showed that there does not exist a fast algorithm to find optimal selections for arbitrary systems, we also showed that there are special classes of systems where we can find near-optimal selections using a simple algorithm that iteratively and greedily selects sensors, one at a time.  We proved how close the resulting sensor selections are to optimal.  Furthermore, we showed that this technique is applicable to a  variety of estimation objectives, ranging from estimating dynamically changing states to settings where the goal is to identify a single static state out of a set of possible states.  We also showed how to address the problem of attack-resilient sensor selection, where the goal is to ensure that the controller can obtain a good estimate of the system state even after an attacker removes some of the deployed sensors.\n\nFinally, we showed that our developed techniques and tools are applicable to a wide variety of settings.  In particular, we showed that the problem of selecting optimal data sources for certain machine learning problems can be tackled using our framework.  Furthermore, we showed that our insights and algorithms can be applied to the problem of optimally testing populations during epidemics, in order to learn the characteristics of the epidemic.  We also created a mathematical framework for understanding how opinions in online social networks impact the adoption of interventions (such as masks and vaccines) against an ongoing epidemic.  This allowed us to understand how to identify influential communities whose opinions can significantly impact the spread of epidemics.  In the context of our sensor placement problems, these insights can potentially be used by researchers and public health experts to better monitor and predict the spread of viruses. \n\nIn addition to the above scientific contributions, the project has also trained a postdoctoral researcher and multiple graduate and undergraduate students in the analysis and design of large-scale systems.  The concepts from the project have been integrated into large undergraduate courses, thereby exposing the undergraduates to cutting-edge techniques for controlling the complex systems that underpin modern society.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/30/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Shreyas Sundaram"
