  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe three years of the PI's Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Mathematics resulted in five published research papers, two conference proceedings, and one expository book chapter in mathematics, as well as sixteen invited lectures. \n\nIntellectual Merit: The PI, along with coauthors Graham Hawkes, Wencin Poh, and Anne Schilling, found a combinatorial characterization of the quantum queer supercrystals that arise in supersymmetric string theory in physics.  This gives a queer Lie superalgebra analog of known results for ordinary Lie algebra representations, filling in an important missing piece of the theory and providing fast algorithms for computing these representations and their tensor products.\n\nThe PI also collaborated with Jake Levinson and Kevin Purbhoo on a series of three papers on the combinatorics of type B Schubert curves and new crystal-like structures that arise in that setting.  We showed that the monodromy of the map from a type B Schubert curve to the projective line is given by a combinatorial operation on shifted Young tableaux, and derived new geometric results on Schubert curves from these combinatorial rules.  We also discovered an analog of Schur function crystals for the Schur Q-functions, and found a new, fast Littlewood-Richardson rule for the Schur Q-functions.\n\nIn addition, the PI, Ken G. Monks, and Ken M. Monks solved an open problem on enumeration of k-bounded anchored permutations, which are permutations of 1 through n that start at 1, end at n, and such that the absolute difference between any two consecutive numbers is at most k.  We proved a conjectured recursion for the 3-bounded anchored permutations and showed that for every k, the k-bounded anchored permutations are enumerated by some finite depth linear homogeneous recurrence. \n\nThe PI published a solo expository paper on Schubert calculus in an AWM book volume called ``Recent Trends in Algebraic Combinatorics''.\n\nBroader Impacts: The PI organized an AMS special session, co-organized the high school summer program Prove it!
