 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nontechnical abstract:\r\n\r\nSome of the most remarkable discoveries are related to the existence and nature of magnetism, and magnetism at a non-magnetic interface remains one of the greatest outstanding mysteries of modern physics. Experimental evidence has revealed magnetism coexisting with superconductivity, and the existence of magnetism at room temperature. This project seeks to provide understanding of such unexpected phenomena. The research requires proficiency in a variety of areas including physics, materials science, and nanoscale engineering, making it challenging and rewarding for beginning graduate and undergraduate students. Students also receive valuable training and experience in an international research setting: this research project is made possible by an international collaboration with a research team from the Weizmann Institute in Israel and exposes students both scientifically and culturally.\r\n\r\nTechnical abstract:\r\n\r\nThe interface between two insulating oxides, strontium titanate and lanthanum aluminate, exhibits an incredibly rich palette of emergent behavior. Some of the most remarkable discoveries have related to the existence and nature of magnetism, which coexists at low temperature with superconductivity, and is strongly influenced by the density of mobile electrons at the interface. Fundamental questions about the origin and nature of magnetism at (non-magnetic) oxide interfaces are investigated using a suite of probes that combine high spatial and temporal resolution. This project seeks an increased understanding of coupled phases in oxides, greatly benefiting the oxide community as a whole. The research focuses on developing a microscopic understanding of the origin of magnetism at oxide interfaces, with a particular emphasis on the role of both localized and delocalized electrons that are otherwise confined to these interfaces.  This research combines ultrasensitive probes of magnetism at low temperature with the ability to create electronic nanostructures using conductive-atomic fore microscope lithography. A variety of complementary imaging techniques are employed to reveal magnetic properties at the oxide interface, including magnetic force microscopy , time resolved Kerr rotation, and superconducting-quantum-interference-device-on-a-tip microscopy. This unique combination of techniques, made possible by an international collaboration between the United States and Israel, is able to provide new insights into the most important outstanding physics questions concerning this remarkable material system.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe electronic, magnetic, and superconducting properties of complex-oxide nanostructures have been the subject of active investigation since the discovery of emergent conductivity at the interface between two insulating materials, strontium titanate and lanthanum aluminate.  In particular, the relationships between these different properties have been the subject of many intense investigations.  Spatially-resolved measurements of these properties have the potential to provide unique insights, and the groups of Zeldov at the Weizmann Institute of Science (WIS) and Levy at the University of Pittsburgh have teamed up to investigate these properties and take advantage of the ability of Levy to create conductive nanostructures and the Zeldov group to image properties using a scanning SQUID microscope.  The work is highly challenging because the conductive nanostructures are volatile and only survive in atmospheric conditions for a few hours, while the scanning SQUID tips are also highly sensitive to air and must be created just before measuring.\n\nDuring the length of the award, Levy visited WIS multiple times, and sent a senior undergraduate student to work on the project (Edan Alpern), who spent an entire summer at WIS and converted an atomic force microscope into a lithography system capable of producing nanostructures locally and initiated several experiments with the Zeldov group.  Edan applied to and was accepted into the Masters program at WIS, and will be continuing this research direction in the Zeldov group.\n\nDuring the course of preparing for these experiments, new insights into the magnetic and superconducting properties of conductive nanostructures were performed in the Levy laboratory.  A major discovery concerns the measurement of quantized ballistic transport of electrons and electron pairs in electron waveguides.  The result is highly surprising since the two-dimensional interface does not exhibit ballistic behavior.  Additionally, a new family of emergent electronic phases was discovered in which electrons bind into clusters of n=2,3,4,&hellip; electrons.  The attractive glue is still not understood but is believed to be the same mechanism that gives rise to both superconductivity as well as some signatures of magnetism.  This novel form of electronic matter is highly unusual and is believed to be a consequence of the inherent strong attraction between electrons in these one-dimensional channels. \n\nBroader impact: Several graduate students supported by this grant received their PhD and are working in national laboratory, finance, and industrial settings.  Levy has given over 40 invited talks on the scientific results supported by this grant.  In addition, new collaborations and interactions have been spawned at the Weizmann Institute and at other institutions in Israel. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/05/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jeremy Levy"
