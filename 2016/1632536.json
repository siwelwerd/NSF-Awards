 "awd_abstract_narration": "Explaining how humans adapt to climate change and population growth remain central research questions in anthropology and are relevant to contemporary issues. About fourteen thousand years ago, ancestral Native Americans first entered the Great Basin of North America, where they encountered a landscape dominated by large inland lakes and marshes. Although the climate was generally cooler and wetter than today, it was highly variable and experienced dramatic shifts associated with the transition from the Pleistocene to Holocene epochs. Nonetheless, early Native Americans developed a stable adaptation, characterized by a flexible technology and subsistence base, and high mobility that persevered over the ensuing six millennia, but dramatically reorganized with the onset of extreme aridity about 8,000 years ago. Understanding how these first Americans made a living, interacted with one another, and adapted to climatic change is critical to explaining the colonization of the Americas, and how humans adapt to changing environments more generally. The researchers believe that a cooperative organization of labor by gender was the central feature of this adaptation. This work will develop and validate a general model of human adaptation and a predictive model of archaeological site location useful in other academic research and public lands cultural resource management. It will also garner primary data on past climatic and vegetation change that will contribute broadly to understanding of environmental variability in the western United States. In addition to supporting undergraduate and graduate student education, this project will disseminate research findings to the public through coverage from public broadcasting and major events at regional museums. \r\n\r\nIt is challenging to recover and interpret archaeological evidence of human responses to past climate change from ancient contexts significantly different from modern environments. Gathering the necessary data requires well-grounded theoretical expectations both about where people likely lived and where evidence of their activities has survived. This project adopts such a research strategy by coupling behavioral and geomorphological models to identify and recover evidence of past human habitation along these ancient lake and marsh habitats. This project combines theoretical predictions from behavioral ecology about women?s and men?s subsistence strategies, with sophisticated geomorphological models to predict where they are likely to be preserved in datable buried deposits. Focused on explaining the pre-9,000 year old archaeology of Grass Valley, Nevada, this project entails targeted archaeological field investigations, generating paleoenvironmental reconstructions from pollen profiles and packrat middens, and conducting geochemical explorations of local fine-grained volcanic toolstone quarries. Combined, these data will allow systematic investigation of how early Native Americans adapted to the Pleistocene Great Basin through a period of changing climate. The central theoretical and methodological models developed and tested in the project are generalizable to other contexts, providing a framework to explain processes of human colonization and adaptation around the world.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe earliest archaeological evidence for human occupation of the Great Basin of North America dates to about 14,000-8,000 years ago, post-dating the last major Ice Age.  Environmental conditions were changing dramatically and rapidly during this post-glacial period (the latest Pleistocene and early Holocene epochs), as the world warmed up.  What were the environmental conditions that early Great Basin settlers encountered?  The Grass Valley archaeological project seeks to understand how people living in the central Great Basin survived and thrived during this period and knowing the habitats in which people lived is essential to achieving this understanding. \n\nGrass Valley is a small internally draining valley in north-central Nevada with a rich archaeological record of early human habitation.  To find out what the Grass Valley environment was like from 14,000-8,000 years ago, our project used the fossil record obtainable from wetlands (containing ancient pollen) and packrat middens (containing well-preserved plant remains) to characterize changing vegetation patterns. \n\nWe took a sediment core from a wet meadow next to a playa left behind by now-dry Pleistocene Lake Gilbert, at Gund Ranch on the east side of the valley (Figure 1). Radiocarbon dates from the sediment core reveal that Lake Gilbert had receded to low levels by ~14,100 years and an open marsh had begun to form, fed by waters from nearby hot springs. This marsh would have been prime habitat for large game, waterfowl, and a range of edible plants that sustained early human populations.  We extracted and analyzed pollen and microcharcoal particles from the core and developed a sequence of vegetation changes that characterized Grass Valley through the terminal Pleistocene and early Holocene periods, up to ~7600 years ago (marked by a thick layer volcanic ash from Mt. Mazama, the present home of Crater Lake in southern Oregon).  Figure 2 (from Brugger and Rhode, 2020) presents a diagram of changing pollen and microcharcoal relative abundances through time in the Gund Ranch core.    \n\nDuring the earliest part of the record, from ~14,100-11,700 years ago, pine woodlands covered nearby uplands down to the valley margins.  Packrat midden evidence shows that these pines were limber pine (Pinus flexilis), a subalpine species that now grows only at the tops of nearby mountains; during the terminal Pleistocene they grew about 1000 meters lower than today, indicating that summers were significantly colder than now, though the climate may have been as dry as today.  Sagebrush (Artemisia) and grass (Poaceae) covered most of the valley slopes, and the marsh was moderately extensive.  The record of microcharcoal suggests that regional wildfires were infrequent during this early period.\n\nAfter ~11,700 years ago (the end of the so-called Younger Dryas cold period and the beginning of the Holocene), desert shrubs such as saltbush (Chenopodiaceae) increased in abundance, and pines retreated upslope.  These vegetation changes indicate rapid climatic warming and drying during the early Holocene. Despite the regional warming, wetland habitats continued to flourish until about 10,200 years ago, with bulrush (Cyperaceae) and cattail (Typha) indicating shallow ponds and sloughs.  (The presence of small quantities of spores of Sporormiella, a fungus that lives on herbivore dung, may signal the use of the wetlands by large herbivores such as deer, mountain sheep, or perhaps even bison or now-extinct camel.) From ~10,200-9200 years ago the wetlands themselves began to dry, with organic-rich muds being overtaken by sands and silts probably blown in from the nearby dry playa.  This dry period marks the maximum abundance of desert shrubs such as saltbush.  It also marks the maximum extent of regional wildfires as indicated by microcharcoal abundance.\n\nAfter 9200 years ago, desert saltbush declined in abundance and sagebrush increased, suggesting ameliorating climate.  Pine pollen also increases, suggesting that pines extended their range downslope again.  The wetland re-invigorated and persisted until about 8300 years ago, only to dry up once more by 8200 years ago, shortly before the deposition of the Mazama volcanic ash.  Microcharcoal abundance suggests that regional wildfires were present and persistent during this period, but not so frequent or extensive as the previous period.\n\nThe paleovegetation record developed from the Gund Ranch sediment core provides key information about local habitats, including productive resources patches such as wetlands, the kind of information important in understanding patterns of human settlement and foraging afforded by the archaeological record.  Other elements of the Grass Valley archaeological project are devoted to characterizing this record, and will be integrated into the paleoenvironmental framework outline here in the near future.  \n\n  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/18/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: David E Rhode"
