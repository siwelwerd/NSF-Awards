 "awd_abstract_narration": "Our science and technology-driven society is immensely dependent on robust, reliable and highly accurate simulations of various natural phenomena. The scope of such natural phenomena is vast. In this proposal,  the PIs take the task of generating software that can robustly, reliably and with high accuracy simulate phenomena that have to do with the propagation of wave-like motions. Such computational codes are very useful in simulating problems in applied and computational mathematics as well as computational astrophysics.  The proposed effort seeks to develop a common software substrate for both those communities. The software is based on advanced computational algorithms and is intended to work very efficiently on modern generations of supercomputers that have been funded by the National Science Foundation. \r\n\r\nTo solve the common problem faced by both communities the PIs develop a toolkit for higher order partial differential equation (PDE) methods. The proposed computational toolkit mainly includes two components. The first one is a multidimensional Riemann solver software that can work with some PDE systems. The second one is Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) schemes for some involution-constrained systems of hyperbolic PDEs such as Euler and magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) flows.",

In particular, important advances were obtained with new ways of exploring magnetic fields that are present in the space between stars. The magnetic fields there play an essential role for the processes of formation of new stars, in the transport of energetic particles accelerated during supernovae explosions, in trasporting heat and matter accross the galaxy. Moreover, these magnetic fields interfere are responsible for the polarized foreground radiation that interferes with the attemps to study the processes at the early Universe.

The latter modes carry information about the gravitational waves at the period of Universe fast exponential expantion, i.e. during the Inflation period. Our research based on our theoretical and numerical studies of magnetic turbulence in conducting fluids allowed us to formulate a technique for tracing magnetic fields with the synchrotron polarization gradients. The new technique has significant advantages compared to the traditional techniques of studying magnetic fields in the interstellar plasmas. In particular, due to the effect of rotation of the polarization plane, the polarized radiation that is sampled by the observer is coming from the limited distance from the observer. This distance depends on the wavelength that is used for observations. Therefore, by changing the wavelength we demonstrated that the new technique can sample magnetic fields in interstellar plasmas at different distances from the Earth. This opens a way for practical studies of 3D magnetic field distribution. Our improved understanding of magnetic turbulence and magnetic field dynamics and dissipation allowed us to address other important astrophysical processes, in particular, the nature of the most energetic events in the modern Universe, i.e. the Gamma Ray Bursts. On the basis of theoretical insight supported by numerical simulations we concluded that turbulence plays an essential role in these bursts and provided the explanation for some puzzling observations of the Gamma Ray Bursts. &nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 11/30/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Alexandre&nbsp;Lazarian</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImage\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation onePhoto\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1622353/1622353_10460563_1575101154145_11--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1622353/1622353_10460563_1575101154145_11--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Magnetic field studies\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1622353/1622353_10460563_1575101154145_11--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Magnetic field studies\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Comparison of a new way to study magnetic field with polarization gradients (red) with polarization.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">MNRAS</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Alexandre&nbsp;Lazarian</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Magnetic field studies</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
