That device changes its properties when it \"sees\" the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), the faint signal from the young Universe. Vast arrays of KIDs are needed for the next generation of CMB experiments. The team will also provide laboratory experience for undergraduates from underrepresented minorities and for high school students in the Chicago area.\r\n\r\nThe team's goals are: (1) Fabricate single-layer resonators to characterize film properties, measure the intrinsic noise level, and verify sensitivity scaling laws. (2) Couple the resonators to a simple antenna, to measure the response and dielectric&#8232; losses at millimeter wavelengths and to verify full coverage of the CMB atmospheric windows. (3) Test single-pixel multi-channel detectors coupled to wide-band log-periodic antennas, to verify background-limited operation under realistic conditions. (4) Conduct end-to-end laboratory tests of a demonstration KID array of about 2000 pixels. Future CMB experiments using KID arrays with millions of pixels will (a) precisely measure the number of neutrino species and the neutrino mass summed over those species, missing - but vital - information for testing theories of particle physics; and (b) dramatically improve searches for the primordial gravitational B-mode polarization that would prove that the Universe underwent the cosmic inflation posited by theorists.",

To make further progress, very large arrays containing hundreds of thousands of extremely sensitive, polarized detectors are required. Fabricating and reading out such large focal planes using existing technology is a challenge.</p>\n<p>The primary goal of this project was to demonstrate a prototype CMB detector based upon a recently developed technology: the Kinetic Inductance Detector (KID). The KID uses superconducting resonators whose frequency changes in response to absorbed radiation. They promise simpler fabrication, integration, and readout than existing technology, but have not yet been demonstrated on-sky for CMB observations. In order to fully demonstrate the capability of this technology and pave the way for future astronomical instruments, it is necessary to characterize the microwave and mm-wave properties of the materials used in fabrication, demonstrate the sensitivity required in the frequency bands at which the CMB can be observed, and show that a large scale array can be constructed with high yield and consistent properties.</p>\n<p>We have demonstrated several new techniques and characterized materials that will be useful in building instruments. Our initial investigation into the use of atomic layer deposited titanium nitride (TiN) films for the construction of resonators showed promising properties and has lead to several publications and new applications. However, the poor repeatability of TiN properties lead us to move to the use of aluminum as a resonator material, which we have demonstrated has predictable and suitable properties. Addition material investigations included the mm-wave properties of silicon nitride dielectrics and niobium transmission lines. Finally, we developed a novel approach to connecting a transmission line to a KID, in which inverted microstrip connects directly to an aluminum resonator coupled to a niobium capacitor, which provides a simple way to reduce excess noise.</p>\n<p>We design, constructed, and tested small prototype arrays consisting of seven optical pixels with lithographic antennas behind small lenses. These devices showed expected noise and response to radiation as well as expected beam patterns. However, we found they suffered from an unexpected response to stray light, that is, optical power entering the chip directly rather than through the antenna. Several designs were tested to mitigate this effect, with partial success. We therefore chose to replace the antennas with a metal feed horn coupled to a dual-polarization wide-band probe. These devices have performed as expected, reducing the sensitivity to stray light to a level which is difficult to measure and suitable for future CMB instruments. Prototype devices at two frequencies have now been tested, and we expect to continue this work in the future.</p>\n<p>The final part of this program - the demonstration of a large array - has been delayed as a result of significant restrictions to cleanroom and lab access due to COVID-19.
