 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports participation of US-based researchers in the conference \"Dynamics of Evolution Equations\" to be hosted by the Centre International de Rencontres Mathematiques in Luminy, France from March 21 through March 25, 2016.  Dynamical systems is an all-encompassing field, which has thriven through the continuous interaction with other sciences and engineering.  The present conference has a blend of presentation of current research and tutorials covering the interaction of dynamical systems and biology, control engineering and other applied subjects.  The format, small size, and location, of the Conference are perfectly suited for learning and scientific exchange, and particularly appropriate for young researchers, who will be able to interact with senior researchers and gain both scientific knowledge and international experience. \r\n\r\nThe scientific focus of the conference will cover the following topics: Differential equations and their discrete time analogues, Partial Differential equations, Stochastic differential equations, Functional differential equations and equations with delayed effects, Problems on networks (problems on graphs), Discontinuous and hybrid systems, Control theory, and Modeling in biological and social systems. These are subjects which are timely and widely important.  It is anticipated that interactions among participants will lead to the development of new directions of research and to the strengthening and fostering of international collaborations.  More information can be found on the conference website: http://scientific-events.weebly.com/1335.html",
