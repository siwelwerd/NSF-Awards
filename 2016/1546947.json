 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ms. Alison Damick will undertake research on the emergence of urbanism and its relationship to technological and environmental change during the Early Bronze Age (c. 3200-2400 BCE) in coastal Lebanon. The development of urban societies is critical in human history. Urbanism continues to be a current dominant settlement trend, and involves especially intensive modes of environmental modification and stress. The fluctuations of urban societies have often been attributed to climate variability, the over-exploitation of agricultural and natural resources, and the ability of humans to respond to such challenges. Archaeology is ideally positioned to examine these processes because it traces long-term impacts of different modes of environmental modification and resource use over the entire course of past climate change events, and generates models for more or less effective strategies in different contexts. This research will produce data that is relevant to widespread contemporary concerns, (in the United States and beyond), where a wide variety of environments, urban infrastructures, and technologies must be mobilized to address national strategies for coping with a changing climate. It is also relevant in areas in which there are globally invested development interests, such as Africa or the Middle East, where policies for engaging with often de-centralized urban systems require models for understanding alternative urban strategies for coping with local needs. This research investigates the ways in which urban systems of the past in Lebanon, and their attendant environmental technologies, provide insight into diverse strategies that allowed for settlement rejuvenation within very small timespans. This will generate new insight into urban resilience, which has direct implications for international development policies. This project also directly contributes to collaborative training programs and international comparative research by providing training opportunities for Lebanese and international students and the first microbotanical reference collections for the Archaeology program at AUB. \r\n\r\nFor this project, Ms. Damick will examine changes in plant use and processing technologies over the course of early urbanization at two sites in coastal Lebanon.  The early urban settlements of Lebanon are much smaller than in neighboring areas, and show evidence for periodic expansion and contraction throughout their occupation history; however, they appear to have been less vulnerable to the broader regional de-urbanization movements of the \"4.2k arid event\" than the settlements of neighboring areas. This research uses a close analysis of the microbotanical and ground stone tool evidence from Tell Fadous-Kfarabida (TFK) in the north and Sidon in the south, to reconstruct and compare plant production and processing over the course of urbanization in one of the least understood areas of the Levant. Through an analysis of grinding tool use wear and microbotanical evidence, contextualized within regional palaeoenvironmental and site-specific occupation records, Ms. Damick will develop a comparative model for how these small-scale early urban societies reacted to climate variability in relation to their micro-environments and their geo-political orientations. This research is crucial for understanding the emergence of social complexity in the Levantine EBA, and for global comparative approaches to environmental resource management in volatile, diverse environments.",

The researchers addressed this goal by assessing the evidence for plant use and processing technologies from two prominent but small-scale Early Bronze Age (EBA; c. 3200-2000 BCE) coastal settlements: Tell Fadous-Kfarabida (TFK) in the north and Sidon in the south. This evidence was gathered and analyzed using microscopic techniques to gather the often-neglected and subtle micro-fossil traces for plant use on site, plant micro-fossil residues from stone grinding tools, and microscopic traces of grinding, pounding, and cutting on the surfaces of those stone tools. This research is part of the Tell Fadous-Kfarabida Excavation Project, co-directed by one of the researchers on this award (Alison Damick), and Dr. Hermann Genz at the American University in Beirut, and in collaboration with the Sidon Excavation Project directed by Dr. Claude Doumet-Serhal of the British Museum.</p>\n<p>The transition from scattered villages to densely nucleated settlement sites (urbanization) in Southwest Asia during the EBA has long been a key archaeological case study for understanding how and why early urban communities first developed, but Lebanon remains one of the most under-studied and least understood areas in the region. This cultural period falls during the Middle Holocene, which was a period of much greater climate volatility than the periods immediately before or after it. Therefore, the expansion and contraction of early urban settlements has often been attributed to how well agricultural surplus strategies worked in the face of that climate variability. However, there were multiple urban trajectories in the Levant, and they show different levels of fitness with a climate-driven model for environmental exploitation strategies and settlement change. This research project combines microbotanical analyses of phytoliths and starches from on and off-site sediments, residues from ground stone tools, and microscopic analysis of ground stone use wear to evaluate the development of plant use and processing technologies at each site. The results of these analyses are then compared to existing records for regional EBA settlement patterns and climate variability to assess how and if they correlate.</p>\n<p>One of the most important ways in which the impact of environmental change on people can be assessed is by linking environmental change with subsistence practices. The analysis has focused especially on evidence from storage contexts (which show long and short-term planning strategies, and the technologies required to maintain those strategies), and cooking and midden contexts (for direct consumption). This project has generated direct evidence for the botanical and technical aspects of subsistence practices over a particularly volatile climate period, ranging from the earliest transition from small-scale villages to urbanized towns in the late fourth millennium through the affective range of the &ldquo;4.2 drought event,&rdquo; in the mid third millennium.</p>\n<p>This research has provided new insight into the processes of the earliest urbanization processes in coastal Lebanon, including producing comprehensive microbotanical profiles for two prominent EBA settlements, the very first produced for any archaeological site in the country. It has drawn on techniques from engineering (use wear) and the natural sciences (plant micro-anatomy and geology) to better develop and inform environmental archaeology methods and practice within the broader scope of anthropological archaeology. This project has also contributed its research and support to local Lebanese environmental and heritage conservation groups working towards better, safer, and more environmentally sound urban development practices along the Lebanese coast. Through this project, international scientific collaboration has been strengthened through collaboration with the American University in Beirut. The excavation of Tell Fadous-Kfarabida functioned as an international field school, and reference collections for phytoliths and ground stone tools have also been produced and will ultimately reside with the American University in Beirut&rsquo;s Archaeology Program as training and teaching tools. Preliminary results have already been presented in the U.S. and Lebanon, and will shortly be presented in Germany, and preliminary reports already appear in Lebanese journals. Further publications are planned in both the short and long term to more broadly disseminate the project&rsquo;s results.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 04/18/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Alison&nbsp;Damick</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1546947/1546947_10403528_1492535727798_Lebmapsites--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1546947/1546947_10403528_1492535727798_Lebmapsites--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Lebanon EBA sites map\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1546947/1546947_10403528_1492535727798_Lebmapsites--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Lebanon EBA sites map\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Location of the two study sites along the Lebanese coast</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">TFK Project</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Alison&nbsp;Damick</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Lebanon EBA sites map</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1546947/1546947_10403528_1492535819484_Lebsitephotos--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1546947/1546947_10403528_1492535819484_Lebsitephotos--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"EBA excavation areas\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1546947/1546947_10403528_1492535819484_Lebsitephotos--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"EBA excavation areas\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Excavation areas from Tell Fadous-Kfarabida (left) and Sidon (right) that were sampled for this study.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">TFK Project, Sidon Project</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (restricted use - cannot be shared)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Alison&nbsp;Damick</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">EBA excavation areas</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1546947/1546947_10403528_1492536010085_Wheat--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1546947/1546947_10403528_1492536010085_Wheat--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Wheat husk phytolith\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1546947/1546947_10403528_1492536010085_Wheat--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Wheat husk phytolith\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Example of a wheat husk multi-cell phytolith, excellent preservation, from TFK</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Alison Damick</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (restricted use - cannot be shared)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Alison&nbsp;Damick</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Wheat husk phytolith</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1546947/1546947_10403528_1492536098749_usewear--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1546947/1546947_10403528_1492536098749_usewear--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Use wear\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1546947/1546947_10403528_1492536098749_usewear--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Use wear\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Examples of microscopic use wear on experimental and archaeological ground stone surfaces</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Alison Damick</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Alison&nbsp;Damick</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Use wear</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1546947/1546947_10403528_1492536166827_groundstone--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1546947/1546947_10403528_1492536166827_groundstone--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Ground stone tools\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1546947/1546947_10403528_1492536166827_groundstone--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Ground stone tools\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Examples of ground stone tools analyzed for residues and use wear</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Alison Damick</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Alison&nbsp;Damick</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Ground stone tools</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
