 "awd_abstract_narration": "This workshop conducted by the University of Texas at El Paso will help to prepare new PhDs and new engineering faculty for careers at institutions with a high value on teaching including Hispanic serving institutions, minority serving institutions and tier 3 universities.  The project will develop and conduct a workshop as well as study the effectiveness of a holistic approach to preparing new faculty to teach at tier 3, minority and Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSIs). The workshop will help new faculty to better meet the wide variety of demands placed upon them at these institutions and improve the quality of teaching experienced by undergraduates.  The workshop addresses a weakness in Ph.D. preparation for meeting the demands placed upon faculty at tier 3 institutions. Since engineering departments at HSIs, minority serving institutions and tier 3 institutions tend to be smaller, and because the teaching of undergraduates is a large component of departmental work, new faculty must quickly become skilled at meeting a range of demands other than establishing a research program.  This project will help new faculty to more effectively advise and mentor diverse students, contribute to ABET accreditation efforts, engage diverse undergraduates in research, use technology in the classroom, include best practices for engaged student learning in their teaching, and participate in education research projects.  Most new faculty at tier 3, HSIs and minority serving institutions are little prepared to address these demands.  This workshop will help to improve faculty effectiveness and lead to better learning experiences for undergraduates at HSIs and minority serving institutions.\r\n\r\nThe proposed workshop recognizes that new faculty teaching at tier 3 institutions, HSIs, and minority serving institutions face a unique set of demands. The workshop will introduce faculty to the issues, effective strategies, and available resources in key areas of demand placed on faculty. Grounded in evidence-based practices, the workshop's holistic approach aims to include all of the major expectations placed on faculty time, and which new faculty are likely to lack experience. Topics to be addressed include: mentoring and advising, ABET accreditation, engaging undergraduates in research, and effective practices for engaged student learning. Workshop organizers expect that future offerings could be made available in the form of a one-credit course for graduate students anticipating a career teaching in HSIs and minority serving institutions. Results from this work will be widely distributed for the benefit of the STEM education community.",
