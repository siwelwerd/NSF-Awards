 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will provide funding to acquire a sensitive instrument to measure magnet properties of rocks in the paleomagnetism laboratory at Rutgers University. The instrumentation will be used to promote progress in the earth sciences.  This new instrumentation will support the laboratory development and research program of a female, early-career researcher.  Access to the instrumentation will also support the training of graduate students and postdoctoral researchers. This system will be the only one of its kind in operation in the entire Mid-Atlantic region of the United States.\r\n\r\nPaleomagnetic studies provide a powerful window into the histories of Earth and other planetary bodies. As rocks form, they record magnetizations which can be measured in the laboratory to infer both the orientation and, in many cases, the intensity of the ambient field at the time of formation.  The new system will be used to address a diversity of problems in the earth and planetary sciences including (1) paleolatitude studies to test different tectonic models for India-Eurasia convergence during the Cretaceous and Paleogene periods, (2) determining the magnetic effects of hypervelocity impact events on target rocks to guide the interpretation of the magnetizations of cratered planetary surfaces, and (3) constraining the physical processes that generated ancient dynamo magnetic fields on other planetary bodies.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nPlanetary magnetic fields shield atmospheric gases and satellite electronics from the solar wind and provide some protection from cosmic rays. As a result, magnetic fields are thought to play a role in preserving habitability and technological infrastructure. The Earth?s field is powered by cooling of its core, which is made of conductive iron-nickel alloy.  In the molten outer portion of the core, warm metal rises and cold metal falls, driving convection.  This organized motion of conductive material generates a magnetic field. Determining how the intensities and geometries of planetary magnetic fields have changed in the past provides a rubric with which to anticipate its future behavior.  When rocks form at the surface of a planetary body or are affected by heating, shock waves, or chemical reactions, tiny magnetic minerals within the rocks record the direction and intensity of the magnetic field present at the time.  The study of these ancient magnetizations is called paleomagnetism.  Scientists use paleomagnetism as a tool to explore topics such as the motion of continents in the past, the intensity and efficiency of Earth?s magnetic shield over time, and factors that affect the generation of Earth?s magnetic field within the core. \n\nTo investigate these topics, laboratories conducting research in paleomagnetism use magnetometers to measure the intensity and direction of magnetization recorded within rocks.   Funding from this grant enabled Rutgers University to purchase a state-of-the-art magnetometer that is now being used to conduct magnetic measurements.  The paleomagnetism laboratory at Rutgers University studies extraterrestrial rocks (such as Apollo samples from the Moon) to assess how common it was for planetary bodies to generate magnetic fields throughout solar system history.  With the new magnetometer from this grant, the lab is measuring rocks from the Moon and from meteorites to study the generation of magnetic fields on other planetary bodies in the early Solar System.  For the first billion years of lunar history, the Moon generated a magnetic field with strengths similar to that of the Earth?s modern field. Recent work at Rutgers has demonstrated that the field declined by an order of magnitude (i.e., factor of 10) in intensity between 3.5 and 3.1 billion years ago, suggesting that there was a change in the mechanism generating the magnetic field within the Moon?s core.  Rutgers paleomagnetists have also demonstrated that large variations in measurement of ancient lunar field intensities is unlikely to be explained by impact shock waves significantly demagnetizing rocks on the Moon?s surface after the magnetic field died. Recent work in lunar magnetism has generated substantial media interest including interviews in the Atlantic and Science Friday, which airs on National Public Radio and Public Radio International. \n\nThe laboratory also uses magnetism to study the tremendous physical and chemical effects that rocks at craters experienced after they were shocked and heated by asteroid impacts.  A major focus of study at present is the 66 million-year-old, 180-km diameter Chicxulub impact crater which is linked to the extinction of the dinosaurs.  After large impacts, chemical-laden waters flow through fractured and highly porous crater rocks, forming a hydrothermal system that would be an excellent habitat for heat-loving microbes.   As such, impact-produced hydrothermal systems may have provided an early habitat for life on earth and perhaps even facilitated its origin.  Because hydrothermal systems can create new magnetic minerals, Rutgers scientists were able to use paleomagnetic techniques to constrain the duration of the hydrothermal system at Chicxulub, which may have lasted hundreds of thousands of years after the impact.  This work led to additional media engagement, including the lab and Principal Investigator being featured in \"Day the Dinosaurs Died,\" an episode of NOVA that aired on PBS.  During the tenure of this grant, the Rutgers Paleomagnetism Laboratory has connected with numerous classrooms through the Skype a Scientist Program to discuss topics in impact cratering and the evolution of the Moon, exposing this research to hundreds of students across the country.  \n\nIn addition to research and public engagement, funding from this grant enabled training of multiple early-career scientists from the undergraduate through postdoctoral levels, including 4 women and 2 non-traditional students.  The ability to construct and utilize a high-throughput paleomagnetism laboratory has also bolstered the research and career development of the female, tenure-track, Assistant Professor who served as the Principal Investigator of this grant, which will help reduce underrepresentation of women at the faculty level.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/29/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Sonia Tikoo-Schantz"
