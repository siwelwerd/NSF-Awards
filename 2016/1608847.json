 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\nNon-Technical:\r\nThe major goal of this project is the development of reliable, bioinspired, molecular assembly protocols and materials for fabricating functional photonic (light-active) and electronic (electron-active) devices. Biological structures with nanometer-scale dimensions are able to self-assemble using principles of molecular recognition, principles that can now be harnessed for production of technologically useful materials, objects, and devices. Fabrication techniques that mimic biological nanometer-scale assembly strategies promise to transform modern electronics manufacturing by reducing the need for increasingly expensive lithographic fabrication equipment and facilities, decreasing reliance on toxic, rare-earth elements, and increasing the energy efficiency of producing and operating computational and communications devices. Besides advancing science and engineering issues critical to future device manufacturing processes, this project will provide educational and research training opportunities for students at the undergraduate, post-graduate and high school levels. This project will train students in the unique combination of biochemical and physical methods of modern nanotechnology that are relevant for industrial and academic careers. Through Project SEED (Summer Educational Experience for the Disadvantaged), high school students from disadvantaged economic backgrounds will participate in laboratory research during the summer months to become acquainted with the emerging field of nanoscience. The project coordinators will continue to actively recruit participants from demographic groups typically under-represented in the science-technology-engineering-mathematical (STEM) disciplines.\r\nTechnical:\r\nSpecific objectives of this three year project include: 1) development of metallic clusters for significant enhancement of Raman scattering signals by templating metal nanoparticles on DNA origami, then using these Raman-bright clusters as photonic devices for tagging and tracking specific cell-types during cell-sorting; 2) application of newly prototyped tetrahedral origami for functional 3D metal cluster assemblies including single electron transistors and chiral plasmonic devices; and 3) fabrication and testing of a 51 kilobase DNA origami for larger, oriented helical structures for photonic devices. Development of self-assembling systems for bottom-up fabrication has been a long sought-after goal of nanotechnology. The particular merit of this project stems from the convergence of recent advances in DNA-based self-assembly methods with new understanding of plasmonically coupled metal nanoparticle clusters for a wide range of optoelectronic applications. Intellectual merit of the project also derives from the interdisciplinary collaboration that couples a biochemist and a physicist on a productive team with a history of successful scientific research and educational activities. The project will lead to development of alternative, cheaper (most steps are in aqueous solution) and more versatile fabrication methods for composite bio-nano-devices. These nanostructures may be useful in the development of naturally biocompatible devices with strong potential for use in biomedical applications. Results from this study may provide major impacts to a range of applications, including electronic devices with decreased size, weight, power consumption, and heat generation for mobile sensing and ubiquitous computing.",
