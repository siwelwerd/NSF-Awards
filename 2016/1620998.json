 "awd_abstract_narration": "Our modern technical society needs devices able to store and deliver energy effectively, for applications including i) mobile electronic devices (ii) electric transport via cars, electric bikes, \"hoverboards\" and other vehicles (iii) implanted biomedical sensor devices, and (iv) electrical energy storage for alternative power sources such as windmills and photovoltaics, because \"the wind doesn?t always blow, and the sun doesn?t always shine.\"  Current commercial storage is dominated by batteries, especially lithium ion batteries ubiquitous in cell phones, laptops, Tesla electric vehicles, etc, because they have the highest energy density by weight.  However, batteries can heat up (not desirable for medical implants), contain toxic components (as in the lead acid batteries common in electric bikes), and have safety issues (witness the string of fires in \"hoverboards\" recently).  It is worth examining other options like supercapacitors, which store energy by nonchemical, nontoxic means, can deliver electrical energy far more rapidly than batteries, and which do not heat or represent fire danger.  While supercapacitors have long occupied niche markets as secondary power sources or for rapid charging applications, they do not store as much energy per unit mass as lithium ion batteries, and conventional designs are more expensive, based dominantly on the cost and materials in the supercapacitor charging terminals (electrodes). This I-Corps team proposes a new approach that combines the revolutionary material graphene with designed proteins to provide supercapacitor electrodes that are cheaper and have high energy density and so could be disruptive for the energy storage market. \r\n\r\nIn the short term, this I-Corps team hopes to produce low cost, environmentally benign small supercapacitors which can potentially be used in medical devices (since they do not heat up and are benign), niche transportation applications (such as replacement for batteries in  e-bikes and cars), and potentially novel devices such as nontoxic, non-flame based biodegradable replacements for flares. In the long term, they could help supply reliable and quickly discharged electrical grid storage to go hand-in-hand with intermittent energy generation from renewables so that the transfer of electricity remains stable and disruption free. During the I-Corps program, the team intends to interview stakeholders in general energy storage technologies, grid storage (from the storage provider side and the energy storage side), home energy storage, energy storage in medical devices, and energy storage in various transportation contexts, especially e-bikes and cars.  The team does not plan to go after energy storage in the consumer electronics market, where the technology is sufficiently mature.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOutcomes from NSF- 1620998 \"I-Corps: Hybrid Protein Graphene Electrodes for Supercapacitors\"\n\nThis award enabled the PI, postdoctoral researcher Krishna Ravikumar, and mentor Melbs Lemieux to discover a strong possible business plan for the startup company Protein Architects.  We began with the idea that our patent pending research on protein \"bricks\" for self-assembled nanoscale device architecture could be used to create a kind of energy storage device (supercapacitor) based upon a hybrid of the 2-dimensional wonder material graphene and our proteins used for binding and spacing graphene sheets.  We ended realizing our proteins may be useful in their own right as a kind of \"synthetic antibody\" which we call \"beta bodies,\"\n\nIntellectual Merit\n\nThe intellectual challenge of this research was 1) to test our hypothesis that the energy storage of graphene/protein supercapacitors could be a useful invention attractive to potential customers, 2) if that hypothesis failed, to develop a viable alternative plan if there are any.  This was to take place through the customary ICORPS process of interviewing about 100 stakeholders.\n\nWhat we realized for (1) is that while there is a potential niche for supercapacitors in the extreme environment of downhole oil drilling to provide safe \"high surge\" power delivery to sensors in the drill, that the viability of the supercapacitors needed there is more dependent upon development of the packaging and not the core material inside the supercapacitor.  This also holds for extreme environment applications in spacecraft.  In other applications, such as wearable medical devices, the very environmentally friendly aspects of our proposed supercapacitors (low temperature, non-toxic, non-explosive energy storage) were not sufficiently strong to beat out the much higher energy density in batteries.\n\nWhile making inquires to members of the biomedical research community about the potential application of our device for energy storage, we recognized that the same binding property could be useful for other applications.  Indeed a conversation with a biomolecule supply firm let to the suggestion that we look into \"synthetic antibodies\", proteins which can bind other biomolecules like the natural antibodies produced in our body but which are more robust in the environment.  Like our \"beta solenoid\" proteins, these proteins contain \"loops\" that can be varied to bind to different proteins or other biomolecules, and like our proteins they are about 10X smaller than antibodies and of the order of 50X cheaper to produce.\n\nWe discovered that there are about a half dozen companies based upon existing protein architectures, that some have stability features in extreme environments (high temperature, extreme acidity or alkalinity, etc.) similar to ours, but that our proteins offer a customizability for multiple functionality that is not present in these other proteins.  In particular, we can develop one side of the protein to say, bind a disease biomolecular marker, while we can modify the other side to bind to a prepared surface or some kind a signalling nanoparticle. We can also build scaffolds of \"beta bodies\".   \n\nWe spoke to a number of companies that develop assays or tests for specific disease markers outside the body, companies that do 3D cell assays (testing drugs in an environment resembling the body), companies that do tissue engineering, and companies that do specific drug testing in complex environments. If we can produce \"beta bodies\" as we call them with high binding tendency and specific binding tendency for certain named compounds, these companies would buy our product.\n\nBroader Impact \n\nOur products could be useful tools in diagnostic clinical assays for humans and animals. In addition, the market for the use of conventional antibodies in research is about $4-5 billion per year worldwide.  There is a problem with the reliability of these conventional antibodies (a given cell line does not always provide reproducible behavior), the cost (they are 50x more expensive to produce than conventional antibodies), and viability (they must be refrigerated to be kept viable and cannot be shipped long distance).  Hence, there are multiple antibody companies worldwide.  University and medical research laboratories can spend tens of thousands of dollars per group on these antibodies.  If one could successfully market a stable, disruptive alternative to these conventional antibodies a rather new business could be created that would benefit university labs (they could spend research funds on other costs like personnel or new equipment that would otherwise go to antibodies), and the stability would offer the chance to develop antibodies for applications in extreme environments which can lead to new discoveries in science and medicine.  Moreover, these synthetic antibodies can be used to develop treatments for biotoxins like snake or spider venoms that will kill organisms before traditional antibodies have a chance to develop (death can occur in hours or days, while it takes about 1-2 weeks for a complete antibody response in the immune system). Use of a human analogue protein could yield eventual therapeutic applications.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/19/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Daniel L Cox"
