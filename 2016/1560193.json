 "awd_abstract_narration": "This REU site project to be hosted at University of Maryland College Park emphasizes combining theory with practice. The students will benefit from a strong faculty team. Building on the past experience, the project is expected to result in strong undergraduate research leading to successful research/industry careers for the students in the future. Outreach activities with high schools will attract high school students to this research. The site plans to recruit under-represented groups and also students from non-research universities and HBCUs. \r\n \r\nThe projects proposed not only form cutting-edge theory research but are also relevant to practice and have high impact applications. The projects considered are in applied area of Big Data Analytics, Information Extraction in Natural Language Processing, Fair Division, Pricing over Social Networks, Secure Communication and Public Health. The approach of getting students interested in theory, starting from applied implementation has an added side benefit that it would train students in sharp algorithmic implementation and experimentation skills, which are deemed in high regard by leading Computer Science companies.",

Each year students from \nacross the country applied (about 180 a year) and we took 20 (10 funded by \nNSF, 10 funded by other sources).  We had very high standards.  Within the \nexcellent students who applied we had some other criteria as you will see \nbelow. Our goals were:\n\n1) Give students who normally would not have a chance to research (e.g., \nfrom non-research schools) a chance to do research. This will help inform \nthem if they want to do research as a career.  Around 60% of the students \nwere from non-research schools.\n\n2) Give students who are from underrepresented groups a chance to do research. \nThis will help broaden the community of researchers in the country.  Around \n60% of the students were female. About 13% were African-American or Hispanic.\n\n3) Give the students a grad-school-like experience and tell them PROS and CONS \nof going to grad school.  80% of the students in our program who have graduated \nare now in grad school in computer science.\n\n4) Actually do research! Our projects were a combination of theory and practice. \nSome took theory (that is, math) and applied it to very practical problems that \nare important today.  Others did mathematics or related computer science that may \nbe important tomorrow.  We give some examples of our projects:\n\na) Security: The more computers are in our society the more chance there is that \nsomeone will break a system and steal data. The Security projects were about \nexposing security flaws and fixing them. Some of the projects focused on the cloud.\n\nb) Kidney Exchange: It is hard to find a good match for a kidney.  So the medical \nprofession often does the following: A1 gives A2 a kidney, A2's friend gives A3 a \nkidney, etc until you get a cycle. To really pull this off involves rather complex \nmathematical problems. The field of Kidney exchange has lead to many optimization \nproblems.  To solve them requires a combination of computer science and mathematics. \nThis project involved defining such problems, solving them, and seeing how they can \napply to the real world.</pre>\n<pre><br /></pre>\n<pre><pre>c) Automated Hiring and Bias: Companies are more and more using software to evaluate \npeople to hire.  In theory this should eliminate bias. In practice it may re-inforce \nbias. For example, if one of the parameters is that the company never hired people \nfrom a certain region, the program may learn that incorrect behavior. This project \nwas on how to keep the benefits of automated hiring (and other similar problems) \nwhile eliminating the bias. Some of what was learned in this project may be used \nat the University of Maryland for graduate student selection.  \n\nd) The Can't Stop Game: Can't Stop is a real game with four dice that is fun. We \nhad a project where a computer was trained to play it very well. Its hard to play \nperfectly since there are many random elements. It is hard to judge how well the \ncomputer played since, unlike Chess, there are no world champions to play against.  \nHowever, it did beat everyone in the program including the mentor who considers \nhimself and expert. The techniques used may in the future be used to train computers \non more serious tasks.  \n\ne) Natural Language Processing: Programs that translate (say) English to Spanish \nusually do a very good job; however, one issue is context.
