 "awd_abstract_narration": "Variability is a major characteristic of the mesosphere lower thermosphere (MLT) system (the region between 80 to 120 km), and the sources of this variability are not very well understood.  There are two types of atmospheric wave activity seen in this region: short wavelength waves called gravity waves (GW) and long wavelength waves called tidal waves.  The science focus of this award work plan is to achieve improved understanding of the possible physical mechanisms that generate short-term tidal wave variability in the MLT region.  Particular emphasis in this award research would be placed upon understanding the role of gravity wave variability producing the resulting variations in tidal propagation and tidal wave dissipation characteristics. The expected broader impacts on the space weather community along with the  implications for space weather research and educational outreach including K12 and under-represented groups are excellent, especially because the research objective of delineating and understanding short-term tidal variability represents information that is much needed for predictive space weather modelers, an important task for a technological society, as emphasized in the Decadal Survey.  The funded research would support a graduate student at Colorado University, Boulder, and second, the lead scientist has described a sound plan to enhance K-12 STEM education with the participation of under-represented groups through the University of Colorado (Boulder) BOLD program, which provides summer courses for high school students.  The Principal Investigator has a successful history of mentoring students through similar programs.\r\n\r\nThis award would analyze and quantify the short-term variability of the diurnal migrating tide in the MLT region using observations derived from the combined TIMED (Thermosphere, Ionosphere, Mesosphere Energetics and Dynamics) and Aura/NASA satellite  databases combined with measurements of the observed ionospheric response determined from COSMIC (Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere, and Climate) data. Two questions would be addressed in this study: the first being the identification of the physical mechanisms that drive the short-term day-to-day variability of the migrating diurnal tide.  The second question is concerned with the overall impact that the day-to-day variability of the migrating diurnal tide has upon the mesosphere-thermosphere-ionosphere system. These observational diagnostics would be supported by meteor radar winds that are in the CEDAR database.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe migrating diurnal tide is a global scale wave, driven in the lower atmosphere (troposphere) by the absorption of solar radiation by water vapor.  This process of absorption heats the atmosphere causing it to expand and contract in relation to the solar heating which has a diurnal or 24 hour cycle.  This wave created in the lower atmosphere can propagate vertically into the upper atmosphere at the edge of space, near 100km above the surface of the earth and impact the atmospheric weather and circulation patterns in this region referred to as the mesosphere and lower thermosphere. \n\nThe atmosphere transitions from well mixed to diffusive equilibrium, where the heavier species separate from the lighter species around 100km.  Additional the region between 100 and 300km contains a majority of the ionosphere which is the charged plasma region of the earth?s atmosphere.\n\nIn recent years it has been acknowledged that the variability in the structure of this atmospheric region, known as ?space weather?, can have a significant impact on space based technologies.  One critical area is around atmospheric density which can impact the position of satellites in space.  Changes in the waves, such as the diurnal tide, propagating up from below, can perturb the atmospheric density and play a significant role in space weather.  An understanding of space weather is critical for maintaining robust space domain awareness.\n\nWhile the migrating diurnal tide has been known to exist for decades and has been well investigated, many of these investigations have focused on the long term or ?mean? structure of the diurnal tide.  This is because of the challenges in effectively measuring the migrating diurnal tide in the mesosphere and thermosphere which much be conducted remotely because satellites or aircraft cannot effectively operate in this region.  One of the challenges with measuring the migrating diurnal tide is that neither a single ground nor satellite measurements can unambiguously resolve the migrating tide.  Either a network of ground based observations or multiple satellites are required to resolve the structure of the short term or daily variability of the diurnal tide.\n\nUnder this grant we evaluated a novel technique we had developed under a prior grant used to determine the daily amplitude of the migrating diurnal tide.  This technique allowed us to estimate the day-to-day variability of the migrating diurnal tide in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere.  These observations were used to validate the day-to-day variability of multiple atmospheric general circulation and assimilation models developed by the National Center for Atmospheric Research and Naval Research Lab for the first time.  Once validated we were able to utilize these models to conduct numerical experiments and better understand the source and impact of migrating diurnal tidal variability.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/05/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Scott E Palo"
