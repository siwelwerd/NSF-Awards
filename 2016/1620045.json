 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award funds the research activities of Emeritus Professor Daniel Z. Freedman of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\r\n\r\nAccording to our present understanding of the laws of nature, there are four different fundamental forces.   One of these, gravity, appears to have a very different character than the others.   Surprisingly, however, research over the past twenty years has uncovered a surprising connection between theories that include the gravitational force and those that do not.   Most striking is the fact that important effects which are very difficult to study by conventional methods in one theory often become relatively simple when approached from the perspective of the so-called \"dual\" theory to which it is connected.  Professor Freedman's research focuses on developing new ways to understand black holes by exploiting these new connections.    He will also study certain non-trivial tests of these connections, verifying their internal mathematical consistency.   Thus, research in this area advances the national interest by promoting the progress of fundamental science. Such research has also proven to be an excellent training ground for junior scientists who are interested in using sophisticated mathematics to describe real and potentially real applications.  Professor Freedman's research involves extensive collaboration with theoretical physicists at other universities in the United States and in Europe, and this award provides travel support that will enable these collaborative efforts to continue.",

This allows a uniform treatment of amplitudes involving bulk fields with spin. \n\nIn the second paper we studied the holographic duals of N=2 CFT's on the 3-sphere deformed by mass parameters m^i.  The main observable is the free energy F(m^i).  We showed that bulk interaction described by D-terms do not contribute to the free energy, while chiral F-terms do contribute. Other bulk multiplets were also considered.  We obtained these results directly from properties of the AdS super-algebra, osp(2|4).\n\nIn the third paper we studied domain wall solutions (aka renormalization group flows) in N=2, D=4 supergravity theories containing n abelian vector multiplets and optional hypermultiplets.  The classical Lagrangian of the vector multiplets is  determined by a holomorphic function of n+1 bulk fields X^I called the prepotential P(X^I).  Given this function, a long and tedious procedure has been developed to obtain a domain wall solution and find the free energy F(m^i).  In a number of examples, we showed that this procedure can be entirely bypassed. Instead one can obtain F(m^i)  by a simple algebraic substitution in the prepotential P(X^I).  It is very striking that the free energy, an observable in a strongly coupled CFT, can be obtained directly from the prepotential, a classical quantity in the bulk dual.  We conjectured that this property holds for general N=2 supergravity models.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/17/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Daniel Z Freedman"
