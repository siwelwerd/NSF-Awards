 "awd_abstract_narration": "Despite recent gains, women still remain underrepresented in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) fields. This is of national concern because of the U.S. STEM workforce is vital to maintaining our status as a global leader and competitor. This research examines the role of gender and ethnic intergroup ideologies in creating an unwelcoming social climate in male-dominated STEM domains. These ideologies are prescriptive sociopolitical beliefs, such as the belief that men and women are naturally suited to do different jobs and they should stick to those areas alone. These beliefs influence attitudes and behaviors, and can result in a negative environment for learning and working.  These negative environments can reduce women's interest and persistence in STEM domains. This research crosses dimensions of intergroup perceptions, and examines novel hypotheses in several experiments and a longitudinal study. The proposed studies examine both the effect of experimentally manipulating the ideologies, as well as the effect of naturally occurring variation in ideology endorsement on the experiences of women and ethnic minorities in STEM fields. The goal is to understand factors that affect persistence in STEM fields, and ways to enhance persistence. Ultimately, this research could increase the participation of underrepresented groups in STEM, and U.S. competitiveness in STEM fields. \r\n\r\nAcross four studies, gender ideology is manipulated experimentally to test whether (1) assimilation (women adapting their behaviors to a male-dominated environment) and segregation (men and women should stick to their areas of expertise) perspectives increase agreement with gendered math and science stereotypes, (2) these perspectives are particularly prevalent where they have the potential to do the most harm - among men in male-dominated STEM fields, and (3) the presence of such perspectives cause women to feel excluded and unwelcome. Two additional studies explore points of overlap and divergence in reactions to gender versus ethnic diversity messages. While women are predicted to respond most favorably to a gender blind perspective, past research shows that ethnic group members respond more positively to a multicultural perspective. Finally, a large-scale longitudinal study examines how naturally occurring variation in gender ideology endorsement relates in a prospective fashion to selecting an academic major. These studies will provide the basis for developing interventions aimed at gender and ethnic ideology beliefs in STEM environments, to promote a culture of inclusion and belonging. They will speak to how beliefs about group differences versus similarities contribute to students' decisions to pursue or avoid STEM majors and careers, and address points of overlap versus divergence in reactions by women versus ethnic students. These findings ultimately could increase participation and innovativeness in STEM fields.",
