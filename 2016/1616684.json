 "awd_abstract_narration": "Scientists from the University of Virginia and Northern Kentucky University will work together to count how many stars in the Milky Way galaxy exist in pairs. Using an instrument that splits the light from each star into a \"spectrum\" they will show if each pair is made up of large or small stars, hot or cold stars, old or young stars. With this information astronomers can better understand how stars form in the Milky Way, and how important being a member of a pair can be to the birth of planets. The light from over 163,000 stars will be analyzed over a three year period by graduate and undergraduate students from each university. The data will be obtained using the Sloan Foundation Telescope at the Apache Point Observatory in New Mexico and the Ir\u00e9n\u00e9e du Pont Telescope at Las Campanas Observatory in Chile.\r\n\r\nThis is a collaborative proposal between Steven Majewski of the University of Virginia (UVa) and Nathan De Lee of Northern Kentucky University (NKU). Together with graduate and undergraduate students at both universities, these researchers propose to analyze Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) radial velocity survey data of 163,000 stars spread throughout the galaxy (disk, halo and bulge) to search for companions to stars with a broad range of stellar spectral types, metallicities, and ages. They will exploit data acquired as part of the SDSS-III/APOGEE-1 high-resolution IR spectroscopic survey, which has already observed over 14,000 stars in multiple (dozens of) epochs. The proposers will complement these data with a new survey, SDSS-IV/APOGEE-2, to extend temporal baselines and the number of observed sources. Their goal is to determine the frequency of companions as a function of host star chemistry, dynamics, evolutionary stage, position in the Milky Way, and environment. They also propose follow-up near-IR speckle interferometric observations of a sample of targets using a new speckle camera on the WIYN telescope, which they plan to build with funds from this award. A pilot spectroscopic survey based on APOGEE-1 data has already produced samples of stellar, brown dwarf, and hot Jupiter companions in a few hundred systems. Dr. Majewski is the PI of both the APOGEE-1 and APOGEE-2 projects.",

This information can include the orbital period, how elliptical the orbit is, and the spacial orientation of the orbit when we observe it from the Earth among other properties. The goal of this project was to understand how well we can actually recover this information for the types of observations that were carried out with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) APOGEE-1 and APOGEE-2 programs. These surveys have a radial velocity precision of these surveys (100 m/s) and the long time-spans between the first and last data points. &nbsp;In order to study the quality of the orbital information recovery, a mock catalog of 9000 simulated radial velocity companions were used. These simulated curves all had 24 observational epochs and a time-span of approximately 1120 days.</p>\n<p>The most important piece of orbital information to recover correctly is the orbital period. This is because the wrong orbital period can visually look correct, but give incorrect values for all the other pieces of orbital information. For example, in Figure 1, the same data is fit using two different orbital periods found using different algorithms found in the VARTOOLS package (Hartman &amp; Bakos, 2016). The Lomb-Scargle (Lomb 1976; Scargle 1982) algorithm found the correct period, and the Fast-&chi;<sup>2</sup> (Palmer 2009) algorithm found a whole number multiple of the true period. On their own, both curves fit the data, however, the Lomb-Scargle algorithm found the correct orbital period in this case. Three orbital period finding algorithms (Lomb-Scargle, AoV (Schwarzenberg-Czerny 1989; Devor 2005), and Fast-&chi;<sup>2</sup>) were analyzed, and Lomb-Scargle proved to be the most effective 73% at recovering orbital periods to within 2%.</p>\n<p>Another way of determining orbital information is by fitting the whole orbit at once. This method is much more CPU intensive, but is often better at recovering correct information from more elliptical orbits. The Joker (Price-Whelan 2017) is a Python software package which is designed to quickly fit all the orbital information to the radial velocity data. Every time the The Joker is run, it can return slightly different results due to the inherent uncertainty in the data. In Figure 2, various orbits returned by The Joker for a given set of sparse data points are shown. The Joker was run 100 times on each of the simulated radial velocity curves, and then the results were put into bins based on their orbital periods. An example of this is show in Figure 3. The period bin with the largest number of data points was usually (greater than 80% chance) the correct period. The few total orbital period bins, the more likely the largest bin was the correct one as show in Figure 4. Thus providing us with a reliable way of identifying good orbital fits to APOGEE-1 and APOGEE-2 like data.</p>\n<p>This work was carried out at Northern Kentucky University in the Physics, Geology, and Engineering Technology department which is undergraduate only.
