 "awd_abstract_narration": "One key limit to spectrum utilization efficiency involves the current practice of half-duplex communication, in which a node cannot transmit and receive on the same frequency at the same time. Some recent studies have provided experimental evidence and methodologies for full-duplex communication. To date, however, all full-duplex demonstrations have been predicated on the principle that the transmitter and the receiver must generate their own radio-carrier waves independently, which in practice results in a high level of self-interference at both nodes. The objective of this CAREER project is to create reliable full-duplex wireless networks by means of reflected power.\r\n\r\nThis project will pursue backscatter modulation, where electromagnetic waves are modulated and reflected by the same antenna that receives them. Within this framework, the end-user receives a signal free of self-interference. This research offers a new paradigm for two-way wireless networks: rather than avoiding self-interference as in half-duplex -- or combating self-interference as in full-duplex -- nodes will re-use the received interfering radio-carrier waves to transfer information. The results of this analysis will advance the knowledge of antenna scattering for a wide range of applications. The proposed implementation in hardware will incite an exchange between algorithm innovation and hardware implementation, pushing the limit of spectrum-efficiency communication.\r\n\r\nThe principal investigator will also embed the proposed research into pedagogy by creating a center of wireless communications at Purdue University Calumet. The center will provide a range of opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students to gain direct experience in testing, evaluating, and improving backscatter modulation for full-duplex communications. Given the current pervasiveness of two-way wireless communication, the results of this research can be used to significantly increase the spectral efficiency of future wireless networks.",

We also proposed two BM configurations with active loads that implement two-way wireless communications.

Using two-way reflection amplifier increases the range of backscatter modulation. \n\nOutcomes\n\nInherent SIC- We proposed a new analog self-interference cancellation (SIC) technique for In-Band Full-Duplex single antenna, named inherent SIC.

The complexity of the analog canceller expressed in the number of taps is independent of the numbers of the TX and RX antennas. Our proposed Full-Duplex Hybrid Beamforming approach provides 1.7X more achievable rate than its HD counterpart with analog canceller of only 50% of total taps. \n\nDNN for non-linear SIC- We used Deep Neural Networks (DNN) for the reconstruction of the non-linear SI components. The new proposed methods allow a significant reduction in or complete elimination of on-line training by utilizing transfer learning and decoupling the reconstruction of non-linear transmitted SI signal from the estimation of the SI propagation channel, respectively. \n\nIntegrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) -- We proposed a new FD-based ISAC system operating at millimeter Wave (mmWave) frequencies, where a massive Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) Base Station (BS) node employing hybrid Analog and Digital (A/D) beamforming is communicating with DownLink (DL) multi-antenna users and the same waveform is utilized at the BS receiver for sensing the radar targets in its coverage environment.\n\nOutreach- This NSF award supported five graduate students.
