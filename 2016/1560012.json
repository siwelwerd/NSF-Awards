 "awd_abstract_narration": "This renewal of a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site at Iowa State University entitled, Biological Materials and Processes (BioMaP), will create novel research experiences for a talented and diverse group of undergraduate students from traditionally underrepresented populations, with limited access to STEM research opportunities. The cross-disciplinary nature of BioMaP enables students to discover the exciting biology/interface and will focus on two research themes. (1) Biological Materials - The interface between biology and materials can be exploited to design robust materials with unique properties. In this context, biological materials are synthetic materials that interact with biological molecules/systems in specific ways to promote biological function. The students will work on projects that include working with new techniques for using bacteriophages as sensors, new thermochemical processing methods for biomass in fluidized bed reactors, and new biosensors for use in pancreatic cancer diagnostics. (2) Biological Processes - A fundamental knowledge of biological processes will be critical in the future chemical industry.  Students will be exposed to this area through projects on protein recovery from transgenic plants, molecular modeling of peptide mimics, and metabolic engineering of alkaloids. Students will be exposed to exciting research experiences of working in a global environment where their research will evolve from dependent to independent status and they will attain life-long learning skills that will impact their contributions to engineering, science and society. \r\n\r\nOver a three year period, this REU Site program will engage undergraduate students in a 10-week intensive, summer research experience focused on the two research themes of Biological Materials and Biological Processes. The students will be active members of inter-disciplinary groups and will interact with a faculty team that is diverse, has broad research interests and an outstanding record of mentoring undergraduate students. The REU students will participate in cohort experiences such as short courses, joint seminars/meetings, workshops, tours of research facilities, and field trips.  Formalized written reports and poster presentations will be used to develop communication skills and significant follow-up will insure that the participants are given the greatest opportunity to pursue careers in Chemical and Biological Engineering. At the end of the summer program, the students will participate in a joint poster symposium together with students from other ISU undergraduate research programs.",
