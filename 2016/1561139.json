 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a renewal project to study carbon balance in the Florida everglades and the interactive effects of climate change, hydrology, and saltwater intrusion. This effort supports continued atmospheric observations of carbon dioxide and methane concentrations, and water and energy fluxes at 2 sites in the freshwater marsh regions of Everglades National Park. The collection of data from 2 additional sites will allow the science investigators to scale up to a regional level and to better develop predictive models to estimate future ecosystem greenhouse carbon balance in the Everglades.\r\n\r\nThe four study sites are co-located with Florida Coastal Everglades Long Term Ecological Research (FCE-LTER) sites and represent the strong gradients found in marsh and mangrove ecosystems of the Park. This work will also contribute to research being conducted through the NSF-supported National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) Program, the National Park Service, the South Florida Water Management District (SFWMD), and the United States Geological Survey (USGS).",
