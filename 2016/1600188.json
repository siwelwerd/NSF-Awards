 "awd_abstract_narration": "The recent detections of gravitational waves by the LIGO observatories in the USA have demonstrated a new way of \"hearing\" the universe using ripples in spacetime, and have provided stunning new tests of Einstein's theory of general relativity.    Observations by astronomers of the motions of stars and gas near supermassive black holes, such as the one at the center of the Milky Way, have opened the possibility of testing Einstein's theory in realms where the warping of spacetime is extreme.   Yet in order to test Einstein's great theory, it is essential to know what it actually predicts for real measurements.  This project continues a program of research to provide concrete links between the abstract beauty and complex mathematics of Einstein's theory and the real world where measurements are made by physicists and astronomers.   These links are established by finding approximate, yet accurate solutions of the equations in forms that are practical and usable.    The solutions developed in this research will be used by data experts at the gravitational-wave observatories to perform better tests of general relativity using newly detected signals, and will be used by astronomers to probe how the warped spacetime near massive black holes affects stars orbiting such objects.  Einstein's theory is a topic that fascinates the general public, and the PI will continue to give public lectures on topics related to this research, bringing understanding of Einstein's ideas to the broader community.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, this project will contribute to the ability of ground-based gravitational-wave observatories such as the LIGO-Virgo network to test general relativity, by computing the equations of motion for binary star systems, along with the emitted gravitational waveforms, as predicted by an important alternative theory, known as scalar-tensor gravity, to high accuracy in the so-called post-Newtonian approximation.  It will provide accurate waveforms predicted by this theory in a format that can be adapted to LIGO-Virgo data analysis methods.  The approach extends a method known as Direct Integration of the Relaxed Einstein Equations that has been developed over many years by the PI and his collaborators.  The possibility of testing general relativity in the vicinity of the massive black hole in the center of our galaxy using future infrared telescopes, proposed by the PI in 2008, will be investigated further.  The effects of general relativity on the structure and long-term evolution of clusters of stars around massive black holes will be studied using analytic means based on the post-Newtonian approximation.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIs Einstein?s theory of general relativity the correct theory of gravity, and if so, what difference does it make?  This is the central question underlying the research carried out in this project.  Although general relativity has successfully passed numerous experimental tests, it is important to continue to test it, especially in new regimes, such as near black holes and with gravitational waves.   And even if we assume that it is correct, it may have important effects in a variety of astrophysical situations.\n\nThe analysis of gravitational waves from colliding black holes has shown that the speed of the waves is independent of wavelength, thereby placing a limit on the mass of the putative ?graviton? associated with the waves.   We showed that analyses of recent orbital data on Mars obtained by advanced orbiter spacecraft could also be used to bound the graviton mass at a level competitive with the bound from gravitational waves. \n\nWe pointed out the existence of a new general relativistic contribution to the perihelion advance of Mercury, the basis of of the iconic tests of general relativity. It arises from the fact that the warped spacetime induced by the Sun?s gravity alters the way the other planets perturb Mercury?s orbit, and from the fact that the warped spacetime induced by the other planets alters the interaction between the Sun and Mercury.  The result is an effect that is smaller than the main Newtonian perturbation of Mercury?s orbit from the other planets, and smaller than the main general relativistic effect from the Sun.  However the effect is large enough that it may be detectable by the BepiColombo mission to place and track two orbiters around Mercury, which was launched in October 2018. \n\nWe developed a generalized framework for analyzing orbits of systems containing compact objects (neutron stars or black holes) in a class of alternative theories of gravity to general relativity.  We applied it to theories that establish a gravitationally preferred rest-frame of the universe, and showed how data on pulsars (neutron stars) in orbit around other bodies could be used to constraint such theories.\n\nAssuming that general relativity is correct, we also explored a range of measurable consequences in astrophysical realms.  For example, it is well-known that when two bodies orbit each other and emit gravitational radiation, the orbit both shrinks and becomes more circular with time.   We analyzed the long-term evolution of orbits of a small body (a star or a small black hole) injected into a very elongated orbit around a spinning massive black hole using an approximation to general relativity known as the post-Newtonian framework.   We found that, at the late stages of the orbit, when the body is nearing the final plunge into the black hole, the ellipticity of its orbit and the strength of the gravitational waves emitted are strongly dependent on whether the body is orbiting in the same or opposite sense as the rotation of the hole.\n\nWe also examined a recent claim that at late times in such binary inspirals, one measure of ellipticity increases with time, in contrast to the standard lore, and that this could have observable consequences. We showed that the variable used in that work is not an appropriate measure of orbital ellipticity under the physical conditions posed.   We verified that, by any proper measure of ellipticity, orbits do become circularized at the late stages of an inspiral.\n\nWe analyzed three-body systems in which two of the bodies are orbiting close to each other, while the third body is more distant.  Such configurations span astronomical situations ranging from systems containing multiple planets to binary systems orbiting massive black holes.   Using an accurate representation of the perturbing forces produced by the outer body, we studied the conditions under which the orbit of the inner pair could ?flip? relative to the orbit of the outer body, a phenomenon that had been found earlier using a less accurate version of the perturbations.  We found that the flip phenomenon was generally robust when including the more accurate expressions, but that under some circumstances, the effects of general relativity could suppress the orbital flips.\n\nIn related work, we studied the possibility that the supermassive black hole Sgr A* at the center of the Milky Way galaxy might have an intermediate mass black hole companion in a close orbit, residing well inside the orbits of a population of stars that have been observed orbiting the central object.  If so, the gravitational field of the companion would induce perturbations on the orbiting stars.  We showed that orbital data on one particular, well-studied star, called SO-2, could begin to place interesting constraints on the mass and orbital parameters of a hypothetical companion, or even conceivably result in a detection of such an object. \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/13/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Clifford M Will"
