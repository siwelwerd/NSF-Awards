 "awd_abstract_narration": "Broward College (BC) is both a Hispanic Serving Institution (HSI) and a Minority Serving Institution (MSI). The college offers bachelor's and associate degree programs and certificate programs.  A 2+2 program in Environmental Science offers an experiential learning curriculum which combines general cognitive and workplace knowledge with applied science and industry specific skills. This five-year project entitled \"Scholarships Targeting Recruitment of Individuals for Degrees in Environmental Science\" (STRIDES) is selecting 30 high ability, low-income students recruited from one of three cohorts chosen to participate in a new bachelor's degree program which has BioSecurity as one focus. Students complete an internship, independent study or a research project as part of the program. The program is developed in response to an unmet need in the geographical region for biological/environmental science graduates. Program staff work with local companies to provide internships, job shadowing, industry mentoring and jobs for students. \r\n\r\nResearch focuses on a study of retention rates via analysis of various aspects of the problem such as financial assistance and the level of Perceived Education Support (PER) with a comparison of community guided research versus faculty guided research as parameters. The program provides students a combination of campus based and field activities which reinforce learning through individual and group work. The college's Academic Support Centers (ASCs) offer academic support, tutoring and career exploration programs. STRIDES students work one-on-one with subject matter experts located in the newly established STEM Center to deepen conceptual knowledge and understanding. Tutors working in ASC's are required to attend training to become certified in order to practice. Faculty who are active members of professional societies and community research receive training in the mentorship of students. The Management Team comprises faculty, STEM administrators, a Support Services administrator and a researcher. Project evaluation(both formative and summative)is accomplished by both internal (BC's Institutional Research department) and external experts (MN Associates). Program assessment occurs at the end of each semester. The database tracks year to year retention and graduation rates for women, minorities and transfer students. Data from prior years serves as a benchmark for success in improving retention and graduation rates.",
