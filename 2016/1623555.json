 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this workshop is to increase robustness and generalizability of the experimental behavioral sciences. The meeting is dedicated to addressing potential solutions to the so-called \"WEIRD people\" problem: the fact that most experimental behavioral science research is conducted with members of WEIRD populations (Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich Democracies) and the discovery that much of this research fails to generalize to broader populations. There has been much attention paid in some fields to this well-documented sampling bias however calls for broader sampling by themselves have not been effective in the absence of structured guidance on how to address this problem. This workshop will bring together scholars from a range of disciplines whose research represents positive case studies of how to overcome these barriers and highlights the benefits of doing so. The goal of the workshop is to conduct a systematic analysis of disincentives undermining diversity and incentive structures supporting convenience and inertia over good science practices. An action plan will be developed for addressing and ameliorating these issues through more specific guidance for researchers.",
