A number of distinguished mathematicians have agreed to attend and speak at this conference. The award gives early career researchers, researchers who are members of underrepresented groups, researchers not funded by NSF a chance to attend and participate in this conference.  The organizing committee will strive to make this funding opportunity known to target groups through a number of different activities.  More information will be made available at:\r\n\r\nhttp://scientific-events.weebly.com/1396.html",

The meeting focused on the behavior of waves in the presence of singularstructures, ranging from boundaries to corners, edges, cones, andcusps.  In these settings, the phenomenon of diffraction of waves is of central importance and considerable mathematical interest: in evolution equations such as the wave equation, for instance, wavefronts can be deflected by interactions with edges and corners in ways that go beyond the traditional \"ray approximations\" that in smooth geometries accurately describe the propagation.  These issues are both a theoretical obstruction to our good understanding of the estimates satisfied by classical and quantum waves, and also a difficulty in accurate computation, for instance in high frequency acoustical problems.  Among the pure mathematical problems discussed at the meeting were: Strichartz estimates for wave and Schr&ouml;dinger equations in the presence of boundaries and corners; regularity of solutions to the wave equation in black hole backgrounds; bounds on solutions to Laplace and Helmholtz equations in domains with corners.  There were also talks on numerical analysis for the Helmholtz equation via hybrid asymptotic-numerical integral equation methods.\n\nThe meeting brought together researchers from a number of areas, including both elliptic and hyperbolic partial differential equations as well as applied mathematics and numerical analysis.
