The symposium series has run since 1954, originally every two years, and yearly since 2000.\r\n\r\nStudents form an integral part of the Information Theory community, and the IEEE Information Theory Society continues to promote student participation, including the ISIT Jack Kiel Wolf Best Student Paper Award, the creation of the ISIT tutorial series, and the Information Theory Society Student Committee.  In recent years, students comprise about one-third of the participants to ISIT, and the travel funds offered through this award will support the attendance at the 2016 ISIT by students enrolled in a graduate or undergraduate program in the United States and whose papers have been accepted for presentation.",
