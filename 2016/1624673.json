The symposium is part of the annual AAAI Spring Symposia series. The symposium will bring together researchers studying teamwork in different fields, including artificial intelligence, human-computer interaction, and the social sciences. For student participants, this experience will provide a unique opportunity to interact with researchers from multiple disciplines and learn about research in different fields. Students will receive feedback on their own research and will work closely with senior researchers and other students to shape a new research agenda for the development of intelligent systems for supporting human teamwork. The symposium will be a starting point for forming a new cross-disciplinary community of researchers who are interested in the development of intelligent systems for supporting teamwork. New approaches and systems for supporting teamwork are needed for supporting increasingly more complex distributed teamwork in such areas as healthcare, education and disaster relief.",
