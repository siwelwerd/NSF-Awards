Currently, over 1500 mobile clinics operate in the US and handle over 5 million visits per year providing essential healthcare services. These programs, however, have grown organically over time and it is important to establish evidence-based approaches to encourage a systematic expansion of this essential healthcare delivery model. This proposal addresses this issue through the use of epidemiological and economic GIS data, combined with proprietary routing software, to implement a program for optimal delivery of mobile clinic healthcare services in the Houston, Texas, region. The project involves eight different providers and includes designing systematic strategies for meeting future healthcare needs of low-income communities. The aim is also to develop models and techniques that can be implemented by mobile clinic programs throughout the country. Early estimates indicate that this project can result in 20% increase in mobile health clinic capacity, which could translate into significant savings in healthcare costs, and considerable improvements in quality of life for the poor. These results are in line with the NSF mission goal of promoting the advancement of health.\r\n\r\nThe overall goal of this project is to optimize and implement a data-based program for coordinated deployment of  mobile clinic programs. We will initially identify optimal expansion strategies for the eight current mobile clinics programs to meet the fast-growing demand for healthcare services in underserved communities. The project will then measure the potential of the developed models and techniques and apply them to mobile clinic programs in other regions of Texas and other states in the nation. To achieve the above goals, the team will first apply data mining and forecasting techniques to estimate present and future demand of healthcare services in selected communities. We will combine these approaches with advance GIS mapping tools and stochastic measures to identify target population clusters. We will also conduct survey and economic analysis to measure the operational cost and identify operational constraints in the present mobile clinic programs, and develop new optimization models for the deployment of the mobile clinic service. Then, we will develop new effective techniques to solve the developed optimization models to estimate the maximum capacity of the current mobile health clinic programs in the Houston region, and identify expansion strategies to meet the future service demand while minimizing cost. Lastly, we will estimate overall healthcare cost savings and quality of life impact at the community level at baseline and post-intervention.",

Currently, over 1500 mobile clinics operate in the US and handle over 5 million visits per year. In Texas several providers operate mobile specialty and primary clinics, but have been unable to meet the expanding needs of regional minority, low-income, populations.  These programs have grown organically over time and it is important to establish technology-based (Smart) approaches to encourage a systematic expansion of this essential healthcare delivery model.  The goal of this NSF-funded project was to develop advanced mathematical and economic models to optimize the routes of selected mobile health clinics, minimizing operating costs, and maximizing patient coverage in underserved communities.  This is the first project of its kind focusing on mobile clinic healthcare in the country.  \n\n The study took place in Houston, Texas, and involved a multidisciplinary team of experts in engineering, health economics, primary care, public health, geographical information systems, and software development from the University of Texas Health Sciences Center at Houston and the University of Houston.  The study lasted over two years including extensive multi-source data collection and integration, and model development. Data on disease emergence patterns, healthcare resource use, population demographics, geographical road distribution, and socioeconomic indicators were used to create the optimization models, and prioritize high-need communities.  Economic analysis tools were used to estimate the impact of proposed routes.  The results of the project showed significant impact in terms of increased population benefit, and improvements in how mobile clinic programs can define geographical community priorities, allocate resources, and develop evidence-based policies.  In the case of the Texas Children?s Hospital (TCH) program, for example, the proposed routes showed potential improvements of up to 60% in the number of vaccinations currently dispensed per year.  This increment equates to savings of up to $4 million in healthcare costs because of prevented emergency care visits on the part of at-risk populations.  Several optimization scenarios were developed so TCH could select from various routing strategies allowing the program to maximize visits to distant priority, underserved, communities.  These strategies also provided the basis for establishing short-term and long-term policies for the expansion of mobile clinic services in areas currently not covered by TCH, and for the justification of establishing fixed clinics in the long term.  \n\n The results of this study also highlighted the importance of fostering multi-organizational cooperation between mobile clinic providers and other healthcare institutions. For example, 80% of patients seen by the TCH mobile clinic program require referral for further clinical treatment.  Currently mobile clinic personnel have limited resources to guide patients to appropriate and affordable medical homes, and have no means to verify if a patient responded promptly to recommended referral, or later sought emergency care at great expense to taxpayers.  During this project, we identified the platform elements for a second study pilot optimizing a multi-mobile clinic network ?connected? to other healthcare system components such as federally qualified health centers, hospitals, or navigation services.  This will allow communities to provide effective, time-sensitive, patient care and reduce the cost of emergency healthcare with the use of smart mobile clinics systems. Timely healthcare to at-risk populations, however, also means connecting mobile clinic programs and community support organizations across geographical regions.  The complexity and transitional nature of the target populations served by mobile clinic programs require integration across cities; families travel frequently between Houston, Austin, San Antonio, Dallas and El Paso, and the risk of disease and healthcare need is shared across Texas. \n\nIn conclusion, mobile clinics play a significant role in providing care to at-risk populations in urban and rural areas.  With this project we have demonstrated how advanced optimization models can help improve substantially the benefit mobile clinics bring to communities.  The next challenge is to implement systems that allow multi-provider coordination across institutions and regions in real-time.  This is part of a vision promising significant savings in healthcare costs, and considerable improvements in quality of life for those segments of the population with the highest need.  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/22/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Rigoberto Delgado"
