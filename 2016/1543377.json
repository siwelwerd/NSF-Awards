 "awd_abstract_narration": "Accurately measuring precipitation in Antarctica is important for purposes such as calculating Antarctica?s mass balance and contribution to global sea level rise, interpreting ice core records, and validating model- and satellite-based precipitation estimates.  There is a critical need for reliable, autonomous, long-term measurements of Antarctic precipitation in order to better understand its variability in space in time. Such records over time are essentially absent from the continent, despite their importance.  This project will deploy and test instrumentation to measure and record rates of snowfall and blowing snow in Antarctica.    \r\n\r\nProject goals are based on installation of four low-power, autonomous Antarctic precipitation systems (APS) co-located at automatic weather station (AWS) sites in the Ross Island region of Antarctica. The APSs are designed with an integrated sensor approach to provide multiple types of observations of snow accumulation types at the test sites. The APSs are designed to construct an accurate timeline of snow accumulation, and to distinguish the water equivalent of fallen precipitation from surface blowing (lofted) snow, a prime confounding factor. The standard suite of instruments to be deployed includes: precipitation gauge with double Alter windshield, laser disdrometer, laser snow height sensor, optical precipitation detector, anemometer at gauge height, and a visible /infrared webcam.  These instruments have previously been shown to work well in cold regions applications.",

The measurement of precipitation in Antarctica is significant because precipitation is the dominant term of the surface mass balance (SMB) of the Antarctic Ice Sheet (AIS). A better understanding of precipitation will provide for a more accurate analysis of trends in the AIS and contributions to global sea level rise in a warming climate. The APSs were installed at four sites in the northwest Ross Ice Shelf and operated for two years from November 2017 to November 2019. At each of the four sites the precipitation was measured with an OTT Pluvio<sup>2</sup> precipitation gauge. Additionally, snow accumulation at the site was measured with a sonic ranging sensor and using GPS-Interferometry Reflectivity (GPS-IR). Supplemental observations of temperature, wind speed, particle count, particle size and speed, and images and video from a camera, were collected to provide context to the precipitation measurements. The observations from the APSs were collected using a combination of UHF radio and internet communications, as well as local storage on a memory card as a part of each APS. The collected data has been processed, quality controlled, and posted to the USAP ? Data Center for public access and use by future research projects interested in the Antarctic climate and SMB.</p>\n<p>The observations collected by the APS sites have provided a greater understanding of precipitation on the Ross Ice Shelf and in Antarctic in general. The observations have provided for event-by-event analyses of precipitation in the region providing direct observations on the frequency, duration, and intensity of precipitation events. The results are concentrated during the summer, austral fall, and early winter seasons when the APSs were operating most efficiently. Most of what has been currently understood about precipitation in remote regions of Antarctica have been based on numerical model simulations or field sites based on using ultrasonic sounders, snow pits, and firn and ice cores. The key piece that has been lacking in these studies is the in situ measurement of precipitation and providing a link and correlation to the accumulation at a given site. Regarding numerical model simulations, the APS observations provide a ground truth for the evaluation of the results from numerical weather prediction forecasts, reanalyses, and Earth system models. Improvements in precipitation simulations from these numerical models will provide for more accurate forecasts, better understanding of past precipitation events and SMB, and a better representation of future climate projections. The APS project also provided for the ability to correlate the occurrence of precipitation to changes in surface height as measured by a sonic ranging sensor and GPS-IR. The results indicate a strong correlation during light wind conditions, some correlation in moderate winds, and no correlation in high winds and provide a better context from which previous field studies can be understood.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 06/10/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Mark&nbsp;W&nbsp;Seefeldt</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div
