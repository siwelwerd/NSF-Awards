 "awd_abstract_narration": "Atomic nuclei are made up of protons and neutrons.  For the lighter elements the number of protons is very often equal to the number of neutrons in the nucleus.  However, nuclei also exist in which there are extra neutrons, or neutron-rich nuclei, which are unstable and undergo nuclear decay.  This project focuses on the study of these neutron-rich unstable nuclei and will investigate key questions in nuclear science related to the overall structure of nuclei: What are the fundamental properties of extremely neutron-rich matter and what is the limit of nuclear existence?  The project will be carried out by Gettysburg College undergraduates and a faculty member with the Modular Neutron Array (MoNA) Collaboration and Large area multi-Institutional Scintillation Array (LISA) at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory (NSCL). Gettysburg College students supported by this funding will learn significant new physics as they develop the tools necessary to be researchers in academia and industry. \r\n\r\nUndergraduate students and their faculty are advancing the field in various ways, ranging from how beams of rare isotopes interact with matter to the exciting possibility of two-neutron radioactivity. Objectives include creating He-9 two different ways experimentally at the NSCL to not only shed light on conflicting prior results but also to better understand the \"halo\" nucleus He-10. Measuring the lifetime of O-26 could confirm a new mode of radioactivity. An analysis project focusing on the production mechanism for projectile fragmentation will impact the physics community's currently limited understanding of beam production mechanics at radioactive beam facilities. All proposed work will involve undergraduate researchers.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis award funded nuclear science research that directly impacted undergraduates and faculty at Gettysburg College as well as the international nuclear science community.  As part of the MoNA Collaboration, we further knowledge of nuclear science through experiments that are designed to probe central questions in our field:  What is the limit of nuclear stability?  How are extremely neutron-rich nuclei formed?  How can we leverage our experimental findings for innovations in technology, education, and science?\n\nFunding allowed us to participate in an experimental campaign at the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams/National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory (FRIB/NSCL) to measure the certain properties of both of a nuclear state in the exotic nucleus 9He.  This funding also allowed us to be part of a second experimental campaign at the FRIB/NSCL to study 26O, a system that may exhibit two-neutron radioactivity.  We also moved forward in a project to use neutrons signals in coincidence with charged fragments created in relativistic beam and target interactions to better understand the dynamics of those interactions.  Publications directly related to the proposal's goals are still in preparation.  However, work not included in the original proposal has led to other publications and the identification of new science from previously taken data.  Two peer-reviewed publications (J. K. Smith et al., Nuclear Physics A, 955 (2016) and M. D. Jones et al., Physical Review C 96 (2017)) are obvious key outcomes.  This funded work also highlights the training of undergraduates through research to support the future workforce in STEM fields in the USA.   Students associated with this work are continuing in STEM fields through graduate study or employment.  \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/30/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Sharon L Stephenson"
