 "awd_abstract_narration": "The team will investigate the abundance of an element, oxygen, commonly found in nearby galaxies with star-studded disks of gas. Over time, the gas in a galaxy is chemically enriched by successive generations of stars. Oxygen is used to trace how this \"pollution\" varies within a galaxy and from one galaxy to another. This information will help solve the important problem of how galaxies evolve. Senior team members will train junior members. The team will also develop a hands-on exhibit for a science museum. The innovative exhibit will mimic the research equipment and use custom software to demonstrate the research technique.\r\n \r\nIn a tour de force, the team will use a cutting-edge observing technique - multi-fiber spectroscopy - to measure oxygen variations within about 3600 galaxies from the just-started survey for Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA). The team's specific goals are to (1) quantify the oxygen gradients, (2) study their relationships to the galaxies' physical properties, (3) study how winds from a galaxy redistribute its oxygen, and (4) search for the abrupt falloffs in oxygen that signal accretion of relatively pristine gas. This research will provide insights into the physical processes that drive chemical enrichment. Those insights will, in turn, lead to important improvements in theorists' simulations of how galaxies evolve.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual Merit: The goal of the project was to study the chemical abundances of spiral galaxies -- namely their Oxygen to Hydrogen (O/H) and Nitrogen to Oxygen (N/O) ratios --- in order to gain insight into the physical processes that drive galaxy chemical evolution.  We did this by analyzing spatially resolved spectra of roughly 10,000 galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey IV MaNGA project.  In each spectrum, we used the stellar continuum to infer the stellar mass and the nebular emission lines to infer the chemical abundances.   We created abundance maps for each galaxy and measured radial and azimuthal variations in their O/H and N/O ratios.   We found:\n\n1) Galaxies that are satellites of a larger galaxy have elevated abundances, likely due to infall of chemically enriched gas from the larger galaxy.   This shows that chemical elements synthesized in one galaxy can be transferred to another.\n\n2) Galaxies that have steeper abundance gradients also tend to have larger azimuthal scatter in their abundances and a higher neutral gas content.  This points to a scenario where unenriched neutral gas from the cosmic web accretes onto galaxy outskirts, steepening gradients and producing scatter.  This process of gas accretion is known to be vital to galaxy evolution, but has proven difficult to observe directly.  These new observational markers will enable astronomers to pinpoint galaxies in the midst of an active accretion phase for further study.\n\n3) Galaxies have different N/O vs. O/H relations in their centers than their outskirts, likely due to differences in star formation efficiency.\n\n4) The O/H and N/O ratios of galaxies depend on both their local and global physical properties (e.g. stellar mass surface density and stellar mass.) \n\nBroader Impacts: We designed and partially built an outreach exhibit called the \"Plug-N-Play Spectrograph\"  for the University of Wisconsin-Madison's outreach center \"Space Place\" .  The interactive exhibit showcases how the Sloan Survey uses optical fiber bundles to obtain spatially resolved observations of galaxies, and it illustrates a spectral data cube.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/01/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Christy A Tremonti"
