 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project involves exploration of how plants adapt naturally to harsh environments, in order to understand stress tolerance mechanisms and inform development of food and energy crops that can better tolerate changing environments. The outcomes have broad societal relevance, as crop production is frequently constrained by environmental stresses, such as salinity. This project will provide a learning platform for diverse teams to design new computational and molecular tools for studying naturally existing genetic variation. These teams will consist of biological and computer science graduate students, undergraduates, including underrepresented minorities, high school students and instructors, and international collaborators. The project also supports career development for two beginning investigators. Data generated from this project will be used to design an interactive visual data analysis interface with contributions from high school student programmers. Other activities include plant nutrient awareness events for the public and K-12 students, a summer workshop to train high school teachers and students in PCR and DNA fingerprinting, and discussions with local high school students on ethical issues related to genetic engineering. DNA sequence datasets and bioinformatics programs resulting from this project will be shared publicly, which will enable scientific activities ranging from basic research exploring mechanisms in genetics and evolution to generating markers and resources for crop improvement.\r\n \r\nThis project will investigate how a species achieves stress adaptation compared to a closely related stress sensitive species by analyzing genomic signatures that lead to transcriptomic responses to stress, followed by targeted transgenics and molecular phenotyping. The overall analysis will be tested in a conceptual framework that highlights stress adaptation achieved by modifications in existing core stress response systems, and/or recruitment of new genetic components. Extremophile plants represent emerging models for understanding genetic mechanisms governing plant survival under extreme abiotic stresses. Schrenkiella parvula and Eutrema salsugineum, the two most salt-tolerant species among known wild relatives of Brassica crops, will be used as model genomes, and multiple salt stresses will be applied to study adaptation compared to the stress sensitive model A. thaliana. Genomes of both S. parvula and E. salsugineum show extensive overall synteny with the A. thaliana genome, which enables comparative studies benefiting from the wealth of genetic information available on A. thaliana. Inter-species comparative RNAseq methods are planned to uncover the dynamics of abiotic stress responsive gene regulation caused by excessive Na+, K+, or Li+ salts. Transgenic plants in all test species will be created targeting representative genes in major stress responsive units identified. Molecular level phenotyping will be achieved via ionomic and metabolomic profiling of wild-type and transgenic lines collected from control and stress-treated samples. Finally, descriptive genetic modules will be developed with a core data set linking genomic restructuring that enables improved stress adaptation in known and novel stress responsive pathways, in both stress-adapted and stress-sensitive species. The work will provide a strategic case study that can be expanded to other organisms, to evaluate genomic organization via targeted genetic studies assisted by transgenic plants, transcriptomic regulation, and metabolomes used for molecular phenotyping.\r\n\r\nThis project is co-funded by the Genetic Mechanisms Cluster in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences in the Biological Sciences Directorate and by the NSF EPSCoR Program.",

Our project goals included research aims that involved generation and interpretation of multi-omics datasets (transcriptomics, metabolomics, and ionomics) to understand genetic mechanisms underlying plant growth during salt stress that in turn have potential broader applications in ensuring global food security. Salinity stress is a major threat to agriculture. Throughout our history of plant biology driven agricultural innovations, developing crops with maximum yields was prioritized. However, with current threats to agriculture, intensified by the climate crisis, the design of smart crops that can sense the environmental conditions proactively, survive multiple stresses, and adjust their growth to result a successful harvest balanced against local and seasonal environmental challenges need to be prioritized over crop designs that simply maximize yield under the best conditions that are coupled to total crop failures when such conditions are missing. Extreme environmental events are a recurrent feature in most agricultural fields today and wild species naturally adapted to extreme environments present an opportunity to harness adaptive strategies brought about by natural selection over millions of years. <em>Schrenkiella parvula</em> and <em>Eutrema salsugineum</em> are two such extremophyte models closely related to Brassica food and oil crops (for example, cabbage, rapeseed, and mustard family crops).</p>\n<p>We have examined <em>S. parvula</em> and <em>E. salsugineum</em> as salt-tolerant extremophyte models compared to the most studied model plant, <em>Arabidopsis thaliana</em>, which is highly salt stress sensitive similar to many of our crops. We have systematically assessed the gene composition of these extremophytes and their unique responses to salt treatments that either cause plant death or lead to extremely low yields in crops. Our understanding of genetics of wild plants adapted to environmental stress is limited. This project contributed to broadening the current knowledge on how salt tolerance is achieved by wild plants that are highly adapted to multiple salt stresses. We found that the core salt-stress response gene network between stress-adapted and stress-sensitive plants largely overlaps, but the extremophytes show selective gene duplications and network reprogramming to adjust growth and development during salt stress, that were significantly different from stress-sensitive plants. Our published work highlights candidate genes selected from extremophytes that are conditionally switched on during short and prolonged stress conditions resulting in stress resilient growth with minimum penalties to growth and yield. Additionally, our results highlight that there are multiple different pathways that lead to stress resilient growth even among closely related extremophytes highlighting the potential value in diverse wild species that can be mined for traits optimized for stress resilient growth. The discovery of innovative genetic strategies underlying plant growth during environmental stress identified in extremophytes and the broader scientific insight gained during the project period have led to 32 research publications and 25 research talks at scientific meetings. These research products ranged from describing our new findings about gene networks to the plant science community to sharing new computational biology tools and methods we have developed, applicable even to non-plant systems.</p>\n<p>In addition to providing novel scientific insight, this project, created a learning platform to a diverse group of next generation scientists formed of graduate students, undergraduate students, postdoctoral scientists, visiting scholars, and high school students to interact with each other; allowed exchange of ideas in designing new computational tools and molecular genetic experiments; and produced research material to practice current analyses methods in data science. Specifically, this project facilitated thesis research for five PhD candidates; provided first-hand research experience for 30 undergraduate students; and provided research material and support for three postdoctoral scientists directly involved with project research aims. Importantly, this project created research opportunities to undergraduate students that may pursue diverse professions in our society beyond academia, who were trained to think critically and value science-based facts. Several K-12 students were recruited to spend 1-3 months participating in research, annually throughout the project to promote early engagement in scientific research and foster involvement of underrepresented groups in research.
