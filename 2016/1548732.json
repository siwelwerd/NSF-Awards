 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main goal of this 2-year project is to improve present understanding of the Coronal Mass Ejection (CME) process by elucidating the relationship between flux emergence and CME dynamics, thus providing additional insights into the CME genesis.  The study will also clarify how flux emergence contributes to the transport magnetic energy from the solar interior to the heliosphere. \r\n\r\nThe 2-year research effort is focused on an undergraduate research project, thereby providing direct training with data analysis and the conduct of scientific research.  Any relationships found between source-region properties of CMEs, including flux emergence and speeds of associated CMEs, should also enable improvements in space weather forecasting, which could minimize adverse impacts of CME-driven disturbances on our society.  This project directly supports the Strategic Goals of the AGS Division in discovery, learning, diversity, and interdisciplinary research.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Sun frequently launches clouds of magnetized plasma, called coronal mass ejection (CMEs), from the low corona into the heliosphere. Earth-directed CMEs can disturb satellite operations, endanger flight crews, hamper radio communications, and disrupt power distribution grids.  Such space-weather impacts tend to be more severe for faster CMEs, so understanding factors that affect CME speeds can improve our ability to forecast CME-driven disturbances.\n\nMany basic questions about CME formation and acceleration remain unanswered, however.  For instance, is the energy introduced into the corona via the emergence of new magnetic fields related to the kinetic energy released in subsequent CMEs?  What other factors produce faster CMEs?  Qiu &amp; Yurchyshyn (2005) reported that CMEs were faster in flares with more reconnected flux, estimated as the amount of photospheric flux magnetic covered by \"ribbons\" of chromospheric flare emission.  In numerical simulations of solar eruptions, Amari et al. (2007) found that CMEs occurred with less injected energy in quadrupolar versus dipolar geometries.\n\nTo address these and related questions, we searched for factors that affect CME speeds.\n\nIn a theoretical study, we analzyed the effects of reconnection during an ongoing eruption on the Lorentz forces that act on the ejection. We found that reconnection generally increases the outward Lorentz force on ejections, with the change in force being proportional to the product of the reconnected flux and the typical field strength near the reconnecting region.  This same scaling should apply in other contexts, for example in the Earth's magnetotail and in terrestrial laboratory experiments.\n\nIn an observational study, we identified a sample of 75 solar flares in NOAA active regions, each of which we manually associated with a CME.  All flares in our sample had unsigned latitudes and longitudes of less than 45 degrees with respect to the Sun's equator and its central meridian (as viewed from Earth), respectively.  We also had observations of ribbons of flare emission at 1600 angstroms, from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly aboard NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), for all flares.\n\nUsing photospheric magnetic observations by the Helioseismic &amp; Magnetic Imager (HMI) aboard SDO in SHARP (Space-weather HMI Active Region Patch) files, we searched for any correlation between the speeds of CMEs and changes in the amount of source-region magnetic flux in the hours and days prior to eruptions. No significant correlation was found.  \n\nWe also computed moments of the spatial distribution of radial photospheric magnetic fields, including weighting by magnetic field strengths and/or masking by the presence of ribbon emission (a binary weight), to search for correlations between CME speeds and the magnetic structures of both active regions and flare ribbons.  Several significant correlations were found, but the physical bases of these correlations remained unclear at the conclusion of this project.\n\nIntellectual Merit\n\nOur effort has increased understanding of the CME process in several ways.  We modeled how reconnection during an eruption increases forces on the ejection.  We found no evidence that flux emergence is a significant factor in the speeds of CMEs in subsequent hours or days. We found that some aspects of source regions' magnetic structure are correlated with CMEs' speeds, which merits further study.\n\nBroader Impacts\n\nMuch of our effort was focused on undergraduate research projects, which directly trained students in scientific programming in Python, in data analysis, and in the conduct of scientific research.  Our theoretical model of how reconnection affects CME speeds has relevance for understanding how reconnection affects dynamics in magnetospheres and laboratory plasma experiments.  Our observational study of relationships between CME speeds and source-region magnetic properties, including flux emergence and spatial moments of photospheric fields, could yield more accurate space weather forecasts, which might reduce adverse impacts of CME-driven disturbances on our society.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/30/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Brian T Welsch"
