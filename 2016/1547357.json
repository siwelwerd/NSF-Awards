 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recently, algebraic topology has found a number of applications within mathematics and beyond. For example, topology provided powerful new methods for detecting and describing shape and structure in complex and high-dimensional data. This award supports the Research Training Group in Algebraic Topology and its Applications at Ohio State University. This work will be performed in a highly collaborative and active interdisciplinary research environment that has recently emerged, involving investigators from the Departments of Mathematics and Computer Science & Engineering. The main objective of the project is to provide early-stage mathematicians and computer scientists with opportunities to learn about both theoretical and applied aspects of topology and related fields. Exposure to these topics will allow students and junior faculty to move fluently across a range of research topics, to enter research communities in traditional core areas, and to work in new interdisciplinary directions.\r\n\r\nThis award supports postdoctoral researchers, graduate students, and undergraduate researchers studying such topology-related fields as geometric group theory, metric geometry, computational geometry and topology, knot theory, and stochastic topology. The award also supports the development of new courses, as well as working groups, seminars, and workshops in these areas. At the heart of the project is an emphasis on mentoring at all levels. The program also places a strong emphasis on developing writing and communication skills, particularly for postdoctoral researchers and graduate students involved in the research group.",
