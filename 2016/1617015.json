 "awd_abstract_narration": "Astronomers have recently discovered \"Manx\" comets, or comets that have orbits that go farther out in the Solar System, but do not send out gas and dust when they get closest to the Sun in their orbits. New models suggest that they could be objects that formed in the inner Solar System and were forced into the outer part of the Solar System when the Solar System was forming. Spectral signatures of some Manx comets are like those of the most common asteroids in the inner Solar System. This leads astronomers to think that the Manx comets are fresh material from the inner Solar System. The investigators will study the Manx comets through using telescopes to image and take spectra of the comets to look at composition and any dust or gas that could be present around the objects. These observations can help astronomers learn how the early Solar System formed. This research serves the national interest by increasing our knowledge about how our Solar System formed and what materials formed at different distances from the Sun.  The investigators participate in many educational outreach efforts, including innovative data visualization with the Hawaii Innovation initiative, and including interns from the K - 12 Assets School in Honolulu.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn an effort to place firm constraints on models of the Solar System, the investigators will study the newly-discovered \"Manx\" comets, or comets that have long-period orbits but have little or no activity at perihelion. These observations suggest that these might be objects that were ejected into the Oort Cloud in the outer Solar System during early planet migration. Photometry of one object suggests that it is similar to the S-complex asteroids that dominate the inner Solar System, but it is also outgassing, suggesting that the Manx comets might represent fresh inner Solar System material. These studies include photometry and spectroscopy of the Manx objects to determine their surface compositions from reflectance spectroscopy, deep images of Manx comets that are sufficiently bright to determine any amount of coma that might be present, a search of old archived data for past detections of Manx comets, and modeling to determine ice sublimation. Observations of many Manx comets could distinguish between Solar System dynamical models. If there are active objects with S-type spectra, the Manx comets could represent primitive material that formed near the Solar System water-ice line. The investigators participate in efforts to train the next generation of scientists in STEM fields through one-on-one mentoring, development of new courses, integration of research and hands-on science into courses, and exploring innovative data visualization with the Hawaii Innovation initiative. The team is currently partnering with the K - 12 Assets School in Honolulu in their intern program, and will incorporate the Manx comet work into this program.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe old view of comet formation suggests that the long-period comets are ice-rich planetesimals that formed in the vicinity of the giant planets and were scattered out to the Oort cloud as their orbits were perturbed by the giant planets.  Later, orbital perturbations by passing stars injected them into the inner solar system where their ices began to sublime under the effect of solar radiation.  Our paradigm of planet formation is changing with models that demonstrate that the giant planets may have migrated in the solar system (as they clearly have in exoplanetary systems), redistributing planetesimals&ndash;both bringing icy material to the inner solar system, and ejecting inner solar system material outward.  The dynamical models make testable predictions about the existence of inner solar system material stored in the Oort cloud.  Recent Pan-STARRS1 and other surveys have been discovering objects on long-period comet orbits that are inactive or minimally active at perihelion (the \"Manx comets\").  This suggests the intriguing possibility that these could represent inner solar system material that was ejected into the Oort cloud during planet migration.  One of these objects has surface properties similar to S-type asteroids and exhibits activity, possibly representing fresh inner solar system material.  Observations of a significant number of Manxes may distinguish between solar system dynamical models.  Discovery of active objects with S-type spectra suggests we might have accessible primitive inner solar system material that formed near the water-ice line in the solar system.\n\nThe goal of this project was to conduct observations of Manx comets that can be used to test current solar system dynamics models.  During this award, we obtained spectral reflectivities for 84 Manx comets, 24 of these have spectral reflectivities at more than one epoch.  We discovered the first Manx object, C/2014 S3 (PANSTARRS).  The surface materials were spectrally consistent with an inner solar system S-type asteroid. At the same time the object exhibited a dust coma consistent with formation by gas-driven (water-ice) sublimation, at a level a million times less than typical long-period comets at a similar heliocentric distance.   The activity implies that it has retained a small fraction of the water that was expected to be present at its formation distance in the inner solar system, and this may be related to Earth-forming materials.  We also undertook an intensive campaign to characterize the first interstellar object because it is on a Manx-like orbit and like Manxes, can help inform how a solar system forms (but in this case an extrasolar planetary system).  This work addresses a key goal of the Planetary Science Decadal Survey, which includes using primitive bodies to provide information about the epochs and processes occurring in the early solar system to understand how our solar system was assembled.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/04/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Karen J Meech"
