 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funding for US participants at the workshop \"Algebraic Cycles and Moduli\" to take place June 2-8, 2016, at the Centre de Recherches Mathematiques, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Canada.  The funding will support three principal speakers, 4 regular faculty and between 9 to 14 junior participants. The workshop activities will include three to four talks each day by leading international experts, interspersed with unscheduled time to allow for discussion and collaboration. The topic of the conference is at the forefront of current research in algebraic geometry. It involves a wide range of complex techniques from geometry, analysis, and topology and has important applications in physics.\r\n\r\nThe specific purpose of the workshop is to survey the recent developments in the field of algebraic cycles and moduli, with a focus on the following topics: (1) Mumford-Tate groups and domains, (2) Torelli-type theorems and hyperk\u00e4hler manifolds, (3) Conformal block bundles over moduli spaces of curves, (4) Normal functions, (5) Applications of the Beilinson regulator to Mahler measure and Feynman integrals.  The workshop will bring together some of the leading experts in these fields, as well as a number of young researchers, who will further propel developments in these directions. More details on the conference can be found at its website: http://www.crm.umontreal.ca/2016/Cycles16/index_e.php",

Hodge theory provides a natural framework in which to study both questions via the Torelli theorem and the Abel&ndash;Jacobi map.\n\nFor higher dimensional varieties, the question of construction of an appropriate moduli spaces of varieties of a given type, and the study of algebraic cycles on a fixed variety remain topics of active research.  Hodge theory again plays a central role, providing an often complete local description of the moduli space (Torelli type theorems) and various refinements of the Abel&ndash;Jacobi map which give a wealth of information about algebraic cycles modulo rational equivalence.\n\n This grant was in support of researchers from US institutions attending the conference entitled Algebraic Cycles and Moduli, which was held at the Centre de Recherches Mathematiques in Montreal from June 2 to June 8, 2016.
