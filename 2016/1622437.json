 "awd_abstract_narration": "Understanding the details of solar energetic particle (SEP) acceleration is critical for accurate predictions of space weather and potential impacts on sensitive space-based assets.  This 3-year SHINE project is aimed at studying SEP events associated with filament eruptions on the Sun.  The goal is to isolate and investigate SEPs accelerated at CME-driven shocks with minimal flare material contributions.  The work expands on other researchers' recent results by using more instruments to cover a broader energy range and extend the analysis.  The methodology involves spectral and elemental composition data analysis techniques that are well established.  The dissemination of the scientific results will be made broadly to the scientific and space weather prediction communities through published articles, scientific talks, and personal communications.  In addition, project results and relevant data sets will be made available via the public web pages of the ACE and STEREO Science Centers.  The three project teams have excellent track record of publications, participating (often in leadership roles) in various workshops (e.g., SHINE), and attending scientific conferences.  Both the team leader and a Co-PIs are under-represented minorities and funding is included for the involvement of an undergraduate student.  The project will promote strong international collaborations for the benefit of advancing space weather research both in the USA and worldwide.\r\n  \r\nThe research plan of this 3-year SHINE project includes four main tasks.  The first task is to examine the characteristics of heavy ions for previously identified events.  The spectral shape variation as a function of particle species reveals characteristics of the accelerating shock, while the composition provides important clues regarding the SEP seed population.  The second task is to study smaller SEP events associated with filament eruptions by using the more sensitive SEP sensors onboard ACE and STEREO.  The inclusion of STEREO data alone has the potential to increase the number of events suitable for study and, in combination with near-Earth spacecraft, allows the examination of SEP characteristics as a function of longitude.  The third task is to define stronger constrains on the primary acceleration region by combining calculations of the particle-release times, for both for single-and multiple-spacecraft events, with timing of the corresponding solar signatures.  The fourth task is to study in detail similar filament eruption events without associated SEP events in order to identify specific features that are key to SEP generation.  The project is directly relevant to the NSF's SHINE program, because it will provide important knowledge about the acceleration and transport of SEPs during solar eruptive events.  Such knowledge is critical for accurate modeling and prediction of space weather conditions from the solar surface to the Earth and beyond.  The research and EPO agenda of this project supports the Strategic Goals of the AGS Division in discovery, learning, diversity, and interdisciplinary research.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Study:\n\nWhile the basics of solar energetic particle (SEP) acceleration are fairly well known, understanding the details is required for accurate prediction of the occurrence and characteristics of SEP events; a goal that remains elusive.  It is widely accepted that SEPs are accelerated primarily by two mechanisms, one associated with coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and the other associated with solar flares.  As most CMEs occur with large flares, it is difficult to determine the relative contributions of the two processes to the resulting SEP event.  One unique class of CMEs generally occur without significant flaring; these are a result of an eruption of a solar filament.\n\n \n\nThe current sophisticated array of solar and energetic particle sensors makes it possible to study the Sun and interplanetary medium in greater depth than ever before and a recent application of these resources has resulted in the identification of ten such events associated large SEP events.  Detailed examination of these events showed the location of the SEP acceleration was generally higher than events with large flares and the resulting SEP proton fluences decreased strongly with increasing energy.  Our study extended this work by examining more species and over larger energy ranges for these events as well as identifying additional ones.  With the STEREO spacecraft well separated from near-Earth spacecraft, we were able to also examine the spread of these events in heliographic longitude.\n\n \n\nScientific Results:\n\nFrom this work, several significant results were obtained.  Comparison of the proton fluences as a function of energy for our events to those from earlier studies of large CME+flare-associated SEP events revealed that filament eruption events, on average, have significantly different energy dependences, with fluences decreasing more strongly with energy.  Although there is some overlap in the distribution of this dependence with that of previous studies, our events lie primarily in the tail of the distribution for large SEP events.\n\n \n\nIn terms of composition, we find that most filament eruption events have a Fe/O abundance ratio at 0.1 MeV/n that is higher than the average SEP 5-12 MeV/n value of 0.134 and decreases with increasing energy.  Most events have Fe/O values significantly below the SEP average at 10 MeV/n.  Most events have no apparent 3He at energies of a few MeV/n, and the few that do the 3He/4He ratios are &lt;1%.  These attributes suggest little to no contribution of flare-accelerated material, which is consistent with expectations.\n\n \n\nThe longitudinal widths of our events are all ~40-45 degrees, agreeing well with the average widths obtained from several surveys of SEP longitudinal distributions in large events.  The centers of the distributions are ~50 degrees west of the source region longitude.  This implies that the particles were accelerated at large than average distances from the Sun.\n\n \n\nImpacts:\n\nThis study furthers our understanding of the variety and generation of SEP events. It specifically looked at a understudied class of events wherein the dominant acceleration mechanism is that associated with CMEs resulting from filament eruptions (rather than those associated with large flaring active regions).  This work contributes to the body of knowledge that is used to assess space weather conditions and their potential impact on society's space-based assets. It also furthers the nation's predictive capability in forecasting the variability of space weather.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/12/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Christina Cohen"
