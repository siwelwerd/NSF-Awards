 "awd_abstract_narration": "It has long been proposed that female animals use various external information containing signals to assess male quality when choosing mates.  However, the connection between a male's level of intelligence and external traits that females can assess has been difficult to measure. Here the researchers will assess spatial memory ability, an intelligence trait thought to increase survival in wild food-storing birds, and two overt male signals, feather coloration and song production, to address the question of whether or not female mating choice is associated with these traits. The researchers will conduct the experiments with free-living birds using arrays of programmable 'smart' bird feeders that can track which individuals are using these feeders to test spatial learning ability. The researchers will then test whether individual variation in learning is associated with variation in communication signals and with mate choice. Findings from this work can be applied to a wide variety of species, including humans, that must make important decisions when using information that isn't always easily assessed or tangible.  All of the results and findings will be widely available to a variety of audiences through publication in peer-reviewed journals and participation in professional conferences. Additionally, this work will support the research experience of undergraduate students and the equipment used in this project will also be used in public outreach activities in the community, including creating a museum display at the University of Nevada's Museum of Natural History that illustrates the differences in human and non-human.\r\n\r\nSignals are universally used across taxa to convey a diverse range of information, including social status, foraging locations, and predator presence. Several hypotheses have been proposed regarding how sexual signals of quality, in particular, have evolved to be honest as these signals are only useful insofar as they reflect some fitness associated trait(s) of the sender. Cognitive ability is one such fitness-related trait, yet direct evidence linking cognitive ability, signaling, and associated fitness consequences of female mating choices have historically been difficult to assess. Using wild birds fitted with passive integrated transponder leg bands and radio-frequency identification technology, the researchers will directly test whether (a) individual variation in a cognitive ability is associated with variation in two modes of signaling perceivable by females and (b) whether variation in cognitive ability and these two signals reflect female mating choices via production of extra-pair offspring. By doing so, the researchers will connect a cognitive trait thought to increase survival, with song production and plumage reflectance, to female mating choices in wild food-caching birds. These birds inhabit differentially harsh environments creating differential selection pressures on spatial memory ability used to retrieve cached food. Using this system the researchers will be able to directly test the assumption that signals reflect individual quality, an assumption that has been somewhat intangible in the past.",

All of the data for this project has been collected and analyses are underway. What we have discovered while collecting data for this project, is that females produce more eggs and fledge more young when they are mated to a male that has enhanced spatial memory abilities. The idea that females invest more in their reproductive output when mated to a &ldquo;high-quality&rdquo; male has previously been shown, however, this pattern has not been shown in relation to a cognitive trait that is heritable and critical for survival. This is a very exciting finding, because it suggests that females are able to identify males with superior spatial memory abilities and choose to invest more in their offspring when they have mated with such a male, as these offspring will inherit this enhanced memory ability and be able to survive winter. While we do not know how females are able to assess the spatial memory of males, this finding supports the possibility that they are able to discriminate between males with better and worse memory, thus providing the foundation for the current project.</p>\n<p>We are also assessing pairing decisions across multiple years and have found that rates of divorce in our mountain chickadee system are very low, and that females almost always pair with a male that is larger than them. This assortative mating based on size is interesting, as females do not mate with the largest male available, but simply appear to prefer a male that is larger than themselves.</p>\n<p>In addition, we have also found that males inhabiting different geographic locations, with large differences in winter climate severity (e.g. snow fall and temperatures), sing different songs. This is interesting in light of previous work in our system that shows large differences in spatial memory abilities in birds inhabiting these different locations. Differences in the song that males produce may allow females to identify males from a preferable location, and mate with those males accordingly. For instance, if you are from a very harsh environment you need superior spatial memory ability to recover your stored food items and you would likely want to mate with a male that also has superior spatial memory abilities so that your offspring may inherit this trait and be able to survive the harsh winters where you live. If we know song is different among birds that have been shown to have better and worse spatial memory ability based on their geographic location, and that females are able to identify males with superior spatial memory within their populations, this means that song may be a trait that females are able to use to assess spatial memory ability. In other words, spatial memory ability and song production may correlate in males, allowing females to use song as a proxy for choosing a male that with superior spatial memory. The work we are conducting on this mountain chickadee system is important and critical for understanding the relationship between cognition, sexual signaling, and female mating choices, as we have and continue to collect all of our data in the wild on naturally behaving animals.</p>\n<p>The findings to date from this project have been disseminated to the scientific community through talks at national and international conferences and have been written up for publication in peer-reviewed journals. In addition, we have created teachable units to engage community members in our research. We have created a unit on caching behavior and spatial memory for young students, where students are taught what spatial memory is, and how they may use it, as well as how other animal species use spatial memory and how important it is for their survival. We also test the students&rsquo; spatial memory ability using a candy caching game, and the students are always surprised to see how difficult it is to remember the precise locations of their food caches. In addition, we have created an activity called &ldquo;Bird Bills: Form and Function&rdquo; that demonstrates how bird bills have evolved to optimize foraging on particular food items.&nbsp;For this activity we have the children or community members match bird specimens with the type of food they think they would be best at eating based on what their bills look like. These activities engage students and community members in science that is relatable and exciting and allow them to ask us any questions they may have.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 01/02/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Carrie&nbsp;L&nbsp;Branch</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1600845/1600845_10416254_1546462827021_chicky1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1600845/1600845_10416254_1546462827021_chicky1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"MOCH_4\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1600845/1600845_10416254_1546462827021_chicky1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"MOCH_4\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Mountain chickadee singing in the spring</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Vladimir Pravosudov</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Carrie&nbsp;L&nbsp;Branch</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">MOCH_4</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1600845/1600845_10416254_1546462611042_chicksinbox--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1600845/1600845_10416254_1546462611042_chicksinbox--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"MOCH_2\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1600845/1600845_10416254_1546462611042_chicksinbox--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"MOCH_2\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Mountain chickadee chicks in one of our nestboxes.
