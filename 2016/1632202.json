 "awd_abstract_narration": "General Audience Summary \r\n\r\nThe Principal Investigator on this project will collaborate with climate scientists at the National Center for Atmospheric Research to develop a framework to advance understanding and resolve conflict over the meanings of the concept, \"value added,\" when comparing regional climate models to global models. The core questions are whether and, if so, how regional models add value to our understanding of climate with regards to global models. Regional models are some of the primary means available for modeling socially significant climate events such as floods, droughts, and fires, among other events; so, it is very important to understand their value. The investigator will situate herself in the climate science community, and use philosophical conceptual analysis, in collaboration with leading climate modelers, to develop an advanced framework. The proposed framework will refine and develop an existing framework based on a preliminary study that she conducted.  She will then use the advanced framework to analyze ongoing debates in detail, and in doing so to define and develop the various meanings of \"value added.\" She will publish articles in both climate science and philosophical journals with these new frameworks and analyses, clarifying where there is now mostly confusion. She will also apply this knowledge towards the publication of one or more articles for the general public, urging clarity about climate issues and their impact on our daily lives.\r\n\r\nTechnical Summary \r\n\r\nThe proposed project has the capacity to advance philosophical knowledge concerning the concept of \"value added,\" of which there is presently none, despite its cutting edge role in climate modeling. Knowledge in climate science concerning this concept will be amplified through the introduction of an advanced analytical framework and its application to a variety of debates on the topic of \"value added.\" The climate community currently uses that term in conflicting ways in heated discussions, with little awareness of its ambiguities. The PI's aim is to cool down these conflicts by analyzing the various meanings of the term involved in the various debates she will examine, clarifying the mismatch of usage of the terms, and through the use of the advanced framework developed through this project, urging more uniformity of meaning and deeper understanding of the various issues engaged in \"value added.\" The investigator's collaboration with her climate scientist co-authors will reach a wide variety of climate modelers, nearly all of who are involved in modeling impacts of climate change on society. Her clarification and analysis of the concept of \"value added,\" central as it is to the value of regional climate models and the funding and support thereof, should have a serious impact on those who inform us about droughts, floods, forest fires, and other climate consequences.",
