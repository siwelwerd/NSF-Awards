 "awd_abstract_narration": "Most research projects that are engaged in characterizing the whole set of genes crop plants possess are complex in nature and carry out a diverse set of activities in addition to research. These include education and training of students, postdoctoral associates, and other professionals in different settings that range from classrooms and labs to workshops. In addition, many of these programs are also engaged in outreach activities with the community to raise awareness of the role that plant science plays in the quality of everyday life. One of the challenges faced by these scientists is recruitment of the research team, and communication with academic groups and the community at large. This project proposes to develop a web portal that will enable scientists to carry out these activities effectively and efficiently. In addition, this project will also assemble a large collection of highly specialized analytical software in a manner that will allow scientist to search and select the appropriate tool for very specific analytical tasks. The project also plans to request feedback from the community to target development of appropriate resources.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe primary objective of this project is to create an integrated Gateway for Education, Training, Broader Impacts and Outreach in Plant Genome Research (GETBIO-PGR). This resource will provide an infrastructure to access, create, share and exchange information about plant genome research projects and broader impact activities. It will also provide a resource to enable users to discover the most relevant bioinformatics analytic tools. More specifically, GETBIO-PGR will enable investigators to create individual, integrated web pages that will serve the multiple needs of their research program including recruitment of students and postdocs, availability of internships, and scheduling of workshops. The web pages will also be used to communicate research results, and describe resources that are available to the community. These may include availability of sequence information, clones, seeds of genetic stocks, and research software. This project will also create a bioinformatics analytic Tool Discovery System (Bio-TDS) and integrate it into GETBIO-PGR. An ontology annotation system will be added to the Bio-TDS to enable robust searching capabilities. Finally, the PIs will introduce the research and educational communities to GETBIO-PGR through education, presentations, and workshops while gathering usability feedback.",
