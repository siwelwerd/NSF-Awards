 "awd_abstract_narration": "This collaborative award generally aims to establish a new stable sea level site in Mallorca, Spain, through the study of phreatic overgrowths on speleothems (POS) from  littoral caves.   Specifically, the researchers aim to establish age control by precisely measuring overgrowths by Uranuium/Lead U/Pb dating to determine the timing, position, and duration of sea-level high stands in the western Mediterranean basin over the past 5 million years using cave deposits that grow exactly at sea level.\r\n\r\nImplications of sea-level reconstructions centered on the POS from this island's littoral caves are fundamental for understanding the glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) in the western Mediterranean basin.  The data generated by this research will better constrain estimates of Pliocene and early Pleistocene sea-level, without being plagued by the large uncertainties associated with proxies available for this time period.\r\n\r\nNew data could be used to improve GIA corrections.  This is important because current published sea level highstands during past interglacial climate are significantly above modern sea level and vary widely over time.  The precision of such results are still controversial and accurate data to realistically evaluate potential sea level by the century's end is critical.  \r\n\r\nThis project involves training for several graduate and undergraduate students, outreach efforts in Mallorca and in Florida, production of a documentary film on the caves, and strong and meaningful international scientific collaborations.",
