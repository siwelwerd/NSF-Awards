The fundamental physics component will investigate, both by\r\nexperiment and modeling, the stable magnetic configuration of such arrays subject to different\r\nperturbations introduced by different magnetic underlayers. It will also investigate the possibility\r\nof (a) using such arrays for next generation magnetic recording media for information storage, and\r\n(b) developing a magnetic approach for logic function in information processing. \r\nWe will study interactions that can provide much needed additional freedom to\r\nengineer new properties, functionalities and applications. This proposal will also enable the PI to \r\ncombine the simultaneous advancement of discovery with teaching, training, learning, and if appropriate, commercialization.\r\n \r\nTechnical Abstract\r\n\r\nSingle domain, nanoscale magnetic elements, fabricated by lithography, and patterned into\r\nordered arrays, form excellent magnetic metamaterials with unusual properties. Typically, their\r\nbehavior is dominated by macroscopic inter-element dipolar interactions, but here in addition, we\r\npropose microscopic exchange interactions to provide much needed additional freedom to\r\nengineer new properties, functionalities and applications in three distinct areas:\r\n(1) Geometrical frustration in a lattice of nanoscale ferromagnetic islands with dipolar interactions,\r\nleads to the formation of a spin-ice configuration; here we propose to investigate the materials\r\nphysics and magnetic configuration of a spin-ice metamaterial, including its thermodynamic phase\r\ntransitions, coupled through underlayers where the interactions between the nanoelements of the\r\nspin lattice are dominated by lateral exchange bias (EB). The EB, along different well-defined\r\ncrystallographic directions, can also be added to the system at different stages of the spin-ice\r\nconfigurational evolution.\r\n(2) Alternatively, each element in the metamaterial can be a multilayer, with intra-element\r\nexchange interactions; the magnetic performance of such exchange exchange-coupled composite\r\nmetamaterial, fabricated in large-area arrays by nanoimprint lithography, will be optimized for bitpatterned\r\nmedia.\r\n(3) Magnetic quantum cellular automata (MQCA) in specific nanomagnetic arrays to process\r\ninformation and perform Boolean logic operations is a promising alternative to CMOS technology.\r\nWe will design and construct, for the first time, exchange-coupled logic gates that perform\r\nelementary Boolean logic operations, based on a novel design of sub-50nm nanomagnet elements;\r\ntwo representive gates (AND and OR), will be demonstrated.\r\nMicromagnetic modeling and materials characterization, both routine and advanced, using\r\nelectrons, photons and scanning probes, will provide fundamental insight into the structure- property \r\nperformance correlation, at appropriate length scales, of all these unique and tailored\r\nmetamaterials. This proposal will also enable the PI to combine the simultaneous\r\nadvancement of discovery with teaching, training, learning, and if appropriate, commercialization.",
