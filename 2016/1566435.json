 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Chemical Structure, Dynamics, and Mechanism B Program of the NSF Chemistry Division supports the research of Professor Josef Michl in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at the University of Colorado, Boulder.  Professor Michl and his students are examining the nature of bonding in electronically excited states of chains of silicon atoms. These studies have practical implications for understanding fatigue in amorphous silicon solar cells exposed to ultraviolet radiation as well as understanding conductivity in materials comprised of silicon chains. The project is providing opportunities for the training of undergraduate and graduate students and postdoctoral researchers interested in lasers, in the interaction of light with matter, and in international science. Emphasis is being placed on attracting students to STEM fields, including those from groups that are presently underrepresented. \r\n\r\nThe current understanding of electron delocalization in saturated molecules such as oligosilanes and polysilanes (silicon analogs of saturated hydrocarbons) lags far behind that in conjugated pi-electron systems. Geometrical distortions induced in peralkylated oligosilane chains by light absorption are particularly intriguing. Fluorescence reveals that they are negligible in long chains and very pronounced in chains containing fewer than about seven silicon atoms. Calculations suggest that the distortions can be described as a transformation of one or two of the silicon atoms from the normal tetrahedral to trigonal bipyramidal geometry, in which silicon used five \"valence\" orbitals instead of the usual four. Such expansion of the silicon valence shell would have fundamental importance for bonding theory. Professor Michl's group is attempting to verify the theoretical prediction experimentally, using vibrational spectroscopy of the short-lived excited species. The same methods of transient vibrational spectroscopy are useful for other photophysical problems, in particular in the investigation of materials known to undergo efficient singlet fission, such as the higher polyacenes and derivatives of isobenzofuran. The work involves continuing international collaborations, providing undergraduate students a research experience, and giving classroom demonstrations to high school students.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n An intuitive understanding of the conformational dependence of &sigma;-electron delocalization in helical catenanes of group 14 elements was obtained.  The behavior is due to an interference between sigma conjugation and sigma hyperconjugation, which is constructive or destructive as a function of the dihedral angle.  The transition between these two regions is characterized by complete hole localization at a single site.  These results are important for the general theory of chemical bonding and have practical implications for electrooptical materials. \n\nInstrumentation for measuring time-resolved Raman spectra in the S1 state of the shorter catenanes was built and the first oligosilane to study was synthesized (a constrained tetrasilane that absorbs in the UV and exhibits a very strongly Stokes-shifted green emission).  The redox behavior of halogenated CB11 anions was investigated and reviewed.  This included the formation of borenium and iodonium ylides, the HCB11F5(CF3)&minus; anion, and its conjugate radical HCB11F5(CF3)&#8729; (stable in perfluorohexane at room temperature), a reversible redox couple with a remarkably high oxidation potential, &gt;4 V vs. ferrocene/ferricinium.  We have participated in the discovery of strong conjugation between carborane cages in their radical anion state and a highly peculiar redox behavior of o-carborane, which can be explained by its very large reorganization energy.  We have contributed to the theory of carborane-based molecular magnets  and to the examination of fluorination of graphene.  Magnetic circular dichroism and electronic states of a planar cyclooctatetraene, a higly unusual biradicaloid, have been investigated and explained. \n\nWe publish our results in professional journals and write review articles.  We also disseminate our results by giving lectures.  Many are invited lectures at professional conferences and workshops, which I also occasionally organize or co-organize.  Others are named lectures, colloquia and seminars at university and research institute chemistry and physics departments.  In my function as the president of the International Academy of Quantum Molecular Science (I just finished my second and last term last summer) I was frequently in contact with theoretical chemists throughout the world.  At home or when abroad, I often lecture to middle school and high school students, learned societies, or the general public about the US educational system or about our work in layman?s terms, and I have done so on radio and television as well.  Much of this is done in the Czech Republic, where I have a part-time appointment at the Czech Academy of Sciences.  Last summer, I lectured to high school students at Bestvina near Prague. \n\nTwo of my students graduated with M.S. degrees (Bowen Han and Sachin Nedungadi) and two with PhD degrees (Eric Buchanan and Milena Jovanovic).  Another graduate student, Andrew Chomas, is being educated.  Each of my graduate students spends several months working in an industrial laboratory in this country or at a university abroad.  Olivia Krohn spent four months at the Humboldt University in Berlin, Germany, and Andrew Chomas spent a fall at the University of Munich, Germany.  Development of human resources in my group also heavily emphasizes the education of undergraduates, while outreach emphasizes interactions with the scientific community and the general public in the Czech Republic, where I spend an integrated total of three months a year.  Undergraduate research assistants and high school students have always been important members of the research group, and at any one time, there usually are ~5 of them.  The group has strong interactions with the Department of Physics on campus and many collaborators elsewhere: the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Argonne National Laboratory, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, and Brookhaven National Laboratory.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/30/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Josef Michl"
