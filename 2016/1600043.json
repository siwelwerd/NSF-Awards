These developments have created a demand for integrative AI and robotics research to fulfill the potential of today's robots. The project aims at fostering cross-fertilization between these research fields through a series of activities at the AAAI-16 conference that will be held in Phoenix, Arizona from February 12th to 17th, 2016.\r\n\r\nThe project will include the following activities at the AAAI-16 conference: (1) participation of PhD students interested in integrative AI and Robotics research, (2) presentations by researchers showcasing current problems and solutions in robotics research, (3) a \"spotlight\" presentation by a young researcher showcasing new and exciting research in the field of robotics, (4) a robotics exhibition, and (5) an open house day, open for the general public.",
