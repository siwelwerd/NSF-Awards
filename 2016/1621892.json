 "awd_abstract_narration": "This SBIR Phase I project enables the research and development of a new hybrid fixed-fluidized biomass gasifier design that allows for a higher carbon conversion efficiency over a far wider range of feedstocks than what current commercially available biomass-to-electricity technologies are able to offer. This technological development serves the public interest by increasing the economic viability of renewable waste-to-energy projects. Biomass waste accumulation from forest thinning and agriculture generate approximately 166 million tons of biomass each year in the United States alone and is problematic to dispose of due to air quality regulations, which restrict open burning, and tipping fees from waste sites that have to mitigate methane production from decomposition. Instead of open burning or uncontrolled decomposition, biomass gasification enables these resources to be utilized locally to replace fossil fuels and to sequester carbon to mitigate climate change. Biomass energy is currently limited by feedstock requirements (typically restricted to standardized wood pellets), which has constrained the implementation of biomass-to-energy plants in the U.S. This project seeks to greatly expand the feedstock characteristic options available for biomass energy to offer an off-the-shelf commercial solution to sustainable energy project developers in the U.S. and organizations responsible for biomass waste processing. Approximately 150 jobs are expected to be generated in the US to support these two industries, through manufacturing and project development, as well as associated sales and income tax revenue. \r\n\r\nCommercially available downdraft and fluidized bed biomass gasifiers are hindered by three main root technical problems that significantly constrain the economic viability of state-of-the-art biomass-to-electricity projects: 1) each is limited by the small range of feedstock particle sizes it can process; 2) maximum allowable reaction temperatures are limited due to ash fusibility temperatures; and 3) the ash fusibility temperature is too low to maximize tar cracking. The proposed technical solution separates the vaporized tar and small feedstock particle sizes from the larger particles and high ash solid charcoal.  This separation decouples the temperature requirements and allows for greater tar cracking potential at higher temperatures while maintaining a lower oxidation temperature for the char to increase carbon conversion efficiency??overcoming all three root technical problems. The goal of the research is to identify and validate the dimensions and parameters required to maintain stable biomass gasification with improved tar cracking efficiency and reduced ash clinkering risk. The scope of the project includes proving the proposed technology at a gas capacity of 20kW, which will be scaled up to a 150kW to be able to provide the algorithm to dimension the technology at any scale. The development of a fully fuel agnostic gasifier is the so-called holy grail of gasification and the successful completion of the project will be a significant step toward this goal, enabling the technology to scale successfully and be disseminated in almost any market or sector with a biomass waste stream.",

The biomass gasification process also produces a byproduct known as biochar&ndash;&ndash;the fixed carbon structure of the biomass feedstock&ndash;&ndash;which has many beneficial uses as a soil amendment to increase plant growth and water and nutrient retention. However, commercially-available biomass gasifier designs suffer from an inability to accept the wide range of biomass feedstocks typical of real world organic waste. These gasifiers require a closely-controlled particle size range and mineral content, making the use of general forestry slash or crop residues with leaves, bark, and dirt problematic in practice. &nbsp;In order to meet these stringent fuel specifications, most commercial gasification projects require significant pre-processing of the biomass fuel, which leads to increased project costs and complexity, challenging the economic feasibility of biomass waste-to-energy projects. </span></p>\n<br />\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>This project proposed, developed, and tested a novel &ldquo;Swirl Hearth&rdquo; gasifier design, which</span><span> not only accepts a broader range of feedstocks (specifically, those with high mineral content and a wider range of particle sizes), but also demonstrated substantially improved performance across the three critical gasifier metrics of tar conversion, clinker (mineral slagging) avoidance, and gas energy density.</span><span> For example, the Swirl Hearth successfully operated with raw, unsifted forestry waste without clinkering and with tar conversion rates improved by multiples in comparison to the reference &ldquo;Imbert type&rdquo; reactor, despite using this more difficult feedstock. The Swirl Hearth design achieved this success by physically separating the various thermochemical stages inside the reactor. This separation enabled optimized conditions for each individual process in different chambers (including cracking and combustion reactions within an open swirl chamber) and eliminated the dependence upon void space between feedstock particles for reactions to occur. </span></p>\n<br />\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>This is a potentially transformative development in the field of biomass gasification, as most market participants are still utilizing an almost century-old downdraft &ldquo;Imbert type&rdquo; gasifier design that simply cannot operate on most raw waste biomass. Not only will the Swirl Hearth eliminate or significantly reduce feedstock pre-processing costs, but its substantial reduction in tar concentrations also markedly lowers operation and maintenance costs, the other primary obstacle to the viability of biomass gasification projects. The Swirl Hearth thus revolutionizes the applications and economics of distributed biomass gasification, opening new markets and making great strides toward to unlocking gasification&rsquo;s immense potential to become a ubiquitous waste-to-energy, power, and products technology that can help overcome key challenges.</span></p>\n<br />\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>These broader impacts have the potential to be felt worldwide, as the lowered cost and increased flexibility of gasification projects and products brings energy access and effective agricultural and forestry waste management to developing countries that desperately need those services. However, the impacts will first be felt closer to home, here in the United States. The initial target market for the Swirl Hearth gasifier is the forestry sector. According to the US Forest Service, communities throughout the country, particularly in the West, are facing record-breaking wildfires and fire risk from high fuel loading&ndash;&ndash;resulting from decades of natural fire exclusion&ndash;&ndash;and unprecedented tree mortality&ndash;&ndash;brought on by drought stress and uncontrolled invasive species infestations. This is creating an immense biomass waste disposal problem, paired with the challenge of paying for expensive fire remediation.

Utilizing the technically recoverable forest biomass for bioenergy will result in a 22% reduction in burned areas, according to the Bioenergy Association of California (BAC). BAC also reports that fire suppression costs between 2006 and 2010 totaled $6 billion in California alone&ndash;&ndash;much of which came from struggling local governments in rural areas&ndash;&ndash;meaning that billions of dollars can be saved and put back into local economies each year. Swirl Hearth deployment at scale will enable wildfire mitigation that saves hundreds of millions of dollars in avoided wildfire damages to local residents and governments, preserving local income, tax revenues, and energy supplies, as well as human lives and structures. Local jobs would be created directly and indirectly through the deployment of distributed gasification resources in rural communities, according to BAC. The biochar byproduct sequesters carbon and can increase crop yield, improve soil health, and conserve water&ndash;&ndash;all of which enhance local economies.
