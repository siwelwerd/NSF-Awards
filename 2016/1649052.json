 "awd_abstract_narration": "As our closest star, the Sun provides an important laboratory to study the processes that govern stars in our Galaxy.  The Sun is also the primary driver for the space weather that impacts human life on Earth.  Since 1976, the National Solar Observatory (NSO) has operated the Sacramento Peak Observatory located in Sunspot, New Mexico for the NSF as a premier solar research facility available to scientists in the U.S. and abroad.  The primary research facility still in operation at the observatory is the Richard B. Dunn Solar Telescope (DST).  The DST can study the Sun at high resolution in wavelengths ranging from the optical to the infrared.  The NSF and the NSO are currently building the most powerful solar telescope in the world, the Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope (DKIST) atop Haleakala, Maui, Hawaii.  While DKIST will render the DST redundant as a national user facility, the DST retains substantial value both as a scientific tool and as a training ground for the next generation of solar researchers.  This award supports science and operations of the DST as it transitions from the NSO to a potential university-based consortium led by New Mexico State University (NMSU).  During this transition, the proposers will begin an innovative science program of long-term, synoptic observations of solar magnetic fields while preparing the facility for consortium operations.   \r\n\r\nThis award supports science and operations of the DST for a period of 24 months bridging the gap between the departure of the NSO at the end of 2017 and the development of the NMSU-led Sunspot Solar Observatory Consortium (SSOC) as the primary operator beyond 2018.  The development of the SSOC will depend on maintaining the telescope and its instrument suite, transferring critical knowledge, and reducing areas of identified risks.  As the SSOC develops, its members will be provided with dedicated DST time in accordance with the member?s level of participation.  During the bridge period covered by this proposal, the PIs will conduct a program of synoptic science concentrating on four key areas of interest: (1) solar filament magnetic field structure, (2) solar flare energy budgets, (3) quiet Sun magnetic canopy, and (4) solar prominence instabilities.  In order to deliver the proposed synoptic science, specific knowledge of the facility will be transferred during the transition period overlapping the final year of NSO at Sunspot and the first year of SSOC operations.  The proposers highlight three important objectives to be accomplished during the transition period: (1) Complete a critical synoptic science plan for the DST; (2) Hire consortium personnel for telescope and site knowledge transfer; and (3) Update and upgrade the telescope.  In accomplishing these objectives through this award, the PIs aim to achieve the long-term goal of reinventing and reinvigorating the DST and the Sunspot facility.",

As our closest star, the Sun is a critical plasma and astrophysical laboratory. As the dominant external influence on Earth, the tremendous energy generated by the Sun can be suddenly and spontaneously released, sending radiation and high-energy particles to Earth that wreak havoc with communication satellites, power grids, and other critical infrastructure. These adverse effects caused by the Sun are known collectively as Space Weather. Space Weather is a broad and growing federal concern and we do not, as yet, fully understand the details about how the Sun influences the Space Weather environment.In 2016, NMSU identified a strong national scientific interest in using the Dunn Solar Telescope (DST) at Sunspot Solar Observatory as a means of providing fundamental scientific solar physics and space weather data, from 2018-2023, and beyond. The development of this consortium depended heavily upon maintaining the telescope and its instrument suite at current levels, obtaining critical knowledge transfer regarding the DST and the Sunspot site, and reducing areas of identified risks.

It fosters innovative developments in the progress of astrophysics by studying a feature that determines the habitability of exoplanets around stars.
