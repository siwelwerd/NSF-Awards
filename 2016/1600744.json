 "awd_abstract_narration": "The \"Strengthening the Teaching and Learning of Electro-Mechanical Technology (STLET)\" project is responding to a significant demand for highly skilled advanced manufacturing technicians in the Southeastern Pennsylvania (SEPA) region.  Meeting this need is critical because the advanced manufacturing sector is growing in the region, where it is a major economic driver, with an estimated $36 million Gross Regional Product (GRP).  The STLET Project is employing curricular improvements and professional development activities to enhance and deliver advanced manufacturing technician education that meets industry needs.  The main project activities are a) improving and implementing an industry-aligned, apprenticeship-based early college-to-university Electro-Mechanical technology career preparation pathway and b) upgrading the teaching competencies of faculty through competency assessment, formal pedagogy training, and engagement in a community of practice.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of the STLET design and approach is that it is comprehensive, innovative and replicable.  It is comprehensive in that it is addressing both teaching and learning outcomes.  STLET is innovative because it is integrating two proven educational programs (early college programs and community college-university transfer agreements) and a competency-based apprenticeship into a career preparation pathway.  Normally these three programs, with demonstrated success in improving completion outcomes at both high school and college/university levels, are offered independent of one another.  In STLET, however, they are interwoven to provide a structured career preparation pathway.  This pathway is replicable and can be adopted by other community colleges seeking to assist in the economic development of their regions.  This demonstrates STLET's broader impact to the larger advanced technological community.",
