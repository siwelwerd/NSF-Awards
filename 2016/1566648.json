Some of the main foci of the 2016 event are the following: deformation/rigidity theory; free probability; recent advances in operator theory; classification of C*-algebras; noncommutative geometry; noncommutative probability; C*-algebras and dynamical systems; operator spaces and their applications. The conference program provides ample opportunity for graduate students, postdocs, and other young scientists to present their work.",
