 "awd_abstract_narration": "The growing ability to generate digital information and the hunger to consume that information create a need to communicate information at ever-higher rates. Free-space optical and millimeter wave wireless communication systems strive to achieve rates exceeding 100 Gbps.  Optical fiber supports terabit-per-second communications.  These systems require high-speed decoding circuits that currently sacrifice performance to meet latency requirements with available computational resources.  This research develops new techniques for high-throughput communications with a goal of achieving theoretical performance limits while meeting latency requirements with reasonable complexity.  In addition to providing a new path for practical solutions for high-throughput systems, the broader impacts of this research include the training of graduate students to support continued leadership of the United States in communications technology as well as hands-on research experiences for undergraduates to maintain the pipeline that will supply our country?s continuing need for diverse, well-trained, and innovative engineers.\r\n\r\nThis research explores a new paradigm in which many low-complexity decoders work in parallel, decoding variable-length codes with short average block-lengths.   Fixed-length codes with short block-lengths cannot approach the Shannon capacity, but variable-length codes with short average block-lengths do approach capacity.   Variable-length codes are traditionally implemented with feedback so that incremental redundancy is transmitted only when requested by the receiver.  This research transmits incremental redundancy without the use of feedback, utilizing techniques such as network coding and ergodicity to deliver redundancy only to those parallel decoders that need it.  The problem of delivering incremental redundancy without feedback is framed as a joint source-channel coding problem with side information at the receiver.   The primary goal of this research is to produce low complexity systems that can approach capacity at high throughput.",

The practical value of this new technique is that it meets the need for low-complexity high-throughput communication, for example over optical fiber.  This is accomplished by a novel structure that approaches capacity while still allowing a highly parallel decoding architecture that feature short block-length decoders and does not require feedback from the receiver to the transmitter. \n\nPreviously, capacity has been approached by practical systems in two distinct ways:  a fixed-length code that has a long blocklength that can be used without feedback or a variable-length code with a short average blocklength that uses feedback to inform the transmitter when to terminate transmission.  The new technique uses variable-length codes with a short average blocklength, but does not require feedback because the variable length codes share a pool of incremental redundancy that is accessed through a peeling decoder.  This technique produces a single long blocklength code that can approach capacity without feedback but can be decoded with the low complexity of decoding many short variable-length codes in parallel.
