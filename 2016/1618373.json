The conference's technical content and professional networking opportunities are particularly valuable to students and postdocs.  This award will provide partial support to approximately 16 attendees to defray costs of registration fees, shared hotel rooms, and travel.\r\n\r\nChaining is a method for bounding the maximum of a collection of dependent random variables that can be much more efficient than performing a simple union bound.  Within computer science it has a diverse array of applications to problems related to coding theory, random walks on graphs, dimensionality reduction, compressed sensing, manifold learning, dictionary learning, streaming algorithms, and more.  This conference aims to popularize chaining in the theoretical computer science (TCS) community by having invited speakers both from the pure probability community and from TCS.",
