 "awd_abstract_narration": "How the major materials of our hydrosphere and atmosphere, such as water and carbon dioxide, are cycled into the deep Earth within solid mineral phases via plate tectonics, and then ultimately released as fluid phases at high pressures and temperatures, is of key importance for how subduction-associated volcanism (like the circum-Pacific \"Ring of Fire\") is produced, and also possibly for the occurrence of deep earthquakes (at depths greater than ~200 km). In this project, the investigators plan to examine water- and carbon-containing minerals of relevance under the high-pressure and high temperature conditions under which they release water and carbon dioxide to determine: (1) their properties that govern when water or carbon dioxide are released at depth; and (2) whether water or carbon dioxide are released gradually or abruptly. These results will constrain how the water that ultimately generates circum-Pacific volcanism via water-induced melting is released at depth in the planet, and help in the modeling of magma production at depth; and will explore how carbon dioxide is released at depth and the form in which it might be transported to the surface. Thus, these results have fundamental relevance for the production of volcanism at continental margins, and for how deep subduction-related earthquakes (which are likely greased by fluids) are generated. In conducting these experiments, the group will spearhead the development of a new facility, which will be available to the scientific community as a whole, which is designed to conduct high-pressure/high-temperature characterizations of materials at the Advanced Light Source at Lawrence Berkeley National Labs. The group extensively engages undergraduates in its research effort, and the graduate students supported by this grant include a military veteran. The results are also incorporated into undergraduate curricula at the PI's institution.\r\n\r\nThe investigator team plans to: (1) examine the properties of important carriers of volatiles into Earth's mantle at simultaneous high pressures and high temperatures using high precision single-crystal x-ray diffraction; and (2) characterize the properties of carbonates of relevance to carbonatite petrogenesis at high pressures using infrared and Raman spectroscopy. In tandem with the first objective, the establishment of a new, community-accessible, high-pressure/high-temperature synchrotron-based single crystal x-ray diffraction facility will be facilitated by this support.  The cycling of water and carbon dioxide into and out of Earth's interior are pivotal processes that impact both the properties of the solid Earth (through their effects on melting and rheology) and Earth's surface (through the volume of the hydrosphere and the composition of Earth's atmosphere). The team proposes to probe the properties of volatile-bearing phases under subduction conditions to gain insights into: (1) the polymorphism of volatile-bearing phases in Earth's mantle (or, what is degassing at depth); (2) the structures of volatile-bearing phases at high-pressures and temperatures (to examine why these phases hold volatiles); and (3) how phases that are known to carry water to depth (and particularly lawsonite and phengitic micas) behave as they approach (and hopefully exceed) their dehydration conditions.  They also will provide new constraints on the rich polymorphism of phases associated with the binding of the carbonate ion under mantle conditions: the focus here will be on alkali-rich carbonates, which have recently been demonstrated to be associated with deep carbonatite melting, and which have largely been uninterrogated at high pressure conditions. The team will utilize this project to deploy two graduate students to assist, work through, shake down and debug a new, world-class high-pressure single-crystal x-ray diffraction set-up that will be set-up and commissioned over the next year at the Advanced Light Source (ALS) at Lawrence Berkeley National Labs (LBNL). This facility will be available to the community as a whole through the General User Program proposal process of the ALS (the facility will also be part of the COMPRES-Consortium's Approved Program at the ALS, and thus will have assistance for users who are awarded time). In addition to this deployment of new community infrastructure, the PI will: (1) contribute to the education of a diverse group of graduate students (currently, one military veteran, one returning female) and undergraduates; (2) continue to publish/contribute to the literature on topics of broad interest for those interested in the natural history of the planet (and promote these as appropriate with press releases); and (3) incorporate new results into UCSC undergraduate teaching (typically, to ~90 earth sciences majors per year).",

Specifically, water and carbon dioxide each facilitate melting in the deep Earth, and water has a weakening effect on the flow of mantle rocks. Similarly, the volume of the hydrosphere at Earth&prime;s surface is controlled by the rate of cycling between Earth and the interior, and the degassing of the silicate portion of the planet provides a major control on the initial composition and evolution of Earth&prime;s atmosphere. Under this award, a variety of studies were conducted on how water and carbon-bearing minerals behave at the extreme pressures and temperatures of Earth&prime;s interior. For example, the mineral lawsonite, which contains ~12 wt% water and forms as the dominant water-bearing phase in subducted oceanic crust, had the structure of its enigmatic high-pressure phase solved under the aegis of this award, and its structural behavior under pressure was documented. The electrical conductivity of lawsonite and its high pressure phase was measured under compression as well: this allowed a direct comparison between magnetotelluric results showing the presence of high conductivity anomalies beneath the Pacific Northwest&prime;s Cascade volcanoes and our experimental data on hydrated subducted material. Here, the net recognition was that both hydrated minerals and (as depth increases) fluids released from hydrous phases are both present beneath the margin of the western U.S. Other water-bearing minerals, including topaz, tourmaline, tremolite and kernite, were also examined at high pressures in work funded by this award, with the discovery of new high pressure phases in tourmaline and kernite.</p>\n<p>With respect to how carbon is retained within minerals at conditions of Earth&prime;s deep interior, the alkaline earth and alkali/alkaline earth carbonates dolomite and shortite were probed at high pressures, as was the rare-earth fluorocarbonate, and important ore mineral, bastnaesite. Theoretical calculations on metallic iron-carbon alloys were also conducted, with relevance to how carbon might be retained in Earth&prime;s core. New high-pressure phase transitions were discovered in both shortite and bastnaesite. Most importantly, in both dolomite and shortite, a previously hypothesized but previously unobserved shift in carbon bonding was characterized. Oxidized carbon in minerals typically occurs as carbonate (CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup>) ions---in which the carbonate unit is essentially flat, with three neighboring, roughly equidistant oxygens in a triangular arrangement. We observed the onset of &Prime;3+1 coordination&Prime; in both dolomite and shortite, in which carbonate units become distorted, and incipient bonding begins between carbonate units. This is shown in the Figure for carbon configurations (black balls; oxygens are in red) in a portion of the high-pressure structure of shortite, as determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction at a pressure of 15 Gigapascals (150,000 bars, which corresponds to a depth of ~450 km in the Earth). Here, carbon enters a 3+1 bonding coordination with oxygen, as the carbonate units distort from planarity and begin to become polymerized/bonded to one another. From our spectroscopic results on dolomite at high pressures, this type of configuration is notably stable at deep mantle conditions, and may represent a primary means by which carbon is sequestered in much of Earth&prime;s deep mantle.
