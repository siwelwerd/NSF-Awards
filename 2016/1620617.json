 "awd_abstract_narration": "Sinkhole activity in central Florida is a major natural hazard. Over the past several years, two events in particular attracted media attention. In March 2013, a sinkhole collapsed beneath a house in Seffner and \"swallowed\" a person from his bedroom. In August 2013 a sinkhole collapse destroyed a resort complex near Disney World. These dramatic events, however, are just extreme examples that stand out from a steady stream of about $200 million per year in property damage claims, which spike at times of anthropogenic groundwater withdrawals. Detecting incipient sinkhole activity is a challenging task, because most of the activity occurs in the subsurface. However, in some cases sinkhole activities also induce surface subsidence, which can be detected by space-based Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) observations. This project is a follow up of a proof-of-concept project funded by NSF, in which the researchers demonstrated that InSAR observations can detect localized patterns of surface changes in central Florida. However, the detection of slow subsidence using more advanced InSAR time series techniques requires longer span of acquisitions than obtained during the limited duration of the initial project. \r\n\r\nIn this renewal project, we propose to continue the InSAR-based detection of sinkhole activity in central Florida by extending the observation period for two additional years. The longer time series will allow us to reduce the effect of measurement noise and detect localized slow subsidence induced by sinkhole activity. The proposed project also includes geophysical surveys to map sinkhole structure and soil sampling at selected field sites. In addition, a mechanical modeling effort will examine whether, at the field sites, InSAR-detected subsidence is compatible with measured properties of cohesive soils, field data, and simple models for sinkhole subsidence. This modeling method could be used to assess whether observed subsidence represents a likely precursor to collapse.",

Over the past decade, two events in particular attracted media attention. In March 2013, a sinkhole collapsed beneath a house in Seffner and ?swallowed? a person from his bedroom. In August 2013 a sinkhole collapse destroyed a resort complex near Disney World. These dramatic events, however, are just extreme examples that stand out from a steady stream of about $200 million per year in property damage claims, which spike at times of anthropogenic groundwater withdrawals. Detecting incipient sinkhole activity is a challenging task, because most of the activity occurs in the subsurface. In this project we used space-based radar observations, also known as Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR), which are capable of detecting small ground movements between repeat measurements. The data were acquired by a German satellite, TerraSAR-X, over three selected sinkhole-prone areas in central Florida, every 11 or 22 days over a time span of 1.7-2.5 years. We used TerraSAR-X data because of the high spatial-resolution acquisition mode of the satellite (25cm up to 1m), which allowed us to detect movements of individual houses and other small structures. The data were processed with dedicated software packages that enabled us to detect slow movements, the order of a few millimeter pre year (mm/yr) over small areas, as expected from localized surface movements induced by sinkhole activities. Results revealed several areas of localized subsidence in buildings ranging from 300 m<sup>2</sup> (~3,000 ft<sup>2</sup>) to nearly 2000 m<sup>2 </sup>(~20,000 ft<sup>2</sup>), and subsidence trends ranging from -3 mm/yr up to -6 mm/yr in some cases. These results were compared with ground-based imaging methods, as Ground Penetrating Radar, which confirmed the existence of subsurface cavities beneath some of the space-based detected sites. However, not all InSAR-detected subsiding areas occurred above subsurface cavities, suggesting that the space-based InSAR detection method can serve as a useful tool for detecting sinkhole activity only when combined with ground-based observations.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/21/2020<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Shimon&nbsp;Wdowinski</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1620617/1620617_10447610_1608568457415_Fig-1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1620617/1620617_10447610_1608568457415_Fig-1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Sinkhole distribution in west-central Florida\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1620617/1620617_10447610_1608568457415_Fig-1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Sinkhole distribution in west-central Florida\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">a) Overburden classification map according to type and thickness (Source: Sinkhole Type, Development and Distribution in Florida, 1985) overlaid by subsidence reports in Florida (red dots). b) Enlarged view of the study area.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Oliver-Cabrera et al.
