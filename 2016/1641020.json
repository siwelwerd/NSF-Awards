 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support the Mathematics Research Communities (MRC) activities run by the American Mathematical Society (AMS) over a three-year period from 2017 - 2019.  The goal of the MRC program is to create research cohorts of early-career mathematicians that will sustain themselves over time and to foster joint research and coherent research programs that will, eventually, reach all areas of mathematics. The MRC program strives to achieve this goal through summer research conferences, Special Sessions at the annual AMS-MAA Joint Mathematics Meetings, support for collaboration travel, mentoring, and a discussion network. It is the formation of research cohorts that sets this program apart from any other (national) professional development programs for mathematicians that currently exist. The creation of three to four new cohorts per year has the potential to lay a foundation for decades of research, and will have an extremely positive effect on mathematics research in the U.S. Most importantly, this program will focus on mathematicians who are beginning their research careers; all program components will help to train and connect the next generation of researchers in, eventually, all research areas of mathematics. This grant provides support for an additional three years of this unique program. \r\n\r\nIn 2017, there will be three MRC conferences supported, all to be held in Snowbird, Utah, with the following titles:  (1) Homotopy Type Theory, (2) Beyond Planarity:  Crossing Numbers of Graphs, and (3) Dynamical Systems:  Smooth, Symbolic, and Measurable.  The topics of the conferences to be held in 2018 and 2019 will be determined later by the MRC Advisory Board, which evaluates proposals submitted by senior mathematicians who wish to be organizers. Each of the MRC conferences will bring together a diverse group of early-career mathematicians. The organizing committee for each conference is composed of leaders in the field of the conference and includes individuals with previous experience in organizing successful workshops and conferences. The conferences will bring together senior and junior researchers in an ideal environment to establish connections, and the follow-up elements of the program will help to ensure those relationships endure for many years.

Over time, the expectation is that the program will touch upon most areas in the mathematical sciences. To achieve these goals, the AMS engages in a two-year-long cycle of activities for each year's research cohort: recruitment of three to five senior organizer teams consisting of leaders in specific research areas, recruitment of approximately 120 participants whose professional development stage is in the range from graduate students nearing completion of a PhD&nbsp; through five years post-doctorate, hosting intensive hands-on summer research conferences for the participants led by the organizers; programming Special Sessions at the annual Joint Mathematics Meetings in the winter following the conferences, and supporting collaborative travel throughout the year following the summer conferences.</p>\n<div class=\"porColContainerWBG\">\n<div class=\"porContentCol\">\n<p>NSF grant DMS-1641020 supported the MRC program during a period spanning 2017 to early 2021. Supported activities included summer conferences (centerpieces of the program) in 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2021; participant and organizer travel to the Joint Mathematics meetings in 2018, 2019, and 2020; and follow-up collaboration travel. The conference originally planned for summer 2020 was postponed until 2021 because of pandemic conditions, and it was ultimately hosted in an online format. Sixteen cohorts of participants totaling approximately 480 individuals engaged in research in these conferences and related program activities under the guidance of 69 senior organizers. Topics were drawn from broad areas such as topology, graph theory, dynamical systems, mathematical physics, harmonic analysis, geometry, number theory, mathematical modeling, probability, combinatorics, linear algebra, analysis, several complex variables, and more.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>During the period of the grant and subsequently, participants and organizers have produced scores of publications and preprints emanating from their MRC collaborations. Prior to the pandemic, the grant supported over two hundred participant and organizer trips to the Joint Mathematics Meetings in 2018, 2019, and 2020. In that period, several participants and organizers took part in follow-up collaborations that were partially funded by the grant.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Over time, participants have come from most of the US states and a number of other countries (the program allows for a small percentage of participants to be international). Typically, each year between forty and fifty percent are graduate students, and this correlates with a high percentage of participants coming from PhD-granting institutions. However. each year, a few who are faculty come from liberal arts colleges and non-PhD-granting universities. About 34 percent of the participants during the years supported by this grant were women, a percentage somewhat higher than that of current new PhDs in the mathematical sciences who are women--roughly 30%. Of those who reported their race or ethnicity, about 9% identified as Hispanic/Latino, and about 2% as Black/African-American.&nbsp; The corresponding percentages for new PhDs in the mathematical sciences are about 3.6% and 2.9%, respectively.</p>\n<p>Many alumni of the program report a high degree of satisfaction with the opportunties to engage directly in collaborative research in the MRC summer conferences and subsequently. They mention that the program introduced them to a highly valuable professional network, that their collaborations have been lasting, and that their participation&nbsp;gave them confidence about their capacity to do research. In reent years, some of the program's alumni have themselves become MRC organizers. These experiences are illustrative of the program's goals, to help train and connect the next generation of mathematical scientists.
