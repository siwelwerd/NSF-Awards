 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Web application/database MorphoBank is a modern tool giving scientists a digital workspace to collaborate on matrices in teams worldwide - and in real time. In MorphoBank scientists can add annotated digital images to matrices to support observations of phenotypes.  All data are permanently archived in a highly reusable format at no cost to the investigator.  Powerful new algorithms have emerged in the last decade that allow investigators to use continuous or morphometric data directly in phylogenetic tree-building. This project will develop new web-based tools to allow investigators to collect and display continuous data in phylogenetic matrices in Morphobank. In this context users can integrate both continuous and discrete variables, can illustrate and label this information and can share the data with the scientific community and the public following publication.\r\n\r\nContinuous and morphometric data (e.g., relative length of jaw to skull, absolute body size) are commonly collected scientific practice and recognized to be phylogenetically informative. However, integrating continuous with discrete data in online matrices with images is not yet possible. By introducing new tools to organize and graph continuous data through the stable online platform, MorphoBank, paleontologists can better examine how coding practices affect tree-building and can present more robust descriptions of how continuous data from fossils inform the Tree of Life.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "Paleontologists describe new fossil species every day for their research publications, creating contributions that expand our knowledge of the history of life on Earth. Many fossil discoveries derive from ongoing research on US lands and constitute a scientifically valuable record of the unique natural history of this country.  New fossil and living species need to be placed into what is called the 'Tree of Life,' the hypothesis of species relationships as the result of evolution.  Scientists use both anatomy (also called morphology) and genetic data to build the Tree of Life.\nThis award funded new tools and new training for the database MorphoBank, which is a real time research tool and data archive for the anatomical part of the research on the Tree of Life.  Seeded and brought to maturity by NSF funding, MorphoBank exists to address the following challenge: it is a best practice and expectation in modern science that when a scientist publishes a new, peer-reviewed research paper that he or she archive the raw data used to support the research findings, and that the data be both human readable and machine readable.  MorphoBank came into existence to guarantee this type of data storage for the anatomical data associated with building the Tree of Life.  MorphoBank provides a private collaborative workspace for scientists to prepare their data during research and MorphoBank releases all published data freely, requiring neither login nor payment to use the data or download it.  As such, MorphoBank serves the data of past work as a foundation for future work.\nAs this award concludes, MorphoBank has reached its twentieth year of service to the paleontological research community.  With the funding from this award the team of biologists and computer scientist that run MorphoBank introduced new, collaborative tools for the scientists who build content on the site.  When a scientist collects data about species to test hypotheses about where that species fits in the Tree of Life, the scientist codifies his or her observations into what is called a 'matrix'.  A matrix is a spreadsheet of species in rows and observations about the characteristics of those species (what are call 'characters') in columns.  Characters are traits that exist in different 'character states,' for example: Leg length: short (state 0), intermediate (state 1), and long (state 2).  When a matrix is completed with hundreds or thousands of such observations during a scientific study, that matrix, with anatomy now codified as numbers, can be analyzed by computer algorithms to produce a tree, or branching diagram, showing evolutionary relationships.  This award funded an important change in how data can be collected.  The example above describes what are called 'discrete' character states, but due to algorithm innovations, scientists can now use 'continuous' character states.  Thus, instead of grouping many different actual leg lengths into gross categories, a scientist can enter into the matrix the exact length he or she has measured for each species and that can be analyzed.  Many scientists prefer this approach.  MorphoBank now allows this kind of data entry and has user friendly screens and help documents to assist with this research.\nDuring this award, our team also trained computer science interns who were ethnic minorities underrepresented in science.  These interns came from Stony Brook University's Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation.  These paid interns developed real code that was integrated into the live site and were mentored by MorphoBank's scientific team.  Additionally, we offered a course at the American Museum of Natural History to high school students, introducing them to the concept of the Tree of Life, allowing them to use real anatomical specimens to propose their own ideas about evolutionary relationships, and entering this data into MorphoBank.  MorphoBank's scientific and leadership team is also diverse in having a female director and curator and an ethnically diverse engineering team.\nAs part of this award, we also developed a new, sustainable business model for MorphoBank.  MorphoBank's copyright was transferred from Stony Brook University where the project was developed with the support of multiple NSF grants, to Phoenix Bioinformatics, a non-profit company that exists to sustain scientific databases.
