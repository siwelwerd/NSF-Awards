While the needs of different research communities will vary, there are many issues which the Civil, Mechanical and Manufacturing Innovation communities will have in common for data infrastructure. This award supports a workshop which brings these communities together to identify these needs, learn from the success of communities whose data infrastructures are further advanced, and plan for paths forward in establishing the tools, resources, and culture shifts needed to bring open sharing of research data to the broad engineering community.\r\n\r\nThe workshop supported by this award will highlight the key issues that must be addressed to realize the full impact and use of big data on the research areas represented in the Division of Civil, Mechanical and Manufacturing Innovation (CMMI) at the National Science Foundation. The community will convene to (1) develop an overall strategy and short term research agenda for capturing and sharing large volumes of data (2) recommend methods and techniques for making large data sets available and usable by the CMMI research communities (3) forge interdisciplinary research teams that can develop prototype platforms for CMMI research communities and (4) suggest best practices for NSF data management plans. Approximately 60 members of the community, including both junior and senior researchers, data scientists, library scientists, and members of the scientific publishing community will convene in Arlington, VA at NSF Headquarters.",
