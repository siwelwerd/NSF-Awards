 "awd_abstract_narration": "The extinction of Earth?s largest animals is radically changing the feeding relationships among other species (?food webs?) which may place them at greater risk of extinction in the future. This project will examine Rancho La Brea tar pits for the complete fossil record (large carnivores to plants) and build ice age food webs prior to the major changes at the end of the last ice age 12,000 years ago (human arrival, the loss of large mammals, and climate change). Understanding the relationships among ice age animals and plants will help biologists predict which species were at most risk of extinction and apply these model predictions to present-day biodiversity. This project is also an excellent opportunity to support science education and diversity, by directly involving middle school students in California and Maine in the identification of fossils used in this research. Project findings will also be shared in new La Brea Tar Pits & Museum exhibits, which draw 350,000 visitors each year. \r\n\r\nFor this project, sediments from multiple asphalt seeps will be sampled for the small animals, insects and plants of the La Brea Tar Pits (California, USA). Fossils will be identified, radiocarbon dated, and then integrated into multi-trophic paleo food webs over the 40,000 years before the widespread environmental upheaval at the end of Pleistocene. Previously only the upper trophic levels (particularly carnivores) were investigated in detail; added information will test food web properties for predicting the sensitivity of species to global change. The project?s novel Bayesian framework, employed to reconstruct biomass flow, will be useful to both paleo and modern food web studies by facilitating integration of multiple proxies to characterize uncertainty in trophic interactions.",

Small mammals and plants, which are key components of ecosystems, have barely been studied at this site. For this project, investigators took advantage of the opportunity afforded by the newly discovered \"Project 23\" deposits at La Brea, a series of&nbsp; deposits excavated using modern techniques that recover the smaller components (i.e., tiny mouse teeth or juniper seeds) that were missing from many of the earlier excavations at La Brea. Team members, including postdoctoral scholars, graduate students and undergraduates from UC Merced, the University of Maine, and the La Brea Tar Pits and Museum, as well as Museum staff, volunteers, and other collaborators, identified tens of thousands of specimens, filling in the broader picture of the LA area during the time of sabertoothed cats and giant sloths. This project extended the chronology of Rancho La Brea back to &gt;55,000 years ago, developed the first comprehensive catalog of plants that grew in the LA Basin before the Last Glacial Maximum, completed a comprehensive list of small mammal taxa found at the Project 23 deposits, and developed a new generation of food web models focused on understanding interactions between herbivores and the plants they consume and predicting community structure. These results have contributed significantly to understanding how complex mammalian systems are structured, and how these structures change over long timescales. Although La Brea Tar Pits is famous for community change through the extinction of mammals like sabertoothed cats, dire wolves, and mammoths, this project demonstrated that the small mammal community in the Los Angeles Basin remained relatively stable from before the Last Glacial Maximum through today. Moreover, new theory generated by this project suggests that the energetic constraints characteristic of mammalian herbivore-plant interactions may result in larger-scale structural limitations to mammalian communities, potentially shaping these systems across time. Together, these results allow a better understanding of the role of species interactions in extinction, and how differences in community structure lead to overall community stability.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>This project supported the development of new exhibits at the La Brea Tar Pits and Museum, which receives &gt;400,000 visitors a year.
