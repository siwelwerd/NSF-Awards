 "awd_abstract_narration": "Problems in Geoscience relevant to the coastal regions and climate change span a broad spectrum of disciplines: oceanography, atmospheric science, geology, computer science, data science, chemistry, engineering, and biology. Solutions to these problems can have strong socioeconomic impacts. Advances in computing and big data analytics are essential in obtaining these solutions, allowing us to make appropriate assessment of resources in light of future issues related to climate change. These solutions likewise require broad thinking that can only be afforded by promoting diversity. However, Geoscience has historically produced the lowest number of minority doctorates in STEM and has been one of the least diverse disciplines. Similarly, gender inequality has continued to plague Computer Science. \r\n\r\nThe REU site provides opportunities for undergraduates to conduct research projects that integrate computing and geoscience to advance on-going research activities related to coastal zones, climate variability, and big data analysis. For example, research activities by REU students will help seek ways to improve climate forecasting, better understand physical processes in the coastal zones, increase national preparedness for climate change, understand the nexus between food, energy and water and mitigate the impacts of natural disasters. To promote interest and increase diversity in Geoscience and Computer Science, underrepresented students will be recruited from South Carolina, nearby states, and the Southeastern U.S. region, especially those attending all-women and historically black colleges and universities with limited research opportunities. The REU site's goals are (1) to increase the percentage of women and other underrepresented students in graduate programs and careers in Computer Science and Geoscience, (2) to provide meaningful research experiences in computing intensive research topics of societal relevance, and (3) to provide a supportive environment for students to improve their research, critical-thinking, problem-solving and communication skills.",
