 "awd_abstract_narration": "Understanding the history of galaxy and cluster formation fundamentally affects our knowledge\r\nof the Universe as a whole, and sets the context for our place within the Universe. \r\nThis project will use Blue Waters to model the formation and evolution \r\nof a population of galaxies in a Coma-sized galaxy cluster, including their contribution \r\nto and interaction with the Intra-Cluster Medium (ICM).  Modeling galaxies and the ICM in galaxy \r\nclusters is a formidable challenge.  The morphology of the galaxies, and the energy and \r\nmetal content of the gas is ultimately controlled by star formation processes that happen \r\non molecular cloud scales of less than a million solar masses. On the other hand, \r\ntotal cluster masses exceed 10^15 solar masses; hence a dynamic range in mass of over a billion is \r\nnecessary for consistently modeling galaxies within this context.   The investigation of such \r\nissues is appealing to many interested in science and even in society at large. In particular, \r\nthe results of the project will be used in a program that will introduce the use of computer \r\nsimulations in astrophysics to science pre-majors, in the hope of ultimately attracting \r\nunderrepresented students into a STEM major.\r\n\r\nSeveral advancements have now enabled the modeling of these systems. First is the availability\r\nof supercomputers like Blue Waters that can sustained petaflop calculations on real world\r\nproblems. Second is the improvement of hydrodynamic modeling in Lagrangian codes. These improvements\r\ninclude better modeling of multiphase medium and the resulting instabilities, more accurate\r\nhandling of high Mach number shocks, and better modeling of the subgrid physics including\r\ngrowth and feedback from supermassive black holes. Finally these algorithm improvements have\r\nbeen implemented in codes that can scale to a large fraction of Blue Waters even with very\r\nclustered datasets.  This project will use the highly scalable N-body/hydrodynamics code, ChaNGa, to model the\r\nformation and evolution of a population of galaxies in a Coma-sized galaxy cluster, including\r\ntheir contribution to and interaction with the ICM. This model will be compared to observations\r\nof cluster galaxies to understand the physical and temporal origin of their morphologies.\r\nThe model ICM will be compared to X-ray and microwave (via the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect) to\r\nunderstand the relation between these observables and the underlying gas properties. Finally,\r\nthe overall mass distribution will be used to better understand how these clusters gravitationally\r\nlens background galaxies.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nClusters of galaxies are one of the most important probes of the\nglobal geometry of the Universe, of the evolution of the overall\ncosmic expansion, and of the nature of ``dark energy''.  This\nis due to the extreme sensitivity of the cluster population statistics\nto these parameters and to the fact that as regions of high galaxy\nconcentrations are filled with luminous X-ray emitting plasma, these\nsystems can be identified across a wide range of distances.\n\nClusters are also ``closed box'' laboratories for the study of galaxy\nevolution.  That is, gas driven out of galaxies by energetic processes\nsuch as supernovae or active galactic nuclei will still remain within\nthe cluster where it can be studied with X-ray and UV telescopes.\n\nThis work produced very high resolution simulations of galaxy\nclusters.  The need for such high resolution was to be able to model\nthe shapes and sizes of individual galaxies as they interacted with\nthe cluster as a whole.  Individual galaxies need mass resolutions\nbelow one million solar masses, while the cluster totals 100 trillion\nsolar masses, hence a dynamic range of more than 100 million is\nneeded.  With such a resolution the work was able to follow the star\nformation and supernovae processes within individual galaxies and\ntrack how these processes interact with the hot gas that fills the\ncluster.  In this way the simulation was used to examine both how the\ncluster environment shapes galaxy evolution, and how galaxies\ninfluence the structure of the cluster gas.  In the former case, the\nstudy has shown that the growth of the cluster active galactic nucleus\ntracks the growth of the star formation in cluster galaxies, somewhat\nindependently of the environment.  This is contrary to previous ideas\nwhich invoked galaxy mergers to fuel black hole growth.  In the later\ncase, the study has shown that the intracluster medium becomes\nincreasingly multiphase (i.e. a mixture of gases at various\ntemperatures) as one looks further from the cluster center, with\n10,000 to 100,000 Kelvin gas dominating in the cluster outskirts.\nTherefore the simulation can be used to make predictions of the\ndistribution of cluster gas that can be compared with observations\nmade by the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph aboard the Hubble Space\nTelescope. Maps of the cluster as seen via various observational\ndiagnostics are shown in theattached image.\n\nThe fascination of this subject has attracted many good students both\nat the Graduate and Undergraduate level to work on the simulation\nresults.  Four undergraduate students participated in the analysis\nof these simulations, particularly in comparing the simulated galaxies\nto real galaxies.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/17/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Thomas R Quinn"
