 "awd_abstract_narration": "The development of future wireless systems requires a network architecture that simultaneously addresses communication efficiency and system modularity. Due to the inefficiency of current network architectures, most existing networks adopt the structure of using wireless communication only at the last hop. The goal of this project is to develop an enhanced physical-link layer interface to solve the architectural inefficiency problem in wireless part of the special-structured networks, mainly for the distributed communication and networking model. By equipping a link layer user with multiple transmission options, the new interface enables advanced communication adaptation at the link layer that exploits wireless capabilities such as power, rate, and antenna adjustments. This project represents the first systematic investigation of distributed link layer networking that exploits multiple transmission options at each link layer user. The project will establish an important bridge toward the integration of information and network theories, and will serve as an example wireless architecture development that seeks to minimize its disturbance to the operation of wireline systems. Unification of information theory and network theory will also influence the way subjects are taught in Higher Education and attract more talented students to this field of acute national importance. \r\n\r\nThe project is organized into four steps. In Step I, the focus is to investigate typical distributed networking scenarios with homogeneous users and saturated message queues. Based on a stochastic approximation model, a medium access control (MAC) framework will be developed to enable effective formulation of distributed channel sharing problems. Distributed algorithms will be developed to ensure asymptotic optimal or near optimal performance with respect to the maximization of particular network utility functions. In Step II, the focus is to extend the MAC framework to distributed networks that contain user groups with different priorities, as well as to distributed cognitive networks where secondary users are required not to disturb the communications of the primary users. In Step III, the focus is to develop fast adaptive MAC algorithms by incorporating the exponential backing-off approach into the MAC framework. In Step IV, the focus is to use computer simulations to investigate performance of the MAC algorithms in practical scenarios.",
