 "awd_abstract_narration": "Two fundamental problems in Statistics, and in science more generally, are how to extract information from massive data sets and how to exploit this information to make predictions of future uncertain events.  By modeling and predicting market behavior, economists can better control financial risk; by modeling and predicting climate change, scientists can better manage the environment; by modeling and predicting health care needs, policy makers can better allocate resources to meet the needs.  Massive datasets bring a wealth of information, but this information is accompanied by a host of problems -- the most salient of which is varying data quality, ranging from \"good data\" to \"bad data\".  The proposed research will develop methods which provide robust, stable inference and prediction for massive datasets of varying quality.  The general methodology will be applicable to many fields, including environmental sciences, medical sciences and corporate decision analytics, where massive datasets are collected and robust predictive analysis is needed.  \r\n\r\nBayesian methods have enjoyed extraordinary success in the past two decades, and they are widely used throughout the scientific and corporate communities.  Their success has been driven by their unique ability to combine information from an experiment or observational study with extra-experimental information, expressed through the prior distribution.  However, this success hinges on the quality of the data and the quality of the prior.  The proposed research takes aim at these two issues.  For the first, the research develops formal predictive methods in the Bayesian framework which are suited to use with data of modest quality; for the second, the research develops Bayesian methods for model comparison and model averaging which provide robust and stable inference when little prior information is available.  The two portions of the project naturally combine to yield complete, cohesive Bayesian analyses with methods which are robust to model misspecification and outliers, and which require only modest prior information.  The project will provide several students with opportunities for training in research and data analysis, and much of this will be interdisciplinary in nature.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "Intellectual Merit.\nBayesian methods are widely used throughout the scientific and corporate communities.  Their success has been driven by their unique ability to combine information from an experiment or observational study with extra-experimental information, expressed through the prior distribution.  However, this success hinges on the quality of the data and the quality of the prior.  In this project, the PIs have investigated the development of Bayesian methods for model fitting and model averaging that are robust to deficiencies of model, data, and prior, and that focus on the most relevant features of the data.\nFirst, the PIs have developed formal predictive methods in the Bayesian framework which are suited to use with data of modest quality.  The new methods improve model specification via sequential decompositions as well as pre-processing transformations, especially when the data distribution is skewed or heavy-tailed.  They have improved the common nonparametric Bayesian methods such as mixture of Dirichlet process models.  The PIs have proved the superior theoretical properties of the new methods, and have demonstrated the potential improvements through both simulation studies and real data analysis.  \nSecond, the PIs have developed robust Bayesian model averaging approaches in weak prior settings.  They have explored the impacts of prior diffuseness levels on posterior model weights and on Bayesian model averaging, and then utilized the findings to develop innovative methods that validate or calibrate over-dispersed priors using training samples, and then sequentially update the posterior model weights.  This new approach is robust to the choice of prior distributions for the model parameters, allows sequentially enlarging model spaces when the data accumulates, and is applicable to both parametric and nonparametric models.  The PIs have compared the performances of our methods with those of many competing methods in the literature.  The improvement of the new methods is substantial under various settings.\nThe two portions of the project naturally combine to yield complete, cohesive Bayesian analyses with methods which are robust to model misspecification and outliers, and which require only modest prior information.\n \nBroader Impacts.\nThe results of this project have been widely disseminated to the statistics and broader communities.  In particular, results have been conveyed to the machine learning community through short courses and participation in panels, talks, and posters at conferences that draw an audience from both statistics and machine learning, and through publications at their interface.  Results from the project have been presented to corporate audiences, including Nationwide Insurance Company and Eli Lilly.

The students include five international students and two domestic students; three women and four men. All are currently employed in the field.
