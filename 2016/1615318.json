 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to better understand how plants respond to environmental stress through the study of proteasomes and proteasome inhibition. Proteasomes are protein complexes inside all plant and animal cells that degrade damaged proteins to prevent their toxic aggregation. Such damage can arise from physical stress; however, such stressors may also inhibit proteasome activity. Thus, the focus of the research will be to understand how plants reprogram their cellular activities during proteasome inhibition. A better understanding of plant responses to environmental stress may ultimately improve crop yield and food security. The project will allow the training of twelve undergraduate students at Coastal Carolina University.  Students with physical disabilities will participate in the research, and will strengthen the ties between the College of Science and Office of Accessibility and Disability Services; this collaboration may serve as a model to other universities seeking to increase this group?s participation in STEM disciplines.  As this project integrates both research and teaching, it will also facilitate the revision of a laboratory-based class that will serve to strengthen the curriculum. \r\n\r\n\r\n\tThis research investigates plant proteasomes, which avert cytotoxicity by safely removing damaged proteins that result from stress.  However, severe oxidative stress decreases proteasome activity in plants, and this project aims to identify mechanisms that contribute to its impairment. In contrast to yeast and mammalian models, the effects of proteasome inhibition in plants are not understood.  This project intends to address this gap in plant biology by examining how cellular processes are altered in response to proteasome inhibition.  Respirometry, biochemical, and -omic approaches will be used to reveal if proteasome inhibition coordinates metabolism to restore amino acid levels or adjust antioxidant metabolism.  The outcomes of the study will describe differences in how plants respond to proteasome inhibition compared to mammalian and yeast cells.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nPlants are sessile organisms that must confront a variety of stress imposed by their environment.  Crop yield is partly limited by how effectively plants can respond to excessive light, salinity, drought, heavy metals, and heat.  These stressors can oxidize and misfold proteins in cells.  In eukaryotic cells, minimizing the accumulation of these damaged proteins can be achieved by targeting irreparable proteins for removal by the ubiquitin proteasome pathway (UPP).  Additionally, proteasomes provide cellular homeostasis by degrading regulatory and signaling proteins, which in turn maintains the amino acid pool in the cytosol.   Severe stress can impair proteasome activity.  The consequences of proteasome inhibition in yeast and mammalian cells have been well studied.  In contrast, nearly nothing is known about how plants respond to proteasome inhibition, and how its impairment can be attenuated by reprogramming cellular activities. \n\n            This project revealed that proteasome inhibition induced by MG1232 in canola (Brassica napus) plants rapidly stimulated nitrate reductase and sulfite reductase, which supported elevated rates of amino acid synthesis. The increased nitrogen assimilation was in response to reduced proteolysis caused by proteasome inhibition.  Although de novo amino acid synthesis might have initially alleviated MG132 toxicity, it could not overcome the deleterious consequences of proteasome inhibition, which significantly stunted plant growth and development.  Our team optimized and developed a non-radioactive method in plants to demonstrate that proteasome inhibition decreased protein synthesis.  The experiments conducted also indicate that proteasome inhibition in plants perturbs abscisic acid signaling and decreases levels of many sugars and metabolites involved in carbon metabolism.  Collectively, our results show that proteasome-inhibition in plants alters primary metabolism and hormone signaling prior to the onset of oxidative stress, which provides a new understanding of the sequence of events leading to stress caused by proteasome malfunctioning.\n\n            Additionally, we used unicellular Chlamydomonas algal cells to demonstrate that proteasomes protect against stress caused by photoinhibition.  Excessive light rapidly exacerbated photohibition in cells treated with MG132 compared to untreated control cells.  Proteasome inhibition in Chlamydomonas challenged with high light intensity impaired their photosynthetic electron transport chain, impeded their photosynthetic recovery in the dark, and ultimately delayed cell division and growth of the algal culture. \n\n            This award facilitated the establishment of the summer CLIMB (Creating Leaders and Inclusion in Molecular Biology) research program aimed at          training undergraduate students who are under-represented in the sciences, particularly those who are deaf or hard of hearing.  Four cohorts participated in the 7-week program, which trained a total of sixteen students from four different universities. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/20/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Douglas Van Hoewyk"
