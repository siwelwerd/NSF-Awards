 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research objective of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award is to enable civil engineers to design bridges and other critical structures so that the structure will naturally provide signals about its structural state with only a minimum installation of sensors. This will result in a safer and more resilient civil infrastructure as new construction or retrofitting incorporates these designs. This is significant because critical structures have been failing without sufficient warning despite the fact that the cracks in these structures were already being inspected and monitored with the latest modern techniques. The research has the potential to transform the field of structural engineering by detecting damage at the earliest stage.  The educational impact of the research will include modifying existing steel and prestressed concrete design courses to introduce damage detection concepts to undergraduate students, developing Honors College research projects, involving high school and undergraduate students into research, and developing mentoring program within female civil engineering students. \r\n\r\nIn this research, an acoustic based damage detection method will be introduced into the design stage by adding spatially periodic subsystems into structural elements. Existing structures exhibit some localized periodicity such as perforated beams, and equally spaced bolts in steel connections where spacing is based on stress distribution and spacing requirements. The structural periodicity can be tuned to make the design behave as an acoustic metamaterial, which can be able to block, redirect, and strengthen propagating elastic waves released by newly formed crack surfaces in the deployed infrastructure. Local resonance in an acoustic metamaterial medium affects the elastic wave spectrum such that certain wave frequencies cannot propagate to the medium if the frequency falls within these stop bands. Once the periodicity is modified by damage, the elastic wave spectrum will change, and then structural damage can easily be detected as a disturbance of the normal resonant frequencies. Highly narrowband and sensitive micro-mechanical transducers will be tuned to the stop band of the periodic subsystem and positioned strategically such that one sensor will be sufficient to detect the localized damage. The combined response of structural design and periodic behavior will be tested with analytical and numerical models and validated on laboratory scale structural tests.",

Aging structures and their performance under increasing extreme events is a societal challenge as unexpected structural failures may cause significant disruption in urban mobility and negatively influence human lives and environment. Current structural design practice is based on strength and serviceability limit states and does not consider how to inspect critical design details susceptible to failure. In this research, structural design and damage detection methods are bridged by building local and global periodic systems that improve the probability of detection especially for hidden defects. The periodic systems in macro level behave as phononic crystals, which exhibit unusual mechanical and dynamic properties as compared to conventional materials. Phononic crystals are artificial composite, man-made periodic systems creating new responses through physical constraints in the constituent materials such that certain frequencies are prohibited by local resonance of the periodic system. New effective properties can block, direct or focus elastic waves that enhance waveform-based damage detection methods, namely ultrasonics and acoustic emission. Periodic truss systems provide global level behavior, and any local damage breaks the periodicity that can be easily detected by the measurement of frequency response. Periodic placement of bolts at steel connections provides local level behavior such that the presence of crack or thickness loss due to corrosion can be detected by guided wave ultrasonics. In general, redundant sensors are needed to detect defects reliably especially for acoustic emission method, which is based on the detection of propagating elastic waves released by active defects. Noise blocking with micro-electro-mechanical-systems (MEMS) sensors tuned to the stop band of phononic crystals enables to monitor localized defects with single sensor. Super narrow bandwidth MEMS AE sensors developed in this research function as natural mechanical filters, which reduce the data processing efforts and enable the integration of the sensor with low power wireless devices. The engineered structures in local and global levels introduced at the design stage of structural life cycle can enhance acoustic emission and ultrasonic methods by blocking unwanted signals and tuning the frequency response of structure sensitive to damage.</p>\n<p>The patent application of the MEMS AE sensors is currently in review and the transfer of this technology to practice is in progress with Office of Technology Managemant and industrial partner. Current undergraduate and graduate courses were modified, and new graduate courses were added to the curriculum such that the importance to integrate the damage detection philosophies and the structural inspection concepts into the design practice was included. The awareness to the sociatal challenge of aging infrastructure systems among high school and undergraduate students was increased via summer cluster research program for female undergraduate students and presentations at community college. The research results have been disseminated through workshops with industry and stage agencies, keynote and conference presentations, and peer-reviewed journal manuscripts. The research supported numerous female and underrepresented undergraduate and graduate students who joined to workforce with outstanding positions. The expansion of the research to different structural systems including conformal isotropic and composite systems is achieved via collaboration.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 09/02/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Didem&nbsp;Ozevin</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1552375/1552375_10407398_1630602164220_Figure1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1552375/1552375_10407398_1630602164220_Figure1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1552375/1552375_10407398_1630602164220_Figure1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The noise blocking with phononic crystal, (a) the conventional method of monitoring local defects with redundant acoustic emission (AE) sensors, and (b) the developed method of monitoring local defects with phononic crystal (PC) and MEMS sensor</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Didem Ozevin, Minoo Kabir</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Didem&nbsp;Ozevin</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 1</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1552375/1552375_10407398_1630601822010_Figure3--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1552375/1552375_10407398_1630601822010_Figure3--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 3\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1552375/1552375_10407398_1630601822010_Figure3--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 3\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The periodic placement of bolts in steel connections with unique frequency characteristics.
