 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program in the Division of Chemistry and the Instrument Development for Biological Research (IDBR) Program in the Division of Biological Infrastructure, Professor Valentine at West Virginia University and his group are developing scientific instrumentation and techniques for studying the three-dimensional shapes of complex, biological molecules. This developmental work is aimed at the study of protein complexes. Proteins play a crucial role in life processes. When such molecules do not form the correct three dimensional shapes, disease often ensues and therefore it becomes important to be able to determine the structures of these biological molecules and how their components come to form critical shapes. However, because of their relatively large sizes and other factors, it is difficult to determine accurate structures for many molecules. The new instrumentation and techniques developed by Professor Valentine are important ways for determining the structures of such proteins. Professor Valentine is also engaged in educational outreach efforts to improve the training of Middle- and High-School teachers in the science, technology, engineering and mathematical fields thereby benefitting many students. \r\n\r\nThe characterization of protein complex structures as well as the structures of coexisting protein species presents one challenge to modern analytical techniques. Professor Valentine is developing novel gas-phase separation instrumentation and techniques to study these problems. This work has three major tasks. First, a hybrid drift tube that combines traditional ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) separations with overtone mobility spectrometry (OMS) analysis is constructed and coupled with an existing linear ion trap mass spectrometer. The approach may allow the probing of minor conformational changes (~4%) occurring on very short timescales (microsecond and lower), enhancing current methods for structural assessments. Second, the novel technique is used to characterize a protein system associated with Huntington's Disease. Multimeric peptide ions formed by portions of the huntingtin (Htt) protein are subjected to OMS-hydrogen deuterium exchange (HDX) analysis with tandem mass spectrometry (MS). The results are compared with those obtained from IMS-OMS-MS analysis to provide a means for testing the new instrumentation and techniques on a real-world sample as well as provide new information in the form of species that are undergoing structural transformations during the course of the measurement. The final task is characterizing these same protein systems using solution-phase HDX combined with OMS-MS/MS studies to unravel linking of solution- and gas-phase structures as well as to provide information regarding conformation establishment in the gas-phase.  This research may provide important clues about Huntington's Disease progression.  The educational component establishes strategies for improving the efficacy of middle- and high-school science instruction, develops undergraduate curricula, introduces undergraduate students to research, and provides unique research and instructional opportunities for graduate students.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual Merit\n\nThe research conducted during the CAREER award time period advanced the field of biomolecular structure analysis in a number of ways and will continue to affect the study of important biomolecules.  First, the development of an ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) - overtone mobility spectrometry (OMS) instrument that can be coupled to a linear ion trap or a time-of-flight mass spectrometer will allow fullscale characterization of gas-phase structural transformations of important peptide and protein systems.

This has ebabled the study of unique compounds such as DNAzymes and Ribozymes and how they establish important, functional structures.  Thus, there is a strong potential to gain important information in entirely new fields of study.\n\nThe research conducted under the CAREER award is highly creative and has the potential to be truly transformative.  First, the extensive development of the new ionization soruce for conducting online, in-droplet HDX (see attached Figure 1) is shown to distinguish isomeric species (see attached Figure 2) in very rapid experiment.  It is also shown to reveal co-existing biomolecular solution structures that cannot be revealed easily by other experimental techniques.  Finally, the approach is shown to allow the characterization of structural transformations (see attached Figure 3) as well as transient secondary structural elements.  This information cannot be obtained with traditional measurement strategies.  These in-droplet, solution-phase structural probes will be combined in the future with the IMS-OMS gas-pahse biomolecular ion structure analyses.  This combination will allow the characterization of structure establishment in solution as well as the evolution of structure in the gas-phase.  No other laboratory currently has these combined capabilities.  Thus, as a result of the work performed for this CAREER award, our lab will be able to conduct analyses that provide unprecedented structural characterizations of important biological systems.  As an example, consider that the foundational work conducted here was used to present preliminary data for a separate grant that was submitted to the National Institutes of Health for funding consideration.  Here, it is proposed that the HDX capabilities be used to track all intermediates of DNA and RNA folding for functional oligonucleotides.\n\nBroader Impacts\n\nThe Broader Impacts of the work conducted during the CAREER award has already provided enhanced societal outcomes.  First, in the last year of the award alone, four students have received their PhD degress and have become important personnel in the STEM workforce.  Of these, three are from underrepresented populations in STEM fields.  Second, the development of a highly informative course for Jr. and Sr. HIgh school teachers to help improve scientific presentations will have an impact on the quality of science instruction in the state.  Finally, the construction of several miniature scientific measurement tools begins to form infrastructure that will be used to lend to different Jr. and Sr. High School instructors to be used in effective scientific demonstrations.\n\nThe Broader Impacts work conducted for the CAREER award is highly creative and potentially transformative.  The laying of the foundation for the development of a library of simplified measurement tools to be used for effective demonstrations in Jr. and Sr. high schools is unique.
