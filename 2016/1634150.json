 "awd_abstract_narration": "Part of the Ocean Observatories Initiative (OOI) is a cabled observatory in the northeast Pacific Ocean that extends offshore to Axial Seamount, an active submarine volcano that has frequent eruptions, hydrothermal vent fields, and unique deep-sea ecosystems.  Because it is so active and accessible, Axial Seamount has been a long-term study site and monitoring has revealed a cycle of volcano inflation and deflation that has been used to forecast eruptions with increasing accuracy.  This project will enhance the OOI Cabled Array at Axial Seamount by adding instruments with the capability to detect changes in hydrothermal output in the summit caldera, and to ground movements at the volcano, which will in turn improve eruption forecasts.  These enhancements to the monitoring effort at Axial Seamount will help to increase our understanding of magma storage systems at active volcanoes, the processes that lead to and trigger eruptions, and the impacts of submarine eruptions on hydrothermal systems and the deep-sea ecosystems they sustain. A teacher will participate on the research cruise to deploy the instruments, and the teacher will interact with classrooms before, during, and after the research cruise.  Public lectures at the Hatfield Marine Science Visitor Center in Newport, OR will include results from this project. \r\n\r\nThe 2015 eruption at Axial Seamount was the first detected in real time by the OOI Cabled Array.  Although it captured the event in unprecedented detail, it also showed that there are some key observations missing from the instrument network that limited understanding of the eruption and its consequences.  This project will make the following targeted and timely additions to the cabled observatory: (1) one new seafloor CTD (Conductivity, Temperature, Depth) instrument to add critical salinity measurements, which are currently lacking but are needed to test the hypothesis that hydrothermal brine is released from the crust during seafloor eruptions, and (2) one bottom pressure/tilt instrument that has already been built and paid for. In addition, four autonomous (non-cabled) miniature pressure recorders will be built and an acoustic release transducer will be purchased to be used on an existing autonomous bottom pressure recording mooring.  These instruments will enhance the spatial and temporal monitoring of volcanic deformation of the seafloor and the modeling of its causes in the subsurface.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project added two monitoring instruments to a cabled observatory at Axial Seamount, an active submarine volcano located about 300 miles off the Oregon coast.  Axial Seamount is the most active volcano in the Pacific Northwest, with 3 eruptions in the last 20 years, which makes it a great natural laboratory for studying how volcanoes work, how eruptions are triggered, and how underwater eruptions affect the marine environment.  One instrument that was added to the cabled observatory was a \"bottom pressure/tilt\" instrument, which measures vertical movements of the seafloor that occur in response to molten rock (magma) moving underground within the volcano.  These measurements can be used to forecast volcanic eruptions.  The second instrument that was added to the cabled observatory was one that will precisely measure the temperature and salinity of seawater at the seafloor in the summit caldera of the volcano.  This instrument was added to detect the temperature and salinity changes that occur during eruptions and can give information about magma interacts with the volcano?s hydrothermal vent systems.  The data from the two new instruments are available on-line and in near-real-time since they are transmitted to shore via fiber-optic cable, and they will help scientists better monitor this very active volcano so that lessons can be learned of how to better forecast the behavior of more dangerous volcanoes on land.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/02/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: William W Chadwick"
