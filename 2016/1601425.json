 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many animals, including humans, live in extended family groups where both parents and mature offspring share the responsibility of caring for young. This type of social system, called cooperative breeding, is frequently associated with monogamy across a diversity of animal groups. This association is thought to result from the fact that helpers in monogamous groups share on average 50% of their genes with their full siblings - the same proportion they share with their own offspring. Therefore, from a gene's eye view, helping can be as good a strategy as reproducing independently when helpers can assist in rearing full siblings. Although staying near home to help can be beneficial in some circumstances, the benefits of cooperating could be reduced or even cancelled out if helpers find themselves competing with close relatives for resources when they do not disperse from the area where they were born. This project investigates the contexts in which cooperation and competition occur to determine if animals can balance these costs and benefits through dispersal behavior. This proposal also tests a novel alternative explanation for the observed association between monogamy and cooperation, asking whether this relationship could be due to environmental factors that similarly influence both mate fidelity and helping behavior. The role of sibling relatedness in the evolution of cooperation is of major interest in the field of behavioral evolution, and the studies proposed here could have profound influences on our understanding of family-based cooperative societies, such as our own. The project will also provide multiple training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students in a range of modern scientific skills, including the use of the most cutting edge DNA sequencing techniques. The work will be shared with the public through a community science festival and scientific illustration classes.\r\n\r\nThis research investigates the relationship between mating systems and social systems using cooperative bess beetles as a model organism. First, fine-scale population structure will be assessed to test the hypothesis that beetles cooperate locally within their highly related family group before dispersing to compete globally with unrelated individuals, allowing them to avoid the costs of competing with kin while maximizing the benefits of cooperating with relatives. The second objective in this study will test the novel hypothesis that certain environments may favor both monogamy and cooperation simultaneously, leading to a correlation between mating and social system that is consequential rather than causal. Conceptually, this hypothesis suggests that the terms in Hamilton's Rule (rB-C>0) may covary in certain environments. Specifically, this study will test whether a single ecological factor, low resource density, reduces the costs (C) of helping (by increasing the costs of dispersal) while simultaneously increasing the relatedness between helpers and their siblings (r) by reducing extra-pair paternity. To assess this possibility, paternity and dispersal will be investigated in response to resource density in both natural and experimental populations of bess beetles. The results of this study could suggest that the terms in Hamilton?s Rule are not modular, but rather covary under certain conditions, changing the way we understand both the correlated evolution of social and mating systems as well as the association between relatedness and cooperation.",

The reason for this correlation between cooperation and monogamy, however, is not entirely understood. The most widespread explanation is that relatedness in family groups is higher when parents are genetically monogamous, which may be important if individuals help each other in ways that carry costs to their own personal, or direct, biological fitness. We investigated two additional explanations for the coupling of monogamy and cooperation using both beetles and birds as examples.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, some ecological factors might favor both genetic monogamy and social cohesion simultaneously. We test these ideas in a family living, socially monogamous beetle (<em>Odontotaenius disjunctus</em>). This species of beetle, popularly called Bess beetle, inhabits rotting logs in mature forests and exhibits some of the characteristics of more highly social species, most importantly the long-term association of breeding adults and apparently mature offspring (see photos). To identify the proper ecological factor to test, we first described the mating and dispersal behavior of this species. Despite social monogamy and high levels of parental care by both parents, extra-pair paternity (infidelity) is high in this species. Furthermore, population structure analyses revealed that young adults are capable of dispersing long distances from their nest. These results (described in two publications) suggest that high dispersal capability may facilitate extra-pair paternity by allowing individual beetles to easily encounter multiple mates. Dispersal, however, may be more difficult if suitable nesting habitat is scarce. If movement is environmentally limited, dispersal from the nest site may decrease, leading to both lower rates of extrapair paternity and larger, more cohesive family groups. Beetle families from locations containing either low or high density of suitable nesting sites were collected to assess the effects of ecology on both paternity and dispersal patterns. Analysis of genetic paternity for this study is ongoing and may help explain the processes that lead to sociality.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, animals that possess certain adaptations for social monogamy, such as providing parental care to young, may also simply be better at cooperating in social groups. These traits might therefore make monogamous lineages more likely to develop advanced social behaviors in response to certain selective pressures. We tested these ideas by conducting a comparative analysis using a data set of nearly 300 bird species. We performed phylogenetically controlled path analyses to determine how ecology, biparental care, and genetic monogamy affect the evolution of cooperation. In general, we found few ecological traits that strongly influenced both monogamy and cooperation simultaneously. Instead, we demonstrated that the presence of both high group relatedness and high levels of biparental care were the most important factors in determining whether a species was cooperative. These results suggest an important relationship between paternity, biparental care, and cooperative care that deserves further investigation.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The funding supported the continued development of a young investigator. A variety of field- and lab-based techniques were used to collect data and bioinformatic and statistical methods were learned and employed. The project also resulted in multiple presentations before other scientists and the publication of three papers in peer-reviewed journals, with another manuscript in preparation.
