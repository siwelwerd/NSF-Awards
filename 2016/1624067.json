 "awd_abstract_narration": "In recent years, significant focus has turned to archival data sources in the Big Data and computational social science research communities. The scale of archived Web data is unprecedented in terms of scope and scale, creating major challenges for scholars. The 2016 Web Archiving workshop series provides a premier venue for engaging with Web archives, and for learning the skills necessary to utilize archived Web data for knowledge discovery. This award will support travel of Ph.D. students at U.S. universities who have submitted research proposals that have been accepted as part of the workshop series. Participants in this workshop series will gain critical skills necessary for developing cutting edge research agendas. Training provided to Ph.D. students will help to prepare the next generation of Big Data scholars. \r\n\r\nThe workshop series will consist of two events; the first workshop will be held at the University of Toronto from March 3 - 5, 2016, and the second workshop will be held at the Library of Congress in Washington DC from June 15 - 17. The workshop co-chairs are Matthew Weber (Rutgers University), Jimmy Lin (University of Waterloo) and Ian Milligan (University of Waterloo). The workshop series builds on prior research agendas established across disciplines for working with archived Web data. Specifically, this work responds to ongoing calls in computational social science for improved access to archived Web data. Workshop attendees will further be asked to engage with a variety of topics of societal importance. The products of the workshop focus on integrating scholarship in computer science with the social sciences and demonstrating the potential of interdisciplinary Big Data scholarship.
