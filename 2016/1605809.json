 "awd_abstract_narration": "1605809\r\nColosqui, Carlos\r\n\r\nThis project will examine an innovative approach for separation of water and oils, generally defined as organic compounds insoluble in water, by tuning the in wetting/de-wetting dynamics of drainage and absorption dynamics in engineered porous media. This project will advance the fundamental knowledge of (dynamic) wetting and liquid adhesion on \"real\" surfaces having complex nano- and microscale structure. The new knowledge will advance technologies for anti-fouling, drag reduction, and micro/nano-fluidic handling, having large impacts on the U.S. economy, infrastructure, and the environment.\r\n\r\nRecent theoretical developments by the PI indicate that the dynamics of the wetting process, present nontrivial regimes not described by conventional continuum-based and deterministic predictions. These theoretical predictions have been confirmed by molecular dynamics simulations and, more recently, through experimental work by the PI's group and other groups. Building upon these developments this project will examine the feasibility of exploiting novel phenomena such as the crossover from capillary-driven to thermally-activated wetting for innovative technical applications. The accomplishment of specific research objectives will be enabled by interdisciplinary and complementary skills of the PI and Co-PIs. To understand this will require incorporating the effects of thermal motion of the contact line which dominate the dynamics as mechanical equilibrium is approached. This project aims to generate fundamental knowledge required to understand and control the dynamics of spontaneous and forced imbibition or drainage in nano/microstructured media such as synthetic filters, sponges, and fabrics, or soil, sandstone, and biological membranes. The research hypothesis this project will examine is that significant asymmetries in wetting/de-wetting dynamics (wetting hysteresis) of different liquid pairs on micro/nanostructured surfaces can be designed and controlled to engineered capillary \"diodes\" for efficient separation of immiscible liquids. The PIs approach to test this hypothesis is to use the surface nano/microstructure to control dynamic hysteresis effects that will lead to fast or slow (arrested) wetting depending on the direction of motion of the wetting line and physicochemical properties of the liquids (e.g., viscosity, density, interfacial tensions). The central objective of this project is to generate fundamental knowledge required to understand and control the dynamics of spontaneous and forced imbibition/drainage by different liquid pairs on nano/micro-structured media such as synthetic filters, sponges, and fabrics, or soil, sandstone, and biological membranes. Building upon theoretical developments and preliminary experimental results the project has two specific objectives: (1) Tuning the crossover points between fast and slow wetting regimes; (2) Controlling the relaxation rate in the slow (kinetic) regime. Theoretical predictions will guide the selection of experimental parameters and physical conditions to accomplish two specific objectives: (1) Tuning the crossover point between fast and slow wetting regimes; and, (2) Controlling the relaxation rate in the slow (kinetic) regime. The proposed research has the potential to be highly transformative to environmental remediation and water treatment.

We have designed, fabricated, and tested simple fluidic devices called capillary diodes (Figure 1) for potential application in passive separation and filtering processes for immiscible liquids in water. The concept is analogous to conventional diodes, since a junction between two surfaces with dissimilar surface energies induce a threshold pressure head that must be overcome to observe the ?forward? transport of certain liquid pairs.

Our work has been able to predict, induce, and control the effective hydrodynamic conductivity and the threshold pressure head to observe imbibition (forward liquid displacement) and drainage (backward liquid displacement) of water and oils in a rectangular glass capillary that was partially micro/nanotextured using a single-step laser-based fabrication method. The fabrication approach developed and employed as a part of this project produces both a well-defined micropattern with controlled geometry and the deposition of nanomaterial with complex morphologies (Figure 2). The nanomaterial deposition and coverage extent was a critical factor to control the surface energy and resulting affinity of different liquids to each section the device surface.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;The key hypothesis that this project examined and verified is that significant asymmetries in the wetting and de-wetting dynamics by specific fluid pairs (water-air, oil-air, oil-water) can be effectively controlled through the surface micro/nanostructured in order to engineered capillary \"diodes\" for potential applications as passive separators and filters for immiscible organic liquids in water. To test or working hypothesis, we employed a laser-based method to design and fabricate surfaces having microscale patterns and complex nanoscale structures that once infused by water or oil break the symmetry of the energies and forces required for wetting/de-wetting and the associated forward/backward fluid transport inside the device. This resulted in the ability to prevent the spontaneous imbibition and wetting by simple oils when the micro/nanopatterned slits were pre-infused by water and immersed in water-oil mixtures at controlled immersion depths that were predicted by analytical models (Figure 3).</p>\n<p>Broader impacts</p>\n<p>The research work in this project has contributed to the fundamental knowledge of (dynamic) wetting/dewetting processes and liquid adhesion phenomena on surfaces having complex micro/ nanostructure. A better understanding of these phenomena is relevant to a wide range of natural processes and industrial applications. The new knowledge gained and the predictive models produced in this project can help develop new strategies for anti-fouling, drag reduction, and micro/nano-fluidic handling in diverse engineering applications. The theoretical developments and experimental analysis produced by this project indicate that the dynamics of imbibition and drainage processes present nontrivial regimes with long-lived metastable states that are not described by conventional continuum-based predictions (e.g., the Lucas-Washburn equation). To understand the presence of metastable states and the hindering of imbibition or drainage by different liquid pairs required new analytical descriptions considering the effects of thermal motion and the surface nanostructure, which largely dominate the wetting dynamics near thermodynamic equilibrium conditions.
