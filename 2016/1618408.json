 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMP) program assists universities and colleges in their efforts to significantly increase the numbers of students matriculating into and successfully completing high quality degree programs in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) disciplines in order to diversify the STEM workforce. Particular emphasis is placed on transforming undergraduate STEM education through innovative, evidence-based recruitment and retention strategies, and relevant educational experiences in support of racial and ethnic groups historically underrepresented in STEM disciplines: African Americans, Hispanic Americans, American Indians, Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians, and Native Pacific Islanders. These strategies facilitate the production of well-prepared students highly-qualified and motivated to pursue graduate education or careers in STEM. The need for cultivating STEM talent has been well established. For the United States (U.S.) to remain globally competitive, it is vital that it taps into the talent of all its citizens and provides exceptional educational preparedness in STEM areas that underpin the knowledge-based economy. American students from diverse ethnic groups are underrepresented in STEM fields, and represent an untapped resource for the STEM workforce in the U.S. The Indiana STEM LSAMP (IN STEM LSAMP), which consists of three research institutions: Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (lead institution), Indiana University Bloomington and Ball State University; two four-year regional universities: Indiana University Northwest and Indiana University South Bend; and Ivy Tech Community College Indianapolis, will address the critical need of increasing the participation and advancement of underrepresented students in STEM disciplines through its comprehensive and holistic plan that is built upon the elements of the LSAMP Model (academic integration, social integration and professionalization). \r\n\r\nIN STEM LSAMP activities will result in significant increases of STEM degree holders among historically underrepresented racial/ethnic populations in Indiana and the nation by providing these students access to faculty research mentoring, academic support, and STEM-related professionalization. To achieve alliance goals, all IN STEM LSAMP partners will implement the following cohesive high-impact practices to increase the retention rate of first-year full-time students and to strengthen students' disciplinary engagement: a) mathematical placement and online review support, b) summer bridge programs, c) freshman learning communities, d) peer mentoring programs, e) degree mapping, f) faculty-mentored research, and g) annual research conference. Additionally, the alliance will facilitate seamless transitions into STEM undergraduate and graduate degree programs by i) increasing program activities for community college transfers and ii) improving undergraduate disciplinary connections and preparation for STEM graduate programs. The project will generate new knowledge regarding the relative contributions of the selected high-impact practices to the academic success of underrepresented students. Additional new knowledge will be gained regarding the efficacy of pre-transfer programming at community colleges and STEM degree program collaborations for success in the retention and graduation of underrepresented students in STEM fields at the four-year college level. The alliance's accomplishments will have widespread effects beyond the region as its talented STEM graduates enter national research and development enterprises and thus, will diversify the STEM workforce of the U.S.",

The IN LSAMP project ended May 31, 2023, after receiving a no-cost extension for Year 6. The aspirational goal of the Alliance was to double the number of historically underrepresented minority (URM) graduates receiving a baccalaureate degree in a STEM discipline across the Alliance, from 278. While the Alliance did not meet its aspirational goal of a 100% increase in URM STEM degrees, it nevertheless made impressive progress in the desired direction. From baseline through the 2020-2021 academic year, the number of URM STEM degrees awarded across the Alliance, to both LSAMP participants and non-participants increased by 61%. The external evaluator of the project, Goodman Research Group, Inc. confirmed that IN LSAMP benefits all participating institutions. Across the Alliance, URM STEM full-time enrollment increased as did the number of URM STEM degrees awarded.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"Bodycopy\">To achieve its goal, IN LSAMP implemented three strategies: Practice high-impact programs to increase the first-year, full-time URM retention rate at each institution and to strengthen disciplinary engagement; facilitate seamless transitions into STEM undergraduate and graduate degree programs; and development and implementation of mechanisms for project communication and information dissemination.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>To fulfill the goals of the grant, the&nbsp;IN LSAMP Alliance offered or supported nearly 300 student activities and programs including: Mathematical placement/Summer bridge programs; Peer Mentoring/tutor support/STEM Living Learning Community; Science Workshops for High School Students; Transfer student support/community building; Faculty-mentored Research; IN LSAMP and LSMRCE Conferences/regional, national, and international conferences; Travel Support; Graduate school and career preparation/professional development.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The IN LSAMP Alliance has funded over 300 research scholars who have presented 510 scholarly presentations and who are co-authors on 11 publications<strong>.&nbsp;</strong>Fifty-one of these IN LSAMP Research Scholars were admitted to graduate or professional programs. Studies and reports done by staff relating to the program were disseminated by eight external conference presentations, 1 publication, and eight videos. The publication was entitled:&nbsp; New developments in pathways toward diversity &amp; inclusion in STEM:&nbsp; A United States Perspective (2022). Two videos were submitted to the NSF STEM for All Video Showcase. One of those, <em>Scientific Journal or Graphic Novel? A Student-Production Featuring LSAMP Research</em>! was the Experts? Choice winner in 2020.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Past and future campus coordinators have benefited from online training modules, a handbook, and a Canvas Course that assists each institution with summer research orientation and programming. An Alliance website <a href=\"https://inslamp.org/\">https://inslamp.org</a> stores and shares this information and features Scholar profiles and awards. The IN LSAMP Alliance maintains a presence on twitter, LinkedIn, and YouTube.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The key strengths of the Indiana LSAMP program included the collaboration among the Alliance institutions, faculty-mentored STEM research, and the impacts of its programming on students. During its initial six years, Indiana LSAMP developed an infrastructure for effective collaboration. The Alliance was characterized by concrete objectives, skilled and supportive leadership, and members who saw collaboration as in their institutional interest. Faculty-mentored STEM research emerged as a significant strength of the Alliance. It was implemented by all six campuses and helped establish a pipeline for student engagement in STEM/STEM research throughout their undergraduate years. The Alliance has trained 129 faculty research mentors in mentoring minority STEM students by using a required online training module, an online handbook, and virtual and in-person training, all developed by IN LSAMP personnel. Students reported that the faculty-mentored STEM research program was engaging and mutually beneficial for the faculty and scholars. They felt a sense of belonging in their research lab as well as in the program overall. The experience helped improve their research abilities, particularly their technical science skills and their ability to collect data. They gained more advanced disciplinary knowledge and skills, and the experience increased their commitment to future STEM endeavors, including graduate school and careers in STEM. With these successes and strengths, the Alliance is well-positioned to embark on its second period of implementation, concluded by the project final evaluation report.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 08/31/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Kim&nbsp;S&nbsp;Nguyen</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1618408/1618408_10455831_1693259465651_Slide1(002)--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1618408/1618408_10455831_1693259465651_Slide1(002)--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"IN LSAMP Direct Participants 2016-21\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1618408/1618408_10455831_1693259465651_Slide1(002)--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"IN LSAMP Direct Participants 2016-21\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The number of URM STEM students directly supported by the program increased more than 500% at the end of the project.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">GRG.

Faculty-mentored STEM research emerged as a significant strength of the Alliance. It was implemented by all six campuses and helped establish a pipeline for student engagement in STEM/STEM research throughout their undergraduate years. The Alliance has trained 129 faculty research mentors in mentoring minority STEM students by using a required online training module, an online handbook, and virtual and in-person training, all developed by IN LSAMP personnel. Students reported that the faculty-mentored STEM research program was engaging and mutually beneficial for the faculty and scholars. They felt a sense of belonging in their research lab as well as in the program overall. The experience helped improve their research abilities, particularly their technical science skills and their ability to collect data. They gained more advanced disciplinary knowledge and skills, and the experience increased their commitment to future STEM endeavors, including graduate school and careers in STEM. With these successes and strengths, the Alliance is well-positioned to embark on its second period of implementation, concluded by the project final evaluation report.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/31/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Kim S Nguyen"
