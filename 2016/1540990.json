 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project embeds a CI Engineer into four University of Pittsburgh research centers providing a resource for cyberinfrastructure engineering on existing projects and consulting on the use of campus and national cyberinfrastructures to advance center missions and objectives.  Research centers are the nexus for campus collaborations and serve as \"virtual science organizations\" in the University.   These centers provide a rich locus for engagement and development of cyberinfrastructure use cases and best practices for the use of shared facilities and information sharing among large collaboration teams.  The selection of centers with different missions and objectives provides an excellent test bed from which to develop the role of the CI Engineer and influence future support models.   The project integrates the knowledge and experiences derived from the center engagements into a CI-Consultant curriculum for use in workforce training and student education.  Sharing of the CI-Consultant curriculum with peer institutions contributes to the development and maturation of the CI Engineer role at large.",
