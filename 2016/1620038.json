 "awd_abstract_narration": "Modern network science analyzes and interprets relationships such as friendships between people in a social network, interactions between proteins in a biological network, or connections between machines in a computer network.  A key challenge in large-scale network analysis is understanding how the network is composed of basic building blocks or motifs, such as communities in social networks or groups of proteins that function together in a biological network.  Once such building blocks have been identified, one would like to identify what things in the network play key roles in them.  This project will create novel methods for decomposing networks into basic building blocks using the mathematical tool of graph spectra. Just as physical scientists use the spectrum of light frequencies absorbed or emitted by an object to determine the atomic composition of the material, graph spectra let network scientists determine how networks are composed from basic atomic building blocks.  The project will produce fast software tools to compute graph spectra for networks involving relations between millions of entities, along with new analysis techniques to extract network building blocks from these spectral signals.\r\n\r\nThe main objective of this research is to extend spectral density analysis methods common in spectral geometry and physics to gain new insights into the structure and composition of complex networks. The research extends prior work in computational material science, introducing novel stochastic and deterministic estimators of local and global spectral densities with different tradeoffs with respect to cost and accuracy.  These methods will take advantage of the structure of localized eigenvectors associated with interior eigenvalues in the spectra of complex networks  and to find network motifs. New graph decomposition techniques based on these local spectral density estimates will enable new and practical tools for graph analysis, and spectral node classification techniques based on this approach will generalize current centrality-based measures of node importance to provide more detailed insights into the role nodes play in a network. In addition to providing new mathematical insights, the project will result in new software tools for use by a broad audience of network scientists, and will expose undergraduate researchers to spectral theory in network science.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nSpectral methods in network analysis relate properties of the network to eigenvalues and eigenvectors.  In a physical analogy, if each edge were a string in a musical instrument, these would represent the tones that the instrument could play and the shape of the vibration for each tone.  Classical spectral network analysis focuses on the extreme eigenvalues and eigenvectors -- that is, just the lowest frequency vibration.  The work in this project emphasized inferring properties of the network by looking at pictures of the distribution of allfrequences, or \"spectral densities.\"  The PI and his students developed fast, scalable algorithms to compute these spectral densities and described how they can be used in practical data analysis applications.  This work won a best paper prize at KDD, the premiere data mining conference.\n\n\nThe key computational tool used in the algorithms for fast spectral densities is stochastic estimation.  These approaches use random numbers in numerical experiments that produce functions of the spectral density as a mean value.  The development of these tools for network analysis also shed light on how to use stochastic spectral estimators to help with prediction in a variety of statistical models.  Such approaches are important for classic spatio-temporal inference problems, like predicting overall rainfall patterns from the measurements at a discrete set of sensors, but they are also enormously important to pattern recognition problems that lie at the core of much of modern machine learning. Stochastic linear algebra methods also play a key role in work on large-scale topic modeling related to this project.  The algorithms developed in this part of the project have been highly influential in the machine learning, where they are integrated into state-of-the-art tools like GPyTorch, and are currently used by companies like Facebook and SIGOPT.\n\nAs part of this project, the PI also developed a new course on \"Numerical Methods for Data Science,\" which is now regularly offered as a graduate course at Cornell.
