 "awd_abstract_narration": "The response of the Antarctic Ice Sheet to future climatic changes is recognized as the greatest uncertainty in projections of future sea level.  An understanding of past ice fluctuations affords insight into ice-sheet response to climate and sea-level change and thus is critical for improving sea-level predictions.  This project will examine deglaciation of the southern Ross Sea over the past few thousand years to document oscillations in Antarctic ice volume during a period of relatively stable climate and sea level.  We will help quantify changes in ice volume, improve understanding of the ice dynamics responsible, and examine the implications for future sea-level change. The project will train future scientists through participation of graduate students, as well as undergraduates who will develop research projects in our laboratories.\r\n\r\nPrevious research indicates rapid Ross Sea deglaciation as far south as Beardmore Glacier early in the Holocene epoch (which began approximately 11,700 years before present), followed by more gradual recession. However, deglaciation in the later half of the Holocene remains poorly constrained, with no chronological control on grounding-line migration between Beardmore and Scott Glaciers.  Thus, we do not know if mid-Holocene recession drove the grounding line rapidly back to its present position at Scott Glacier, or if the ice sheet withdrew gradually in the absence of significant climate forcing or eustatic sea level change.  The latter possibility raises concerns for future stability of the Ross Sea grounding line. To address this question, we will map and date glacial deposits on coastal mountains that constrain the thinning history of Liv and Amundsen Glaciers.  By extending our chronology down to the level of floating ice at the mouths of these glaciers, we will date their thinning history from glacial maximum to present, as well as migration of the Ross Sea grounding line southwards along the Transantarctic Mountains.  High-resolution dating will come from Beryllium-10  surface-exposure ages of erratics collected along elevation transects, as well as Carbon-14 dates of algae within shorelines from former ice-dammed ponds. Sites have been chosen specifically to allow close comparison of these two dating methods, which will afford constraints on Antarctic Beryllium-10 production rates.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nDuring the last ice age, the Antarctic Ice Sheet grew to fill the large embayments now occupied by the floating Ross and Weddell Ice Shelves.  Deglaciation of the Ross Embayment began 15-16,000 years ago, and continued to within 3000 years of the present, final retreat of the ice sheet marking the closure of the last ice age.  Our previous work has shown that the Ross Ice Sheet had contracted to a small remnant south of Beardmore and Shackleton Glaciers by ~ 7000 years ago.  This current project aimed to study the last stages of its disappearance, to understand rates and causes of ice-sheet deglaciation under comparatively stable climatic conditions similar to the present.  To do so, we sampled sites in the Transantarctic Mountains, using cosmic ray exposure dating to determine the age of glacially-transported boulders which were stranded on mountain sides as glaciers thinned to their present-day elevations.  This method uses the build-up of rare isotopes such as beryllium-10, produced by cosmic ray bombardment of rock surfaces, to measure the time since a rock sample emerged from the thinning glacier ice.  We also used  carbon-14 to date ancient algae from melt pond deposits which mark the former edges of the receding glaciers.  Together these dates show that Liv Glacier, coastal ice to its south, Amundsen Glacier, and Scott Glacier all reached their present levels between ~4200 and ~3200 years ago.  Compared to earlier, rapid deglaciation of the northern Ross Sea, when the ice front receded more than 1000 km between 12,000 and 7000 years ago, final deglaciation was more gradual, and ended almost synchronously along the southernmost Ross Sea coast.
