 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms (CSDM-A) Program of the Division of Chemistry, Professor Daniel Turner of New York University and his research group conducts experimental studies aimed at understanding how certain coordinated motions of the nuclei and electrons in molecules determine the outcomes of photochemical reactions. The research improves the fundamental understanding of several light-driven processes, including mechanisms of solar energy conversion. The activities enhance secondary education, enable mentoring by retired scientists, promote science to the public, and produce scientists equipped to apply technical and quantitative skills in research, industry, and education. \r\n\r\nThis project focuses on the detection of conical intersections and extraction of topographic information from femtosecond spectroscopy experiments. By clarifying the role of conical intersections in condensed-phase photochemistry, the proposed experimental studies not only resolve questions about conical intersection topography that have been postulated by computational work, but also guide and motivate future theoretical efforts. The molecules to be measured, oxazines and phytochromes, serve as model systems for studying how conical intersections mediate nonradiative decay and drive photo-isomerization reactions, respectively. The broader impacts include training young researchers for scientific careers, disseminating science to the general public through a partnership with The Huffington Post, creating a website that captures the expertise of retired scientists to fill in the gaps created by generational turnover of research trends, and, through a partnership with high school teachers, developing feasible science labs for underprivileged schools.",
