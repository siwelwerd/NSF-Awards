The main topics of the program and workshop lie on the frontier between physics and mathematics with emphasis on interconnections and cross fertilization of ideas between these fields. The project will promote progress in the areas in mathematical and theoretical physics by training of junior US researchers (postdocs, junior faculty, and advanced graduate students). \r\n \r\nThe Thematic Program on \"Statistical Mechanics and Combinatorics\" from February 15-April 15, 2016  will include preparatory courses and regular lectures and seminars by the long-term and short-term visitors of the program and the one-week-long workshop \"Six-vertex model, dimers, shapes, and all that,\" March 14-18, 2016. The preparatory courses, related to the themes of the workshops, will be aimed at graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and young researchers. The project will support participation of young researchers at preparatory lecture courses, as well as in the program and the workshop. The SCGP program will cover a broad spectrum of interrelated topics which include mathematical aspects of solvable models of statistical physics, combinatorics, representation theory, and related topics.  This will be an interdisciplinary activity with participation of distinguished mathematicians, physicists and mathematical physicists. For junior researchers it will be an opportunity to learn modern mathematical physics and discuss their own projects with established experts in the field.",
