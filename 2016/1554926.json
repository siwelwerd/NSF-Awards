 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research supported by this award will advance our understanding of the space near Earth (geospace) with focus on the variability of the electric fields over height and over time within the low latitude ionosphere, which is that region of the upper atmosphere located between approximately 50 and 300 miles altitude. It is formed by a mixture of atmospheric neutral species and charged particles (ions and electrons) created, mostly, by the absorption of solar radiation. The dynamical behavior of geospace depends on various physical processes occurring in the Sun, in the Sun-Earth environment, and in the lower (below 50 miles) atmosphere. The research plan of this award will combine existing ground-based radar measurements made in Peru with space-based measurements.  These results together with new measurements would be utilized to assist the development of computer numerical models that would provide better specification of the low-latitude ionosphere and its dependence upon local time, solar flux levels, and geomagnetic activity. The broader impact of the funded work will provide professional training for undergraduate and graduate students in the fields of science, technology, engineering and mathematics. The project will also enhance the curriculum of the Physics program at UT Dallas. Finally, the project is expected to also increase public literacy about scientific and technological aspects of the Earth's geospace environment through the medium of public lectures presented at the Space Center at regular intervals.\r\n\r\nThe research plan to combine measurements and modeling would achieve greatly-improved understanding of fundamental physical processes responsible for the ionospheric dynamical behavior. The outcomes of this study will also help to evaluate, more accurately than currently possible, the impact of the ionosphere in the propagation of radio waves used by various technological systems (GPS, telecommunications, remote sensing, over-the-horizon radars, etc.) providing strong relevance to societal needs in connection with space weather forecasting.",
