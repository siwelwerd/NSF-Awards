 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Pleistocene Epoch began approximately 1.8 million years before present and lasted until about 12 milennia ago, when the last Ice Age ended. Many large mammals succumbed to the harsh climatic conditions of this period, while others were confined to habitable ice-free areas, or refugia. During the peak of the last Ice Age, sheets of ice divided the Old and New Worlds, restricting movement of organisms across the Bering Land Bridge for thousands of years. Geological and biological evidence have suggested, however, that refugia along the North Pacific Coast may have played crucial roles as \"stepping stones\" for movements of species between the Old and New Worlds, forming an early postglacial corridor for the recolonization of North America. Building on an unparalleled vertebrate bone collection excavated from limestone caves in Southeast (SE) Alaska, this project will perform genetic analyses and radiocarbon dating of black and brown bear specimens from throughout the last 50,000 years to directly test if these caves were occupied by bears at the peak of the last Ice Age. By ensuring precise species determinations of these keystone mammal species in SE Alaska, and providing evolutionary links to extant populations, this research will elucidate species' responses to climate change and help circumscribe the extent and timing of viable coastal refugia in SE Alaska. As such, results from this project will provide important data for a deeper comprehension of the dynamic changes in trans-Beringian biota during the Late Pleistocene, the diversity and biogeographic history of the region, and its importance as a corridor for exchange between continents during and after the last Ice Age.\r\n\r\nAn important outcome of this research is to recover genetic information from bear specimens that occupied SE Alaska during the late Wisconsin glaciation and into the Holocene, and provide calibrations for precise timings of demographic events. Focusing on brown bears (Ursus arctos) and black bears (Ursus americanus), which have developed into well-established systems for studies of Northern Hemisphere phylogeography, the project will test if the same bear populations inhabited this region continuously for the last 50,000 years, or if they were recolonized following the Last Glacial Maximum, and if they contributed to postglacial (modern) mainland populations. The project will take a highly integrative approach that leverages state-of-the-art ancient DNA analysis (including a targeted hybridization enrichment approach using custom-made biotinylated RNA baits designed from whole mitochondrial genome sequences), radiocarbon and molecular dating, reconstruction of paleodiets, and phylogenetic reconstruction. This research will have broad significance toward understanding past and present North American mammal diversity and for assessing the impact of late Pleistocene climate change on biotic diversification, colonization, and the historical biogeography of the region.",

Many species died out and others were forced into isolated, ice-free areas (refugia) north and south of the ice sheets. Today?s plants and animals carry the genetic legacy of the Ice Age and this refugial isolation, but the westernmost extent and timing of ice cover along the North Pacific Coast at the peak of the last Ice Age (the Last Glacial Maximum or LGM) is&nbsp;poorly known, leaving unanswered fundamental questions about the impact of climatic change on biodiversity and colonization of the Americas after the Ice Age. The main goal of this project was to seek a deeper understanding of the impact of the dramatic climatic changes on the biodiversity and biogeographic history of Southeast Alaska, and its importance as a corridor for exchange between continents during and after the LGM. With a focus on two key North American mammals, our aims were to recover and analyze genetic data from American black bear and brown bear fossil bones that had been excavated from limestone caves in the Alexander Archipelago in Southeast Alaska. By ensuring precise species identities and determining evolutionary links to modern populations, we have been able to test the diversity and movement of bears in SE Alaska throughout the last 50,000 years. Based on the recovery of ancient DNA from bear remains and comparisons to genetic data from present-day bear populations, we discovered many distinct genetic lineages, now extirpated, among preglacial bears in the Alexander Archipelago, suggesting considerable loss of genetic variation during the Ice Age. While preglacial brown bear populations may not have survived in local refugia during the Ice Age, but instead that bears living in the Alexander Archipelago today repopulated the islands around 12,000 years ago, black bears may have occupied ice-free refugia during the LGM in or nearby the archipelago and that they contributed to population expansion south of the ice sheet following its postglacial retreat. As parallel systems to bears, this project also isolated DNA and performed genetic analyses of numerous other ancient vertebrate species in the archipelago, including red and arctic fox, seals, deer, and caribou. Results so far indicate that ice age climate changes had a significant but complex and differential impact depending on the life history of the species, and that even small climatic fluctuations in the Holocene also strongly impacted the fauna. In collaboration with geologists, this project helped define the duration of complete ice coverage of the region during the LGM and directly tested the hypothesis of ice-free refugia during the LGM in the archipelago. By using radiocarbon dating of bones and exposure dating of rocks, we have estimated that the culmination of&nbsp;maximum ice extent in SE Alaska occurred in a narrow timespan around 20-17 thousand years ago, that the area may have been devoid of large mammals in a narrow time span at the peak of the Ice Age, and soon thereafter around 17,000 years ago, the region provided an open and ecologically viable pathway through SE Alaska. As such, this project has had broad significance for assessing the impact of late Pleistocene climate change on mammal diversification and historical biogeography of the region, including the peopling of the Americas.
