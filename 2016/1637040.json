 "awd_abstract_narration": "There has been increasing concern of infections related to visit to hospitals, called hospital-acquired infections (HAIs).  HAIs have resulted in significant cases of mortality.  Approximately fifty percent of such susceptible to death circumstances are related to not properly cleaning (or disinfecting) the surfaces such as hospital beds, hospital room floors, and medical devices.  The common disinfectants used are bleach (i.e. sodium hypochlorite), hydrogen peroxide, and salt containing central positively charged nitrogen atom surrounded by four organic groups (or quaternary salts).  These disinfectants can clean the surfaces effectively, but in performing their disinfection functions destroy hospital equipment and materials.  In additions, these disinfectants have off putting odor and also cause irritation to eyes and skin to end users.  In this proposal, a liquid ferrate molecule, which is based on iron and oxygen atoms, is proposed to address the problems associated with currently used disinfectants.  In the laboratory, ferrate has shown tremendous potential to inactivate a wide range of microorganisms.  A recent patented liquid ferrate technology, which solved the inherent issues related to stability of ferrate in solution from, will be tested for its commercial viability as a surface disinfectant. The successful implementation of ferrate technology will decrease the cost burden to hospitals by applying safer approaches\r\n\r\nFerrate has been shown to be an effective oxidant, coagulant, and disinfectant for treating water and wastewater. Significantly, ferrate is a capable disinfectant due to its ability to inactivate a wide variety of microorganisms at a low dosage. Most of the research on ferrate as a disinfectant has been carried out in an aqueous environment.  Ferrate has potential in disinfecting surfaces that carry several harmful bacteria that cause HAIs.  However, no study has been performed on ferrate as a potential surface disinfectant.  This I-Corps team's main approach is to evaluate disinfection capabilities of ferrate on environmental surfaces, especially in healthcare settings.  In the proposed work, two methodologies will be applied to seek the applicability of ferrate as a disinfectant in healthcare settings.  Initially, the intensive market evaluation of surface disinfectants will be done, followed by best practice to commercialize the liquid ferrate product as a surface disinfectant for healthcare facilities.  The market evaluation will provide information whether the ferrate technology stands in comparison with currently available market disinfectant products to the health care facility customers.  Finally, the physical properties (i.e., staining of surfaces/clothes/skin, odor) and interactions with hospital materials (e.g., glass, fabric, ceramic, metal, and plastic) will be examined after the ferrate treatment.  Evaluations include visual inspection, photographs, silk tests, smell, and discoloration of material.  The proposed successful systematic investigations on technological feasibilities and market evaluation of liquid ferrate product to clean surfaces of health care facilities will demonstrate the feasibility of ferrate technology to the health care facilities.",

It has been reported in medical journals that about fifty percent of such susceptible to death circumstances are related to not properly cleaning (or disinfecting) the surfaces such as hospital room floors, hospital beds, and medical devices.  These HAIs cost an additional $39 billion to US healthcare systems. Reducing HAIs is a priority for the hospitals because of immense cost and severe penalties associated with implementation of Affordable Care Act measures.  The common disinfectants used are bleach (i.e. sodium hypochlorite), hydrogen peroxide, and salt containing central positively charged nitrogen atom surrounded by four organic groups (or quaternary salts).  These disinfectants can clean the surfaces effectively, but in performing their disinfection functions destroy hospital equipment and materials.  In additions, these disinfectants have off putting odor and also cause irritation to eyes and skin to end users.  In the project, In this proposal, a liquid ferrate solution, based on iron and oxygen atoms (tetraoxy iron in +6 oxidation state, FeVIO42-), was evaluated as a commercial product to disinfectant a variety of bacteria, generally present in hospital environment.  The liquid ferrate solution is stable for many weeks that solved inherent issues of stability of the solution and is an emerging surface disinfectant. \n\n During the proposal period, commercial viability of liquid ferrate was explored by visiting sites including health care facilities.  More than hundred interviews of personnel involved in health care facilities were conducted to evaluate the viability of a liquid ferrate as a new disinfectant in market.  Results of the most of the interviews showed the critical need of environmental friendly disinfectant like ferrate that can effectively clean the facility in the hospitals in order to minimize the HAIs.  This assessment was also supported by practical use of liquid ferrate product.  However, the ferrate product needs tweaking to satisfy customer needs.  Basically, the successful implementation of liquid ferrate will decrease the cost burden to hospitals by applying safer approaches.  Two videos are available in public domains:  Technical Video:     https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7weDj0pWVvI; Lessons learned:     https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9_zN0usujo\n\n To support viability of liquid ferrate as a surface disinfectant, efficacy tests were conducted to inactivated three types of bacteria, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Clostridium difficile (C. diff), and Escherichia coli (E. coli).  The tested ferrate solution was able to inactivate these bacteria.  A stable ferrate solution was able to demonstrate antibacterial effect in disinfecting 106 organisms on a surface.  The testing further showed the practical viability of liquid ferrate as a surface disinfectant in hospital settings.  Significantly, the project also gave opportunities to educate postdoctoral on ferrate technology.  The successful ferrate technology will not only circumvent infections in hospital, but may have a role in water and wastewater treatments.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/10/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Virender K Sharma"
