 "awd_abstract_narration": "Communication is always a leap of faith.  But this is particularly the case for people who work with adolescents with severe and profound intellectual disabilities. Their interactions with others challenge our understanding of what a social relationship is and could be.  For typically developing children, language begins with what researchers call the \"basic affiliative need\" -- the emotional need for connection -- that compels infants to imitate others and interpret their intentions in increasingly effective ways.  This observation raises intriguing questions when it comes to interactions involving individuals who neither imitate nor use conventional signs.  What are the effects of the \"basic affiliative need\" felt by the family members, aids, therapists, and teachers who live and work in close proximity with adolescents with severe and profound intellectual disabilities?  How do cultural norms and institutional constraints influence how they treat adolescents in their midst?  How do they learn to connect with their loved ones, clients, and students across what might appear to be an unbridgeable gulf?  What new social worlds emerge as a result?\r\n\r\nThis Cultural Anthropology Scholars award supports research-specific training to prepare cultural anthropologist  Dr. Danilyn Rutherford to address these questions.  With guidance from colleagues in the University of California Santa Cruz Department of Psychology, Rutherford will master methods suited to the collection of data on the interactions that occur between disabled adolescents and those who work with them.  She will also undertake coursework in speech and language pathology and special education at San Jose State University to learn the methods and techniques used with individuals with complex communicative needs.  This is not usual training for cultural anthropologists but it will allow Rutherford to to carry apply anthropology's traditional methods of ethnographic fieldwork and participant observation to entirely new domains: speech therapy sessions with disabled adolescents and informal interactions at school and at home. The training undertaken through this grant will provide a model for interdisciplinary collaboration.  Rutherford's work will enhance anthropology by demonstrating what anthropologists can can learn from fields that make general claims about human development.  At the same time, her work will demonstrate how the intensive methods of cultural anthropology enlarge understanding of human development and inter-personal communication.  Findings from the research enabled by this training also will benefit members of the special needs population by helping policy makers and practitioners tailor services more closely to students' abilities and needs; and it will showcase the creativity of members of a long stigmatized population and of those who work with them.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nCommunication is a leap of faith.  It is particularly a leap of faith for the caregivers of people who don?t communicate in typical ways.  The PI has used this NSF Scholar Award to pursue training in developmental psychology and speech and language pathology that will allow her to explore this problem.   This training prepared her to carry out fieldwork focused on the social worlds that arise around adolescents who don?t speak or use sign language or other systems of conventional signs.  Her goal is understand how the experiences of people intimately involved in the lives of severely and profoundly disabled adolescents both draw upon and challenge American cultural understandings of what it is to be a person. \n\n \n\nWith guidance from colleagues in the UC Santa Cruz psychology department, she learned new methods for studying the subtle, non-verbal ways caregivers and disabled people communicate in the course of a typical day.  Through coursework in speech and language pathology at San Jose State, she has gained insights into the assumptions at work in the methods and technologies used in speech therapy, which can downplay the importance of non-linguistic ways of engaging with others.\n\n \n\nThe PI has used this background in her research on speech therapy sessions and informal interactions at school and in the flow of family life.   So far, the PI has conducted interviews and participant observation with a total of seven families in California.   In addition to spending time in a school setting, she has attended conferences, workshops, and trainings in assistive technology.  She has presented her work in talks at academic conferences and in anthropology departments in the United States and Europe.  Her work has also attracted interest from scholars in disability studies, some of whom are involved in the development of new communications systems. \n\n \n\nBeyond academia, her work has had an impact on the families included in her study.  She has shared her draft publications with the individuals discussed in her scholarship.   The parents and caregivers she has interviewed are enthusiastic about the project, which showcases the creativity with which severe and profoundly disabled individuals create meaningful social worlds.  They have seemed to enjoy telling the story of their lives with their loved ones.   The PI hopes to build on the network created through this research to create more of a sense of community among severely and profoundly disabled young adults and their allies in Santa Cruz.  The parents and caregivers involved in the study are all concerned about their loved ones' futures as severely and profoundly disabled adults and are eager to work together to create meaningful arenas for social engagement.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/01/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Danilyn Rutherford"
