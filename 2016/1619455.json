 "awd_abstract_narration": "The growth of mobile apps in recent years has been aided by Frameworks, Services, and Third Party Libraries (FSTPL), which provide support for user interfaces, advertising, analytics, and other critical app functionality. These FSTPLs enhance developer productivity, improve security, make key functionality easily accessible, and modularize complex and error-prone components. Our prior work shows that there is a tradeoff between the benefits of using FSTPLs and the impact they have on end users; however, developers lack clear guidance on how to manage these tradeoffs. Best practices that can be found online are generally anecdotal and sometimes contradictory. For developers who wish to improve their apps while maintaining the use of FSTPLs, there is no way to quantify or estimate the magnitude or impact of their FSTPL related design and implementation decisions. This motivates us to investigate techniques that can help developers more accurately evaluate FSTPL tradeoffs.  The results of this investigation will advance the state of the art in software engineering methodology and education, benefiting society by leading to the development of apps with higher reliability and usability.  For methodology, this will result in techniques to help developers improve the quality of their apps.  For education it will enhance training of future software developers in using analytical techniques to drive software design and implementation decisions.\r\n\r\nIn this proposal the PIs will investigate techniques to help app developers evaluate their usage of FSTPLs and their impact on end users? experience. The proposed work will include the design of techniques and methodologies for quantifying the way developers use FSTPLs in their apps and correlating their usage with user ratings and reviews that will be mined from the app stores. Within this project, the PIs will focus on two thrusts. The first will be to design program analysis based techniques that can measure and quantify the usage patterns of FSTPLs in mobile apps. The second will be to perform empirical investigations by applying the program analysis based techniques on apps from app stores and using statistical analysis to understand relationships between the gathered data and various user feedback based metrics, such as the ratings of apps, to learn best and worst practices for using FSTPLs. The techniques and methodologies produced by these two thrusts will allow developers to analyze their apps and determine if their usage of FSTPLs could negatively or positively impact the user experience. The approach will provide objective and quantifiable guidance to developers to make refactoring choices, redesign components, and other such decisions about their apps. Therefore developers will be able to understand how their design and implementation choices affect the users? perception of their apps. More broadly, the proposed work will define a methodology for guiding developers in making design decisions and a way to tie these decisions to ratings based outcomes.",

FSTPLs are widely used by mobile app developers, and include the usage of mobile advertising services, databases, and analytics engines.  Our work on this project included the design of techniques and methodologies for quantifying the way developers use FSTPLs in their apps and correlating this usage with user ratings and reviews mined from the app stores.

The techniques and methodologies produced by these two thrusts allows developers to analyze their apps and determine if their usage of FSTPLs impacts the user experience in such a way as to harm their apps' ratings or software development quality. \n\n \nThe first type of FSTPL that we investigated was third party mobile ad network libraries.  These types of libraries are widely used by mobile app developers to display ads in their apps and monetize their development efforts.  However, even though they monetize app usage, they can impose a cost on end users and developers in terms of resource usage on the mobile device and on the quality of user experience.  In the work targeting mobile ads, we carried out several empirical studies to determine the issues that affected mobile app users' ratings and perceptions of quality for apps that contained mobile ads.  Our work reviewed thousands of app reviews and ratings to identify these topics.  Next, we developed analysis techniques to identify these issues when they occurred in apps and quantify the severity of their impact.  Based on these findings we designed a lightweight automated analysis tool that could guide developers in making better tradeoffs with regards to their usage of mobile advertising in their apps.\n\n \nThe second type of FSTPL that we investigated was mobile app local databases.  These types of databases are widely used by mobile app developers to store app information locally on the mobile device and improve the responsiveness of their apps.  However, these databases must be used very carefully, as misuse can cause them to unnecessarily consume more resources on a mobile device and negatively impact the perception of the quality of an app.   In this work, we performed an extensive literature review of developer reports, research papers, and database developer manuals to identify all of the known misuse patterns.  We then built static program analyses to automatically identify the prevalence of such misuse patterns and quantify their impact.  Our work found that these database misuse patterns appeared frequently and could have a high cost to end users in terms of their resource usage (i.e., battery power and runtime performance).  To support developers in automatically finding these kinds of misuse patterns, we developed a static program analysis framework that encapsulated the analyses necessary to detect these patterns.  This framework makes these powerful analyses more accessible to developers who might have otherwise lacked the technical expertise to develop them from scratch and therefore been unable to accurately and efficiently find occurrences of these misuse patterns in their software code.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/07/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: William Halfond"
