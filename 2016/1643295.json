 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is a renewal of the Bay Area Regional I-Corps Node to continue creating a robust and broad-based entrepreneurship infrastructure built on the scientific, technology, and engineering strengths as well as the business thought leadership of three globally recognized universities, the University of California, Berkeley (UC Berkeley), the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), and Stanford University. This I-Corps Node will continue building on its success of applying and disseminating the Lean Launchpad methodology through classes and training for both new trainers and early-stage startups. These startups will drive creation of sustainable, scalable science and technology-based startups with both regional and national impacts. The I-Corps Node also will raise awareness of the value of entrepreneurship among science and engineering faculty and students, using specialized programs to drive forcing mechanisms for collaboration. The success of the I-Corps Node itself will be the subject of continual evaluation and analysis, consistent with Lean LaunchPad principles, to develop and disseminate best practices for this region and the nation. A central focus of the Node's work will be finding more efficient ways of solving the two-sided market of connecting scientific and technical talent with business talent. A key question that will be elucidated by this I-Corps Node's research is whether structured mechanisms or a more organic approach will achieve the most favorable outcomes.\r\n\r\nThe partner schools have been key contributors to the National Innovation Network in the development of new curriculum and advanced tools. The Node will continue to disseminate the Lean LaunchPad classes widely throughout the Node via classes like Hacking For Defense at Stanford. The Node will also create specialized programs for government funded research centers within universities and governmental agencies ,such as NSA, with the ultimate goal of financial sustainability. The training products and programs created by the I-Corps Node will have broad impact through their widespread dissemination throughout the Node network and beyond. All activities and programs at the I-Corps Node will facilitate the inclusion of groups from diverse regions, economic backgrounds, and ethnicities.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Bay Area Node has continued to drive the creation of deep technology spinouts from academic and National laboratories on the West coast and throughout the National Innovation Network (NIN).  The Node has accomplished this primarily through team formation activities as well as through delivery of a targeted, Lean Startup-based training program.  Other contributions include recruiting, preparing and sending 21 teams to National training (with 8 more in process for Fall) from across the Node as well as intended Hub Partners.  As with previous years, the majority of National teams (11) were led by Female Founders.  The Node also continued its mission of sourcing, developing and training new National faculty with the addition of two URM faculty members, both National adjuncts and one as a fully trained Regional instructor.\n\n \n\nWith one to two Regional courses (virtual) per month, the Node has become a trusted, reliable resource for other Hubs, Nodes and NIN members to send teams.  Multiple PFI teams as well as National teams with new team members have been referred so that they can quickly complete eligibility requirements without disrupting a scheduled National cohort.  Other high potential teams with expedited training needs have been referred from partners across the NIN.   Curricular emphasis remains on introducing the fundamental concepts of Lean Startup and applying them through a mandatory 15 customer discovery interviews over a 7 day period.\n\n \n\n \n\nIn addition to meeting monthly with intended Hub Partners, the Node continues to refine a pipeline of sourcing and training for their unique needs.  These have included quarterly trainings focused on life sciences as well as dedicated cohorts for UC Davis teams. \n\n \n\nAs identified in previous years, \"team formation\" remains a consistent and major barrier to academic team eligibility for and engagement with the Regional course.  As a result, the Node continues collaboration with feeder programs such as Berkeley StEP, PostX, PhdX  (funded by an NSF I-Corps supplement) and Stanford Venture Lab.\n\n \n\n \n\nAll programs and activities are designed to enable a regional ecosystem in which suitable deep technologies are routinely commercialized through a clear and efficient pipeline.
