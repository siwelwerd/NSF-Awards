 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation Program (MRI) and support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program (CRIF), Professor Leonard Mueller from the University of California Riverside and colleague William Harman have upgraded a 600 MHz spectrometer by equipping it with a console for a 14.1 Tesla magnet. The instrument also has solid state capabilities. The upgrade provides new electronics and thus updated capabilities to this 600 MHz spectrometer to allow research in a variety of fields such as those that accelerate chemical reactions of significant economic importance, as well as the study of biologically relevant species. In general, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution or in the solid state. The results from these NMR studies have an impact in synthetic organic/inorganic chemistry, materials chemistry and biochemistry. This instrument, located in a general user facility managed by highly qualified scientists, is an integral part of research, research training and teaching at this Hispanic Serving Institution. The facility provides training for the next generation of scientists and engineers and broadens the participation of groups traditionally underrepresented in STEM fields. Because the University of California at Riverside is a comprehensive NMR user facility, the award provides the means to establish outreach efforts and service structures to both smaller colleges and universities, the private sector and the broader scientific community in the region.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe award is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels, especially in areas such as (a) studying structure and mechanism in typtophan synthase; (b) studying well-defined heterogeneous catalysts via solid state NMR; (c) exploiting N-H resonances for glycosaminoglycan characterization; (d) characterizing microscopic photomechanical molecular crystals; (e) studying ligand binding, enzyme kinetics and inhibition; (f) regulating DNA methylation by the CXXC domain of the ten-eleven translocation (Tet1) proteins; (g) using molecular electrets for bioinspired charge transfer; (h) studying cooperative bond activation at reactive N-heterocyclic silylene complexes; (i) exploring self-sorting, supramolecular catalysis and molecular dynamics; (j) exploring catalysis and energy storage enabled by carborane anions; (k) studying the antioxidant selenoeine and (l) isolating and characterizing insect semiochemicals.",
