 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research has shown that STEM learning is enhanced when students' experiences are authentic and meaningful, e.g., when students see direct connections between what they learn and their own lived experiences and the surrounding community. During the last ten years there has been prolific growth of Makerspaces, hackerspaces, and Fab labs that are accessible to students and provide an environment that introduces students to methods and technologies that they can use to arrive at solutions relevant to society and their lives. This project aims to increase retention rates for college students majoring in STEM disciplines by creating a university \"Makerspace\" laboratory and an associated Sophomore Year Experience (SYE) course.  The STEM-SYE course aims to develop specific skills, including technical skills, group collaboration, project design, planning and execution, and the ability to present and defend results.  \r\n\r\nThe project will impact sophomore STEM majors through three major program elements: 1) The design, creation, and implementation of a multi-disciplinary STEM sophomore-year experience course; 2) the creation of a campus Makerspace to support the proposed curriculum and to foster an inclusive community by providing learning and service opportunities; and 3) the improvement of the knowledge base for defining effective undergraduate STEM education. The education goal will be guided by two research questions: How does the developed innovative pedagogy impact students' motivation and retention in STEM fields? Do the skill sets introduced through low-cost campus Makerspaces lead to gains in students' future performance and career readiness? Education research conducted by the project team will measure the influence of the new course, and will provide formative input on the course development process, replicability and scalability. To document learning and retention gains from the program, external evaluators will quantify progress toward achieving specific learning outcomes and improving the retention and graduation rate of STEM students.",

The main goal for Sci 220 was to enhance student engagement and professional growth through the lens of addressing societal needs. This was accomplished by providing an immersive hands-on maker experience where students were empowered with technical&nbsp;skills and given the opportunity to fail while working on challenging open-ended problems with community partners.&nbsp;Students enrolled in the course excelled at developing&nbsp;essential&nbsp;STEM skills and also showed improved attitudes towards technical skills and science. Additionally, students demonstrated gains in problem solving, critical thinking, and openness to technology. The ~2000 square foot SSU Makerspace was completed and officially opened in October 2017. Science 220 was taught with lab activities in the new SSU Makerspace each semester beginning in Fall 2017 through Spring 2020, when it was interrupted by the campus shutdown due to COVID-19. Sci 220 has now transitioned to University support and is planned to be offered regularly as a lower-division General Education course.</p>\n<p class=\"Default\">Building on what we learned in the first two years of the project, we had the opportunity to create a second Makerspace and an additional Making course, when in the summer of 2018, the original Principal Investigator Dr. Jeremy Qualls accepted the position of Dean of the College of Science, Technology and Health at the University of Southern Maine (USM). As a result, Dr. Lynn Cominsky took over the responsibility for SSU's class and Makerspace. Funding was split between SSU and USM, enabling Dr. Qualls to create a Maker Innovation Studio (MIST) at USM, and to use some of the Sci 220 lab writeups for USM's similar course, EYE199:&nbsp; Galileo's Laboratory. Each Makerspace is also used in several other courses.</p>\n<p class=\"Default\">The SSU Makerspace includes: &nbsp;laser cutter, six 3D printers,&nbsp; vinyl cutter, heat press, sublimation printer, four sewing and/or embroidery machines, 3D scanner, soldering equipment, oscilloscopes, two CNC mills (\"Carveys\"), button maker, 25 laptops,&nbsp; large screen interactive computer projector, and four virtual reality systems. At USM, the new MIST Labs are fully operational and include a Makerspace, Digital Immersion Lab, Digital Media Lab, APIS Commercial Lab, and the NASA CubeSat of Maine Lab.</p>\n<p class=\"Default\">Intellectual merit of the SETSI project is derived from the creation of the Makerspaces, the development of original content for semester-long courses at both institutions, and education research into STEM identity. The courses teach STEM skills through laboratory-based activities tied to the equipment in the Makerspace. Research into the development of STEM identity has created two diagnostic instruments and a coding scheme for the analysis of interview data: the SETSI Making Diagnostic Tool and the SETSI Interview protocol. Both instruments can be used or adapted by future Making educators to diagnose undergraduates' application of maker-related dispositions and skills. Prof. Ed Lyon's analysis of interview data from SSU students found that the Sci 220 course allowed sophomores to confront and, in most cases, reinforce their identities-in-practice that align with doing STEM and in some cases made them more inclined to pursue STEM related careers. He also found that enrolled sophomores developed both technical and project management skills that they felt could potentially support them in current and future STEM courses and careers. In addition, the course provided some students with a sense of community and belonging that could make them more likely to continue their STEM studies. Statistical analysis of SSU institutional data by WestEd found that \"In all cases Sci 220 students were at least 44% more likely to be STEM majors than those not enrolled, controlling for students' declared major at the start of the program.\"</p>\n<p class=\"Default\">Both SSU and USM projects have demonstrated broader impacts through required service-learning projects as well as the use of the facilities by community groups. Service learning is a high-impact strategy that help students feel connected to the campus and to the community, through the formation of partnerships with local (mainly non-profit) organizations. Students also learn project management skills, through the introduction of the Agile framework for planning successive iterations of their projects (\"sprints\"). Community use of the Makerspace has included SSU summer use by middle school students in Excel and a Tinker Academy for eighth grade girls. &nbsp;At USM, considerable work was done to create face masks and shields for COVID-19 prevention, and hundreds were printed and distributed. Additionally, the Makerspace was used to create parts for respirator repair. USM personnel also assisted with the development of a Gastrocutaneous Closure Device (Patent Application Number: 16893380), the creation of a Lung Nodule Educational Tool (Patent Pending), and the development of a Left Ventricular Assist Device pre-insertion training device (Patent Pending).</p>\n<p class=\"Default\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/11/2020<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Lynn&nbsp;Cominsky</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1626917/1626917_10455145_1607652940566_SSU_MS--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1626917/1626917_10455145_1607652940566_SSU_MS--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Sonoma State University Makerspace\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1626917/1626917_10455145_1607652940566_SSU_MS--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Sonoma State University Makerspace\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Sci 220 students in SSU's Makerspace</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Lynn Cominsky</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Lynn&nbsp;Cominsky</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Sonoma State University Makerspace</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1626917/1626917_10455145_1607476795831_MIST_creations--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1626917/1626917_10455145_1607476795831_MIST_creations--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"MIST products\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1626917/1626917_10455145_1607476795831_MIST_creations--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"MIST products\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">USM students utilize a wide range of digital based techniques to generate physical products.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">So Young Han</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Lynn&nbsp;Cominsky</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">MIST products</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1626917/1626917_10455145_1607476914608_IMG_0738(1)--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1626917/1626917_10455145_1607476914608_IMG_0738(1)--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"USM Galileo's Lab students\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1626917/1626917_10455145_1607476914608_IMG_0738(1)--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"USM Galileo's Lab students\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Galileo\ufffds Lab Students utilize spaces for working on open problems.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Jeremy Qualls</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Lynn&nbsp;Cominsky</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">USM Galileo's Lab students</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1626917/1626917_10455145_1607460977064_salois_final_project_S18--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1626917/1626917_10455145_1607460977064_salois_final_project_S18--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Weather station -
