 "awd_abstract_narration": "It has been estimated that the entire world-wide demand for energy will double in the next\r\ntwo decades, therefore it is critical to investigate revolutionary energy technologies\r\nto meet this demand. A potential hydrogen economy is a key player in this market\r\nspace. However, hydrogen as a fuel requires efficient storage materials that retain and release\r\na great deal of hydrogen as desired. This proposal aims to use large scale and accurate quantum\r\nmechanical calculations on an important class of porous hydrogen storage materials: metal-organic\r\nframeworks (MOFs). The research team will study the properties of hydrogen inside of MOFs\r\nand seek to understand their physical properties and how one can design improved MOFs that\r\nshould deliver improved storage of hydrogen per unit weight under reasonable and real-world\r\noperating conditions.\r\n\r\nTo understand and improve MOFs for hydrogen storage applications, it is key to study the microscopic\r\nphysical properties of MOFs that govern hydrogen uptake, release, and diffusion\r\ninside the MOFs. This requires simulation of hydrogen inside of MOFs at the atomistic scale.\r\nThe project propose to perform highly accurate quantum mechanical simulations of hydrogen dynamics\r\ninside of MOFs using first principles density functional theory to describe the electronic\r\nstate of the system coupled to molecular dynamics of the nuclear degrees of freedom including\r\nquantum nuclear effects (via the path integral formalism). The effect due to the quantum\r\nfluctuations of the nuclear degrees of freedom are critical for understanding the binding\r\nand dynamics of light elements such as hydrogen. The project will use this advanced and accurate theoretical\r\nframework to address three questions of key importance to this field: (1) How do quantum\r\nnuclear effects alter hydrogen dynamics inside of MOFs? (2) How do the transition metal atoms\r\nincorporated into the MOF structure change the hydrogen binding and dynamics properties and\r\nwhich metals are best for real-world applications? (3) How does the flexibility and temperature-dependent\r\nfluctuations of the MOF framework affect hydrogen storage?\r\n\r\nThe scientific outcomes of this research will be of interest and importance to researchers\r\nstudying MOFs and hydrogen storage. The aim is to provide useful understanding and information\r\nthat may lead to the creation of materials that will help create a hydrogen economy. The\r\nresults of the work will be published in high quality journals, presented widely at international\r\nconferences, and form the basis for outreach events to the broader public in order to elevate\r\ngeneral interest in science and technology as well as how simulations and computations can\r\naddress important real-world problems. Junior researchers carrying out the research work\r\nwill be trained in the use of advanced computational methods, attendant software infrastructures,\r\nand materials design approaches that are all highly useful skills in the twenty-first century.",
