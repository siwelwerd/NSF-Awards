 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to enable more effective design and use of virtual worlds. Virtual worlds are important in many domains, including architecture, education, medicine, simulation, and training. However, when compared to the real world, virtual worlds are hard to move through effectively, and pose challenges to effective navigation. If virtual worlds are going to be widely deployed - particularly for applications in education, training, and simulation - then these problems must be solved. This work will generate essential discoveries improving the process of wayfinding (orienting and navigating from place to place) and locomoting through immersive virtual worlds. It thus provides a critical and synergistic complement to the recent advent of low-cost commodity-level virtual reality equipment.\r\n\r\nThis research is multi-disciplinary and employs methods from computer science, cognitive science, and geographical information science in accomplishing these objectives. A transformation of wayfinding and navigation for large immersive virtual worlds can be accomplished by studying locomotion modes in conjunction with the spatial characteristics of virtual worlds and individual differences and abilities of the users of the virtual environments. In this work, virtual worlds are described and analyzed in terms of their connectivity, visual access, and integration using formal measures summarized as space syntax. Likewise, individuals traveling through virtual worlds may navigate and reason about space quite differently, and these differences can be quantified and measured. The goal is to develop locomotion modes that take into account both characteristics described by space syntax and individual attributes of users.  Truly effective design and use of virtual worlds depend on an understanding of how an individual's abilities relate to the characteristics of the virtual world and the mechanisms for moving about in them. This interdisciplinary approach examines wayfinding and navigation in a multi-factor way, combining a focus on locomotion modes, a focus on spatial syntax (characteristics) of the virtual world, and a focus on the abilities and differences of individual users. In addition to improving the design and use of virtual worlds, this work will impact multiple  disciplines: it not only advances computer graphics and virtual reality, but also informs the fields of cognitive science and geographical information science.",

Virtual reality (VR) that we can now experience using easily accessible headsets is no exception. VR has captured the imagination of scientists, visionaries, educators, and gamers for many decades but is now finally ready to enter the mainstream. While VR has many inherently appealing qualities, we still lack a reliable and empirically validated assessment of whether VR improves learning, which features of VR support understanding a virtual space, and which might be cool but do not deliver improvements. Despite rapid technological developments, VR is also facing challenges such as providing efficient and comfortable movement between different locations. We are used to continuous motion, just like simply walking around the neighborhood. However, a larger virtual world can usually only be explored using tricks that are impossible in the real world, such as teleportation. Teleportation is a feature that allows a user to be at a new location instantaneously. The fantastic additional advantage is that teleportation also reduces cybersickness. So why not always use teleportation? Unfortunately, teleportation is not something that we as humans, or any other species, can use naturally. We do not know how teleportation influences, for example, how we learn the spatial layout of a virtual city. To better understand these effects, we conducted several empirical user studies that provided insights into the impact of different modes of locomotion in VR. Our findings show that although VR is a superb medium for giving users a feeling of being in a place, such as a city, not relying on our accustomed senses poses challenges to virtual experiences that are not easy to overcome. This does not mean that virtual experiences cannot be highly entertaining and motivating, but simply that they also have features that might take a while to get used to.Additionally, we explored more aspects in this project that are not available in the real world, such as giving users a bird's eye perspective on an environment. We know from research on maps that overview perspectives facilitate learning the spatial layout of an environment, so the question was whether giving users access to \"an elevator function\" might help them understand an environment better. We can say with some certainty that users develop a better sense of a place if they have access to an elevated perspective. When they have to memorize the layout of an environment, though, it is essential to look into what we call individual differences. Not everyone learns about an environment in the same way, and understanding different approaches and abilities has been on scientists' radar for quite some time. We looked into this aspect by organizing users into two groups, one that thinks about the environment more in terms of left and right. We call this a relative reference frame.In contrast, some users prefer cardinal direction, and we call this an absolute reference frame. This is not a black-or-white distinction, but we can identify users with a preference. We found that users who favor an absolute reference frame benefit more from an elevated perspective than users who prefer a relative reference frame. These aspects are essential as with the availability of more user data and the development of data analytics for VR, we will be able to tailor experiences to preferences but also the abilities of users.The final aspect to know about this project is that we used the insights we gained from basic research and applied them to education. We collaborated with many educators in geoscience and biology, and we designed learning experiences that were inspired by the findings and ideas we developed in this project. These have been successful collaborations and rewarding experiences that resulted in numerous practical and widely accessible learning experiences and contributed to our ability to quickly react to the constraints imposed by the COVID pandemic on all US universities. As a joint effort, we delivered scientifically informed virtual learning experiences to hundreds of students.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 09/20/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Alexander&nbsp;Klippel</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"></div>\n</div>",
