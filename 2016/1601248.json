 "awd_abstract_narration": "Environmental change alters ecosystems by changing the physical characteristics of a habitat, affecting which organisms can thrive in a given environment. In this graduate student project, research will address the impacts of darkening water in Midwestern lakes on the prevalence of disease in a common miniature crustacean. Lake darkening occurs due to increases in input of plant debris washing into lakes as a result of increased precipitation and storm severity. Lake nutrient levels and the penetration of various wavelengths of light into the water are both affected by the darkening process. The common miniature crustacean known as Daphnia can be parasitized by certain fungi and/or bacteria.  This project will examine the mechanisms by which lake darkening can affect these parasitic interactions.  It will provide insight into how altering environmental factors can influence disease in lake communities, and will also involve local students in research and fieldwork in south-central Indiana.\r\n\r\nIn order to quantify how lake darkening affects disease dynamics in lakes, for this Doctoral Dissertation Improvement grant, the graduate student will manipulate the darkness of lake enclosures through two treatments: shading and addition of dissolved organic matter. The student will then seed enclosures with local community members (Daphnia hosts, other plankton, and invertebrate predators) and parasite-infected hosts. Abiotic habitat variables (e.g. temperature, pH, oxygen levels), community structure, and disease levels will be measured throughout the course of the ten-week experiment and compared to control enclosures without shading or added dissolved organic matter. Since lake darkening is expected to affect all lake community members either directly or indirectly, it is important to observe and quantify effects of these environmental factors on hosts, disease agents, predators, producers, decomposers, and physical habitat structure. By measuring differences in communities in the different treatments, we will be able to tease apart the mechanisms by which lake darkening affects disease.",

In lakes, floating parasite transmission stages may be particularly susceptible to damage from light if they cannot escape light by swimming deeper. The depth of light penetration varies among lakes due to differing concentrations of dissolved organic matter, which absorbs light and acts as a sunscreen to lake organisms. Importantly, climate change is altering lake clarity, as a result of increases in dissolved organic carbon in lakes, making it especially urgent to understand the impacts of altered water clarity. The goals of this project were to understand how light conditions in lakes affect parasitism in&nbsp;<em>Daphnia</em>&nbsp;host species, which are important members of lake food webs. We conducted a field experiment to understand how a bacterial and a fungal parasite of <em>Daphnia</em> tolerate light conditions in lakes. We incubated spores of each parasite in ambient light or dark conditions in July, August, and November at two different depths in lakes across a gradient of clarity. We also analyzed data from natural epidemics to see if lake clarity influenced epidemic size and timing. We found that both parasites were sensitive to ambient light, with the fungal parasite's sensitivity persisting late into the fall when natural light levels were waning. This contrasted with the sensitivity of the bacterial parasite which was not significantly impacted by the low levels of light in the late fall (Figure 1). Consistent with this, natural epidemics of the less-sensitive bacterial parasite started earlier in the summer when light levels were still intense (Figure 2). In addition, darker lakes had larger epidemics of the bacterial parasite than clearer lakes. Surprisingly, we did not find the same significant trend for the more sensitive fungal parasite. We hypothesize that the lack of a pattern associating epidemic size with lake clarity for the sensitive fungal parasite may be due to the amount of light at relevant depths when the fungal epidemics begin in the fall; this is a topic of ongoing research. Overall, this study shows that light may be an important factor controlling timing and size of parasite epidemics.</p>\n<p>The incubations described above showed that parasites were much more strongly impacted by light when they were incubated near the surface of the lake, as opposed to when they were incubated further below the surface. This raises the question of where parasite spores are naturally found in the water column. Therefore, in a second study, we quantified the densities of free-living spores of parasites at a variety of depths in the water columns of lakes. We developed a molecular assay to detect DNA from parasite spores in water samples. We then quantified parasite spores throughout water columns in three lakes and two months. In addition, we quantified the distribution of hosts to relate host habitat use to risk from parasites to understand where hosts are at most risk of becoming infected. We found that spores are unevenly distributed in the water column, and that hosts migrate, living lower in the water column during the day, where they could have higher contact with parasite spores (Figure 3). Though additional sampling will be necessary to definitively quantify a pattern in spore distributions with depth over time and in lakes with differing clarity, we developed an assay that will make this work possible, and also showed that spores are not uniformly distributed throughout the water column. Understanding parasite distribution with depth -- and the factors that drive that distribution -- can help us predict parasite exposure to light as well as an additional aspect of the risky environment faced by <em>Daphnia</em> hosts.</p>\n<p>The broader impacts of this grant include the training of one PhD student, Clara Shaw, who was the co-PI of this grant.
