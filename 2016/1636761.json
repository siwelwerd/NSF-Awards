  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe ISSI Workshop on \"The Scientific Foundations of Space Weather\".\n\nThe International Space Science Institute (ISSI), Bern, Switzerland organised a Workshop on \"The Scientific Foundations of Space Weather\".  The Workshop was hosted by ISSI on its premises, from 27 June to 1 July 2016.  The proposal provided part-funding of travel costs of the 20 invited US participants to the Workshop. \n\nISSI has organised Workshops on a range of space science, astrophysics and Earth sciences topics since 1995;  following the same format as previous Workshops.  Workshops are initiated by ISSI who invite a group of Convenors from the scientific community.  The Convenors define in detail the topic and objectives of the Workshop and invite about 40 leading scientists to participate.  The program of the Workshop is elaborated by the Convenors.\n\nTypically (as in this case), all participants contribute a talk of 30 minutes on their topic in the coordinated program.  There is time allocated to discussion within the talks, to \"round-table\" overview discussions and off-line informal discussions.  There are no parallel sessions.\n\nThe funding specificity of the Workshops is that ISSI covers the costs of (a) organising and holding the Workshop on its own premises, (b) the hotel accommodation and per diem costs of all participants.  However, participants need to cover their travel costs to and from Bern from their own resources.  ISSI also covers all publication charges arising from the Workshops.\n\nhttp://www.issibern.ch/ ,http://www.issibern.ch/program/workshops.html http://www.issibern.ch/publications/sssi.html\n\nScientific context of the Workshop on \"The Scientific Foundations of Space Weather\"\n\nThere has been considerable progress in solar physics, in the physics of space plasmas and in the physics of the Earth?s magnetosphere and ionosphere in recent decades.  Solar-terrestrial physics had evolved as the discipline that covers studies of solar effects on the Earth?s space environment. \n\n In more recent years, the concept of space weather has developed as both a scientific discipline and, increasingly, a topic that provides a forum to assess the vulnerabilities of the space infrastructure of 21st century human life on Earth from solar disturbances. Therefore space weather research covers more than solar-terrestrial effects as it also includes the physics behind those phenomena that are identified as hazards in space and on the ground. \n\nA key requirement of space weather studies is the understanding of causal chains from the Sun to the terrestrial environment and their quantified predictability. \n\nConvenors for the Workshop\n\nDaniel Baker (University of Colorado, Boulder, USA)\nAndr&eacute; Balogh (Imperial College, London, UK)\nTam&aacute;s Gombosi (University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, USA)\nHannu Koskinen (University of Helsinki, Finland)\nRudolf von Steiger (ISSI, Bern, Switzerland)\nAstrid Veronig (University of Graz, Austria)\n\n\n Objectives\n\nThe science of space weather is effectively a synthesis of solar and near-Earth space phenomena and the causal links from the Sun to the Earth?s neighbourhood.  The objectives of the Workshop will be to review the elements of the physical processes and to identify the way they link to each other to form the causal chains from the Sun to the Earth and thus to assess and review the scientific foundations of Space Weather.\n\nThe specific contribution is expected to be a comprehensive review of the phenomena and their physical relationships to provide the foundations of the scientific modelling of space weather processes.  This is to be achieved in the highly interactive environment of ISSI by leading scientists in the different fields that build up the science of Space Weather.\n\n Topics covered in the 5-day program:\n\n Space weather: what it is, and its most important causal effects (and what?s impacted)\nSolar phenomena driving space weather and their predictability\nPropagation of solar phenomena in the inner heliosphere\nThe geoeffectiveness of solar phenomena\nAnthropogenic space weather effects\nExtreme space weather events\nSpace climate - long term variations in space weather effects\nSpace weather at other planets in the solar system \nWhat can we learn from the activity of sun-like stars \n\n\nWorkshop Product\n\nFollowing the Workshop, its output will be published as a volume in the Space Science Series of ISSI by Springer (61 volumes published or in preparation to date), in parallel with the publication of the papers in Space Science Reviews.  It is expected that a total of about 15 to 20 high-quality, generally multi-authored topical review papers will result, to be submitted to the usual refereeing process and published in the book.  Thus the volume does not simply represent the proceedings of the Workshop, but rather is a carefully composed series of review papers that encompasses the current state of the field.\n\nThe papers will be based on talks presented at the Workshop and will reflect the discussions that are encouraged to be held among the participants during the Workshop, with emphasis on interdisciplinarity.  The Workshop Convenors will also be the Guest Editors of the issue of Space Science Reviews and the volume in the Space Science Series of ISSI.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/16/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Daniel N Baker"
