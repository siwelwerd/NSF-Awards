 "awd_abstract_narration": "The role sensory systems play in mediating an organism?s environment is critical to developing our understanding of how information is perceived and processed.  A potentially new sensory organ, the furcasternal tubercle, was discovered within a family of leaf-dwelling praying mantises (Mantodea, Iridopterygidae) that reside on the undersides of broad-leaf vegetation, a unique ecological niche within Mantodea. This research seeks to uncover the environmental information that the sensory organ encode. The work will be conducted in collaboration with Drs. Marie Herberstein and Kate Barry, prominent researchers in ethology and ecology, at Macquarie University in Sydney, Australia. The characterization of a novel sensory organ will provide further insights into neural systems as they relate to ecological niche specialization.\r\n\r\nPreliminary investigations of the furcasternal tubercle revealed that it is surfaced with a variable number of articulating surface hairs, suggesting a mechanosensory function, and histological sectioning uncovered the presence of neural tissue within the structure. Behavioral and neurophysiological assays will be conducted to determine what behaviors the furcasternal tubercle modulates; extracellular recordings from the neural tissues within the structure will conclusively demonstrate the neural activity generated when the structure is stimulated. This research seeks to uncover the furcasternal tubercle?s physiological role within the context of the group?s unique habitat use.    \r\n\r\nThis award under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the Australian Academy of Science.",

The main objective of this project was to collect neuroethological data on this organ to determine if it is sensory, which entailed collecting and observing living Iridopterygidae specimens in Australia, performing behavioral experiments on specimens, and conducting extracellular recordings. Specimens were collected in the rainforests of Kuranda and Daintree, Queensland, Australia, using common techniques for capturing mantises, including sweep netting and light trapping. Specimens were frequently collected on broadleaf vegetation, including Eucalyptus and Singapore Daisy. These specimens were stored in 50-milliliter vials and transported to Macquarie University for behavioral and neuroethological experiments. Following the collection of Iridopterygidae praying mantises, the various behaviors of the mantises were recorded with high-resolution videography. Such behaviors included predation, rest, flight, and mating attempts. Specimens were filmed with both an intact or removed organ to determine if there would be differences between specific behaviors or posture in intact and ablated specimens. The results from these experiments demonstrated that no significant behavioral change occurred following the removal of the organ. To determine if the organ responded to external mechanical stimuli, extracellular recordings of the neural tissue comprising the organ were performed. These recordings were conducted using ultrafine nichrome wire electrodes using a SpikerBox&trade;, a travel amplifier that enables researchers to see and hear action potentials. These preliminary recordings demonstrated that the sensory system responded to external stimuli. While targeted investigations of the organ are needed to determine the specific function of the organ within the context of the organism and its environment, these results confirms our preliminary hypothesis that the organ responds to sensory input. Preliminary data collected on this project was incorporated into a neuroscience course at Case Western Reserve University&nbsp; (NEUR 424). This research was presented as a case study for students to develop neuroethological techniques to test various hypotheses as to the organ&rsquo;s possible function in the context of the ecology of the possessor mantises. Using Environmental Scanning Electron Microscopy, we have captured the morphological variety of the organ across the Iridopterygidae lineage.
