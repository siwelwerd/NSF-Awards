 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposal aims to identify the chemical structure of glomalin, a complex molecule produced in large quantities by members of a special group of fungi that grows on plant roots in soil. Glomalin is ubiquitous, abundant, and exhibits a profound impact on soil physical properties and carbon content. Production and degradation of glomalin could also impact the fertility and long-term carbon storage potential of soil. Surprisingly, a remarkable lack of knowledge concerning the form, structure and variability of this important molecule currently exists. By elucidating the chemical structure of glomalin (and its variants), this early concept for exploratory research (EAGER) proposal will yield potentially transformative results in the fields of fungal biology and soil science. One postdoctoral scientist and several undergraduate students will also be trained on sophisticated techniques in protein chemistry and fungal biology as part of this exciting and important project.\r\n \r\nThe structure of glomalin sensu stricto will be examined in the hyphal biomass of Rhizophagus intraradices as well as in representatives of the genera Glomus, Rhizophagus, Claroideoglomus, Diversispora, Gigaspora, and Acaulospora within the Glomeromycota. Axenic cultures will be grown in a dual compartment system to obtain plant-free hyphal biomass. The cell wall glycoprotein fraction will be subjected to SDS-PAGE and/or 2D gel electrophoresis and the separated bands/spots will be used for structural elucidation. A fraction of each band/spot will be enzymatically deglycosylated to identify the site of the N-glycan followed by HPLC to identify the N-glycan structure, and LC/MS/MS to identify the primary amino acid backbone composition. The O-glycan site and composition will be identified from the LC/MS/MS fragmentation pattern. A second fraction of each band/spot will be used for identifying the occurrence of a GPI-anchor at the C-terminus. We hypothesize that: glomalin sensu stricto in Rhizophagus intraradices is not a single peptide but will consist of multiple peptides with distinct N-, and O-glycosylation patterns, as well as GPI anchoring sites (H1). We further hypothesize (H2) that comparison of glomalin sensu stricto structures between various Glomeromycota genera will reveal a universal backbone of conserved peptide moieties reflecting a single ancestral evolutionary origin in the phylum, and that variations in glycosylation patterns and amino acid sequences identified will reflect the subsequent distinct evolutionary trajectories within various Glomeromycota lineages.",

One of the most important plant-fungal symbiotic relationships is the one occurring between the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), and plants. The AMF have developed an obligate symbiotic lifestyle, where they grow and propagate in and on the surface of plant roots. It is estimated that approximately &sim;80% of terrestrial plants harbor AMF species on their roots.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Far from being a simple case of scientific oddity, the AMF-plant symbiosis represents one of the most significant symbiotic relationships in nature. In broad terms, the relationship involves transfers of fixed organic carbon from the plant and soil-derived nutrients from the fungi. AMF penetrate plant roots and form arbuscules, coiled hyphae, and intraradical mycelium inside the root cells. Outside the plant, extraradical mycelium extends meters away and plays important roles in nutrient (phosphorous, nitrogen, and zinc in particular) uptake.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>While the importance of AMF-plant symbiosis is undisputed, our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of AMF-host interaction and those enabling AMF propagation is currently incomplete. In this proposal, we hypothesized that these types of interactions could best be investigated by using a proteomics approach, where the identity of proteins identified during AMF growth is determined and analyzed to understand the specific pathways/processes enabled fungal growth on plant root. To this end, we used a specialized procedure enabling the establishment and scaling up of a culture of a model AMF species (<em>Rhizophagus irregularis</em>) in the laboratory on Chicory roots. The total proteins, and protein-sugar complexes (glycoproteins) were subsequently extracted from these slowly growing AMF cultures (requiring 18-20 weeks for growth). The mixtures of secreted proteins were subsequently separated using chromatography, and their identity determined using mass spectroscopy.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Using this approach, we identified 474 <em>Rhizophagus irregularis</em> proteins expressed when grown in the laboratory. Four important findings were gleaned from the detailed analysis of proteins identified: First, we document a high level of signal transduction proteins expressed by <em>R. irregularis.</em> Forty-seven proteins (9.9% of total, 21.4% of proteins with known function) mediating signal transduction were identified. The relative proportion of signal transduction proteins within <em>R. irregularis</em> proteome is much higher than values reported in non-host associated fungi, suggesting the importance of signal transduction for AMF symbiotic growth.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Second, we report a large proportion of hypothetical proteins in <em>R. irregularis </em>proteome:<em> </em>A total of 254 (53.6%) of <em>R. irregularis</em> proteins identified had no assigned function. This value is much higher than the percentage of predicted hypothetical proteins in non-symbiotic fungal genomes. Remarkably, the absolute majority (218 protein; 85.8%) of these hypothetical proteins were specific to the phylum Glomeromycota with no hits outside the phylum, clearly suggesting the involvement of novel types of pathways in AMF-plant symbiosis.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Third, our results does not support a previously hypothesis AMF promote soil health and aggregation by the production of copious amounts of cell wall proteins (collectively known as glomalin-related surface protein; GRSP) that sloughs off to the soil and form the basis for additional particle aggregation and improvement of soil organic carbon content. We could not identify putative candidates for glomalin production in our proteomic datasets, and all of our candidate surface/transmembrane proteins were not produced in exceptionally high levels.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Fourth, our comparative proteomic analysis identified<strong><em> </em></strong>a core set of pathways and processes involved in AMF growth on plant roots. We compared the results obtained in this study to the few available less extensive prior studies conducted on other AMF species (<em>Rhizophagus intraradices and Gigaspora margarita), </em>and identified the following core pathways as consistently expressed in all studies: Fatty acid beta-oxidation, TCA cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, Gluconeogenesis, Chromatin remodeling, DNA replication and repair, protein synthesis, and Protein turnover. As such, we posit that these four pathways are important for AMF growth and propagation on plant roots.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The results from this project were submitted, and accepted for publication, in the Journal fungal biology.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In addition to research activities, the proposal has contributed to the development of an educated US workforce by training a graduate student, a post doc, and several undergraduate students.
