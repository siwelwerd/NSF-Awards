This week-long meeting will be preceded by a Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) on the same topic, July 23-24, 2016. The GRS promotes the inclusion and participation of younger researchers (graduate students and postdoctoral scientists), both in their own GRS forum and also at the GRC meeting afterwards. Both the GRS and the GRC will focus on the small scale behavior of materials, with an emphasis on the tools used to measure and study behavior at these scales. The conference and seminar are immersive and interactive. A broad impact on knowledge dissemination, stimulation of new research and cooperation is expected, particularly for young scientists.\r\n\r\nThis GRC will explore how micromechanical measurements can be combined with complementary techniques for materials characterization at the same length-scales, to  facilitate a comprehensive understanding of mechanical behavior of materials. Furthermore, by recognizing that the mechanical response of bulk materials is mediated by mechanisms and microstructures at the nanometer and micron length-scales, the importance of bridging small scale observations to macro-scale predictions will be emphasized.",
