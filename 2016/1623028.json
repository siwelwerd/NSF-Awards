(See http://www.math.wustl.edu/~kuffner/WHOA-PSI.html.) Post-selection inference is relevant to virtually all areas of statistical application. Higher-order asymptotics provides the tools and insights needed to refine basic large-sample results for post-selection inference procedures, and make them more accurate in the practically realistic setting of small to moderate sample sizes. WHOA-PSI seeks to merge these fields, foster collaboration and discussion, and push forward the post-selection inference research frontier in the direction of higher-order accuracy for inference procedures. NSF funding will provide travel support for junior researchers to attend this conference.\r\n\r\nWashington University will host a workshop on higher order asymptotics and post-selection inference September 30 ? October 2, 206. Speakers include Brad Efron, Jianqing Fan, and Rob Tibshirani. This workshop attempts to address the needs of applied statisticians utilizing model selection procedures who also need extremely accurate inference procedures. The workshop will begin with tutorials on the main topics. This award provides funding for junior researchers to attend the conference.",

The primary scientific goal of the workshop was to improve the accuracy of existing methods of post-selection inference, and to use insights from other inferential problems to develop new methods for inference after model selection which are valid, accurate, and powerful.

Participants attended tutorials on both higher-order asymptotics and post-selection inference, given by the PI. The research program gave participants the opportunity to learn about the frontier of statistical inference methodology.
