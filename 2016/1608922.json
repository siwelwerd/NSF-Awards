 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is jointly funded by the LIGO Research Program (Physics Division) and the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR). This is an exciting time for the maturing field of gravitational-wave physics. Construction of Advanced LIGO (the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory), an overhaul of the Initial LIGO interferometers, is now complete and the first couple months of data have been collected. The advanced detectors made last year the first direct detection of gravitational waves, a momentous event that will transform our understanding of the universe and marks the beginning of a new field of gravitational wave astronomy. Predicted by Einstein nearly 100 years ago, gravitational waves are distortions of space-time created by the movements of massive astrophysical objects such as exploding stars and coalescing black holes or neutron stars. The effect of gravitational waves on space-time is minuscule, however, and necessitates the design and construction of detectors that push the limits of precision measurement techniques. This award supports research to improve the Advanced LIGO sensitivity at low frequencies and increase the amount of time the detector is collecting science quality data. In addition, this program will serve as an invaluable training ground for undergraduate and graduate students who will develop scientific skills from a diverse set of disciplines and prepare them to fill positions in academia and industry. The group is strongly committed to sharing the excitement of the field with the public through outreach at all levels, reaching out in particular to the communities in Mississippi.\r\n\r\nGravitational waves can be detected by using laser light to measure infinitesimal changes in the distance between mirrors located two-and-a-half miles (4 km) away from one another. The mirrors are suspended as pendulums to isolate them from all vibrations other than the gravitational wave. The Advanced LIGO detectors have achieved a sensitivity to changes in the distance between the mirrors of better than one-ten-thousandth the diameter of a proton. There nonetheless remain many challenges to further improve the interferometers in order to increase the rate of gravitational wave detections and expand the spectrum of astrophysical objects that can be observed. One such challenge arises from the design of the commercial seismometers that are used to provide active vibration isolation of the mirrors. The seismometers cannot distinguish between horizontal acceleration of the ground and tilt of the ground. This award supports the development of a high precision tilt-free seismometer to improve the Advanced LIGO seismic isolation. The project includes deriving updated requirements for a tilt-free seismometer based on data from the observatories, designing and modeling the instrument, constructing and measuring the performance of the tilt-free seismometer and conducting a theoretical and experimental noise analysis of the system.",

Using laser light to measure infinitesimal changes in the distance between mirrors located 4 km away from one another, the Advanced LIGO detectors&nbsp;are the most precise rulers in the world and have already produced countless scientific impacts, most notably through the landmark first direct detection of gravitational waves from coalescing black holes in 2015. Yet there nonetheless remain many challenges to further improve these laser interferometers in order to increase the rate of gravitational wave detections and to expand the spectrum of astrophysical objects that can be observed.</span><span class=\"EOP SCXW21722209 BCX0\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"OutlineElement Ltr  BCX0 SCXW21722209\">\n<p class=\"Paragraph SCXW21722209 BCX0\" lang=\"EN-US\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\"><span class=\"TextRun SCXW21722209 BCX0\" lang=\"EN-US\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">One such challenge lays in preventing noises that arise from the seismic isolation system from both disturbing the&nbsp;amount of time each detector is in observation mode and from disturbing their sensitivities to gravitational waves at frequencies below 20 Hz. All ground-based gravitational wave detectors employ elaborate seismic isolation systems specifically for the purpose of decoupling the optics from the motion of the ground beneath them, but they have limitations. The quality of the active isolation provided by sensors (accelerometers) and actuators that control the tables from which the mirrors are suspended depends on the noise of the sensors and the decoupling of degrees of freedom. This award supported the development of new hardware and control techniques for improving the seismic isolation system of the Advanced LIGO detectors.&nbsp;</span><span class=\"EOP SCXW21722209 BCX0\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"OutlineElement Ltr  BCX0 SCXW21722209\">\n<p class=\"Paragraph SCXW21722209 BCX0\" lang=\"EN-US\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\"><span class=\"TextRun SCXW21722209 BCX0\" lang=\"EN-US\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\"><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXW21722209 BCX0\">The intermediary objectives evolved over the course of the project.

Although this work trained many graduate and undergraduate students and resulted in a peer-reviewed publication, it became clear that we were perfectly posed to achieve a greater scientific impact on a much faster timescale by shifting course in our approach.

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe minuscule effect that gravitational waves from distant astrophysical sources have on the rigid fabric of spacetime has necessitated the design and construction of detectors that push the limits of precision measurement techniques. Using laser light to measure infinitesimal changes in the distance between mirrors located 4 km away from one another, the Advanced LIGO detectors are the most precise rulers in the world and have already produced countless scientific impacts, most notably through the landmark first direct detection of gravitational waves from coalescing black holes in 2015. Yet there nonetheless remain many challenges to further improve these laser interferometers in order to increase the rate of gravitational wave detections and to expand the spectrum of astrophysical objects that can be observed. \n\n\nOne such challenge lays in preventing noises that arise from the seismic isolation system from both disturbing the amount of time each detector is in observation mode and from disturbing their sensitivities to gravitational waves at frequencies below 20 Hz. All ground-based gravitational wave detectors employ elaborate seismic isolation systems specifically for the purpose of decoupling the optics from the motion of the ground beneath them, but they have limitations. The quality of the active isolation provided by sensors (accelerometers) and actuators that control the tables from which the mirrors are suspended depends on the noise of the sensors and the decoupling of degrees of freedom. This award supported the development of new hardware and control techniques for improving the seismic isolation system of the Advanced LIGO detectors.  \n\n\nThe intermediary objectives evolved over the course of the project. Our initial approach had been to design and develop a tilt-free seismometer that could replace the tilt-contaminated commercial seismometers used for the active vibration isolation of the mirrors. Although this work trained many graduate and undergraduate students and resulted in a peer-reviewed publication, it became clear that we were perfectly posed to achieve a greater scientific impact on a much faster timescale by shifting course in our approach. Rather than continue with the development of new hardware, we sent a graduate student and a postdoc to the LIGO Livingston Observatory to develop and commission a new seismic isolation control scheme, called ?Earthquake Mode?, that could be implemented immediately.  \n\n\nDuring the first two observing runs, both the Livingston and Hanford Observatories spent 25% to 30% of the time out of observation mode for various unplanned reasons. One of the contributors to this downtime was large earthquakes. By designing a new filter and control scheme to allow the seismic isolation platforms to move together during times of increased ground motion due to earthquakes while suppressing differential motion, we set a milestone in the ability of the Advanced LIGO detectors to cope with large ground motion induced by earthquakes. The use of \"Earthquake Mode\" during the O3b observing run (Nov. 2019 - Mar. 2020) increased LLO's observing time by about 80 hours, resulting in more gravitational wave detections than would have otherwise been made. \n\n\nThe description of \"Earthquake Mode\" and the resulting improved up-time of the Advanced LIGO detectors was published in the peer-reviewed journal Classical and Quantum Gravity as the major output of this grant. Our work also uncovered some previously unidentified noise couplings within the seismic isolation system and has paved the path for future improvements that will further increase the duty cycle of the detectors and their sensitivity to gravitational waves.  \n\n\n\nThis project, through all of its stages, involved close collaboration with colleagues at Stanford University, MIT and the LIGO Laboratory. A total of 3 high school students, 4 undergraduate students, 2 masters students, 1 PhD student, and 1 postdoctoral researcher contributed to the project. They all benefitted from it in many ways, from the first-hand experience of what it means to be a scientist to the training and professional development it enabled. The project provided countless opportunities for students of all levels and backgrounds to engage in hands-on laboratory projects, calculations and modeling. Each student gave presentations at local and/or international conferences, the more senior students received guidance on how to supervise their younger peers, and everyone participated in public outreach events. \n\n\nDuring the course of this award, the PI sought every opportunity to increase public understanding of this work and communicate the exciting groundbreaking research to the next generation of students. She gave countless public talks and radio interviews, developed new pedagogical materials about the design of gravitational wave detectors and co-authored a book chapter. She co-hosted a workshop for HS physics teachers in Mississippi, judged science fairs and co-founded the first Women in Physics club at the U. of Mississippi. Through this award, we not only contributed to improving our understanding of the universe, but also helped create a more informed society and the next generation of scientists. \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/26/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Katherine Dooley"
