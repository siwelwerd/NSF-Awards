Topics to be addressed include among other Fundamental Studies and Modeling of Epitaxial Processes, Wide-Bandgap Group-III Nitride Materials and Devices, III-V Semiconductors and Devices, Narrow Bandgap Materials and Devices, II-VI Materials and Devices, Growth of Nanowires, Nanostructures and Low-dimensional Structures, There will be both invited talks and contributed presentations. The conference will provide, networking opportunities and intellectual stimulation for graduate students, Post-Doctoral Fellows and all attendees. It is expected that the venue will attract a significant number of members of underrepresented groups in STEM. The proceedings will be published in a journal which receives wide electronic distribution.",
