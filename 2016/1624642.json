 "awd_abstract_narration": "Narragansett Bay is one of the world?s best-studied estuaries and research conducted by the numerous institutions, state and federal agencies in the region has led to considerable understanding of the normal functioning of a temperate marine ecosystem. Roger Williams University (RWU) is a primarily undergraduate institution with a water-front campus from which all of Narragansett Bay and its tributaries are easily accessible by boat. In addition to an active field-based research program of their own, RWU collaborates extensively with other institutions, relying on their current fleet of two small vessels. All of Narragansett Bay and its tributaries are easily accessible by boat from the Roger Williams University campus. Their faculty sample and conduct research throughout the region, often extending beyond Narragansett Bay into the ocean for studies involving the RI coastal ponds and the offshore islands (e.g., Cuttyhunk, Block). Over a dozen fixed field-project locations are maintained that include experimental shellfish beds and oyster flats constructed as part of long-term restoration and shore/habitat stabilization efforts. Projects such as these engage the broader public, state agencies, commercial fishermen and aqua-culturists, and students participate with faculty and staff in all of these efforts. Additional information on current research projects is available at ceed.rwu.edu.\r\n\r\nIn addition to RWU, a large contingent of research programs work the Narragansett Bay estuary system. These include the University of Rhode Island (URI), Brown University, UMass Dartmouth, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, Marine Biological Laboratory, Salve Regina College, Rhode Island College as well as numerous federal and state governmental agencies. RWU often collaborates with these institutions, frequently in the form of providing water access as projects dictate. There is continuing demand for this on-the-water research capacity, which RWU tries to accommodate where possible with its two current vessels (24' Romarine and a 19' open skiff). This award enhances regional research capacity through the acquisition of a third RWU vessel capable of 1) doubling passenger capacity on a given cruise (12 plus crew instead of the current six), 2) providing increased open deck space for gear deployment, 3) enhancing fuel efficiency through the inclusion of an inboard diesel engine, 4) reducing scheduling conflicts for boat time, 5) supporting the development of new undergraduate courses in small boat handling, boat operations and maintenance, and 6) supporting SCUBA research diving. RWU recently initiated a formal dive program in collaboration with the University of Rhode Island, and will offer a scientific research diving course for the first time in the fall of 2016. The vessel of choice for this is a 30' Island Hopper configured with open deck space and a dive platform. Commonly used as local dive boats, these vessels are built by Sea Hawk Boats of Sebring, FL; are coast guard certified and are well regarded for their stability and construction.",

The construction contract was signed on 10/11/2016 and the university took delivery of the vessel on 4/19/2017.

This will greatly improve our ability to access and sample local waters while enhancing all of our program offerings. We anticipate that the vessel will complete the Coast Guard inspection process by the end of September, 2017. At that time, we will begin to incorporate it into our program &ndash; numerous class sampling trips have already been scheduled for later this fall.
