 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project will be the use of degradable natural product-based materials for the reduction of pollution stemming from lost and discarded plastic goods in the environment. Natural product-based polycarbonates have significant potential environmental and societal impact, as they are made from natural products, reducing the dependency of polymeric materials on petroleum-based feedstocks.  Another advantage of these polycarbonate materials is that upon degradation, they reproduce natural products and carbon dioxide, giving the potential for environmental resorption.  The commercial potential of degradable polymer materials is extensive when they can be produced rapidly and have broadly-tunable mechanical properties, allowing for their use in a diverse range of commercial products, from disposable food containers to high performance engineering materials.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project involves a safe, sustainable solution to the challenge of durable plastic materials that can foul and damage marine and other environments.  This I-Corps technology involves the use of abundant natural products to produce polymer networks and composite materials having a range of physical and mechanical properties, and a programmed disintegration pathway.  Synthetic strategies have been developed to transform glucose, quinic acid, and other natural products into multi-functional monomers that can be rapidly polymerized using photochemically- or thermally-initiated crosslinking to afford unique polycarbonate materials.  Through the use of molds during crosslinking, these materials can be fabricated into many shapes and sizes.  Polycarbonates with mechanical characteristics from a rubbery elastomer to a rigid plastic can be achieved by varying the crosslinking conditions.  Hydrolytic degradation times can be tuned, depending on the crosslink density and hydrophilicity.  These materials have also demonstrated no negative effects on the growth of cells.  In summary, a combination of simple fabrication techniques and rapid, reliable chemistry can be employed to obtain a versatile and non-toxic natural family of materials with a breadth of physical and mechanical properties, generating commercial promise in a wide range of applications.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nPlastics are of critical importance to every aspect of human life, from the clothes that we wear to the tires on which we drive and the packaging for most consumer goods.  Far too often, the full life cycle of these plastic products is not considered, including the source materials for their manufacture and their ultimate fate in landfills, waterways, and marine environments.  Although nature has several examples of engineering-type construction materials (e.g. cellulose, chitin, etc.) that are degradable, resorbable and recyclable, most synthetic materials are synthesized from petrochemicals and non-degradable, allowing them to persist for potentially thousands of years after being discarded.  The technology in this project involved chemistry techniques to incorporate sugars into plastics with carbonate linkages so that they can degrade by reaction with water to regenerate the sugar building blocks and carbon dioxide after their useful lifetime.  The focus of this project was to determine the commercial potential of this technology through the process of customer discover and business model generation.  Through the customer discovery process, several aspects of the business model were explored.  A business thesis was created and revised throughout the program, an ecosystem diagram was created, and a market size of 5.6 million anglers (valued at $300 million annually) was determined.  We learned valuable information about potential customers as well, including the development of customer archetypes for economic buyers, end users, and influencers as well as the important customer relationships, \"get, keep, grow\" strategies, and the lifetime value of customers.  The results of the customer discovery process were disseminated in 9 presentations during the summer cohort.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/10/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Karen L Wooley"
