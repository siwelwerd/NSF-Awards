 "awd_abstract_narration": "Coastal Louisiana is currently experiencing net sea level rise at rates higher than most of the world's coastlines and within the global range predicted to occur in the next 65 - 85 years, making Louisiana an ideal site to study potential future impacts of rising sea level on coastal systems. This project will use field collection and controlled tank experiments to study the changing organic carbon cycle resulting from erosion of marsh soils along with its impact on associated biogeochemical processes. The hypothesis tested in this study is that the majority of eroded soil organic carbon is converted to carbon dioxide (CO2) and released to the atmosphere, representing an addition to the anthropogenic input of CO2. This process has not been quantified and could be an important missing component in predictive models of atmospheric CO2 changes. While this process may be of only regional importance today in comparison to other sources of CO2, this study of the Louisiana coast will greatly enhance our full understanding of the potential impacts on the global carbon cycle that may result from coastal erosion as global sea level continues to rise.\r\n\r\nThe project will train graduate and undergraduate students in interdisciplinary research involving marine and wetland biogeochemistry, microbiology, and ecological modeling. It will also fund development of an interactive, educational display on the loss of coastal wetlands for the Louisiana Sea Grant's annual Ocean Commotion educational event attended by area middle and high school students, teachers, and parents. Results from this study may also inform community planners both regionally and worldwide as they prepare for sea level rise in coastal communities.\r\n\r\nEustatic sea level rise and regional subsidence have created a much greater rate of coastline loss in Louisiana than is being experienced in most of the world's coastal regions, reaching global rates that are predicted to occur worldwide in 65 - 85 years. This provides a unique potential to extrapolate data from Louisiana's changing coastal carbon cycle to both regional and global models of the future impact of sea level rise and coastal erosion. By quantifying and modeling the importance of CO2 emissions resulting directly from mineralized soil organic matter from eroding coastlines, a missing element can be added to climate change models. The PIs here plan to investigate the fate of the coastal wetland carbon pool as it erodes using field sampling, laboratory analysis, mesocosm manipulations, and the creation of a coupled physical-biogeochemical model for the basin being studied. Beyond quantifying increased CO2 emission, the PIs will also address the potential for increased eutrophication due to input of nutrients from eroded soils, as well as the potential for future contribution to existing hypoxic zones in the northern Gulf of Mexico that result from excessive nutrient input from the Mississippi River watershed.",

Wetlands, while only about 5% of the land area, store 1/3 of all soil carbon.&nbsp; Although many scientists focus on soil carbon near the surface, this research highlights the vast amount of soil carbon at depth in coastal wetlands. Understanding the amount and type of carbon stored in coastal wetland soils down as deep as 2 m is important because the combination of sea level rise, large storms (e.g., hurricanes), and wind driven waves are rapidly eroding many wetlands. We sought to quantify wetland erosion in coastal Louisiana, including the properties of the eroding soils (carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorous content) and their fate following submergence. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Key findings from this project include: 1) The wetlands of Barataria Bay, LA are eroding at an average rate of 1.4 m per year, causing about 850 years of previously sequestered and stored soil carbon to break-apart and submerge into the coastal bay. 2) Based on comparative analysis of the properties of the eroded wetland soils and the sediments in the bay, the wetland soils are not being re-buried in the coastal zone, but rather are transported and transformed, including being broken-down by naturally occurring microbes. 3) Contrary to expectation, the mid-depths of soil (e.g., 50-100 cm) were the most carbon-rich and the most vulnerable to microbial break-down, which releases the stored soil carbon as carbon dioxide. 4) Bioavailable nitrogen and phosphorous was 7-11 times more abundant deep within the soil (e.g., 130-140 cm) when compared to the surface of the soil. These key findings suggest the erosion of large areas of coastal wetlands can serve as a climate change feedback where previously buried soil carbon is released into coastal water and the atmosphere as carbon dioxide, thus contributing to climate change. Moreover, the large amount of nitrogen and phosphorous stored in the eroding soils is also released into the coastal zone during wetland erosion and could contribute to Gulf of Mexico eutrophication and hypoxia.</p>\n<p>Additional knowledge gain through this research has advanced the understanding of the properties of deep organic coastal wetland soil deposits. For example, we show limited evidence that microbial processing of soil organic matter increases with age (depth), but rather the degradability and nutrient quality of the soil is more closely related to the history of the site, such as large shifts in water flow patterns and plant communities. We also differentiated coastal wetland loss caused by edge erosion for that caused by the formation of open water ponds in the interior of a wetland, referred to as ?peat collapse.? We posit that vegetation stress due to chronic or acute disturbance is a precursor to interior wetland loss, while edge erosion increases as the duration of wind-driven waves increases and undercuts unconsolidated soils beneath the root zone.</p>\n<p>Through this project, at least four graduate students were trained in cross-disciplinary science, as well as several undergraduate researchers.
