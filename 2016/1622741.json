 "awd_abstract_narration": "Traumatic brain injury is a leading cause of death and disability in the United States. Over 1.7\r\nmillion people sustain a brain injury each year and make up one-third of all injuries seen in the\r\nemergency room. Developing rehabilitation and treatment strategies to manage this disease are\r\nimportant, but preventing the occurrence of brain trauma is also critical component to the solution.\r\nThe goal of this proposal is to reduce the risk of traumatic brain injury through smart technology\r\nthat collects sensory data to predict and characterize head impact in real-time, optimizes protective\r\nmechanisms based on those impact characteristics, and sends impact trauma attributes to a clinical\r\ndatabase for further analysis and injury risk prediction. This technology will substantially improve\r\ntraumatic brain injury prevention and diagnosis in motor vehicle crashes, sports, and industrial\r\naccidents. To accomplish this goal, fundamental research efforts include (1) real-time situational\r\nmonitoring to predict when and how dangerous impacts are about to occur and (2) active\r\nprevention mechanisms to reduce the risk of brain injury impact. Initial evaluation of the\r\ntechnology is in a sports setting, but the system components can be widely adaptive for\r\nimplementation in motor vehicles, industrial safety helmets, and living environments for the\r\nelderly.\r\nThe research goals of this proposal are to (1) reduce the risk of traumatic brain injury through\r\nadvanced situational monitoring, musculoskeletal activation, and impact-specific force reduction;\r\nand (2) to improve potential identification of head injury risk based on multiscale brain\r\ndeformation modeling. These goals are accomplished by integrating four fundamental research\r\nefforts. First, tracking and collision detection algorithms are developed based on radio frequency\r\n(RF) sensing, processing, and flexible antenna design. When used in conjunction with triaxial\r\naccelerometers, gyroscopes, and magnetometers, these algorithms provide the sensing capabilities\r\nrequired to detect objects, capture directional velocity data of surrounding objects, and process\r\ndata in real-time to determine probabilities and characteristics of impending collision. Second,\r\nmusculoskeletal clenching following auditory warning is investigated as a means of minimizing\r\nhead angular acceleration following head or body impact. The development of auditory warning\r\ncues and muscle clench strategies utilizes kinematic musculoskeletal modeling and human subject\r\nstudies to identify required auditory cues and response times as well as muscle activation\r\nparameters that best mitigate head angular acceleration during a collision. Third, active force\r\nreduction specific to impending impact characteristics are implemented using a unique controllable\r\nair-filled bladder. Optimal pressure and deflection characteristics of the bladder are based on\r\nimpact velocity and direction, and evaluated with a novel three-dimensional multiscale finite\r\nelement model of the human head. This model incorporates anatomical variability in the\r\nmicrostructures at the brain-skull interface, a region that is critical to predictions of head injury.\r\nThe fourth fundamental research area uses the multiscale model to investigate the relationship of\r\nhead impact force and acceleration to regional deformation of brain tissue upon impact. These\r\nstudies will be used to improve predictions of TBI risk from impact kinematics.",
