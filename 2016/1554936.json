 "awd_abstract_narration": "This effort will improve the ability to model aerosol properties in the atmosphere. It combines thermodynamic modeling and experimental studies to better understand water uptake by particles and the interactions of gases, solid and liquid aerosols, and water in the Earth's atmosphere.  Project results will benefit climate and air quality models and improve our ability to predict ambient concentrations of particulate matter.\r\n\r\nThe specific project outcomes expected are: (1) a parameterized predictive model for equilibrium internal structure of atmospheric aerosol particles (internally mixed, nodule, or core-shell) in complex multicomponent systems across the entire range of particle liquid water content or gas phase relative humidity; and (2) a novel microfluidic platform for mimicking and investigating aqueous-organic and aqueous-vapor interfaces which will yield valuable data for improving the parameterizations used in predictive models.",

Energy and U uses exciting demonstrations to teach the first law of thermodynamics to thousands of grade school students in the Twin Cities metro area each year. In addition, the PI designed and presented an AAAR tutorial entitled \"Aerosol Measurements with Microfluidics\", including hands on demonstration of microfluidic flows.  We also published a review introducing the aerosol science community to the broad range of tools and platforms available on microfluidic platforms for use in aerosol science measurements and technologies.
