Newark.  The ICP-OES would support research in environmental geochemistry that requires the ability to determine elemental concentrations in natural samples with low detection limits (ppm-ppb) and high precision.   The investigators include early career faculty and an underrepresented geoscientist and the acquisition will support focused efforts to broaden the participation of underrepresented students in geoscience research through experiential learning in analytical geochemistry with relevance to issues of urban sustainability.\r\n\r\nResearch on trace metal interactions with a phosphate mineral precipitate (struvite) produced from human waste and the biogeochemical cycling of trace metals in soils will be facilitated by this acquisition. \r\n\r\n\r\n***",
