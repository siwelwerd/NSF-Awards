North Carolina), Punita Nagpal (co-PI, U. North Carolina), William Gray (PI, U. Minnesota), Michael Blatt (co-PI, U. Glasgow)\r\n\r\n\tThe ultimate goal of the project is to understand how leaf physiology can be controlled to improve plant yield during drought.  Stomata are pores on plant leaves whose regulation balances the demand for carbon dioxide uptake for photosynthesis against excessive water loss through transpiration. A deeper understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms regulating stomatal aperture could result in enhanced function, potentially leading to improved crop yields under drought and other environmental stresses.  Research under this collaborative project will provide training for postdoctoral researchers and undergraduate students in diverse experimental and computational techniques and approaches at the University of North Carolina and University of Minnesota in the U.S. and the University of Glasgow in the U.K. Together with high school teachers, the researchers will also design and implement lesson plans for high school students on stomatal aperture and its relationship to plant water use and drought tolerance.  \r\n\tStomatal movements are critical for optimizing plant growth, and for adapting to changing environmental conditions including water availability, temperature, light, and CO2 levels.  Stomatal opening and closing occur through changes in the turgor and shape of guard cells that flank each stomatal pore, which requires regulated movement of solutes and water across the plasma membrane and the tonoplast (vacuolar membrane).  Mechanisms by which transporter activities are coordinated over the diurnal cycle and in variable environments are incompletely understood.  The project will exploit two recent advances to elucidate stomatal aperture control.  First, SAUR (Small Auxin Up RNA) proteins can promote stomatal opening, in part by regulating PP2C.D phosphatases that target membrane transporters.  Second, computational models developed by the researchers enable simulations of guard cell physiology that can predict and explain effects of altered SAUR or PP2C.D regulation.  A multidisciplinary approach including genetics, biochemistry, electrophysiology, and computational modeling will be used to determine mechanisms by which SAUR and PP2C.D proteins regulate stomatal aperture, whether different members of these families have different activities, and at what times and under what physiological conditions they act.  The combined experimental and modeling approach will lead to understanding of novel mechanisms that regulate stomatal movements and integrate them into existing models of guard cell regulation.  Such insights may suggest synthetic biology approaches to modify stomatal aperture or the kinetics of stomatal responses in crop plants, and enhance predictive models for the effects of environmental change on plant productivity.  \r\n\r\nThis collaborative US/UK project is supported by the US National Science Foundation and the UK Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council.",

These PP2C.D phosphatases function to inhibit cell expansion and SAUR proteins antagonize PP2C.D enzymatic activity to promote cell expansion.  Specifically, PP2C.D phosphatases dephosphorylate, and thereby inactivate, plasma membrane proton ATPases - enzymes that drive the process of cell expansion in plants.  SAUR proteins bind to and inhibit PP2C.D phosphatases, thus keeping the proton ATPases in the phosphorylated, active state to promote growth. This regulatory pathway plays important roles in the control of stem elongation and plant organ growth, both of which are important agricultural traits.\n\n \n\nInterestingly, plasma membrane proton ATPases also play crucial roles in regulating the reversible cell expansion of guard cells on the surface of plant leaves.  Pairs of guard cells, known as stomata, reversibly expand and contract to control the aperture of the stomatal pore - an opening in between the paired guard cells that mediates gas and water exchange between the leaf and the atmosphere. During drought stress, guard cells shrink to close the stomatal aperture to minimize transpirational water loss.  Alternatively, under water replete conditions, guard cells swell, thus opening the stomatal pore to maximize CO2 uptake for photosynthesis.  This project examined the possibility that SAUR and PP2C.D proteins might also regulate plasma membrane proton ATPases to control guard cell dynamics.  Indeed, we identified SAUR and PP2C.D genes that are expressed in guard cells.  We found that overexpression of SAUR proteins in guard cells results in plants with constitutively open stomata.  Consequently, these plants are hypersensitive to drought conditions.  Likewise, pp2c.d phosphatase mutant plants exhibit similar phenotypes.  Reciprocally, plants containing mutations in the SAUR56 and SAUR60 genes, as well as plants overexpressing PP2C.D phosphatases in guard cells exhibit reductions in stomatal aperture and display phenotypes consistent with improved drought tolerance.  Together, these complementary findings indicate that PP2C.D phosphatases play important roles in closing the stomatal pore, and that SAUR proteins antagonize PP2C.D function to promote stomatal opening.

However, ATPases do not appear to be the only target of SAUR/PP2C.D regulation in guard cells, as the regulation of potassium channel activity was also strikingly altered by perturbation of SAUR and PP2C.D function.\n\n \n\nThe above findings have several important implications.  Firstly, they extend our understanding of SAUR-PP2C.D regulatory modules in plants beyond plasma membrane H+-ATPase-mediated growth control.  Secondly, they identify a previously unknown regulatory mechanism that plants employ to regulate stomatal aperture and thereby gas and water exchange. Consequently, future work on SAUR-PP2C.D regulatory modules in guard cells may enable novel strategies for developing crops with improved drought tolerance.  And lastly, SAUR-immune mutant derivatives of PP2C.D phosphatases that were developed as part of this project provide novel tools for manipulating plant organ size and stomatal dynamics.\n\n \n\nThis project supported three PhD-level researchers who received extensive training in plant genetics, molecular and cellular biology, and physiology.  Additionally, one high school teacher from Saint Paul Humboldt HS spent two summers in the lab conducting research and developing teaching modules for her biology curriculum.  Humboldt is a public HS that has a large percentage of low-income students.  83% of the students represent minorities, including ~ 41% African-American.
