 "awd_abstract_narration": "Groundwater contaminant remediation involves removing subsurface contaminants so that they do not pose unacceptable future risks to humans and the environment. While various remediation methods have been developed, they all face a common challenge that the groundwater environment is complex and cannot be fully understood and characterized with limited amount of time and resources. Hence, given the uncertainty in the characterization of the groundwater environment, the challenge is to design a remediation strategy that has the maximum probability of success or equivalently the minimum probability of failure. A common reason for remediation failure is ignoring model uncertainty. Using a single model for remediation design may lead to overconfidence in the predictive capability of the model and thus to increased probability of failure. The proposed research will reexamine the problem of remediation design under model uncertainty by using a multimodel-based data-worth analysis. In other words, multiple models are used to identify and guide the collection of the most valuable data for model evaluation, improvement, and reconstruction. Because of the synthesis between models, remediation designs, and data, the proposed multimodel data-worth analysis for remediation design will provide a transformative platform for scientists, engineers, and decision-makers to systematically investigate all components involved in groundwater remediation. This project will also provide an opportunity for interdisciplinary training of undergraduate and graduate students in the areas of hydrology, computational science, and civil engineering. In addition, the project will engage high school teachers and students in summer schools to gain laboratory and computational experience for understanding the concepts of groundwater contaminant transport and remediation.     \r\n\r\nThe proposed research has two objectives: to reformulate data-worth analysis for groundwater remediation with consideration of model uncertainty, and to break computational barriers between models and model analysis needed for remediation design. To achieve the first objective, a data-worth analysis will be integrated into a framework of multimodel analysis (also known as model averaging), which will be developed into a new procedure for remediation design that will be compatible with the multimodel data-worth analysis. To achieve the second objective, an accurate but cheap-to-evaluate surrogate of the models will be developed and then used for the data-worth analysis and remediation design under uncertainty. The Bayesian approaches (theoretical and computational) will be used for achieving both the objectives. While the proposed method of multimodel Bayesian data-worth analysis is general and can be applied to any remediation method, it will be integrated with the recently developed engineered injection and extraction method, a promising technique for in-situ remediation. The proposed methods will be evaluated in a two-prong strategy using synthetic and real-world modeling problems. The real-world problem involves uranium contamination at the Naturita Site, Colorado, and nitrogen contamination at the Indian River County, Florida. The synthetic study will mimic the real-world problem to the extent possible so that insights gained from the synthetic study can be used directly for the real-world modeling. This project will provide scientific support for on-going environmental remediation and monitoring at the two field sites as well as other contaminated sites.\r\n",

Groundwater contamination poses a threat to not only the environment but also public health. An example problem of groundwater contamination is that caused by per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), as shown in the movie entitled ?Dark Waters?. Many contaminants cannot be degraded or removed in natural environments even after a long period of time. For example, PFAS is called ?forever chemicals?, because it is not naturally degradable.

This project supported three graduate students (two female) and one post-doc, and they received interdisciplinary training when working on the project. The project also published a total of 23 peer-reviewed journal articles, two book chapters, one conference proceeding, and 11 conference abstracts in multiple fields.

We developed a new method of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation for estimating model evidence, which measures plausibility of multiple models.

The relative model score implicitly incorporates the measures of ensemble mean accuracy, prediction interval precision, and prediction interval reliability for evaluating the overall model predictive performance.

The identification methods explicitly consider process model uncertainty, which is referred to the situation that a system process can be represented by several models.

We developed two different design concepts, and evaluated using real-world data and models. The first approach is a model selection approach that helps identify the ?critical models? within the multimodel ensemble, which particularly govern the design process. The other approach is a model aggregation approach that identifies system designs that meet the remediation objectives for all models of the ensemble. Results show that the model aggregation approach is the more conservative option, which results in reliable designs at the expense of higher pumping rates. This study evaluates these two approaches within the context of multi-model simulation-optimization, providing insights on multi-model simulation-optimization in groundwater management.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 01/01/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Ming&nbsp;Ye</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1552329/1552329_10418636_1641077322356_Figure6--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1552329/1552329_10418636_1641077322356_Figure6--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"multimodel remediation design\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1552329/1552329_10418636_1641077322356_Figure6--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"multimodel remediation design\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Four approaches to incorporate multiple conceptual models in a simulation-optimization framework</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Ming Ye</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Ming&nbsp;Ye</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">multimodel remediation design</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1552329/1552329_10418636_1641076651418_Fig2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1552329/1552329_10418636_1641076651418_Fig2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Multiple models and multiple experiments\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1552329/1552329_10418636_1641076651418_Fig2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Multiple models and multiple experiments\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Measured and calibrated breakthrough curves of four models for four experiments of column experiments.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Ming Ye</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Ming&nbsp;Ye</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Multiple models and multiple experiments</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1552329/1552329_10418636_1641076832259_Figure3--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1552329/1552329_10418636_1641076832259_Figure3--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Improved nested sampling\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1552329/1552329_10418636_1641076832259_Figure3--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Improved nested sampling\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Coefficient of variation (CV) of the repeated estimations by NSE_D and NSE_M.
