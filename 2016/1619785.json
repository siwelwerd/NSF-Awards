The goal of NEBEC is to stimulate collaborations and to promote bioengineering research and education programs in the Northeast. The objectives of the meeting are to 1) To identify new collaboration opportunities, 2) To develop a community to share ideas, resources, and technologies, 3) To expose students to exciting research at the cutting edge of biomedical engineering, 4) To encourage students to pursue careers in biomedical engineering, 5), To introduce students to research leaders and encourage interactions, and 6) To stimulate new interactions between research groups in the Northeast.  The theme of the meeting is \"Biomedical Frontiers for the 21st Century.\"   Topics to be addressed include:  3D bioprinting, cell manufacturing, nanomedicine  and scalable nanobiomanufacturing, human brain mapping, neuron science and engineering, stem cells & regenerative medicine, biomaterials, bio-MEMS, organ-on-a-Chip, biomedical devices, biomechanics, systems biology & synthetic biology, tissue engineering and computational biology.   These topics are covered in 3 Platform Sessions: 1) Regenerative Medicine and Advanced Biomanufacturing; 2) Tissue Engineering, Bioimaging and Engineering Biology; 3) Nanomedicine, Biomechanics, and Neuroscience/technology.    A fourth session is designed for student attendees: Career Development in Biomedical Engineering & Biotechnology.   At least 400 attendees from 28 area universities and approximately 20 respected keynote and plenary speakers will participate in the conference.  Workshops will focus on industry participation and public advocacy needed to help translate basic biomedical research into clinical treatments.   The goals of the conference, including the emphasis on student participation and career development, are well matched to programs supported by the Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental and Transport Systems (CBET) Division.",
