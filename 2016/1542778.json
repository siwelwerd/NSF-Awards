 "awd_abstract_narration": "Alley/1542778\r\n\r\nThis award supports a three-year effort to study physical properties of the South Pole ice core to help provide a high-time-resolution history of trace gases and other paleoclimatic indicators from an especially cold site with high preservation potential for important signals. The physical-properties studies include visual inspection to identify any flow disturbances and for identifying annual layers and other features, and combined bubble, grain and ice crystal orientation studies to better understand the processes occurring in the ice that affect the climate record and the ice-sheet behavior. Success of these efforts will provide necessary support for dating and quality control to others studying the ice core, as well as determining the climate history of the site, flow state, and key physical processes in ice.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merits of the project include better understanding of physical processes, paleoclimatic reconstruction, dating of the ice, and quality assurance. Visual inspection of the core will help identify evidence of flow disturbances that would disrupt the integrity of the climate record and will reveal volcanic horizons and other features of interest. Annual layer counting will be conducted to help estimate accumulation rate over time as recorded in the ice core. Measurements of C-axis fabric, grain size and shapes, and bubble characteristics will provide information about processes occurring in the ice sheet as well as the history of ice flow, current flow state and how the ice is flowing and how easily it will flow in the future. Analysis of this data in conjunction with microCT data will help to reveal grain-scale processes. The broader impacts of the project include support for an early-career, post-doctoral researcher, and improved paleoclimatic data of societal relevance. The results will be incorporated into the active program of education and outreach which have educated many students, members of the public and policy makers through the sharing of information and educational materials about all aspects of ice core science and paleoclimate.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe South Pole Ice Core (SPICEcore) is providing a unique window into the history of atmospheric composition, as well as climate and ice flow near the South Pole, from a coordinated suite of measurements.  The physical properties team contributed to the successful outcomes in several ways. \n\nCareful examination of the core and its granular structure shows that the climatic record has not been disrupted by ice-flow processes or in other ways, so that the data collected by all investigators can be used with confidence.  Annual layers are visible in the core, because 24-hour summer sunshine and winter dark produce layers with different characteristics.  The physical-properties visible identification of the annual layers helped, together with chemical, electrical and other data, in the overall effort to learn the age of the samples collected, providing accurate dates for the climatic and trace-gas records extending back into the most recent ice age.  Bubble number-densities measured by the physical-properties team provide insights to the history of past temperatures at the site, agreeing well with indications from other data.  \n\nThe ice core was collected from the flowing mass of the Antarctic ice sheet at the South Pole.  That flow affects various properties of the ice, and in turn is affected by those properties.  Measurements of the size, shape and arrangement of the ice crystals, of their crystallographic orientation, and of the deformation of bubbles can be used to learn about the history and modern state of the ice flow.  The results did not reveal any major surprises, a reassuring result for the whole project, but do provide new details on processes and behaviors of the important ice-flow processes in this region. \n\nMembers of the physical-properties collaboration conducted vigorous efforts in education and outreach, in total making well over 100 public presentations concerning ice, climate and related issues, teaching extensively, and answering questions from reporters and the general public, among other efforts.  Together with published scientific papers, scientific presentations and data sets, this provided broad windows into the effort for the public.   \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/30/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Richard B Alley"
