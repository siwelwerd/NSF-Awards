 "awd_abstract_narration": "NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION\r\nGEOGRAPHY SPATIAL SCIENCES (GSS) PROGRAM\r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\n\r\nThis research project will contribute new knowledge regarding wildfires spread, the physical mechanisms through which they spread, and how wind, topography, and fuel properties affect their propagation.  Observation and analyses of how fast a wildfire front travels is challenging because of the transient, hazardous nature of wildfires and the spatially heterogeneous conditions in which they occur.  The project will enhance capabilities for inferring fire-spread rates and wind speeds by developing a new approach for delineating fire fronts and measuring their movements from precisely aligned airborne thermal infrared images.  These measurements and analyses of fire-spread rates have not been possible at scales that are needed to understand fire behavior and its relationship to factors like fuel properties, topography, and wind.  Outcomes from this research will support more sustainable fire practices.  Measuring and generating knowledge about rates of and controls on wildfire spread will benefit the fire-science and fire-management communities as well as emergency response managers throughout the world.\r\n\r\nWildfire-spread rates are key information requirements for fire suppression and evacuations.  Their measurement and prediction pose a critical scientific challenge.  Observing and analyzing how fast a wildfire front is traveling is challenging due to the transient, hazardous nature of wildfires and the spatially heterogeneous conditions in which they occur.  To address these challenges, the investigators will use airborne thermal infrared imaging to acquire frequent and detailed tracking of moving flaming fronts for an area of chaparral vegetation in southern California.  The flight lines will be aligned along the direction of the flaming front in the vicinity of the maximum spread zone.  Frequent, sequential images captured along flight lines will enable wind speeds to be estimated through image flow analysis techniques.  Segments of the fire line will be analyzed using spatial statistical and geovisualization methods to empirically establish the relationships between the rate of wildfire spread and characteristics or conditions of the vegetation fuels, terrain, and wind at the landscape scale.  Project benefits to the broader community will include better tools to evaluate fire behavior and better estimates of the response of wildfires to fuel conditions and treatments.",

In the past, such measurements were limited to small-scale laboratory or prescribed burn studies, or poorly resolved estimates from airborne or satellite image-based tracking of entire fire perimeters. We estimated ROS by capturing airborne thermal infrared (ATIR) imagery in a repetitive manner (every 5-15 minutes) over the most active segments of spreading fire perimeters. The brightness of ATIR image pixels is primarily related to the heat of approximately 10 m x 10 m areas on the ground. We delineated the locations of active fronts based on the sharp gradient in brightness temperature portrayed on these images, mapped sequential front locations over time, delineated normal fire spread vectors between sequential fronts at regularly spaced intervals, and estimated ROS as the length of spread vectors divided by the time interval between sequential image capture. Sequential ATIR imagery was captured and ROS measured for five wildfire events that occurred in southern and central California from 2016-2018. The most comprehensive imaging mission and analyses of ROS occurred for the Thomas Fire, an extensive wildfire that burned in mostly chaparral shrublands of Ventura and Santa Barbara Counties (California) at the end of 2017.</p>\n<p>By sampling terrain slope (angle and direction) measurements and vegetation fuel characteristics of small patches of ground, called landscape sampling units, through which a portion of a wildfire had spread at an estimated rate, we were able to statistically analyze relationships between slope and fuels with ROS. Terrain slope data were derived from digital elevation models and fuel characteristics were represented by spectral vegetation indices and growth form (e.g. trees, shrubs, herbs and bare ground) cover amounts derived from visible and near infrared aerial imagery. Wind is a key factor associated with ROS but is not directly available with the spatial or temporal detail required for such analyses. Using a variety of statistical and machine learning models that assessed single and multiple terrain and fuel variables relative to ROS variability, we determined that around half of that variability could be explained by directional terrain slope alone and that the relationships were consistent, positive and weakly non-linear. Image-derived fuel variables alone did not account for ROS variability in a statistically significant matter but did when included jointly with terrain slope. ROS magnitudes were substantially greater (and highest for all five study fires) for estimates made where and when high velocity Santa Ana wind conditions occurred during the Thomas Fire than when wind velocities were low. Complementary coupled weather-fire model simulations of fire growth periods&nbsp;throughout the Thomas Fire's first week produced periods of both wind-driven and plume-driven fire behavior with vastly different spread rates.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Project outcomes included an end-to-end image capture and processing flow for making reliable estimates of ROS based on time sequential ATIR imagery. We established a strong theoretical basis for estimating frequency distributions of ROS associated with fire spread episodes and for understanding and reducing errors and uncertainties associated with image registration as well as active front and spread vector delineation procedures. We designed spatial sampling schemes that enabled statistical analyses of ROS relationships with landscape covariates (i.e. fuel and topographic variables).&nbsp;Landscape-level estimates of ROS provide a source of reference data for validating simulation results from fire behavior models. These findings are reported in two published journal articles, one journal manuscript in review, and one other ready for submission.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Study challenges and limitations suggest opportunities for follow-on research. Mobilizing and operating ATIR systems in a timely and responsive manner can be challenging and costly. Smaller aerial platforms and commercial TIR sensors, that are capable of radiometric calibration and not saturating at high temperatures should be explored as a solution. Assuming that fire spread occurs perpendicular to active fire front curves was necessary in order to maintain independence when statistically analyzing ROS relationships with terrain and wind.&nbsp;We are developing and testing geovisualization tools for graphically assessing the validity of that assumption and for analyzing complex relationships between ROS, terrain, and fuels. Our attempts to estimate local winds with sufficient spatial and temporal detail using image flow analysis, weather simulations, and weather station data were not sufficiently successful to quantify wind's impact on ROS. Thomas Fire simulations&nbsp;showed that while some locations experience exceptionally strong local winds, other areas experienced sporadic exposure to surfacing Santa Ana winds. This has implications for understanding and staging measurements in fire events.</p>\n<p>Finally, we encourage the fire science and suppression communities to adopt these sequential ATIR data collection and analysis techniques for natural wildfire events in disparate ecosystem, terrain, and climate types, as well as the establishment of a comprehensive data base for purposes of future fire spread research and model validation.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 01/24/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Douglas&nbsp;A&nbsp;Stow</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1561093/1561093_10417938_1611251740512_DetwilerFireprogresson--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1561093/1561093_10417938_1611251740512_DetwilerFireprogresson--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Detwiler Fire spread progression\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1561093/1561093_10417938_1611251740512_DetwilerFireprogresson--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Detwiler Fire spread progression\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Fire spread sequence for Detwiler Fire.
