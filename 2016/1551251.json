This is the first time that the conference will be held in China. Participating in the conference will afford the students an opportunity to share their work in an international forum and to impact the field as it develops in this region of the world. The award is consistent with NSF's mission of developing the next generation of scientists and promoting international scientific collaborations.\r\n \r\nThe IGALA 9 conference has taken as its theme, \"Time and Transition.\" The conference will address such questions as: how discourse, gender, and language intersect with rapid change; how meanings are discursively constructed across various timescales; how short-term performances persist across time; and how self is projected discursively into the future while drawing on the past.",
