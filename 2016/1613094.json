Dey, Facundo Memoli, Yusu Wang\r\n\r\nThis NSF award will support a conference on \"Topology, Geometry, and Data Analysis\" at Ohio State University in May 2016. Topology and geometry provide novel and robust methods for understanding the shape and structure of complex data sets. This meeting will gather a number of experts in algebraic topology, computational geometry, and related areas, as well as researchers in more applied scientific domains. The main aims are to exchange ideas and to consolidate synergistic activities through fostering collaborations. The organizers will encourage participation by a number of junior participants, introducing this emerging field to the next generation of researchers. Most of the funding will support travel and local expenses of conference participants.\r\n\r\nApplied algebraic topology is a rapidly developing area. This meeting will focus on a few of the most promising fronts. It will bring together specialists in computational topology and geometry (mesh generation and manifold reconstruction, persistent homology and cohomology), experts in the theoretical underpinnings (algebraic and categorical views of persistent homology, stability and inference), and researchers working in more applied areas (mathematical neuroscience, molecular biology, material science). The organizers are especially interested in new collaborations across disciplines, for example in applying topological methods to detect previously unknown structure in biological datasets, so the focus of this meeting is coherent but broad.  The website for this conference can be found here http://www.tgda.osu.edu/tgda-conf-osu.html.",
