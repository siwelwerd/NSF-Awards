 "awd_abstract_narration": "Central Community College (CCC) is developing a Mechatronics with Instrumentation and Controls program in an effort to meet Nebraska's growing need for Process Instrumentation and Controls (I&C) technicians. The goal of the project is to increase the number of qualified I&C technicians to meet the state's current workforce needs and promote a pipeline of future technicians. To accomplish this goal, the project is leveraging CCC's state-of-the-art Mechatronics Education Center and well-established business, education, and community relationships to develop a Process Instrumentation and Controls specialization within its existing Mechatronics AAS degree program. While the fundamentals found in the first year of both the existing electromechanical and the new I&C program pathways are similar, the I&C pathway distinguishes itself in that the fundamentals are applied in a processing environment instead of an advanced manufacturing environment. The I&C pathway is the first AAS degree program in Nebraska to focus primarily on the unique needs of Nebraska processing facilities. This is important because there is a shortage of qualified skilled technicians for both processing and manufacturing businesses, and, prior to the project, processing facilities could only compete with manufacturers for graduates of manufacturing-related technician programs. \r\n\r\nWith guidance from its Business-Industry Leadership Team, the project will modify/create up to 18 credit hours of new Process Instrumentation and Controls material for integration and alignment with existing coursework to form the new I&C specialization. The I&C specialization will provide education and skills that emphasize properties of liquids and gases using sensing and control devices that measure pressure, temperature, flow, volume density, and chemical composition. The new specialization will help create a pipeline of skilled I&C technicians and promote a Nebraska workforce with improved skills, knowledge, and abilities ultimately leading to more competitive businesses. To build and promote early college pipelines, the project is providing professional development and awareness activities for secondary educators and their students so they can introduce and integrate Mechatronics career pathways into the schools. To increase the diversity of the program, the project is implementing strategies to attract women, Hispanics, and military veterans from rural communities. To enhance student retention and completion, the project is embedding proven successful methods for engaging student cohorts throughout the curriculum and college experience. The project is using formative and summative efforts to document its impact on processing industries and to help urgent national calls to increase the number of workers entering Mechatronics-related careers.",
