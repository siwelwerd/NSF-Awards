 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ability to use teams of robots in real-world tasks, such as exploration, reconnaissance and search and rescue, depends on their ability to effectively cooperate in complex and dynamic environments. Unfortunately, determining the most effective team size for a given task depends on a variety of factors, often requires information not readily available, and can be computationally impractical.  Observations from nature show that some animal societies exhibit frequent splits (fission) and merges (fusion) of subgroups without the coordination overhead frequently found in multi-robot systems.  The goal of this research project is to use these insights from fission-fusion societies in nature as inspiration to implement similar behavior in multi-robot systems.\r\n\r\nThis project will investigate the motivations and mechanisms that contribute to the fission of a team of robots into smaller groups and the fusion of smaller groups into a larger group, into sizes appropriate to a given task.  Potential biological and environmental factors that contribute to individual decisions that result in the fission and fusion of groups and that have artificial analogues relevant to multi-robot systems will be identified using agent-based simulations.  An emphasis will be placed on factors that contribute to an adaptive task-specific preferred group size.  Once identified, these factors will be implemented on physical robots to evaluate the performance of the decision-making system within the constraints of physical robots.  The decision-making system used will be implemented using an adaptive fuzzy behavior hierarchy and a collective decision-making model developed using observations of natural systems.\r\n",

For some tasks, a small number of large groups is the best option, while other tasks may require a large number of small groups. Although the optimal configuration for some tasks may be determined, these solutions are frequently unable to adapt to dynamic environments, rapid changes in tasks, or situations in which team membership frequently changes. While this is a significant challenge for multi-robot systems (MRSs), natural systems exhibit frequent changes in subgroup composition and number in response to factors such as resource availability, conflicts of interest, and predation risk. This fission-fusion process allows natural systems to adapt just as an MRS should.  The goal of this project was to gain inspiration from natural systems exhibiting fission-fusion behaviors and design MRSs that can adapt subgroup size and number dynamically, depending on the current task.\n\n \nIn order to meet this goal, we investigated the environmental factors that promote fission-fusion events in natural systems, especially those that have relevant analogues in artificial systems such as an MRS.  Once we identified potential factors, we designed control systems that made use of the promising factors and evaluated them in simulated environments with a group of simulated robots.  Special attention was paid to using only information that could realistically be sensed by a physical robot.\n\n \nWe made several important steps towards achieving our goal in this project.  First, we were able to demonstrate a design for an MRS that promotes fission-fusion behaviors without defining explicit groups.  Preliminary progress was also made on extending the MRS so that fission-fusion events can be produced as a byproduct of environmental changes and not explicit incentives.  To aid in the development of these MRSs, we also made progress on developing an approach for evolving comprehensible fuzzy rulesets.  The intent here was to create MRS systems that could be analyzed by researchers from many backgrounds that do not traditionally have experience in analyzing complex control systems.  These steps, however, are just the beginning in this line of research.  We will continue to refine the design of these systems and approaches and extend them to more general applications in the coming years.\n\n \nThroughout the entire project, undergraduate research assistants made significant contributions.  They were involved in everything from determining the direction of various aspects of the research to the implementation and analysis of the experiments.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/30/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Brent E Eskridge"
