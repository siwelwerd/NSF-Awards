The project aims to attract and retain students in STEM careers and to inspire national students to pursue graduate work with a focus on sustainable technologies and materials. This 9.5 week summer project provides a unique research experience and prepares undergraduate students for the scientific and technical challenges faced in the nascent field of bioplastics and biocomposites. Participants will gain a greater understanding of and appreciation for the importance of sustainable technologies and materials in meeting national renewable goals and the rewarding research career opportunities available. The program builds on existing relationships with industry already engaged in the Center of Bioplastic and Biocomposites both at Iowa State University and Washington State University.\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: The NSF I/UCR Center of Bioplastic and Biocomposites (CB2) was established in order to (1) to improve the basic understanding of the synthesis, processing, properties, and compounding of bioplastic and biocomposite materials; (2) to develop reliable material characteristics data for industrial partners; and (3) to support large-scale implementation of renewable materials. The overall goal of the center is to provide the scientific basis for a successful transition from petrochemical raw materials to domestic sources for polymers, in particular renewable and biodegradable plant-based oils, carbohydrates, and proteins. This crucial transition will reduce the environmental impact of plastic production, manufacturing, and disposal and create new businesses and markets within the US. This fast growing industry depends on a well-prepared workforce that is familiar with research and development of plant-based materials and cutting edge manufacturing technologies tailored to these materials.  Students participating in the REU focused on Sustainable Technologies and Materials will learn: (1) how to conduct research as part of a collaborative research team; (2) how to present and publish their findings; (3) the role of ethics in research; (4) the scientific and technical challenges in the area of sustainable materials and technologies; and (5) that research offers rewarding career paths.\r\n\r\nAcknowledgement: This site is supported by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program.",

However, traditional polymers and composites are derived from non-renewable fossil feedstocks. With unstable pricing, expectations of future petroleum shortages, and growing environmental concerns threatening this industry, new technologies for useful polymers from renewable resources have the transformative potential to vastly impact the economy and environment. Bioplastics and biocomposites are innovative materials developed to reduce the dependence on petroleum and the release of harmful greenhouse gases. As a relatively new industry, bioplastics and biocomposites are already having significant economic and environmental impact. A new study predicts global demand for bioplastics to climb at an annual growth rate of 24% through 2023, reaching 6.62 million tons, significantly outpacing even the growth of traditional plastics. This growth will increase the demands for a skilled workforce.&nbsp; To address the scientific, technical, and workforce challenges faced by companies in the nascent field of bioplastics and biocomposites, the Center for Bioplastics and Biocomposites (CB<sup>2</sup>) was formed in 2013 from collaboration between Washington State University and Iowa State University. The objectives of the CB<sup>2</sup> REU program associated with the Center for Bioplastics and Biocomposites were to provide undergraduate students with research opportunities to explore the scientific frontiers of bioplastics and biocomposites within the context of the industrially relevant research environment of the Center for Bioplastics and Biocomposites, an NSF I/UCRC.</p>\n<p>The center is an interdisciplinary program involving faculty members from various departments and programs at the two partnering universities, as well as industry mentors associated with the center. The participants of the CB<sup>2</sup> REU program benefited by building their research and problem-solving skills, gaining a deeper understanding of the issues related to petroleum-derived materials such as plastics, engaging with fellow students and seasoned researchers, interacting with industry members, improving their communication skills, understanding their future education and career path, and having more confidence in their ability to conduct independent research work. Students actively participated in research projects tied to one or more ongoing CB<sup>2</sup> research team projects that were funded through CB<sup>2</sup> or projects that were generating preliminary data to apply for future funding from CB<sup>2</sup>.</p>\n<p>This award supported 33 REU students from different parts of the country (Figures 1 and 2). A significant portion of these students have continued to graduate school (over 80%). All of the REU students were successful in the program, demonstrated increased knowledge in sustainable materials, prepared poster presentations (Figure 3), many have presented at national conferences, and many have co-authored papers that are being prepared or under review by refereed journals. The biorenewable plastics and composites developed and characterized through the individual research projects of this REU program are excellent alternatives to traditional petroleum-based materials. Because of the partnerships between the REU students and our industry members, this research had a broad impact on the process of developing bioplastics and biocomposites. Because fossil resources are limited and bioplastics markets are projected to grow, the demands for innovative and skilled researchers will necessarily increase, and we had a significant impact by attracting and retaining students towards careers in this growing STEM field.</p>\n<p>During the grant period, for the 10-12 REU positions we offered every summer, there were 54 applications in the first year, 58 in the second year, and 94 in the third year; an increase in interest of over 60% compared to the first two years. Applications were received from 125 universities and 36 different states distributed across the US, indicating a desire among students, our future workforce, to learn more about processing of biobased and biodegradable products from renewable feedstock. This program provided research experience for a diverse group of students by recruiting from regional 4-year colleges and universities and community colleges from several states within the country, with significant numbers of underrepresented minorities, women, and first-generation students (Figures 4 &amp; 5). High quality mentorship was provided by experienced faculty.<strong> </strong>The range of technical research projects focused on five major areas related to biobased plastics and composites, including synthesis/compounding, biocomposites, processing, biobased products, and modelling. Each year, this REU site provided ~10 undergraduate researchers every year with focused and well directed research experiences on precompetitive, industrially relevant topics that met the scientific needs of our industrial partners in CB<sup>2</sup> related to bioplastics and biocomposites.&nbsp; Through these projects, the students obtained a better understanding of bio-renewable materials, practical training on frequently used laboratory facilities, communication and social skills (Figure 6), and a network within the bioplastics community.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t
