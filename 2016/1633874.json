 "awd_abstract_narration": "The CombinaTexas 2016 conference will be held at Texas A&M University, College Station TX on May 7-8 2016. The conference will take place on Saturday and Sunday to make it easy for researchers to attend, and will feature six fifty minute plenary lectures and a number of contributed talks, each twenty minutes long. About 50 participants are anticipated in 2016, with about 20 contributed talks in parallel sessions. The aim of the CombinaTexas conference series is to enhance the educational and research atmosphere of combinatorialists in Texas and the surrounding states, increase communication between mathematicians of the region, and provide a forum for presentation and discussion of the most recent developments in the field of Combinatorics. Ever since Texas A&M University hosted the first conference in 2000, it has been held almost every year at different institutions in the South Central United States. CombinaTexas 2016 is the sixteenth conference in this series. The conference will be publicized using distribution lists and on related conference websites (a conference website is at http://www.math.tamu.edu/conferences/combinatexas/ including titles and abstracts of the speakers).\r\n\r\nThe conference will feature a broad selection of combinatorial research, including Algebraic Combinatorics, Enumerative Combinatorics, Geometric Combinatorics, a wide range of areas in Graph Theory, and various applications. A Special Session on Graph Theory will be led by plenary speakers Professors Neil Robertson and Guoli Ding. The confirmed plenary speakers are Professor Bruno Benedetti (U Miami), Professor Guoli Ding (LSU), Professor Fu Liu (UC Davis), Professor Nicholas Loehr (Virginia Tech), Professor Neil Robertson (Ohio State) and Professor Anne Shiu (Texas A&M).",
