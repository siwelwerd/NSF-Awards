 "awd_abstract_narration": "This REU Site award to Boston University (BU), located in Boston, MA, will support the training of 8 students for 10 weeks during the summers of 2017-2019. The program will focus on computational and mathematical analysis of bioinformatics data. Research projects will include studying gene regulatory networks, the microbiome, and the linkage between genetic variation and phenotypes. Students will learn to analyze high-throughput sequencing data, gain experience in statistical and machine learning methods, and learn dynamic systems modeling. Full-time research with a Bioinformatics faculty mentor will be supplemented by workshops covering 1) bioinformatics programming, 2) parallel and cloud computing, 3) creating a scientific poster, 4) applying to graduate school, and 5) scientific ethics and responsible conduct of research. Additional activities will include tours of local science facilities, and participation in BU Bioinformatics symposia. A stipend, housing, meal, and travel allowances will be provided. Students will be selected based on relevant coursework in biology, mathematics, and computing, a good academic record, enthusiasm for bioinformatics research, and evidence of involvement in community activities and community service. \r\n\r\nIt is anticipated that a total of 24 students will be trained in the program with an emphasis on recruiting women, members of groups underrepresented in the sciences, and students from schools with limited research opportunities. Students will learn how research is conducted and many will present posters at national, regional, or BU sponsored undergraduate research conferences. \r\n\r\nA common web-based assessment tool used by all REU programs funded by the Division of Biological Infrastructure (Directorate for Biological Sciences) will be used to determine the effectiveness of the training program. A Research Experience Wiki will be used for weekly recording of skills learned. Students will be tracked after the program to determine career paths using BU Bioinformatics LinkedIn and Facebook pages. Students will be asked to respond to an automatic email sent via the NSF reporting system. More information is available at http://www.bu.edu/bioinformatics/research/undergraduate-research, or by contacting the PI (Dr. Gary Benson at gbenson@bu.edu) or the program coordinator (Ms. Caroline Lyman at clyman@bu.edu).",
