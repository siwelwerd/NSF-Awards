Such materials could be employed as tools for applications involving gas emissions and water pollution. This project will focus on creation and study of high-surface-area polymer particles.  These would contain high loadings of specifically chosen chemical groups delivered by specially designed polymer units and could be readily prepared by industrially practiced polymerization processes.  These polymeric materials could provide practical candidates for acid gas and heavy metal ion capture (e.g., carbon dioxide, hydrogen sulfide, heavy-metal ions).  Some of these polymers could also lead to practical high-surface-area polymer particles for enhancing reversible storage of hydrogen.  Results from this project will be reported at major scientific conferences and published in high-impact journals. Students trained with intense interactions across discipline boundaries are an important output of this research.  The tight coupling of disciplinary and interdisciplinary training in the scientific development of new functional polymeric materials will prepare students to enter the scientific workforce well-prepared to make important contributions for advancing the technological growth of the nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThe research described in this project focuses on preparing and studying novel semi-rigid, sterically crowded and precisely functionalized nanoporous hypercrosslinked polymeric materials.  Precise insertion of semi-rigid segments from alternating copolymers into hypercrosslinked polymer particles delivers new chemical backbone units to modify properties of network systems.  Precise control of placement of functional groups from strictly alternating sequences will enable unique solid state constructs that are expected to provide excellent control over physical properties of the resulting networks. For hypercrosslinked systems, these semi-rigid units slow pore collapse during the hypercrosslinking step.  Computational collaboration will help guide the development of the fundamentals for designing higher surface area functional particles. These new hypercrosslinked polymeric materials will possess high surface areas with high concentrations of functional groups designed for specific interactions with gas sorbates, metal ions, or other reactive molecules.  Comparison of semi-rigid chain stiffening sequences to less sterically crowded functional copolymer sequences will assist in elucidating the role of chain stiffness on fundamental structure property relationships. Recent discoveries with semi-rigid structures containing carboxylic acid functional group will be expanded to hypercrosslinked polymeric materials with primary and secondary amine groups and phenolic groups precisely enchained in the polymer backbone.    It is anticipated that these new functional nanoporous particles will be effective solid sorbents for carbon dioxide and other acidic gases.  Hypercrosslinked nanoporous polymer particles containing aromatic amines will be targeted also and their potential for hydrogen storage studied.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nPolymeric materials are indispensable for the functioning of modern societies.  Critical applications range from modern food packaging that ensures the safety and extends the shelf-life of foods to light-weight and strong polymeric materials for building construction and auto and airplane manufacturing.\n\nThe properties of polymer chains with a methylene backbone are dependent on the chemical nature and size of the pendant groups on the chain.  For example, as shown in Figure 1, the polymer with an unsubstituted methylene backbone is the ubiquitous polyethylene, a semicrystalline polymer with a softening point of approximately minus 125 centigrade and is used for many package wraps and other applications.  Substituting one of the hydrogen atoms on one of the backbone carbon atoms in the repeat unit with a phenyl group raises the softening point over 200 degrees centigrade to 100 centigrade and yields a non-crystalline amorphous polymer which has applications in transparent and foamed products for holding hot beverages, \"inter alia.\"\n\nIn addition to the large volume commodity polymers, as polyethylene and polystyrene, speciality polymers with various groups pendant to the backbone endow the polymers with unique and useful properties for important applications where small to modest volumes of these materials are produced.  Applications are as diverse as polymers for biomedical uses, such as targeted drug delivery, resins for water purification, to radiation sensitive polymers for the manufacture of modern integrated circuits that are essential for our electronic devices such as mobile phones and computer displays, etc.  These high-tech enabling materials are a result of the fundamental understandings, developed since the 1930's, of the relationships of macromolecular structure and properties.  This understanding, coupled with new synthetic polymer chemistry, fuels the design and synthesis of the specific polymer structures to provide the properties for the applications.  Polymer science continues this relentless march toward new polymer structures based on fundamental understandings arising from exploratory polymer research.\n\nThe research in this NSF sponsored project is an example of exporatory polymer synthesis and structure property studies based on the hypothesis that adding sterically crowding and chain-stiffening precisely placed functional groups along the polymer backbone will lead to new and enhanced polymer properties which can be of value in applications where current polymeric materials fall short. Substituted stilbene monomer delivered steric crowding to the polymer chains and the cyclic structures of maleic anhydride or N-substituted maleimides enhanced the chain stiffness.  These monomers were copolymerized to yield alternating copolymers which leads to the precise placement of the units in the backbone.The results from this study extend our knowledge of how substituents that render a polymer chain stiffer change the physcial properties of the polymer. \n\nResearch activities in this project focused on three exploratory thrusts.  The first thrust involved the design and then successful synthesis of highly crosslinked polymer substrate particles for bonding amines for adsorbing acidic gases such as carbon dioxide.  A  reactive polymer substrate particle was prepared, by chemistry easily amenable to scale-up,  and  was readily reacted with different amines to yield families of polymer particles with systematic variation of the amine functionality. These amine functionalized polymer particles exhibited carbon dioxide adsorption/desorption which was dependent on the structure of the attached amine groups.\n\nThe second thrust focused on studying the non-conjugated fluorescence properties of selected examples of the substitued stilbene alterating copolymers. An unanticipated significant enhancement of fluorescence was observed with the sterically crowded stilbene copolymers that was absent when the crowding was eliminated.  These results suggest a new design feature, based on chain conformational constraints, for obtaining strong fluorescence in a polymer without having to enchain potentially toxic fluorophores.  Figure 2 shows the best performing polymer, the strong solution fluorescence, and the proposed favored conformation that enables this effect.\n\nIn a third thrust a novel synthetic miniemulsion copolymerization process was developed that enabled the preparation of hydrogels containing sequences of chain stiffened carboxylic acid containing stilbene alternating copolymer with a carboxylic acid containing maleimide crosslinked with divinyl benzene (Figure 3). Conversion of the protecting ester groups, used for the polymerization, to acid groups yielded acid functionalized nanoparticles that showed significant levels of copper ion and lead ion adsorption. This process was found to be easily reversed by changing the pH of the medium and suggests potential application for removal of heavy metal ions from polluted aqueous streams.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/30/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Richard Turner"
