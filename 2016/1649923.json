 "awd_abstract_narration": "Obtaining a \"connectome\" or map of the wiring of the brain is crucial to understanding brain structure and function, and has been set as long-term goals of several international government-funded initiatives due to the potential benefits for improving health, treating brain diseases, and understanding development. As technologies for sample preparation and microscopy advance, it is becoming feasible to image large sections of brain tissue. However, the vast quantities of data produced with these techniques is far outpacing the ability of neuroscientists to analyze the data. This project will address the data analysis challenge by developing new computational software tools that facilitate use of advanced computing for connectomics studies, in alignment with NSF's mission to promote the progress of science and advance national health, prosperity and welfare.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding the microarchitecture and neuronal morphologies that comprise neural circuitry in the brain is crucial to understanding brain function. This EAGER project aims to build the computational and data infrastructure that is necessary to manage and process large microscopy imaging data sets for connectomics studies, bringing High Performance Computing (HPC) resources into the neuroscience workflow. The project will employ a data model that enables scientists to visualize, interact with, and process data of any size that is stored in any remote location, from USB drives to high-performance parallel file systems. The software infrastructure will furthermore enable automatic mapping of analysis procedures designed by neuroscientists to remote HPC systems. The system will leverage state-of-the-art tools and practices developed in the HPC community, and aims to result in greatly accelerated studies of connectivity in the brain at scale.\r\n\r\nThis Early-concept Grants for Exploratory Research (EAGER) award by the CISE Division of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure is jointly supported by the CISE Division of Information and Intelligent Systems, with funds associated with the NSF Understanding the Brain, BRAIN Initiative activities, and for developing national research infrastructure for neuroscience. This project also aligns with NSF objectives under the National Strategic Computing Initiative.",
