 "awd_abstract_narration": "This National Science Foundation (NSF) Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (S-STEM) project at Carleton College in Northfield, Minnesota will provide scholarships for talented, low-income students pursuing bachelor's degrees in the sciences and mathematics. In addition to scholarships, the program will provide academic support to increase the persistence of academically talented, low-income students. Project efforts will include a study of the means of improving the second-year experience of STEM students and a focus on increasing the number of  STEM faculty with direct expertise in fostering the success of those STEM students from low-income backgrounds that are at risk for non-completion of STEM degrees. The results of this project will be applicable to other institutions that do not require students to declare a major until the end of the sophomore year and are seeking to improve the retention of students in STEM programs. Scholarships and support for academically strong students, who may not otherwise be able to afford college, will help to produce a well-trained workforce that will contribute to the economic vitality of Minnesota and the nation.\r\n\r\nThe project builds on several existing initiatives at Carleton and introduces additional effective students support practices targeted at areas expected to be particularly critical to student success. The project will refine and evaluate current first-year cohort strategies in support of student learning, student sense of belonging, and student drive to succeed in STEM.  A year-long civic-engagement research project will be implemented for students in the sophomore year.  The effect of this research participation on student attitudes will be evaluated.  For students in the junior and senior years, opportunities for teaching-as-learning will be implemented.  The project activities will also enlarge the pool of Carleton STEM faculty with direct expertise in fostering the success of STEM students from low-income backgrounds. This project will advance understanding of: the effect of first-year and second-year engaged-learning research projects on student perseverance and success in introductory courses; the effect of the second-year STEM civic-engagement research and advising on student choice of STEM major; and the impact of faculty advising and mentoring of students as well as faculty design of introductory courses.  The evaluation of the student's sophomore-year experience will be of particular value to colleges in which students declare majors at the end of the second year. The lessons learned that emerge from the program will be disseminated widely to the STEM education community and help increase understanding of the attributes and practices of successful student scholarship and support programs.",

Our program is designed to integrate with existing college programs and offers students support for the three pillars of their academic success, and therefore persistence in STEM: (1) their drive to succeed in STEM; (2) support for their learning; and (3) their sense of belonging, in STEM as well as in their discipline. Our model acknowledges that academics only represent a portion of the students' experiences, and their personal considerations can and do have an impact on their academic success, and thus their persistence in STEM.</p>\n<p>\"Broader FOCUS\" has shown notable success in increasing the number of Carleton College students from low-income, first-generation backgrounds and those who are from groups historically excluded from STEM fields, through expansion of the FOCUS Program. With support from this grant, the program has doubled and now supports ~30 students/year. Since its inception in 2007, the program has served 325 students, with more than half of those students involved in the last 6 years (Figure 1). Students who participate in FOCUS have notable successes compared with their peers at Carleton. Evaluation work carried out by the Science Education Resource Center (SERC) in spring 2021 focused on comparing outcomes for FOCUS participants (280 students) with those of non-FOCUS Carleton students (560 students) who were matched based on similar characteristics, including demographics, financial aid status, class year, participation in other programs, and average standardized test scores in math and reading/writing. All studied outcomes were better for FOCUS participants than for the matched sample, including modest increases in both overall GPA and STEM GPA (the former is the only metric that has a non-statistically significant difference), the percentage of students majoring in STEM (82.5% vs. 51.6%), the percent enrolled in graduate programs (54.9% vs. 40.4%), and the percent who had already obtained graduate degrees (23.6% vs. 14.8%). Participation in the FOCUS Program has an impact on the students who participate and includes ripple effects in the STEM programs at Carleton, although no direct causal relationship can be determined from this study, as students are not randomly assigned into FOCUS.</p>\n<p>FOCUS achieves its goals by emphasizing the components identified in the program model. For example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Sense of Belonging</strong>: The FOCUS Program emphasizes connections between students and between students and faculty/staff in STEM, to help students develop a sense of belonging at Carleton, in STEM at Carleton, and in their major department (once they declare). The cohort model supports students' sense of belonging and growing the cohort has increased the opportunities for student participants to find support within the program. Specific activities increase students' experience talking with faculty about academic work and provide outside-of-class interactions for students and faculty, to increase opportunities to develop relationships.</li>\n<li><strong>Support for Learning</strong>: Through an emphasis on how and where students seek help with academic work, FOCUS students have steadily increased their use of campus resources designed to support the learning of all students. FOCUS students now use all resources at a rate at least the same as that of non-FOCUS students, and they utilize peer resources across the college at higher rates. The number of faculty members who participate in the FOCUS Program by teaching required courses for first- and second-year students, serving as academic advisers and faculty mentors for students, and being research mentors, has increased. Faculty participants report that working with FOCUS students has impacted the ways that they teach all of their students.</li>\n<li><strong>Drive to Succeed</strong>: With an internal motivation, or drive, to succeed, students find it easier to persist through challenges. The FOCUS Program builds on students' personal interests in STEM and interests in academic success, with a particular emphasis on research experiences. The FOCUS Program provides all first-year students with an introduction to research in a few ways, including projects that engage them with the research process as well as participation in a group research project. Participation in summer research experiences, as indicated by presentations at Carleton's summer research symposium (an increase from 8 students in 2017 to 28 students in 2022).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Support from Carleton College enables us to continue a successful program that is a model for cohort programs at other institutions. FOCUS has been supported in a variety of ways since its inception, including externally through grants to the college from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI), two S-STEM grants from the National Science Foundation (2009?2015 and 2016?2022), and through the North Star STEM Alliance, a Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation, funded by the National Science Foundation through the University of Minnesota.
