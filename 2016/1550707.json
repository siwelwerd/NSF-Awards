This effort will enhance the current Neotoma platform by: 1) maximizing rates of data ingest through on-going data mobilization campaigns, recruitment and training of new data stewards, and development of facilitation software; 2) expanding the Neotoma data model to facilitate new proxy acquisition and secondary data including organic biomarkers, isotopic data from faunal specimens, and faunal taphonomic information; 3) developing new tools for data visualization and scientific exploration; 4) fostering engagement and growth of the Neotoma research community through support for a series of workshops intended to train data users, data stewards, and teachers, and by development of an on-line blog.\r\n\r\nThe Neotoma geoinformatics platform will promote integrative studies of the biotic impacts of climate change over the past five million years by allowing greater access to previously collected geoscience data sets of relevance and the tools to support analysis at marginal cost.  The project will promote community engagement, support ease of data set ingestion, address PI team succession and promote educational module development.  This award directly addresses OMB Memo M-13-13 ?Open Data Policy-Managing Information as an Asset.?\r\n\r\n***",

Neotoma achieves high data quality by working closely with expert contributors and stewards. Neotoma specializes in records spanning the last few centuries to million years ? a time that covers the spread of humans worldwide and multiple large and repeated climate changes.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>By consolidating many kinds of data into one centralized resource, Neotoma lowers costs and enhances sustainability while offering paleoecologists a high-quality data resource.&nbsp; Many individual prior groups have agreed to join Neotoma as constituent databases; these include NANODe and NACODe (ostracodes); the Academy of Natural Sciences of Drexel University (diatoms); FAUNMAP, MIOMAP, and ANTIGUA (vertebrates); the African, European, Latin American, North American, and IndoPacific Pollen Databases; the International Testate Amoebae Database; and the North American Insect Database.&nbsp; Geochemists are adding their data too, including stable isotopes and organic biomarkers. We are exploring adding sedimentary ancient DNA.</p>\n<p>DATA VOLUME: During this period of support, Neotoma has become the standard repository for Quaternary fossil data in North America and, increasingly, globally.&nbsp; Neotoma data volumes have grown rapidly, with the number of data points tripling, from 2.2 million to 7.6 million.&nbsp; The number of datasets increased fivefold, from 7,600 to &gt;40,000.</p>\n<p>GOVERNANCE: Community data resources require well-developed governance structures.&nbsp; During the project, Neotoma formally adopted bylaws, established the Neotoma Leadership Council as the governing body, developed an annual election mechanism, and established Data Use and Code of Conduct policies.&nbsp; &nbsp;All Neotoma data are freely available to all under a Creative Commons license, with customizable citations for individual Constituent Databases.&nbsp; Over 100 scientists are trained as Data Stewards, who can upload and curate data.&nbsp; We have held four annual elections (2017-2020). Neotoma co-founded the Earth-Life Consortium, a non-profit association with the mission to support the free and open access of paleobiological data.</p>\n<p>SOFTWARE AND SERVICES: We released a new generation of Neotoma?s application programmatic interfaces (APIs), which enable other developers and scientists to write their own software to access Neotoma data.&nbsp; The Neotoma database was migrated to open-source software (Linux/Postgres), a major effort that improves sustainability and access.&nbsp;&nbsp; Database snapshotting services were created so that Constituent Databases could periodically receive copies of their own data, thereby enhancing access and preservation redundancy.&nbsp; Two new interactive mapping services, Range Mapper and Ice Age Mapper, were created by Wisconsin students, to show how species shifted ranges in response to the global temperature rises with the end of the last ice age. A new version of Stratigraphic Diagrammer supports the visual display of all Neotoma data types.&nbsp; All Neotoma datasets are now assigned unique identifiers (DOIs) and individual websites, to facilitate discovery by search engines.&nbsp; We have set up Google Analytics to better track usage.</p>\n<p>EDUCATION, TRAINING, COMMUNICATIONS: This project has supported the training of at least 7 graduate and 18 undergraduate students at the intersection of the geosciences and data sciences, a top-priority area for workforce training. Neotoma data are of particular interest to early career scientists.&nbsp; As one said,&nbsp; \"<em>I?d like to give a shoutout to open-access databases. These databases are what we early career scientists need to get jobs.\"</em> &nbsp;We held 22 workshops over the project period, to train other scientists 1) how to access and use Neotoma data and 2) how to upload and curate data.&nbsp; We built several online educational resources for undergraduate and graduate students.&nbsp;&nbsp; These include 11 new modules housed at Carleton?s Science Education Resource Center to teach about climate change, paleoecology, and biogeography using Neotoma; model analytical workflows for obtaining and analyzing Neotoma data; and a 13-week graduate course in quantitative methods, in which all materials are publicly available on GitHub.</p>\n<p>SUPPORTING SCIENCE:&nbsp; Neotoma data are now the standard resource for large-scale investigations into recent past ecosystem dynamics. The open availability of Neotoma data is enabling new kinds of convergent research among paleoecologists, archaeologists, paleoclimatologists, and macroecologists. As of May, 2021, 807 papers had used or cited Neotoma data, and these papers had been cited a total of 28,779 times with a collective H-factor of 81.
