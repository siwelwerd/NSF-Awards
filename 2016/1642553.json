 "awd_abstract_narration": "Obfuscation studies how to insert noise into an existing signal to make data or information-stream more ambiguous, confusing, harder to exploit, and more difficult to act on. As an important topic in both privacy/security and information processing, it has been studied from many different perspectives in many related areas, e.g., data privacy, databases, machine learning, ethics, etc. This workshop represents one of the first attempts to consolidate and shape the area as a whole, and help develop a new research community that carries out obfuscation research in a holistic fashion.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, this workshop aims to foster and develop new interdisciplinary research partnerships around obfuscation, by involving researchers, designers, and system producers, including but not limited to academic researchers, industry researchers and practitioners, and independent software producers and privacy activists.  The workshop seeks to create benchmarks, assessment tools, and evaluation frameworks for obfuscation techniques, formalizing the notion of obfuscation, and identifying its key challenges and use cases. Through open, online publications, this workshop contributes to the broader conversation about putting obfuscation in practice, and therefore has broader impacts on industry and government, as well as user and developer communities who are interested in producing the next-generation privacy technologies.",

Threat Models: Understanding threat models is key to determining in which cases obfuscation is the solution and in which cases it is not. Throughout the workshop, it became clear that effective threat modeling includes understanding adversarial capacities and dependencies, levels of coordination, and questions of time and scale. For example, obfuscation may be an effective defense against lower-level adversaries (such as a jealous spouse or boss), while still being breakable by those with greater (or networked) computational, financial or legal, resources; similarly, what seems hidden today may be revealed tomorrow. Several speakers raised concerns about the dangers of under- or over-estimating the threat level, as well as perpetuating an \"adversarial arms race.\"\n\n 2. Benchmarks and Metrics: Anyone who has created obfuscation tools has been asked, \"But does it work?\" Throughout the course of the workshop, several different models for assessing success were offered for different contexts, including measurements based on financial costs, computing power, time to de-obfuscate, political efficacy, and so on. There are many cases where identifying benchmarks can be socially or technically challenging, such as in determining training data for \"real\" or \"fake\" news. Moreover, it became clear that often those creating obfuscating systems have only a partial view of their adversaries (or of the effects of their own actions), and often are forced to make quick assessments based on limited information -- which can be quite dangerous. In addition to identifying quantitative metrics for measuring particular tactics' efficacy, some also suggested considering equally rigorous qualitative standards in evaluating its performative or aesthetic impacts.\n\n 3. Ethical Justifications: Many have questioned the ethical justifications for obfuscation techniques, highlighting cases in which tactics may seem to enable instances of free-loading, wasting resources, or failing to challenge larger structures of power. These must be carefully considered in context -- as well as with regards to asymmetries of information or other forms of power -- while also offering legitimacy to obfuscation as a concept and offering confidence to those creating such systems. Several participants also raised ethical questions about who participates in obfuscation tactics and in what ways, noting that people with diverse and intersecting identities may be unevenly impacted by different forms of surveillance and resistance.\n\n 4.
