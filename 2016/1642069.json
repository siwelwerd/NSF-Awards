 "awd_abstract_narration": "Threats to scientific instruments and data that are accessible via the Internet are ubiquitous.  The SouthEast SciEntific Cybersecurity for University REsearch (SECURE) project helps protect the National Science Foundation's investments in scientific research while providing scientists with tools to safeguard intellectual property and ensure data integrity. The project team provides education, training, and selected cybersecurity services to NSF-funded researchers across the Southeast.  The team is multidisciplinary, comprised of cybersecurity experts (both research and practitioner), scientists, and experts in communication.  Team members are located in South Carolina, Alabama and Mississippi, with strong representation from Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU).  This program raises investigators' awareness of their essential role in creating a secure and trustworthy cyberspace and offers concrete assistance in risk assessment, vulnerability testing, and mitigation tailored to NSF-funded scientists' workflow and program size.  Through past collaborations, the team is well positioned to leverage both national and regional cybersecurity organizations and programs to effectively reach the target audience.\r\n \r\nSouthEast SECURE impacts the region by raising cybersecurity awareness; providing concise training, assessment, tools and one-on-one help; and assisting in preparation of select cybersecurity metrics.  Student interns are conducting many of these activities by means of practicum-based deployment and support, thus developing capabilities in the next generation of cyber professionals.  An online survey of NSF-funded investigators in the region will be conducted to learn about their primary cybersecurity challenges and concerns.  Training is then tailored to provide concrete and practical assistance in how to do right-sized risk assessment and mitigation.  A \"toolkit\" is provided to test and validate local cybersecurity, and measures of cybersecurity are created and field-tested.  The team's approach facilitates communication between research faculty and university IT/Data Security staff.  A long-term goal is building communities with common interests in cybersecurity and a commitment to helping others; and building connections with other regions and with national centers and programs.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nAs a result of this project, UAH has observed the following outcomes:\n\n1)       Cyber data archival and analysis: A common problem in many cost-conscious environments is the storage and processing of cyber security data.  Commercial tools are frequently costly and can represent a large burden.  Open source tools are evolving but are frequently isolated.  Researchers on this project implemented a framework for using open source tools to store, catalog, and analyze security-related log files from multiple sources using open source tools.\n\n2)       Enhanced training in cyber security for non-technology faculty:  University faculty are likely targets for a variety of cyber-attacks because of their access to sensitive data like student records.  While faculty in the technology fields are probably up-to-date on cyber security trends and threats, non-technology faculty have a steeper learning curve, placing them at greater risk.  UAH developed a training program aimed at faculty at non-STEM faculty designed to instruct them on the basics of cyber security.  The training also provided instruction on the behaviors commonly exhibited by cyber criminals.  By recognizing the behaviors and clues exhibited by criminals, these faculty will be better protected from future threats.\n\n3)       Training on ?deep fakes?: The emergence of deep-learning artificial intelligence has made it possible to develop fake audio and video clips that appear genuine.  An example of this is the creation of a video depicting a famous person in a situation that never actually occurred.  As this trend continues, faculty have a responsibility to mentor their students to take a critical eye to all data and evidence, even when that data seems valid.\n\n4)       Research experience for undergraduates: During this program, four undergraduate students participated in the above outlined research areas and gained valuable first-hand experience in dealing with emerging cyber security topics.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/27/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Sara J Graves"
