 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Chemical Structure, Dynamics, and Mechanism Program of the NSF Chemistry Division supports the research of Professor Robert Flowers in the Department of Chemistry at Lehigh University.  Professor Flowers and his students are examining the mechanism for reactions of samarium (II) iodide (SmI2), a widely used reagent in organic synthesis.  The first goal of this project is designed to examine the role of proton donors (alcohols and water) on the reactivity and efficiency of reactions and determine whether electrons and protons are transferred in sequential steps, or whether the process is concerted and occurs through a formal hydrogen atom transfer.  The second goal of this project is to use the mechanistic information from studies on SmI2-proton donor systems to develop catalytic reactions. Students at the undergraduate and graduate level receive training in a range of scientific techniques.  Outreach to elementary students leads to sustained engagement with the local community.  Finally, video recordings of experimental protocols developed during these studies are freely disseminated on the Flowers research group webpage to assist scientists who use reagents based on SmI2.     \r\n\r\nSmI2 is among the most widely employed reagents that reduce substrates and reactive intermediates through single electron transfer.  Although most reactions of SmI2 require proton donors, the mechanism of this reagent combination is not fully understood and the current view is that reductions and reductive coupling reactions proceed through a sequential electron-transfer, proton-transfer processes.  This work tests the hypothesis that reductions and reductive coupling reactions proceed through a formal hydrogen atom transfer and that the coupled transfer of an electron and proton is responsible for the unique reactivity of Sm(II)-coordinating proton donor reductions of substrates which are typically recalcitrant to reduction through single electron transfer.  As mechanistic work on Sm(II)-proton donors systems is performed, data obtained from these studies is used for the development of useful and user-friendly catalytic reactions; a longstanding, but elusive goal in this field.  Integration of a range of experimental techniques along with synthetic applications of proton-coupled, electron-transfer in synthesis provides a dynamic intellectual environment for students at all levels of study. The educational plan includes long-term engagement with local elementary schools designed to nurture greater interest in science.  Finally, as research is published in peer-reviewed journals, video recordings of all experimental protocols are made to aid scientists who want to repeat the reaction protocols.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nProfessor Flowers from Lehigh University completed work on a project entitled: \"Proton-coupled electron transfer in Sm(II)-proton donor reactions\"\n\n \n\nSamarium diiodide (SmI2) is among the most widely used single electron transfer reagents in synthesis.  Protic solvents (proton donors) including water and alcohols are used in concert with SmI2 to reduce or couple substrates.  Among proton donors, water is unique in that its presence enables the reduction of substrates that are recalcitrant to electron transfer alone.  We recently proposed that the unique reactivity of SmI2-water was a consequence of proton coupled electron transfer (PCET) where an electron and proton are transferred simultaneously from the Sm-water complex.  Beyond this interesting feature of reactions involving SmI2, use of the reagent is limited since it must be used in stoichiometric amounts. The goals of this project were designed to: 1) Determine the role of PCET in functional group reductions by SmI2-water and related systems, and 2) Examine the development of catalytic reactions of SmI2.\n\nDuring the course of the work, experiments demonstrated that the combination of SmI2 and water reduces many substrates through PCET.  The key feature responsible for the unique reactivity of the Sm(II)-water complex is strong coordination that leads to significant weakening of the O-H bond of ligated water.  With this knowledge, we have demonstrated that other protic ligands can be used to tune the reactivity of the Sm(II) reagent system to promote unusual reactions not possible using SmI2 alone.  In addition to this work, we examined the mechanism of catalytic reactions of SmI2 that use an inexpensive terminal reductant such as magnesium. We demonstrated that the identity of the reductant changed throughout the course of the catalytic reaction.  Using this knowledge reactions with as little as 1 mol% Sm were developed.  This initial work should enable the development of useful and user-friendly catalytic reactions, a long standing goal in Sm(II) chemistry.   \n\nIn addition to the scientific merits of the work, this project also provided important professional training to undergraduate and graduate students preparing them for careers in science, technology, and health.  Additionally, the range of scientific tools and approaches used in this project provided unique training and perspective to students providing a dynamic intellectual environment for engaging with practical, real-world problems through the study of basic chemical processes.

In addition, we participated in significant outreach and presently am engaged in mentoring a high school student in the lab each academic year.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/10/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Robert A Flowers"
