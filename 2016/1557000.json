 "awd_abstract_narration": "Unlike most natural disturbances, such as hurricanes or floods, characteristics and effects of fires depend on the plants present and the fuels they produce, both live flammable leaves and dead tissues that are released into the surrounding environment. Plants that live where fire occurs frequently are often capable of surviving fires. Some of these plants produce fuels that change the likelihood and characteristics of future fires, producing conditions favorable to them and/or their offspring. Soil organisms also affect plant fuels, and some are capable of surviving fires. They represent an important but unrecognized driver capable of altering fuels and future fires, especially in habitats with frequent fires. Soil fungi are a key example of such soil organisms, directly affecting fuel loads by decomposing dead plant tissues and indirectly affecting fuel production through their effects on plant growth. Because fungi differ in fire susceptibility, repeated fires may shape the fungi present, altering direct and indirect effects on fuels (and thus future fires). Knowledge of these fungal effects is important for managing natural fire-frequented habitats such as savannas and grasslands and forecasting the characteristics (such as the likelihood and intensity) of future fires in most terrestrial habitats. This research examines how changes in fires (severity, frequency, suppression) influence fungi and their effects on new fuels, both directly through fuel breakdown and indirectly through plants, then models how these differences may affect future fires. This research will also develop two educational modules on fire, fungi and plants: 1) undergraduate students will test different fire traits of cultured fungi and 2) K-5 classrooms will use inquiry-based learning kits that are developed on fire, fungi and plants, and that directly address next generation science standards. \r\n \r\nThe research will be conducted in pine savannas, highly diverse and threatened southeastern habitats dependent on frequent fire. Initial research showed that fire alters soil fungi and results in 40% slower decomposition by microbes of dead plant leaves newly deposited on the ground. Slower decomposition causes fuels to accumulate more quickly in the environment, increasing chances and intensities of future fires. This research uses large-scale field experiments with fire, next generation DNA sequencing, and computer modeling to determine how soil microbes like fungi respond to fire, and if they play an unrecognized role by influencing likelihoods and characteristics of future fires. Because these effects are tested over a spectrum of fire severities, the model based on experimental results can be used in other pyrogenic habitats and can be used to forecast likelihoods and effects of future fires.",

We hypothesized that pyrophilic plants and soil biota (microbes) should influence ground-level fine fuels, producing endogenous feedbacks enhancing fires that maintain these fiery ecosystems. We anticipated that recurrent fires have small effects on long-lived, fire-adapted plants, but substantial impacts on microbes, directly through heat, and indirectly through soil and plant-host changes. Further, fires should most affect microbes responsible for fuel decomposition (saprotrophic fungi and bacteria) and those that influence plants (e.g., mycorrhizal fungi), resulting in reduced post-fire fuel decomposition and altered germination and growth of fire-adapted plants. Combined, these effects should increase fine fuel accumulation, enhancing recurrence and spread of subsequent fires as depicted in our conceptual model (Figure 1). Over eight years (2014-2021), we examined how variation in characteristics of fires influence plant and microbial communities and their effects on new post-fire fuels, then predicted effects on probabilities and characteristics of future fires. With NSF funding, we explored our hypotheses using pine savanna ecosystems, with diverse ground layer communities and overstory pines that shed pyrogenic needles.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Initially, we compared plant and microbial communities in burned and unburned patches within a frequently burned pine savanna. Fires produced few changes in ground-level plant communities, but altered litter and soil fungal and bacterial communities. Reduced relative abundances of saprophytes explained a 30% decline in microbial decomposition of new fine fuels, indicating rapid accumulation of new fine fuels. &nbsp;We then addressed how variation in fire regimes affects ground layer plants, whose above-ground parts combust during fires, and fungi, which are primarily responsible for fuel decomposition and soil biotic feedbacks to plants.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">First</span>, we explored variation in short-term fire frequency by manipulating numbers of fires within a 3-year period. With increasing fire frequency, 1) abundances of pyrophilic herbaceous taxa in plant communities increased, 2) fungal community shifts increased, with greater loss of saprotrophic taxa, 3) overall fungal abundance did not differ, but 4) fuel decomposition decreased. More pyrophilic taxa of plants and fungi replaced more fire-susceptible taxa as short-term fire frequency increased. Using structural equation models (SEM), slower microbial decomposition was linked to more frequent fires and reductions in soil nutrients post-fire. These results suggested that fire feedbacks, by increasing fire frequency, should shift ground layer plant and microbe communities toward alternate states.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Second</span>, we explored how variation in amounts of pyrogenic fuels (shed pine needles) affected fire characteristics, plant and fungal communities, and fine fuel decomposition. Reductions of needle fuels had little effect on fire intensity. Adding pine needles (similar to amounts below overstory pines) increased intensities and durations of fires at ground level. Results included 1) short-term (one growing season) reductions in plant species richness, but no decreased seedling germination, 2) shifts in fungal communities, 3) slower decomposition of fine fuels, but 4) no changes in soil nutrients. Increasing fire intensity produced stronger effects on fungal communities and decomposition than did increases in numbers of fires, but the reverse characterized plant communities.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Third</span>, we examined how variations in fire intensity might influence plant germination and growth through fire-induced changes in soil. In the greenhouse, we planted seeds of pairs of more-pyrophilic and less-pyrophilic pine savanna plant species in soil from reduction, control, addition pine needle treatments. We compared effects of fire intensity mediated through soil biota + chemistry and soil chemistry alone by autoclaving soil to remove soil biota. Overall, more-pyrophilic grasses, forbs, and shrubs germinated and grew rapidly compared to less-pyrophilic counterparts, which likely aids rapid post-fire responses.
