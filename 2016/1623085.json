 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) through Targeted Infusion Projects supports the development, implementation, and study of evidence-based innovative models and approaches for improving the preparation and success of HBCU undergraduate students so that they may pursue STEM graduate programs and/or careers. The project at Tennessee State University (TSU) seeks to enhance the curricula of the Departments of Biological Sciences, and Agricultural and Environmental Sciences and promote interaction between the students and faculty of the two departments. The proposed activities will enhance integration of research and education in the biology, ecology and environmental sciences (BEES), and provide research opportunities for students through formal instruction and independent research projects. These activities will stimulate students' research interests, enhance their research skills, prepare them for graduate studies, and build a more diverse workforce in BEES. These activities will also increase the retention rate of undergraduate students in Biological, and Agricultural and Environmental Sciences at TSU. Over the three years of the project, more than 300 students enrolled in Biology, Ecology, and other Environmental Sciences courses will benefit directly from this project.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to enhance undergraduate education in the biology, ecology and environmental sciences (BEES). The proposed project will: 1) improve the undergraduate curriculum and course contents by developing and incorporating new research-related course materials; 2) develop a team-oriented and research skill-based multi-disciplinary learning course involving biology, ecology, plant and soil, and environmental sciences; and 3) provide hands-on research experience to undergraduate students through participation in faculty research projects at the TSU Agricultural Education and Research Center (TSU-AREC). This project will significantly improve undergraduate students' training in BEES, and prepare them for graduate studies and a competitive workforce.",
