 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the Young Mathematicians Conference (YMC) to be held at Ohio State University annually over a three year period.  YMC provides a venue for undergraduate students to present and disseminate the results of their research, discuss mathematics with their peers and with senior researchers, and receive serious recognition of their achievements. Besides dissemination of undergraduate research activity in mathematics and facilitating exchange of ideas, another primary mission of YMC is to inspire and encourage students, particularly women and traditionally underrepresented groups, to pursue mathematics as a career. \r\n\r\nEach July, student researchers submit abstracts of their research projects, which are then judged and ranked by a panel of 40-70 faculty reviewers; the top ranked students, and their mentors, are invited to participate to YMC. The conference takes place during a weekend in August, from Friday noon until Sunday at noon. Besides the student talks (about 45, running in three parallel sessions) and a poster session, there are three plenary lectures delivered by world class mathematicians, aimed to introduce students to topics related to high impact, innovative research of current interest; videos of their talks are posted online. Representatives from about seven graduate schools introduce themselves and present their departments on Friday evening. A Graduate School Orientation event is held on Sunday morning where the Graduate Representatives answer the students' questions. Also on Sunday morning there is a Mentors' Breakfast where the mentors exchange ideas and information on undergraduate research. At all stages of preparation of the conference, the organizers seek advice, and then report back to the YMC Advisory Board.",
