A major challenge to realizing the therapeutic potential of these adult stem cells is their rapid depletion upon implantation at the site of tissue injury.  MSCs exhibit significant cell-to-cell variation in their capacity to survive upon implantation, but the molecular basis for this heterogeneity is poorly understood. The objective of this project is to gain insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying the heterogeneity in MSC survival.  This project helps to fulfill NSF's mission to advance the progress of science by generating fundamental knowledge about MSC survival at the molecular level. This knowledge has the potential to advance the stem cell field by developing novel methods to improve MSC survival. Greater MSC survival will overcome a critical barrier to achieve more effective MSC therapies.  This study is broadly relevant to other types of stem cells inasmuch as all stem cells are inherently heterogeneous.\r\n\r\nThis project addresses a critical need to improve the survival of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) upon implantation. Rapid depletion of the majority of implanted MSCs impedes their ability to regenerate tissue upon engraftment. The PI has detected considerable cell-to-cell variation in MSC survival. The objective of this proposal is to gain insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying the heterogeneity in MSC survival. The central hypothesis is that MSCs are an ensemble of distinct cell subsets with different capacity to survive due to differential expression of key signaling molecules.  This project is innovative in exploiting cellular heterogeneity to obtain unique insight into MSC survival on a molecular level.  Aim 1 will evaluate a novel cell-surface marker of MSC survival in vivo, using a xenoimplantation assay to quantify survival kinetics.  Aim 2 will employ bioinformatics to identify the first genome-wide gene signature of MSC survival, which will culminate in a binary classification model to predict MSC survival.  This research is anticipated to develop novel molecular-based strategies to increase survival.  Improving MSC survival is expected to have a positive impact on the therapeutic efficacy of engrafted MSCs.  In addition, complementary educational activities will contribute to the training of a diverse STEM workforce, including students underrepresented in STEM fields. The project will provide interdisciplinary training for graduate and undergraduate students through a unique bioengineering curriculum and collaborative research, a hands-on laboratory experience with stem cells for middle school students, and other outreach activities. Project results will be broadly disseminated to students, scholars and the general public.\r\nThis award by the Biotechnology and Biochemical Engineering Program of CBET is co-funded by the Mathematical Biology Program of the Division of Mathematical Sciences.",

A major challenge to realizing the therapeutic potential of MSCs is the rapid depletion of these cells upon implantation, resulting in limited engraftment.  There is significant heterogeneity in MSC survival.  A critical knowledge gap is that the molecular basis for this heterogeneity in MSC survival is poorly defined.  This gap impedes the ability to improve MSC survival and engraftment in injured tissue.\n\nDuring the grant period, the PI and her research group developed a single-cell assay to measure in vitro survival, which improves on current methods by enabling separate measurements of cell survival and colony formation.  NSF funding also supported the development of an in vivo survival assay that yields a survival half-life for MSC implants that is among the longest reported in the literature.  With these assays, the PI and her research group identified a potential marker of in vivo survival.  MSCs from a donor with higher marker expression had significantly longer in vivo survival than MSCs from a donor with lower marker expression.  When the MSCs were sorted based on a marker of cellular aging, the aging MSCs had an unexpectedly long survival, comparable to robust MSCs that were culture matched.\n\nThe cell surface markers investigated during the grant period have application to mitigating the variability in the survival and therapeutic effectiveness of MSC therapies.  First, the markers may have utility as predictive metrics to rapidly screen MSCs to identify individuals that would be good MSC donors.  They could be used as indicators to select culture conditions that would be favorable to the preparation of MSC therapies with enhanced survival and regenerative function.  Predictive markers can be used as quality control metrics during the manufacturing of MSC therapies to monitor cell composition.  Lastly, they can be used to identify new molecular targets to regulate MSC function by targeting downstream signaling pathways.\n\nThe broader impacts of this study extend to other types of stem cells because all stem cells are intrinsically heterogeneous.  This project developed human resources by (1) providing interdisciplinary training for graduate and undergraduate students through a unique bioengineering curriculum and collaborative research, and (2) fostering the interest of high school students in stem cell technology with hands-on research and coursework for credit towards college.  Through this and other outreach activities, project outcomes were broadly disseminated to students, scholars and the public at large.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/20/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Kim C O'connor"
