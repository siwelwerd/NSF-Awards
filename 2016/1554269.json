 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support the development of new analytical techniques to optimize the application of the newest generation electron microprobes on the market today. These instruments provide chemical composition data at scales less than one micrometer, which is crucial to unraveling the history of many earth science processes.  This research and development project has significant potential impacts for providing guidance to utilization of these instruments for research being performed at the University of Wisconsin, in other NSF-funded facilities, and elsewhere around the world.  The project will employ a postdoctoral research student for two years.\r\n\r\nProjects supported by this new instrument include many studies of deep-crustal processes: petrogenesis\r\nof magmatic systems, causes of explosive volcanic eruptions, conditions of granulite and of eclogite facies metamorphism, the genesis of economic deposits of metals and fossil fuels, tectonics of major shear zones, Hadean zircons, and meteoritics.  Studies of near surface processes include: astrobiology, paleoclimatology (biogenic carbonates and foraminifera, speleothems), diagenesis and basin evolution, cementation in shallow fault zones, and nano-minerals.",

These electrons scatter left and right, up and down, in the sample, and some will generate X-rays which then can be detected and counted. These counts are compared to the counts of a reference material (\"standard\") which is treated in the exact same manner, and after some physics is applied to these numbers, a chemical composition is output by the computer. This study examined what happens when the electron beam energy is dropped from 15,000 volts to 7,000 volts. One critical factor is that when iron (Fe) present, the chemical analysis become much more complicated, as the normal X-ray line typically used (K-alpha) is no longer available, as there is not enough energy to cause its generation. Rather, a much weaker iron X-ray, Fe L-alpha, must be used, and its use is much more complicated. A key part of this research project is to determine a creative approach to using this X-ray, particularly in geological materials, such as the mineral olivine. Post-doctoral research Moy and PI Fournelle were successful in determining an innovative, somewhat non-traditional approach which harkened back to the original work of Castaing, using a quasi-empirical calibration curve, which they showed to have some interesting features -- such as being universally true for all electron microprobes with a certain geometry (\"40 degree takeoff angle\", which is the case for all modern instruments). This differs from all other measurements, which are only valid for each instrument.
