The program stimulates interest in the mathematical sciences through research on accessible and open research problems. This program targets students at an earlier stage of their undergraduate studies and provides a research opportunity for those students who might otherwise have decided against a career in the mathematical sciences before ever learning about the exciting opportunities and challenges present in mathematics research.\r\n\r\nEach year, nine promising undergraduates are selected to participate. Students learn to read research articles; to formulate conjectures and construct examples; to program simulations; to concentrate, listen, and ask questions; to generalize and simplify proofs; and to disseminate their discoveries. Students are immersed in an environment where the mathematical ideas are new and not fully understood. Students work in one of three separate research groups. Students present their progress on a weekly basis. Students present at regional and national conferences on undergraduate research. Students write a research article suitable for submission to an appropriate mathematics or science journal. Students' discoveries contribute to many fields of mathematics research: computational biology and modeling, combinatorial games, combinatorial knot theory, recursive polynomials, analysis of large data sets in biology, and others.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project supported the 2018 Summer Undergraduate Research Institute in Experimental Mathematics (SURIEM), an eight week summer REU program for undergraduate students in the mathematical sciences. The program was hosted at Michigan State University (MSU) from May 27 through July 21, 2018. Eighteen students participated in the 2018 SURIEM program.  For eight weeks, these students and their graduate student and faculty mentors worked on research problems in the mathematical sciences.  The stated objectives were to (1) stimulate interest in the mathematical sciences through research on accessible and open research problems, (2) target students at an earlier stage of their undergraduate studies, (3) provides a research opportunity for students who show promise for success in the mathematical sciences but who are not committed to such a career path.  \n\n\nAll of the projects in the 2018 program fit these criteria.  Projects were designed to be accessible to students who had only completed a year or two of study of mathematics at the level of calculus or above.  All of the projects were investigations of current open research problems, not classroom projects or summaries of earlier research. The 2018 projects were as follows: Combinatorial Neural Codes (lead mentors: Davis and Mavi), Learning Functions of Many Variables via Compressive Sensing (lead mentor: Iwen), Gordian Adjacency for Positive Braids (lead mentor: Raoux), Biostatistics and Neuroscience (lead mentor: Reimers), and Trapping Stochastic Movers (lead mentor: Schenker).  Each student was placed in one of these groups after the end of the first week.  Thereafter, students worked in teams of two to five students and were mentored by both graduate students and MSU faculty.  Students gave weekly presentations about their project.  \n\n\nThere were 179 applications to the 2018 program.  Each participant was at an early stage of their study of mathematics, many participants indicated an uncertain career trajectory, and several participants were from underrepresented groups.  This information was discerned from questions asked of each applicant in their application.  Additionally, students were generally at an earlier stage of their study as measured by class rank (majority second year students).  Almost half of the students did not attend research universities with the highest level of research activity.  All showed exceptional promise as demonstrated by academic transcripts and two letters of recommendation from previous instructors or mentors.  \n\n\nThe participants were rapidly introduced to the five research topics and then sorted into one by the end of the first week.  The remaining seven weeks were spent engaged in intensive research.  Participants in each research group presented project updates every week.  At the end of the program, their results were shared at the regional REU conference, the Summer Undergraduate Michigan Mathematics Research (SUMMR) Conference, which was hosted by MSU this year and was attended by REU students from two other REU Sites and a smaller number of students from two other regional universities.  After the end of the REU, most students shared their research at national and regional conferences, including Mathfest (August 2018), Joint Mathematics Meetings (January 2019), Nebraska Conference for Undergraduate Women in Mathematics (January 2019).  Every research group produced a final technical report, and some groups have submitted articles to the arXiv and to research journals.  \n\n\nThe PIs continue to track past participants in the SURIEM program to measure the success of the project in providing research opportunities to students at an early stage of their studies who otherwise might not have chosen a research career the mathematical sciences.  \n\n\nFrom the 2016 program supported by this NSF Award, 38 percent of the participants were from non-doctoral granting universities and an additional 15 percent were not from doctoral universities with the highest level of research activities.  Ten of eighteen of these students attend or will begin graduate programs in the mathematical sciences as of July 2019, and one went directly into the workforce in the mathematical sciences.  \n\n\nFrom the 2017 program---a smaller group of nine students---three have graduated and two of these are in graduate programs or conducting research at a national lab.  The PIs are committed to tracking thecareer paths of these students, current students, and future studentsin the SURIEM program.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/24/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Robert W Bell"
