 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports participation in a conference entitled \"Geometric and Probabilistic Methods in Group Theory and Dynamical Systems,\" held from November 9 to November 12, 2015, in College Station, TX, on the campus of Texas A&M University.   Geometric, topological, and probabilistic methods are often used in the study of groups and dynamical systems. The conference will provide an opportunity to all participants to keep abreast of recent developments simultaneously in all five of these components (geometry, topology, probability, group theory, dynamics), with special emphasis on their interplay.  There will be close to 100 participants, who will present 16 invited talks and 45 contributed talks. At least half of the contributed talks will be presented by researchers in early stages of their careers and graduate students. The mixture of participants, ranging from some of the world's most established researchers to postdocs and graduate students, will provide a sense of community and continuity. The conference, blending research and education, will stimulate healthy communication flow and collaboration between researchers in different areas and in different generations for years to come.\r\n\r\nThe wealth of ideas and applications related to the use of geometric and/or probabilistic approaches in group theory and dynamical systems is immense, and it practically touches all other areas in mathematics. Many important open problems in group theory and dynamical systems are essentially related to asymptotic, geometric, analytic or probabilistic concepts. The conference will showcase the recent advances and achievements related to such problems and it will provide strong momentum and set directions for further research in such diverse areas as amenability, virtual Haken conjecture, CAT(0) cube complexes, random groups and random subgroups, Borel equivalence relations and cost, sofic groups, interval exchange groups, iterated monodromy groups, and many others.
