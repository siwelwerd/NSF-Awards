COSMO is the premier international series of cosmology conferences. It started with a meeting in Ambleside, Lake District, UK in 1997. It is in its 20th edition this year when it is hosted by the Department of Physics at the University of Michigan. The organizers expect ~250 participants from around the world. The program will be headlined by a number of distinguished plenary speakers, and will include dark matter, dark energy, inflation, and gravitational waves, among other topics. The organizers will pay particular attention to ensuring that the plenary and parallel-session speakers come from a sufficiently diverse pool.",
