 "awd_abstract_narration": "EAGER: Enhancing Solar Energy Conversion by Slowing Diffusion in Photonic Nanostructures\r\n\r\nNontechnical Description: \r\nSolar Photovoltaics (PV) is the fastest growing sector among renewable energy technologies. Most modern solar cells utilized in deployed systems are made from either crystalline silicon (Si) or thin-film semiconductor materials. Crystalline Si cells are more efficient at converting sunlight to electricity, but generally feature higher manufacturing costs. On the other hand, thin-film materials typically have lower conversion efficiencies but are simpler and less costly to manufacture. The increasing materials cost and the growing demands of the Si solar industry have driven a dramatic reduction of the absorbing cell thickness. However, due to their small absorption length, thin-film solar cells have a limited conversion efficiency that needs to be substantially increased in order to become competitive on the global market. This EAGER research will address the fundamental challenges of thin-film PV solar energy conversion by developing a novel photonics-led approach that boosts the optical absorption in Si layers with thickness less than 100nm. Our ambitious goal will be accomplished by designing, fabricating and testing a novel class of photonic nanostructures that are capable of trapping solar radiation by slowing down optical diffusion by design. The PI anticipates that the impact of this EAGER program will be distributed across the solar energy industry and in the field of integrated silicon optoelectronics. In particular, the research will create novel device principles that can also be used to improve the performances of photodetectors and optical sensors integrated on planar chips. The educational activities of this project are designed to integrate sustainable energy topics and nanophotonics research into the education of graduate, undergraduate, and high school students, as well as high school teachers. \r\n\r\nTechnical Description: \r\nThe specific objective of this exploratory EAGER project is to create, design and engineer a novel nanophotonic-driven approach to efficiently couple incident radiation into sub-wavelength semiconductors films and dramatically enhance their photon absorption rate, irrespective of polarization, over a broad range of wavelengths and incident angles. Differently from well-established photonic crystals, randomly textured surfaces or grating-enhanced solar cells, which suffer from polarization sensitivity, require a small range of incident directions, and rely on limited increase of the photon path length within the absorbing medium, this novel strategy builds on a fundamentally different photon transport mechanism, known as logarithmic photon sub-diffusion. This approach combines for the first time ultraslow (i.e., logarithmic) photon transport phenomena in dielectric nanostructures with isotropic scattering in aperiodic systems in order to achieve efficient PV solar energy conversion without relying on the excitation of photonic narrowband resonances. The ultraslow anomalous photon diffusion regime will be engineered using Si and SiN nanostructures fabricated by magnetron sputtering and standard nanolithography over large areas covered by designed aperiodic patterns that create correlated photon walks across the active regions of thin-film poly-Si and a-Si cells. While focusing the efforts on Si for ease of integration, cost-effectiveness and technological scalability, this concept can similarly be applied to alternative semiconductor material platforms as well, such as third-generation solar cells materials. Leveraging sub-diffusive photon anomaly in engineered aperiodic photonic media offers unique performance advantages, such as non-resonant operation, tunable photon diffusion length, insensitivity to incident angles and polarization. This research is interdisciplinary and potentially transformative as it creates sub-diffusive solar energy converters based on a completely novel and tunable photonic mechanism for ultra-thin film PV devices.",

The main task of the project was to design, characterize, and experimentally test a novel class of photonic semiconductor nanostructures based on Si compatible materials that are capable of efficiently redirecting solar energy radiation into thin absorbing amorphous Si films. Differently from conventional photonic solar cells approaches, our methods aims at increasing the residence times of long-wavelength photons inside thin absorbing layers with engineered optical scattering and light diffusion properties, potentially resulting in broader frequency bandwidths for enhanced photon absorption at significantly reduced materials costs. This approach is particularly useful for enhancing the absorption of low-energy near-infrared photons that will be otherwise completely lost to the solar energy conversion processes using traditional cell designs. While focusing our efforts on Si for ease of integration, cost-effectiveness and technological scalability, the developed concepts can also be applied to alternative semiconductor material platforms, such as third-generation solar cells materials. <strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p class=\"default\">The project outcomes and intellectual merit are subdivided into three main categories: (a) theoretical understanding of fractional photon transport and novel photonic states for enhanced light absorption; (b) design and experimental characterization of low-loss nanostructures with large-angle scattering behavior, and (c) novel materials development for transparent contacts and photonics solar cells integration. These combined activities led us to design and demonstrate novel photonic structures for solar energy harvesting that use transparent semiconductor materials to efficiently couple solar incident radiation isotropically into a thin (hydrogenated) amorphous Si absorbing layer. We fabricated optimal nanostructured surfaces using TiO<sub>2</sub> large-scale nano-pillar arrays using Electron Beam Lithography (EBL) in combination with reactive ion etching and experimentally characterized their scattering and absorption properties when integrated on the substrate of solar cell devices. Optical absorption enhancement of up to 5X (from 700nm to 800nm) was experimentally demonstrated on optimized devices using designed isotropic scattering arrrays. We then developed novel Si-compatible transparent contact materials using sputtering deposition for photonic solar cell structures. These include Indium Tin Oxide (ITO) conductive materials with tunable metallic behavior from the near-infrared to the mid-infrared spectral range. Using sputtering deposition, we additionally developed a novel materials platform based on Si-doped Indium Oxide (ISO) and demonstrated enhanced resonant absorption (&gt; 3 times) and significantly reduced surface roughness compared to ITO films of the same thickness, which is a major step for the integration with thin-film Si solar cell devices. We also investigated Si-compatible nitride materials with tunable plasmon-enhanced optical absorption and experimentally demonstrated double-plasmon responses with broadband behavior using Si-doped titanium oxynitride materials. These materials are promising candidates to achieve broadband plasmonic-enhanced absorption resonances across the visible spectrum. The fundamental knowledge acquired during this EAGER project in relation to the synthesis of materials with novel optical dispersion properties and the interdisciplinary methods of fractional calculus to anomalous transport in photonics devices constitute a substantial<strong> intellectual merit </strong>leading to novel principles that promise to boost the efficiency of broadband photodetectors, large-angle couplers, sub-wavelength thin-film optical sensors on a planar chip, and novel types of optical lasers that reach well beyond the engineering applications of solar energy conversion.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"default\"><strong>Broader Impact:</strong>&nbsp;Our combined numerical and experimental research creates novel device principles and components used to boost the efficiency of broadband photodetectors, large-angle and omnidirectional photonic couplers, as well as sub-wavelength thin-film optical sensors on planar chips.
