 "awd_abstract_narration": "Two of the oldest areas of mathematics are number theory and geometry.  Number fields play a central role in number theory, while surfaces play a central role in geometry.  The research project concerns number fields that arise naturally from the geometry of surfaces, via a construction dating back to work of the mathematician Adolph Hurwitz around 1900.  These Hurwitz number fields have a combination of properties that is very unusual from a purely number-theoretic point of view: their degrees and Galois groups are typically very large, while their sets of ramifying primes are very small.  In fact, Hurwitz number fields are so extreme with respect to these invariants that their existence contradicts a heuristic that has successfully guided other recent research into number fields. The goal of this research project is to establish that these outlying number fields all behave in a uniform and highly structured way. The results of the project are expected to support future developments interrelating several disciplines surrounding number theory.  The project includes collaborations with three undergraduates, designed specifically to better prepare them for scientific careers. These collaborations will serve as models for future involvement of students in high-level mathematics research.\r\n\r\nHurwitz number fields arise as fields of definition of maps for Riemann surfaces to the Riemann sphere. The main focus of the research project will be on the explicit description of ramification in an arbitrary Hurwitz number field.  From the geometric data defining the field, one can read off a finite set of primes outside of which ramification is known to be tame.  The project will pursue exact formulas for ramification at these tame primes and sharp upper bounds for the wild ramification at the remaining primes.  Besides studying ramification, the investigator will aim to establish a geometric analog of a conjecture on the unboundedness of degrees for a given set of ramifying primes. In a different direction, where the set of ramifying primes is allowed to grow, the investigator aims to demonstrate further uniformity of behavior by finding multi-indexed sequences of multivariate polynomials that define infinitely many Hurwitz number fields at once.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe title of the project, \"Hurwitz Number Fields\", refers to number fields coming from geometry.   They are interesting number fields because they have a combination of properties which one might think is not possible from a purely number-theoretic viewpoint.  \n\nEarly in the grant period, the PI put three computational papers in their final form. An example from the paper Hurwitz Number Fields illustrates the two properties in tension.  This example is given by a degree 1200 polynomial with Galois group as big as possible and discriminant only divisible by the primes 2, 3, and 5.   From a purely number-theoretic viewpoint, one might have expected that such polynomials involving just the primes 2, 3, and 5 would exist only through degree about 150.  Modern computers and algorithms make Hurwitz number fields very tangible despite their large size.  For example, the discriminant of this degree 1200 number field is exactly -25595  32747 51087 .  The other computational papers likewise contain many examples near the limit of computational feasibility.  Hurwitz-Belyi Maps is more geometrical and A three-parameter family of Hurwitz-Belyi maps is more in the spirit of special functions.  \n\nThe project's main goal to understand Hurwitz number fields more theoretically is still ongoing.  However the project's secondary goal of making progress in related areas of mathematics, mostly with collaborators, has resulted in a number of completed works.    Artin L-functions of small conductor and Mixed degree number field computations, both with John Jones, were completed early in the grant period.   Two papers on number-theoretic aspects of modular forms, Newforms with rational coefficients and PGL2 number fields with rational companion forms were written at this time.  Towards the end of the grant period Abelian surfaces with fixed 3-torsion with Frank Calegari and Shiva Chidambaram generalized known results from elliptic curves to abelian surfaces.  Like all of the works just mentioned, it was computationally intensive: a key quantity in the elliptic curve cases involves 14 terms, but its analog in the abelian surface case has 1,727,927 terms. \n\nAn unexpected collaboration with the mathematical physicist David Broadhurst was begun in the grant period and resulted in two short works, both representing connections between number theory and physics.  L-series and Feynman integrals numerically computed L-functions associated to certain Feynman diagrams.  Previously this had been done in a context involving up to n=8 Bessel functions.  By placing the situation in a broader motivic context, the authors let n be arbitrary and carried out computations up through n=20.   In Quadratic relations between Feynman integrals, the authors obtained very general conjectural quadratic relations by interpreting  Feynman integrals as intertwining Betti and de Rham cohomologies.  The vision presented in these two short works has recently been rigorously established in two long very sophisticated works. Zhou's proofs use differential equations while Fresan-Sabbah-Yu's proofs use algebraic geometry.  \n\nThe remaining works completed in the grant period are in a longstanding area of interest of the PI, hypergeometric motives.    Very different aspects of hypergeometric motives are treated in two short works, The explicit formula and a motivic splitting and Hypergeometric supercongruences.  The latter, joint with Fernando Rodriguez Villegas, has helped spark a resurgence of interest in supercongruences.  At the very end of the grant period, Rodriguez Villegas and the PI submitted Hypergeometric Motives, a brief but reasonably comprehensive introduction to the general subject.  Some of the topics highlighted in this survey, like source varieties and Hodge numbers, are in the realm of algebraic geometry.   But other topics, like explicit polynomials for hypergeometric Belyi maps and the close study of ramifying primes, are very close to the PI's work in Hurwitz number fields.  \n\nThroughout the grant period, the PI was involved in several ways in a highly collaborative project called the L-functions and modular forms database or LMFDB.  This project centers on building a massive database of number-theoretic objects.  It is aimed at a broad spectrum of users, from undergraduate math majors to professional mathematicians. The PI's main previous work with Jones is the starting point for some of its largest sections.  During the grant period, the PI was involved in two week-long efforts to create a hypergeometric motive section, gave talks on involving more exotic L-functions and understanding their distribution via Plancherel measure, and explained the usefulness of the LMFDB to junior researchers in Latin America in three lectures at a summer school in Argentina.\n\nAll works referenced here, and also slides from presentations representing other works in progress, are available at the PI's homepage, www.davidproberts.net .\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/29/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: David P Roberts"
