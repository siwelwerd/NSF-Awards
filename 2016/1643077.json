The meeting was organized and will be chaired by two graduate students.  The format of the meeting is a combination of talks and posters, which will promote scientific exchange in both formal and informal settings. A special concluding panel discussion with researchers from academia, industry and government will focus on future careers in the field.  There will be ample opportunity for sharing latest research results and for exploring collaborative possibilities. \r\n\r\nDNA topoisomerases play crucial roles in chromosome dynamics during the processes of DNA replication and transcription. The field of topoisomerase research is especially diverse, encompassing aspects of physics, chemistry, structural biology, nanobiology, microbiology, biochemistry, drug discovery, cancer biology, and medicine. Recent advances in the field reflect this diversity and will be highlighted in this conference. Topics for discussion will include technological innovations that allow dissection of enzyme-DNA interactions, application of structural biology approaches to understand enzyme dynamics and mechanisms, and use of imaging and other technologies to reveal cellular roles for these enzymes that could enable development of novel tools for controlling their activities. Cutting-edge or late-breaking research will be highlighted in short talks chosen from the abstracts and in posters. Special attention has been given to encourage participation by scientists from underrepresented groups. The conference will provide an excellent forum to promote discussion between early-career scientists with common professional interests, to foster exchange of ideas across this exciting field, and to enable scientific collaborations to evolve in new directions.",
