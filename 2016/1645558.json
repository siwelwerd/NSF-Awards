 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Advanced Accelerator Concepts (AAC) Workshop is a biannual topical meeting under the auspices of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers. The AAC series of workshops is a major forum for the U.S. accelerator physics, engineering and technology community for the exchange and promulgation of the most advanced new ideas and concepts over the widest areas of application. An important part of maintaining this long term mission is the strong participation of students in the Workshop, where they become a part of the larger community of experts working for the continued evolution of new and unique accelerator physics concepts and technologies.\r\n\r\nThis award will enable student participation for approximately 14 US PhD students to attend and present the results of their work at the 17th Advanced Accelerator Concepts Workshop at the Gaylord Hotel and Conference Center, National Harbor, Maryland from July 31 thru August 5, 2016. This meeting is expected to attract more than 250 accelerator scientists and engineers. Critical aspects of a vigorous and productive research community are communication of progress, stimulation of innovative approaches, and training of students.  This is done in part through conferences and workshops, where the AAC series of workshops has been a world recognized forum for communication on progress in accelerator development and innovation bringing together mature scientists, post docs and graduate students from all over the world.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe 2016 Workshop on Advanced Accelerator Concepts (AAC) was held at the Gaylord Hotel and Conference Center, National Harbor, Maryland, from July 31 through August 5, 2016.  The workshop was the seventeenth in a biennial series that began at Los Alamos National Laboratory in 1982.  It was organized under the sponsorship of the IEEE Council on Superconductivity with financial support from the National Science Foundation and the U. S. Department of Energy, Office of High Energy Physics.\n\nThe scope of the AAC16 Workshop addressed a broad range of topics related to advancing accelerator science and technology beyond its  current scientific and technical limits.  The meeting agenda focused on cross-disciplinary discussions of relevant advanced, current research concepts, including progress in plasma acceleration methods, new methods of particle acceleration and high energy photon generation, techniques for production of ultra-high accelerating gradients, diagnostics and control of particle and photon beams, radio frequency accelerating sources, advanced computational techniques, and the development of very high peak power and high repetition rate lasers.\n\nEach day?s schedule began with plenary sessions covering broader relevant research interests or general tutorial topics, as selected by the Program Committee, followed by a break out into eight more narrowly focused working groups.  Each of the Working Groups operated under a prepublished statement of topical focus, scope of discussion and goals approved\nby the Workshop Organizing Committee.  A more detailed description of the Working Groups and their individual charters is available on the Workshop website at http://aac2016.org.  A summary of each Working Group?s activities\nand conclusions is included in the Workshop Proceedings published as American Institute of Physics (AIP) Conference Proceedings, Volume #1812, and available  as an on line open source document at  http://aip.scitation.org/toc/apc/1812/1.\n\nThe scope of the AAC Workshop has grown since 1982 and is now an internationally acknowledged forum for interdisciplinary discussions on\nadvanced accelerator and beam physics/technology concepts.  AAC16 continued the trend of growing worldwide participation and had a total of 256 attendees comprising (including the U.S.) representatives from 11 countries representing 65 different institutions. \n\nIt has been a long tradition of the AAC workshops to encourage strong student participation.  This is accomplished in part by subsidizing student attendance, done for this work shop by using funds from the DOE and National Science Foundation to significantly reduce student registration fees. As a result the registered student participation was 75 persons, or 29% of the total attendance of 256 persons, the highest percentage student enrollment the Workshop has ever had.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/05/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: David F Sutter"
