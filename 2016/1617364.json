 "awd_abstract_narration": "Tens of millions of hectares of land has changed hands in the last decade in a large number of lower-income countries, with the UK, China, and the US being among the largest sources of land investments. Control over land enables investors to cultivate new commodity crops, deploy new agricultural practices and technologies, and sell output for new uses and in new markets - with associated impacts on food-energy security, human well-being, and ecological processes. The scale and pace of changes in land ownership and access has increased rapidly in lower-income tropical countries. The project will assess outcomes of land transactions in Ethiopia - a country that has witnessed thousands of transactions and has substantial external investment, including from the United States - to identify when land transactions generate positive versus negative outcomes. This research will focus in particular on agricultural, ecological, and food and energy security outcomes. The project will generate new data that will be available for public use by other scholars and researchers, train scientists in the United States and build greater research capacity among international collaborators, and produce findings that will hold practical interest for decision makers in government agencies, NGOs, and donor organizations. Generalizable propositions about the impacts of land tenure changes on farm level processes, producer incentives, and labor practices will be of interest to US investors in other regions. \r\n\r\nThe project will focus in particular on quantifying the nature and extent of socioeconomic, land cover/change and ecological impacts, and modeling the causal sequences and feedback loops of land transactions. The research will advance the conceptual understanding of how tenure and institutional changes on land drive human-nature interactions and impacts in coupled agro-ecological systems. The project will aggregate and leverage existing socioeconomic datasets, and collect original social and ecological data from eight transaction sites. The research will contribute in three major ways towards an improved understanding of the effects of land transactions and the social and ecological effects of land tenure changes. It will: (1) Develop new theoretical insights into the livelihood, land use, and ecological effects of land tenure changes and displacement through integration, quantitative analyses, and agent based modeling based on multi-level social, economic, ecological, and biophysical data; (2) Enhance existing methods to understand and detect changes in land cover using remote sensing data for both agricultural and forest landscapes, particularly for the drier eastern African region; and (3) Improve statistical analysis and computer simulations-based predictions, in particular by developing better spatial analysis techniques. Overall, the project will show how varying patterns of livelihood and land cover changes result from land transition pathways associated with land transactions.",

The research generated novel data for all outcome domains of LSLTs. We harmonized existing social and tenure datasets with new survey-based data and remote sensed data products. Our team used sophisticated statistical methods to advance knowledge frontiers about the relationship between property rights and agricultural development. Our analyses pinpointed the diverse causal mechanisms that link land tenure with socio-environmental changes and heterogeneous socioeconomic effects across social groups. Our efforts led to more than 20 peer-reviewed papers (of which four are in Nature journals), 2 integrated datasets, and two courses in addition. The project supported training and successful dissertations for four PhD students. We mentored four postdoctoral fellows. These researchers have secured jobs since (Five in university settings and others in government or NGO offices).</p>\n<p>At the global level, our research mapped the distribution of LSLTs and the major countries involved in them (figure 1).</p>\n<p>Because a substantial proportion of LSLTs are located in forested areas, their effects on additional terrestrial emissions from land clearing and subsequent agricultural production are substantial (figure 2).</p>\n<p>Our scenario analyses show that agricultural development in transacted areas has the potential to substantially worsen greenhouse gas emissions, and that small changes towards sustainable intensification has substantial potential to reduce emissions and improve agricultural output (figure 2).</p>\n<p>To advance causal analysis of the economic effects of land transactions through agricultural change, we first mapped the agricultural suitability of land in Ethiopia (figure 3) and used the new dataset we created for a series of analyses that assessed the different mechanisms through which effects of LSLTs unfold (Figure 3)</p>\n<p>Our research focused on the differential effects of land transactions on specific social groups to highlight their social outcomes. We find that women, lower-income farmers, and smaller landowners are particularly disadvantaged by LSLTs. Although countries pursue agricultural investments in transacted lands with the goal of improved agricultural incomes productivity, our research shows that less powerful and worse off community members are asymmetrically disadvantaged by land transactions. Women saw their work burden and labor demands increase (Figure 4).</p>\n<p>Similarly, subsistence farmers suffered land dispossession. And lower income farmers and smaller landowners lost higher amounts of cultivated land and suffered greater declines in incomes even as the land transactions led to small increases in average incomes owing to higher crop prices (rather than increased productivity).</p>\n<p>NSF support has this helped us advance knowledge of the relationship between land tenure and agricultural development in four key areas. LSLTs are broadly distributed throughout the lower and middle income world, and are located in particular in remote and existing forested areas. They have increased the burden of global terrestrial emissions. LSLTs, despite hopes of governments in tropical countries, have had at best limited effects on agricultural productivity and increases in agricultural production. At the same time, they have led to reduced wellbeing for women and lower incomes for smaller landowners and farmers. These findings, based on new data, sophisticated modeling and statistical analyses, and use of causal inference approaches, create substantial room for governments to be cautious in pursuing agricultural investments through large scale land transactions.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 05/04/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Arun&nbsp;Agrawal</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1617364/1617364_10430012_1683207607868_Figure1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1617364/1617364_10430012_1683207607868_Figure1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1617364/1617364_10430012_1683207607868_Figure1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Distribution of LSLTs globally</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Agrawal, Brown, Southworth</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Arun&nbsp;Agrawal</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 1</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1617364/1617364_10430012_1683207675529_Figure2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1617364/1617364_10430012_1683207675529_Figure2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 2\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1617364/1617364_10430012_1683207675529_Figure2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 2\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Location of LSLTs in forested areas and their emissions potential</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Agrawal, Brown, Southworth</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Arun&nbsp;Agrawal</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 2</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1617364/1617364_10430012_1683207758254_Figure3--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1617364/1617364_10430012_1683207758254_Figure3--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 3\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1617364/1617364_10430012_1683207758254_Figure3--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 3\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Agricultural suitability in Ethiopia and causal mechanisms for LSLTs and Agricultural change</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Agrawal, Brown, Southworth</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Arun&nbsp;Agrawal</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 3</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1617364/1617364_10430012_1683207815167_Figure4--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1617364/1617364_10430012_1683207815167_Figure4--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 4\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1617364/1617364_10430012_1683207815167_Figure4--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 4\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">LSLT\ufffds lead to increasing work burden for women</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Agrawal, Brown, Southworth</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Arun&nbsp;Agrawal</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 4</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
