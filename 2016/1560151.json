 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports an REU program at James Madison University that will host eight undergraduates for eight-week terms three consecutive summers.  The program supports two cohorts consisting of a group of four students together with a pair of faculty who have complementary research programs.  Over the course of the summer, each group will progress from teaching/learning new topics in mathematics or statistics, to developing questions and conjectures, to proving results as part of an authentic research experience. Since faculty have distinct but related research interests, they are able to model supportive scientific collaboration for the students and discuss technical topics from different points of view.  The program will produce original research that is disseminated in peer-reviewed journal articles and talks at national, regional, and local professional meetings.\r\n\r\nOur faculty are well proportioned between mathematics, applied mathematics, and statistics.  We leverage this breadth to produce REU problems that lie on the intersection of two domains of knowledge, in which both faculty members are likely to be able to make significant contributions.  The intradisciplinary nature of the teams supports the student experience by putting the mentors on similar footing as the students insofar as each mentor will likely be teaching and learning something new. This interaction helps lower the barrier for student collaboration and increases intellectual risk-taking across the entire group, particularly in the initial stages of research.  It also immediately creates a group with a cohesive intellectual culture for students to interact in, both academically and socially.  Each group of students will complete the summer with a mathematical research presentation to faculty and peers. They will also be well prepared and strongly encouraged to present at local, regional and national meetings after the completion of the program.  When projects generate original and interesting results, students will be involved in the publication process from drafting technical writing to addressing peer-reviewed referee reports.  The program will recruit and select students from groups that are traditionally underrepresented in mathematics, as well as from institutions less likely to have resources available to support research activity.",
