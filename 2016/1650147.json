 "awd_abstract_narration": "The recognition that climatically modulated erosion acts to govern the development of active mountain ranges is arguably one of the most transformative conceptual shifts in the geosciences subsequent to the plate tectonic revolution. Topography in tectonically active regions results from an interplay among climatic, tectonic, and surface processes. The building of mountains increases topographic slopes, which directly influences the rate and efficiency of erosional processes. Rising landmasses can also influence climate by altering patterns of airflow and heating, influencing the magnitude and pattern of precipitation. Feedbacks between the redistribution of mass by climate-driven erosion can influence the state of stress, thermal structure, and subsequent deformation patterns within mountain belts, the very mechanisms that drive the growth of topography. The strength of these various interactions and coupling, however, is still contested. Furthermore, these processes have strong impacts on the well being of humans living in mountainous terrains. This project supports a U.S.-Taiwan workshop that would assess the current state of research and identify future interdisciplinary research directions. A key objective of the workshop is to increase partnerships between the U.S. and Taiwan through the development of collaborative research projects that benefit from research expertise in both countries, thereby strengthening research activities within each country while advancing understanding of the complex linkages among mountain building, climate, and surface processes. The participation of students and early-career scientists in the workshop will ensure the development of long-term collaborations that are mutually beneficial both from the perspective of the development of the scientific workforce and the exchange of scientific ideas. \r\n\r\nThis project supports the participation of U.S. based scientists in a U.S. Taiwan workshop, which will be held at Oregon State University in 2017. The overarching purpose of this workshop is to promote interdisciplinary research on the linkages and feedbacks among mountain building, climate, and surface processes. The active Coast and Cascade Ranges, which will be explored during pre- and post-meeting field trips, will provide the backdrop for the workshop. Specifically, the workshop goals are four-fold: (1) evaluate the current state of understanding in how feedbacks among climate, mountain building, and landscape evolution govern the trajectory of orogenic systems; (2) identify and refine research goals that capitalize on transdisciplinary approaches that will lead to the next set of advances in our understanding of coupled solid and fluid earth systems; (3) strengthen emerging collaborations between U.S. and Taiwan scientists and to foster the development of specific research strategies to address research goals; and (4) broaden the scope of research goals to include systems beyond the Taiwan orogeny and to increase participation from a broader swath of U.S. researchers. The workshop is organized around two key themes: \r\n\r\nThis project is supported by the Tectonics Program and the Geomorphology and Land Use Dynamics (both in the Earth Sciences Division, Geosciences Directorate) and NSF's Office of International Science and Engineering.",
