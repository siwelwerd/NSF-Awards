 "awd_abstract_narration": "Arecibo Observatory (AO) will host a summer Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site in Puerto Rico.  Undergraduates from across the country will be guided by AO staff as they complete research projects in radio astronomy, planetary science, atmospheric science, and in the supporting engineering and computing applications.  They will also participate in scientific seminars and professional development programs.  Students from the mainland will be exposed to the Puerto Rican culture and natural history through field trips and social activities.  A special effort will be made to recruit qualified Puerto Rican students, who are underrepresented within STEM fields.  The program includes local science teachers through a Research Experiences for Teachers program.\r\n\r\nThe main activity for all summer interns is to work on an original research project closely supervised by a staff member. Each participating mentor designs one or more well-defined projects that a student should be able to complete over a ten-week period. Projects may be either self-contained or form a part of a larger endeavor. Observatory staff give an introductory Summer Student Lecture series designed to introduce the students to the fundamental concepts of the science pursued at Arecibo and to the underlying methods employed in their research areas. Throughout the program, science seminars by staff and visiting scientists are also provided to broaden the scientific horizons of the students. As part of their program, students are strongly encouraged to attend a relevant scientific or technical meeting.",
