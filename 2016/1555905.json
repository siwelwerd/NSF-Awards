 "awd_abstract_narration": "One universal feature of life on earth is that the rate at which new species are formed varies widely across organisms. Features such as changes in life history, may be one explanation for the big differences among these rates. In insects, changes in diet, sociality, and mode of parasitism have been investigated for their impact on species formation.  However, very few groups of insects include species that have all of these life history traits, making it difficult to compare their individual impacts. The ants, wasps and bees (Aculeata) represent one such group; their numerous species exhibit a diversity of life histories.  The researchers will use new methods of genome sequencing to uncover the evolutionary relationships among the 65,000 described species of ants, wasps and bees. This research will provide important insights into differences in rates of speciation for a large group of organisms with sophisticated social systems (including ants, hornets, yellow jackets, honey bees and bumblebees) and the economically important group of pollinating insects (bees). This project will contribute significantly to the development of scientific expertise and improved infrastructure in the United States. It will provide training opportunities for undergraduate students, graduate students, and post-doctoral researchers in sophisticated methods of DNA sequencing, bioinformatics, computer programming, and phylogenetic analysis. Protocols and data will be made publically available. The project will develop a traveling public exhibit on the biodiversity, evolutionary history, and importance of our most important agricultural pollinators (bees).\r\n\r\nThe research team will take advantage of new technological innovations in DNA sequencing to generate massive data sets for resolving the relationships of the Aculeata. Using highly conserved regions of the genome (ultraconserved elements) they will enrich genomic libraries for genes of interest. These enriched libraries will then be subjected to sequencing using the latest sequencing technologies. Using bioinformatics tools, the data sets will be assembled, aligned, and analyzed to reconstruct the evolutionary relationships among aculeate taxa and determine where and when shifts in diversification took place.",

These fascinating insects include herbivores, predators, parasites, and pollinators. Aculeata also includes the three most important eusocial insect lineages (ants, apid and halictid bees, and vespid wasps) and is, therefore, a model group for investigating the evolutionary origins and history of eusociality. Aculeata is estimated to have originated in the late Jurassic or early Cretaceous, between 130 and 160 million years ago. Their evolutionary history is tied intimately to the diversification of the flowering plants, which radiated in the early to mid-Cretaceous. Bees, wasps, and ants have an extraordinary impact on human society. Wasps and ants are important biological control agents and major players in terrestrial ecosystems. Bees are essential for the maintenance of healthy ecosystems and the pollination of high value, agricultural crops. Seventy percent of flowering plants require animal-vectored pollination, and bees are by far the most important pollinators in most terrestrial ecosystems, including agroecosystems. Bee pollination alone contributes an estimated $170B to the global economy and $15.1B to US agricultural production annually. Our project significantly improved our understanding of the evolutionary history of wasps, ants and bees.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our project sought to resolve long-standing questions in the phylogeny and evolution of Aculeata, including how the major ant, wasp and bee lineages are evolutionarily related to each other, and how life history traits (such as predation, parasitism, and pollenivory) have impacted diversification. We used ultra-conserved elements (UCEs) -- short regions of highly-conserved DNA found in many organisms -- to reconstruct evolutionary relationships across all the major lineages of Aculeata. Our project generated 23 presentations at scientific meetings, 52 peer-reviewed publications, and one book. Over the course of the five-year project we analyzed phylogenetic relationships in all major lineages of Aculeata (Pompilidae, Mutillidae, Formicidae, Anthophila [=bees]) as well as related parasitic groups (Ichneumonidae, Braconidae, Cynipidae, Chalcididae). Our project contributed to faunistic studies of the neotropics as well as the desert southwest (Joshua Tree National Park) and we contributed to the development of methods related to the use of UCE data in phylogenetics.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Broader impacts</strong></p>\n<p>1.

Data deposition and infrastructure: Our project is contributing to the growth, curation, and development of three nationally and internationally recognized entomological research collections, including the Cornell University Insect Collection, the National Museum of Natural History, and the Utah State Insect Collection.

Our project also led to the deposition of significant amounts of DNA sequence data to public repositories, such as GenBank.</p>\n<p>3. Bees! Diversity, Evolution, and Conservation: In 2019, in collaboration with co-PI Rob Ross and other staff members at the Paleontological Research Institution (PRI) and Museum of the Earth, we developed a 1200 square foot exhibit which was open to the public from September 2019 to January 2021. The exhibit focused on the biology of the lesser-known bee species and emphasized the diversity of bees on earth. We covered many topics in the exhibit, including bee evolution and classification, the fossil record of bees, the nesting biology of bees, bee-flower relationships, social behavior, brood parasitism, rare and endangered bees, agriculturally important bees, threats to bees, and bee conservation. The exhibit has had a major impact, with 2500-3000 visitors/month during the museum's high season in spring and summer and over 10,000 visitors to the online version of the exhibit. Additional programming accompanied the exhibit, including (1) seminars as part of the PRI's annual Darwin Days celebration, (2) a New York State Master Teachers Program workshop at the Museum, (3) programming throughout the summer at PRI's Cayuga Nature Center focused on bees and bee biology.
