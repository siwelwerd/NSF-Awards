 "awd_abstract_narration": "Effective properties and structural performance of cementitious mixtures are substantially governed by the quality of the interphase region, because it acts as a bridge transferring forces between aggregates and a binding matrix, and is generally susceptible to damage. In spite of advancements made over the last several decades, understanding and modeling the interfacial region of cementitious mixtures still presents important challenges. As non-traditional additives such as recycled aggregates and alternative binding agents are more often used today, there is a growing need of fundamental knowledge to uncover interphase formation mechanisms and a resulting model to predict interphase properties. The goal of this research is to develop an experimental-computational method to identify and model the interphase region of cementitious materials. The successful application and dissemination of research findings is expected to significantly reduce costs, natural resources, and carbon dioxide emissions through the promotion of non-cement binding agents and secondary aggregates without compromising mechanical properties and structural performance. This project will improve education and training opportunities of underrepresented students and also impact current civil engineering practices, allowing for the development of more cost-effective mixture products that significantly increase the performance and sustainability of a wide range of structural materials.\r\n\r\nTo meet the goal, this research systematically integrates multiscale tests and the two-way coupled multiscale computational modeling with the following four specific objectives: 1) develop a multiscale experimental method to identify microstructure details and properties of the interphase zone in cementitious mixtures; 2) develop a two-way coupled computational multiscale model that involves nonlinear-inelastic material behavior; 3) integrate the experimental efforts with computational modeling to determine effective material properties of interphase region; and 4) validate-calibrate the modeling approach and extend it to other cases where mixture design variables are varied. This research will advance the fundamental understanding of cementitious mixtures, specifically the mechanical effects of interphase on entire mixture properties and performance. This research incorporates several intellectual significances including micromechanical-nanomechanical material characterization in multiple length-time scales and the two-way linked multiscale computation with nonlinear-inelastic material behavior. Successful completion of the project will provide significant key information that will advance current technology and knowledge on a broad range of multiphase particulate solids in which inelastic-nonlinear deformation, interface, and multiphysical loads are involved as primary energy dissipation and performance-controlling phenomena.",

Experimental efforts demonstrate that the integrated nanomechanical-chemical-microstructure characterization aided to better understand the time-dependent kinetics of cementitious binding materials and material specific interphase between cementitious materials and particles. By incorporating the multiscale experiments with the two-way linked multiscale computational modeling, it is also expected to unveil the unknown linkages between component properties and macroscale behavior of mixtures. Furthermore, our integrated experimental-computational multiscale approach can help identify challenging material properties, such as nanometer-scale viscoelasticity and micrometer-scale fracture properties, which are considered critical but not usually feasible to identify using conventional test methods.

Five journal papers were published and five more papers are currently under review. We also published nine conference articles, and one of them was selected as the Best Paper.

The REU students have been trained by graduate students and closely work with graduate students. Graduate students served mentors for REU students. All students participated in regular group meetings to share/discuss ideas and make practice presentations to develop oral communication skills. They also worked together to develop technical manuscripts on a regular basis which could improve writing skills.

Our goal was to introduce these young people to the STEM field, especially focused on the engineering aspect. Our team also organized an event in a Discover Engineering session at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln&nbsp;<em>Big Red Summer Camp</em>. For two days, high school students learn how the power of science and engineering can be used to solve world problems in energy, water, healthcare, or infrastructure. We conducted a bridge materials design activity allowing high school students to design and test the strength of bridges using conventional and alternative cementitious binding materials. This hands-on activity demonstrated how alternative construction materials may replace conventional materials and bring greener and more sustainable infrastructure for the future, and fundamental research in construction materials can improve all fields of civil engineering. All three activities were extremely successful, which was demonstrated by summative and formative survey results and their feedbacks during and after the events. Also, the PI reached junior/senior civil engineering students in his Civil Engineering Materials course to introduce green construction-building materials engineering. The activity was planned as a brief workshop within their lab session. The session included a presentation on geopolymer concrete and hands-on experiments in geopolymer mixture design, sample preparation, and nanoscale experiments.
