 "awd_abstract_narration": "Unraveling the mechanisms that govern the movement of individuals is key to understanding a major determinant of the fates of individuals, the structure and dynamics of populations, communities, ecosystems, and the evolution and diversity of life. Insects exhibit remarkable variation in flight and dispersal that are important to investigate because many insects are ecologically and economically important. In addition, studying the genetic to ecological factors that explain variation in flight and dispersal is fundamental because the evolution of flight presaged the most extensive animal radiation in evolutionary history. Selection by predators for enhanced flight performance to escape being eaten by their prey was intense during the evolution of winged animals, such as insects. Yet, a mechanistic understanding by which even contemporary predator-induced selection affects insect flight traits and subsequent dispersal ability, propensity, and the fate of dispersers is lacking. This research project will address this important knowledge gap by investigating how predatory fish affect flight traits and dispersal of insects, such as stoneflies, that live in rivers during one life stage and on land as winged insects during their final life stage. Through four linked objectives, this research will use observations, experiments, and a model to provide one of the first integrative studies of predator effects on flight traits at the biochemical, physiological, and morphological levels, to determine how these traits are ecologically linked to dispersal distance and directionality, and their interaction with landscape-scale habitats in river networks. In so doing, this study will transform understanding of contemporary selective agents on insect flight and dispersal.\r\n \r\nResults from this research will benefit society by providing information on factors affecting landscape-scale movements of adult aquatic insects, some of which are human pests or disease vectors, and will have implications for understanding the impacts of introduced predators on traits of prey species. Integrating research and education are key components of this project that will be achieved by training and mentoring at least 10 undergraduates, plus a graduate student, and exposing them to a vibrant research and teaching community at an internationally recognized field station. Public outreach activities informing non-scientists about the biology of freshwater organisms will be coordinated through the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory's Kid's Nature Camp, Adult Science Tours, and Citizen Science Geek Week.",

The results showed consistent differences between insects developing in streams with versus without predatory fish.  Biochemically, insects developing in streams with fish versus without fish differed in a metabolic enzyme that is linked to intense aerobic activities, such as flying.  In terms of their physiology, insects naturally developing in or experimentally transplanted into streams with fish had larger flight muscles and more a developed breathing system than the same species developing in streams lacking predatory fish.  Morphologically, insects naturally developing in or experimentally transplanted into streams with predatory fish had larger wings than the same species developing in streams with no predatory fish.  The combination of these characteristics enabled adult female stream insects developing in streams with predatory fish to disperse farther upstream and thus lay their eggs in areas of the stream network that typically lack predatory fish because of waterfalls and other barriers to fish upstream movement.  However, enhanced flight and dispersal characteristics had a cost, whereby insects developing in streams with fish produced fewer eggs and did not live as long compared to the same species in streams with no predatory fish.
