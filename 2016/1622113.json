 "awd_abstract_narration": "The weather we experience is driven by convection, sunlight warms the earth which heats the atmosphere which is cooled by the cold temperatures of outer space. Most people are not interested in microscopic behavior, for example the behavior of the individual molecules in the air, nor macroscopic behavior, such as worldwide average temperature. What is of interest are mesoscopic patterns, for example weather fronts which result in local changes in temperature. This interest in mesoscopic, as opposed to micro- or macroscopic features, of large scale systems occurs in a wide variety of complex large scale physical phenomena such as combustion in engines, dynamics of biomass in the oceans, ventricle fibrillation in a human heart, etc. These mesoscopic patterns take on many different shapes and sizes and change with time, sometimes slowly and sometimes rapidly. The form of these patterns and how they evolve in time is often very dependent on parameters. New technologies are greatly increasing our abilities to measure and simulate these physical phenomena, resulting in enormous data sets, but our ability to extract and quantify this information in a way that leads to understanding, predictability, and control of these systems is not keeping pace. We will explore the use of new mathematical tools to address this problem.\r\n\r\nThe spatial and temporal complexity of Rayleigh-B\u00e9nard convection produces high dimensional time series data.  A relatively new algebraic topological tool called Persistent Homology will be used to provide new tools for nonlinear dimension reduction. To ensure the applicability of these methods and that physically important mesoscopic features of the dynamics are preserved they will be developed in conjunction with the further development of carefully controlled high precision convection experiments and state-of-the-art, large scale, high-resolution numerical simulations of the Boussinesq equations. This includes the analysis of the geometry of covariant Lyapunov exponents. The new computational tools developed in this work should find broad application in a wide variety of problems involving complex nonequilibrium systems in nature (oceanic and atmospheric flows, climate and weather forecasting) and in technology (nonlinear optical systems, combustion and chemical reactions) where understanding and prediction of complex behavior is desired.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nComplex, irregular behaviors are found everywhere in nature and in technology; examples include rapidly changing  weather patterns, growth of needle-like structures triggering lithium battery fires and abnormal rhythms in a human heart.   Our ability to collect measurements or perform computations in these and many other settings  is growing so rapidly that it's outstripping our ability harness this information in ways that \nlead to meaningful understanding, prediction and/or control.  In this project, we sought to develop new tools, based on mathematical methods to describe shape (topology), to efficiently and quantitatively harness large data sets to describe how complex systems evolve in time.  These tools were developed in a specific fluid flow problem (thermal convection, in which motion arises when warm fluid rises and cold fluid sinks) and applied to both laboratory measurements and computer simulations of such flows .  The tools we developed in this work could find broad application in a wide variety\nof problems in real world fluid flows and other non-fluid real world problems where understanding and prediction of complex behavior is desired.  Additionally the tools we developed impact the education of the next generation of scientists and engineers, who will be faced with understanding and solving new problems involving complex behaviors.  \n\n \n\nTwo main types of tools were developed in this work.  First, we devised a method to quantify the topology of a complex convective flow could be applied equally well to flows observed in the laboratory or flows that are simulated on the computer.   By applying this method to each case (a lab flow and a computed flow), we were able to show quantitatively that key physics that was present in the real world lab flow was not accounted for in the computed flow.   This quantification is very useful in helping devise new computer simulations of convective flow that better describe what's happening in the lab.  The tools developed in this setting could be useful in developing better weather forecasts.  Second, we devised a method using topological tools to efficiently identify when a complex behavior---such as turbulence---could be related to a simpler behavior. Methods to identify such relationships had been developed earlier; however, those methods are very cumbersome to apply, especially when the amount of data becomes large.   We showed that our topological-based methods work as well and are much more computationally efficient.  Here again, these tools could find broad application in real world problems where representation of complex behaviors in terms of simpler \"solutions\" is sought.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/03/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Michael Schatz"
