The CNS workshop is a relatively young conference started by the IEEE Communications Society in 2013, focused on the lower levels of the networking stack (i.e., at the physical layer), as compared to the higher levels addressed by conferences such as the Network and Distributed System Security Symposium (NDSS), ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS), etc. By supporting attendance for these graduate students, this award helps grow a next generation of researchers with expertise in secure communications. Participation of women and underrepresented minorities will be encouraged.",
