 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Chicago Academy of Sciences/Peggy Notebaert Nature Museum (CAS/PNNM) is funded to join the existing Thematic Collections Network (TCN) project \"InvertEBase: Reaching back to see the future: Species-rich invertebrate faunas document causes and consequences of biodiversity shifts,\" which aims to create an easily accessible scientific resource that will inform novel research on changing species occurrences, abundances, and range distribution of invertebrates, specifically mollusks and arthropods. Data for 104,850 specimens will contribute to support research that provide a more comprehensive understanding of invertebrate biodiversity, building a baseline for improved policies and practices regarding land management, restoration, and conservation. Increased accessibility to collections data stemming from this project will also benefit K-12 students and teachers in Chicago through the development of a curriculum component that aligns with Next Generation Science Standards, introducing students to the role of local mollusk species as environmental indicators. The Academy will also collaborate with the Field Museum of Natural History to develop digital and print field guides to common local mollusks. These guides will be widely distributed and will be resource aids for citizen science endeavors.\r\n\r\nThe Chicago Academy of Sciences was founded in 1857 and quickly established itself as an early leader in collecting and researching regional flora and fauna. This legacy translates into valuable historic species occurrence data for the Midwestern/Western Great Lakes region, particularly within the state of Illinois. This project proposes to digitize and serve data for specimens of invertebrates representative of that geographic region. The efforts of the InvertEBase TCN will aggregate more than 3.9 million digitized specimen records from across the eastern United States. The partnership proposed by CAS/PNNM will contribute an estimated 104,850 records, filling geographic and temporal gaps in the TCN's data. CAS/PNNM will also exploit and improve existing workflows in order to improve efficiencies and cost effectiveness of the digitization process. The project plans to impact K-12 students and teachers in Chicago through the development curricula that align with Next Generation Science Standards. This award is made as part of the National Resource for Digitization of Biological Collections through the Advancing Digitization of Biodiversity Collections Program and all data resulting from this project will be available through iDigBio.",

Historic species data can be used to inform ecological restoration projects, environmental policies on local and national scales, studies on disease, and track the presence of invasive species or species range changes. It enables the Academy to broadcast that this resource is available and helps establish connections broadly within our community regionally as well as around the world.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The project team migrated data for a total of 121,456 specimens (15,418 records) from the malacology collection and 36,437 specimens (26,175 records) from the entomology collection into Arctos, the online collections management system used by the Academy, facilitating greater access to primary source material. The bulk of these specimens were collected between the mid 1800s to the mid 1900s, and are largely North American with a strong regional focus in the Midwest. Specimen data available through the online portals can be examined by scientific names, where the specimens were collected (locality data), and when the specimens were collected (temporal data).&nbsp; Specimens can also be searched through map queries, as locality information was georeferenced whenever possible. The collection includes records for 108 mollusk type specimens, which are important scientific specimens as they are used by scientists and society at large to identify and describe species.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This project provided opportunities for the Chicago Academy of Sciences to <strong>develop deeper collaborations</strong> with other institutions in our area, including the Field Museum of Natural History and the Illinois Natural History Survey. These relationships contributed to improving specimen data quality and to the project?s broader impacts benefitting public audiences. <strong>Two mollusk identification guides</strong> highlighting fresh water mollusk and snail species and land snails and slugs were created and are shared freely by CAS/PNNM and the Field Museum.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The project <strong>provided learning opportunities</strong> for undergraduate students and emerging professionals in the fields of museums and ecology. Interns on the project developed skills in georeferencing, collection curation, data management, and public engagement. The project team produced four <strong>collections interpretive boxes</strong>, displays used to engage museum visitors about nature in the region featuring real specimens<strong> </strong>from CAS/PNNM?s teaching collection. Two of these boxes feature insect metamorphosis, one focuses on the freshwater mussel button industry in Illinois, and one focuses on beetle diversity. The boxes and accompanying facilitator guides are used regularly for daily programming and special events at the Academy?s Nature Museum.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Through an internal partnership between CAS/PNNM?s Collections and Education staff, <strong>new K-12 educational curricula on fresh water mollusks </strong>was developed through the PEN project and reaches students and teachers in the Chicago area. Lessons within the curricula align with Next Generation Science Standards and include touchable specimens from the teaching collection. Using real specimens and their data about local mollusk species provides a richer educational experience for students and exposes them to animals they rarely see. In the first two quarters using the K-12 educational curricula developed as part of this PEN project (summer and fall 2019), content from this project has been shared by CAS/PNNM Education staff with 53 Chicago 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> grade classrooms, reaching over 50 teachers and 1,300 students from 36 schools.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Through this project?s broader impacts, we are providing avenues for the Academy to engage its museum and online visitors, Chicago area K-12 students and teachers, and the general public on issues related to scientific collections and nature in the region.
