 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research advances the theoretical foundations for the computer-aided design of machine systems.  At a basic level machines consist of solid components connected by movable elements that form articulated systems.  And design applications that systematically assemble and evaluate the performance of articulated structures provide a new and unprecedented ability to design innovative mechanical devices.  This research will open broad new fields of inventions, patents, and products with applications in every area that relies on controlled mechanical movement such as compact long travel vehicle suspensions, tone cancelling assistive devices for stroke patients, and linear suspensions supporting micro gyroscopes.\r\n\r\nThe design of machine systems can be formulated as a system of polynomial equations with solutions that yield new articulated structures not previously available.  This research will dramatically expand the design space for articulated systems and provide access to new and innovative mechanical devices at scales ranging form micro to macro dimensions.  A significant challenge in this computational approach to invention is providing the designer a systematic process for exploring what rapidly becomes a huge design space.  The goal of this research is to guide the synthesis of the hundreds of different linkage types, and verify the performance of thousands of designs. Successful completion of this research will develop new capabilities in computational machine design by providing the ability to design a wide range of new mechanical devices.",
