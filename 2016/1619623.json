 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal will support the 2016 Space Weather Workshop to be held April 26-29, 2016 at the Omni Interlocken Hotel in Broomfield, Colorado.   This annual workshop brings together representatives of industry, academia and government to present papers and discuss issues related to space weather. This is one of the few opportunities for the broad community interested in space weather to get together. Emphasis at the workshop is on the impacts of space weather on technology including communications, navigation, spacecraft operations and electric power. \r\n\r\nIn addition to bringing the three communities interested in space weather together this workshop invites both undergraduate and graduate students. This provides the students with information on research developments and on how that research is relevant to operations.  The students are also able to develop valuable networking connections that span these related but very separate communities.  Because the emphasis of the workshop is to discuss the impacts of space weather on technology and identify the operational needs for space weather forecasting it has high societal value.  The need to develop improved and enhanced space weather forecast and mitigation strategies is now a national priority.",
