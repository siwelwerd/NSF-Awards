 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will advance efforts of the Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program to better understand and promote practices that increase students' motivations and capacities to pursue careers in fields of science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) by engaging in hands-on field experience, laboratory/project-based entrepreneurship tasks and mentorship experiences\r\n\r\nThis Tuskegee University ITEST project will use flight simulation as an active learning tool to motivate and engage 75 students in grades 7-8 in learning and reinforcing various math and science concepts. The project also involves training 15 middle school teachers to incorporate innovative, active, and experiential learning techniques while teaching STEM concepts. The project uses commercial-off-the-shelf flight simulation software that is low cost and has excellent fidelity of the physics of the phenomenon. The objectives of this project are: (a) to motivate and train middle school teachers to incorporate innovative, active, and experiential learning techniques while teaching STEM concepts; (b) to improve the overall ability of students in solving STEM problems; and, (c) to improve the attitudes of teachers and students towards teaching and learning STEM concepts.\r\n\r\nThe project team, consisting of faculty from mathematics, aerospace engineering, mathematics education and an instructional designer (consultant), will develop learning modules for 7th and 8th grade students based on the Alabama Course of Study and Next Generation Science Standards using a flight simulation environment. They will design and implement intervention strategies for increasing student engagement and subsequently their understanding of selected math and science concepts through three components:  (1) a one-week professional development workshop for the math and science teachers; (2) a one-week summer camp for grade 7-8 students; and (3) the implementation of the approach by the teachers in their classrooms. The overall goal is to determine if an innovative learning approach supported by popular technology impact the learning of mathematics and science concepts. The research questions are: (a) Does a hands-on activity that is a physics-based simulation and not a \"twitch video game\" engage middle school students in learning math and science concepts? (b) Does a summer program such as proposed in this project enhance the self-efficacy of middle school students in math and science? (c) Are female students as engaged as male students in a flight simulator based learning environment and (d) Do math and science teachers of a rural school district accept and implement a technology mediated pedagogy such as the flight simulation-based approach? The evaluation plan will use a logic model to assess project activities. The intervention will be evaluated through several pre-post instruments that will include the assessment of math and science content knowledge during the summer program, their attitudes towards math and science, and self-efficacy.",

This lack of enthusiasm is despite the exciting technological hardware and software innovations that are used by them in their daily life. One of the many reasons is the perception among students especially K-12 students that STEM is difficult. This perception is the result of a complex interaction between the learning environment and the learner. In general, students are unable to recognize and make the connections between what they are learning in class and its utility in real life. The project Fly High Your Math and Science, was designed to provide an engaging learning environment which provided the opportunity to recognize the linkage between STEM concepts and real life. The learning environment utilized a flight simulator to engage the students while learning certain STEM concepts. The target population of the project was middle school students and teachers of a rural and economically depressed county of Alabama. The students of this county had limited access to technology-based learning experiences. Most of the students of this county are African American.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The&nbsp;<strong>goals&nbsp;</strong>of the project were to (a) provide relevant technology-based innovative pedagogical experiences to middle school teachers to enhance the effectiveness of their classroom environment (b) design intervention strategies for increasing underrepresented students' engagement and subsequently their understanding of selected math and science concepts. The specific&nbsp;<strong>objectives</strong>&nbsp;of the project were to (a) develop math and science teaching and learning materials using flight simulation software based active learning environment, (b) improve the overall skills of underrepresented students in solving STEM problems, (c) train teachers to use the pedagogical approach of the project by conducting summer professional development workshops for the teachers, (d) provide summer camps for middle school students to reinforce certain math and science concepts using the pedagogical approach of the project, (e) identify, adapt and develop assessment materials to determine the effectiveness of the pedagogical approach on the attitudes and self-efficacy of school teachers, and (f) assess and determine the effectiveness of the approach on the learning of middle school students, and their attitudes towards STEM.</p>\n<p><strong>Outcomes<br /></strong>Several lessons were developed by the project team using the active learning environment of a flight simulator. These lessons were implemented in three summer camps for the middle school students and three summer professional development workshops for the teachers. A refresher professional development for the teachers was also held. A total of 75 students, 29 math teachers and 34 science teachers were impacted directly through these camps and workshops. The lessons plans and implementation procedures are available publicly on the project website&nbsp;<a href=\"https://flyhightu.weebly.com\">https://flyhightu.weebly.com</a>. The project team installed three large screen flight simulators in the middle schools, with all the lessons loaded on the computers in the computer labs of the schools.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"Default\">A validated instrument was used to measure the&nbsp;attitudes of the participating teachers towards the pedagogical approach and conduct of the workshops.&nbsp;This instrument measures three dimensions which are&nbsp;Efficacy Belief, Outcome Expectancies, and Technology Integration in teaching.
