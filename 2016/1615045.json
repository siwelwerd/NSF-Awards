 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research contains several projects that are united by the common theme: interaction of a physical system with the environment. While a system of interest is often relatively simple, the environment it interacts with is often complicated and requires a judicious choice of a mathematical model. A model must be rich enough to capture essential features of the underlying phenomena; at the same time, the model needs to be mathematically tractable. In some of the models under investigation, the environment manifests itself as static disorder. This is in particular the case in models of activated carbon. One of the challenges in this particular investigation is to understand appearance of graphene sheets in activated carbon production. Graphene, a material that consists of just one layer of carbon atoms forming two-dimensional sheets, demonstrates a plethora of remarkable properties just beginning to be employed in engineering. This work, which has both theoretical and strong applied potential, will be done in collaboration with scientists working in industry. The long-term goal is to understand statistical mechanics in the presence of noise and disorder, which will enable study of more complicated systems relevant for applications in life sciences. The project will involve training of students through involvement in the research.\r\n\r\nIn the majority of systems under study in this project, interaction with the environment takes the form of noise, modeled as a random perturbation, varying in time. Both classical and quantum systems will be modeled this way. In the case of classical systems, the project studies the qualitative impact of noise in systems with magnetic and time-dependent forces and, more generally, bifurcations resulting from the presence of noise. Of particular interest are also systems of large number of interacting particles. Previous work on one such system has possible applications for design of systems of task-performing micro-robots; that research will be continued in the present project. The theory of open quantum systems is much less developed; in this context the project investigates simple quantum optical systems, as well as the basic phenomenon of quantum Brownian motion. Particularly interesting physically is the case in which the strength of the interaction of the Brownian particle with the environment depends on its position. Mathematical models of this situation are not well understood and the project aims to improve the existing theory. More involved systems will also be studied, especially in the limit of small particle masses. The research on diffusive and open systems will be done in close collaboration with physics groups, both experimental and theoretical.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe projects funded by this award studied classical and quantum open systems---systems exchanging energy with the environment.  While the dynamics of an isolated classical system is modeled by ordinary differential equations, in the open system case, equations of motion include a noise term, representing its interaction with the rest of the Universe.  The equations are thus stochastic in nature.  Systems of stochastic differential equations (SDE) are difficult to study and it is important that the dynamics they describe simplifies in the small mass limit, while preserving the system's essential properties.  A characteristic feature of such limiting equations is the presence of a noise-induced drift---a measurable effect of spatial inhomogeneity of the environment.  The limiting form of the equations of motion of classical open systems was studied in great detail and generality, including systems with nontrivial time scales coming from delayed response to the environment and/or presence of time correlations in the noise.  In addition, the asymptotic behavior of the solutions as a function of the mass was obtained.  The techniques developed by PI and his collaborators led to an analysis of self-organized behavior in a system of interacting microswimmers, controlled by the value of sensorial delay.\n\nQuantum open systems are described by equations of motion which are formally similar to the classical ones, but their properties may be very different and they require different mathematical tools.  They also include a noise term, which admits various probabilistic interpretations.  One such interpretation---using Poisson process---was studied in this project, shedding a new light on the properties of quantum measurement.  When one is primarily interested in the dynamics of the system itself, the environment's degrees of freedom can be averaged over and, in a wide class of cases, one obtains a Lindblad master equation.  An important phenomenon of Quantum Brownian Motion was studied using both a quantum noise model and a master equation.  A concrete physical situation to which these studies apply is that of an impurity atom interacting with a Bose-Einstein condensate.  \n\nBoth themes---classical and quantum open systems---are studied in close collaboration with theoretical and experimental physics groups.  They involve graduate students regularly.  They are both parts of a long-term research program of PI.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/03/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jan Wehr"
