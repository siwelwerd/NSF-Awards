Examples of granular materials from nature include sand, soil, and snow. Granular materials are also found in industrial processes, especially in the pharmaceutical, energy, and agricultural industries. These materials display complex spatial and temporal responses to external forces because they behave as collections of discrete grains instead of a pure fluid and because they are not in thermal equilibrium. The mechanical strength of these materials has been studied previously, but most fundamental research has considered spherical or nearly spherical particles. This project focuses on understanding the mechanical properties of packings of granular materials composed of highly nonspherical particles such as long rods, chains, and objects that can interlock, such as staples and bent rods. We will image the packings using x-rays to identify contacts and entanglements and connect this information about the microstructure to the strength of the packings in response to compression.  The experimental data will be used in computer simulations to validate a physical model of packings of highly nonspherical grains.\r\n\r\nUniaxial compression experiments will be performed on packings of nonspherical particles with different particle aspect ratios and\r\ntopologies. The experimental results will be compared with a theoretical model that predicts which particle shapes exhibit\r\ngeometric cohesion and which particle shapes produce packings that show significant strain-hardening stress-strain response. Comparisons for several particle shapes (e.g.  rods and staples) will allow us to validate the model so that it can be employed to predict the mechanical response of granular packings for a wide parameter space of particles shapes. In addition, numerical simulations combined with x-ray micro computed tomography studies will allow us to investigate the microstructural properties of granular packings\r\n(e.g. interparticle contacts and entanglements) that give rise to geometric cohesion and strain hardening and how they are affected by\r\nfriction and bending stiffness.",

Ourstudies have focused on gaining a fundamental understanding ofhow the properties of jammed packings are affected by the shape of theconstituent particles of the packing. We addressed this question bygenerating jammed packings of nonspherical particles via discreteelement modeling simulations. We have found several significantresults showing deep links between packing properties and particleshape, which will shape the future direction of research in thisfield.<br />The first focus of our studies was on jammed packings of non-sphericalparticles in two spatial dimensions. We specifically addressed thequestion of why packings of nonspherical particles possess fewercontacts between particles than predicted by naively counting thetotal number of degrees of freedom. According to stability criterialaid out by James Clerk Maxwell in the 1800s, there are a certainnumber of contacts that a jammed packing should possess to block allof the available degrees of freedom in the system.<br />However, packings of many non-spherical particle shapes have fewercontacts than Maxwell predicted, despite being mechanically stable. Wediscovered that the reason for this discrepancy is caused by thecurvatures of the surfaces of the particles that are in contact witheach other. Flat contacts between particles are more stable thanhighly curved ones, allowing for more mechanical stability with fewercontacts.<br />We then investigated how the properties of packings of sphericalparticles change when they are deformed via isotropic compression andshear. We found that both shear and compression can cause spherepackings to become unstable and rearrange to a new packing with adifferent network of inter-particle contacts and shear modulus. Wealso discovered the phenomenon of &ldquo;compression unjamming,&rdquo; whereapplying pressure to a jammed packing can cause it to unjam. Thesestudies will be extended to packings of non-spherical particles in the&nbsp;future.&nbsp;<br />We then studied the phenomenon of geometric cohesion in granularmaterials. Geometric cohesion occurs when packings of elongatedparticles entangle with each other, causing them to resist extension,even though the particles do not have sticky interactions. We foundthat u-shaped particles of dumbbells are geometrically cohesive evenin the absence of gravity.<br />Finally, we studied jammed packings of super-ellipsoids in threespatial dimensions. Super-ellipsoids represent a large class ofparticle shapes. One can create flat, round, rod-like, as well as cuboidalsuperellipsoids. We studied packings for more than 200 differentparticle shapes. The primary goal of this work was to investigate therelationship between the contact number and mechanical stability inpackings of super-ellipsoids. By generating packings via a thermalannealing protocol, it is possible to create packings with varyingdegrees of positional order. Surprisingly, we found that a key result for disordered packings, i.e. that the number of interparticlecontacts determines the packing's mechanical stability, also holds for orderedpackings of non-spherical particles.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 09/09/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Corey&nbsp;S&nbsp;Ohern</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div
