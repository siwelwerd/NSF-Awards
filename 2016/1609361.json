 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project funded by the Environmental Chemical Science Program in the Chemistry Division at the National Science Foundation, Professor Ching-Hua Huang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta seeks to better understand peroxy acids (POAs) as emerging disinfectants and oxidants to replace chlorine in wastewater treatment facilities. Despite the growing interest and pilot- to full-scale implementation of POAs in wastewater treatment, the understanding POAs trails behind their applications. The objective of this project is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the chemistry of POAs in water. This project has multiple broader impacts. It establishes an active collaboration with industry partners in evaluating on-going field tests of POA-based processes. The research enhances graduate and undergraduate student education by promoting the participation of underrepresented groups. The new knowledge and improved POAs-based technology benefits society by providing in safe water treatment technology, clean water and sanitation, and smart water management.  All of the applications protect human health and the ecosystem.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual contribution of this study is to provide new fundamental knowledge on the chemistry of POAs and their radical-based advanced oxidation processes.  Such processes may effectively destroy water pollutants. Specific research aims include: investigating the chemical oxidation of organic micropollutants, biomolecules and structurally representative compounds by POAs; characterizing the ultraviolet (UV)/POA process; investigating the degradation of organic micropollutants and biomolecules under UV/POA; assessing the water matrix effect on the POA and UV/POA processes; developing kinetic modeling for the POA and UV/POA processes; and performing quantum chemical evaluation of oxidation reactions by POAs and UV/POA. The new knowledge improves the POA and UV/POA technologies.",
