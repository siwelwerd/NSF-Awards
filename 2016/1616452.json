 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigators will observe, in fine detail, nearby dwarf galaxies and globular clusters in the Milky Way. The investigators have previously measured the dark matter content in some dwarf galaxies and compared their observations to numerical models.   Their results are in better agreement with models than previous observations.   The investigators will use a new, very sensitive, spectrograph, which can measure the velocities of stars in these galaxies and clusters with great precision. Their observations are important because understanding the dark matter content of dwarf galaxies is critical for testing of models of the universe as a whole.\r\n\r\nThe investigators directly focus on observational studies of low dispersion systems in the cold dark matter paradigm. There has been a problem in comparing these systems with numerical simulations over the past 30 years, typically referred to as the core/cusp problem, the missing satellite problem, and the \"too big to fail\" problem. The investigators aim to resolve each of these issues with this study. \r\n\r\nIn addition to the scientific advancement, the  investigators are also committed to engaging the public with these studies.  The investigators are designing an exhibit connecting the topic of dark matter with the optical instruments used in their research.  Their presentations will engage and educate the general public, which includes a large number of Spanish speakers that live in or near West Texas.",

We started trying to figure out if there is a universal shape to the dark matter profiles of dwarf galaxies. It has been established that the shape of the profiles for larger galaxies is flat towards the center, but results were ambiguous for dwarfs. These measurements are very challenging due to the dim signal coming from lower density environments, and the need to resolve velocities in a smaller spatial range.<br /><br />All of our measurements were made using VIRUS-W, an IFU spectrograph installed in the 2.7 Harlan J. Smith telescope at McDonald Observatory. This instrument allows the unique combination of large enough spectral resolution to measure the lower velocities of stars in dwarf galaxies, large enough field of view for efficient mapping, and large optical fibers to obtain enough signal from low density environments. <br /><br />From our analysis, the results for disk-like galaxies, with young populations, are that they look like scaled-down versions of the larger counterparts. The central part of the dark matter profile is flat, which points to a universal sark matter shape for disk-like galaxies. In the last couple years, galaxy formation simulations have gotten more sophisticated as they include more realistic physical processes. Results from those simulations point in the same direction, so both theory and observations appear to be converging in this case.<br /><br />The surprising result came from analyzing the dwarf spheroidal galaxy Leo I orbiting our own Milky Way. For this object, we detected a shallow central cusp in stellar density that had never been reported before. This came from using a technique to measure density that was developed for Galactic globular clusters, and which turns out to be the best way to measure dwarf galaxies with resolved stars and crowding in the center. The velocity profile also shows a small rise towards the center. When the observations are incorporated into sophisticated orbit-based models, which were used to analyze a dwarf galaxy for the first time, the result is that there is a clear need for a sizable central black hole. The best-fit black hole is close in size to the one at the center of the Milky Way, but it sits in a much smaller spheroidal. The result places Leo I among a peculiar group of galaxies that have oversized central black holes, which could point to a complicated past for the small galaxy. Besides the presence of the black hole, the outer parts of the galaxy require little to no dark matter. <br /><br />Leo I is already one of the densest dwarf spheroidals in the Galaxy, and it is already known to host a much lower percentage of dark matter than the other fainter galaxies, which are clearly dark matter dominated. It is possible that Leo I has been misclassified as a dwarf spheroidal and it is in reality a stripped spheroidal galaxy that lost stars due to some harsh encounter in the past. <br /><br />During this project, the PI participated in a large number of outreach events. Most of those happened in the form of talks to general and specific audiences, but there were also a few fair type events. The vast majority of the talks were given in Texas, but there were also a few talks abroad. Some of the talks were given in Spanish for dual language school populations. Even when the talks were given in English, the possibility of responding to questions in Spanish was offered (and used) by audience members more than once. One activity to highlight was a guided visit of McDonald Observatory to a group of dual language middle schoolers from San Antonio who traveled all the way to West Texas for this. The tour was given in Spanish by the PI, and in English by a member of the outreach team at McDonald. <br /><br />During visits to other Universities in Texas there was always at least one meeting slot dedicated to talking to undergraduate students, many of which are of hispanic origins, and several of which are female. The Pi believes there is a relevant positive effect on young students when seeing a role model that is similar to them (either in gender or in geographical origin).</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 02/10/2020<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Eva&nbsp;Noyola</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1616452/1616452_10459941_1581362092148_ScreenShot2020-02-10at1.11.36PM--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1616452/1616452_10459941_1581362092148_ScreenShot2020-02-10at1.11.36PM--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Leo I observations\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1616452/1616452_10459941_1581362092148_ScreenShot2020-02-10at1.11.36PM--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Leo I observations\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Layout of previous and recent observations for the dwarf galaxy Leo I</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Maria Jos\ufffd Bustamante</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Eva&nbsp;Noyola</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Leo I observations</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1616452/1616452_10459941_1581361758324_ScreenShot2020-02-10at12.56.47PM--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1616452/1616452_10459941_1581361758324_ScreenShot2020-02-10at12.56.47PM--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"outreach 2\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1616452/1616452_10459941_1581361758324_ScreenShot2020-02-10at12.56.47PM--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"outreach 2\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Examples of outreach activities during project</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Eva Noyola</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Eva&nbsp;Noyola</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">outreach 2</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1616452/1616452_10459941_1581361693392_ScreenShot2020-02-10at12.56.18PM--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1616452/1616452_10459941_1581361693392_ScreenShot2020-02-10at12.56.18PM--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"outreach 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1616452/1616452_10459941_1581361693392_ScreenShot2020-02-10at12.56.18PM--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"outreach 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Various examples of Outreach work done during the project</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Eva Noyola</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Eva&nbsp;Noyola</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">outreach 1</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1616452/1616452_10459941_1581362186001_ScreenShot2020-02-10at1.12.40PM--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1616452/1616452_10459941_1581362186001_ScreenShot2020-02-10at1.12.40PM--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Leo I models\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1616452/1616452_10459941_1581362186001_ScreenShot2020-02-10at1.12.40PM--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Leo I models\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Every model for Leo I shows the need for a central conpact massive object (a.k.a. a Black Hole)</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Maria Jos\ufffd Bustamante</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Eva&nbsp;Noyola</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Leo I models</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
