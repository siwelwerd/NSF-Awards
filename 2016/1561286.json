 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project focuses on a Comparison and Explanation of Multiple Strategies (CEMS) approach for Algebra I. The instructional approach focuses on having students compare strategies and explain their thinking. The investigators will modify the current materials, the instructional approach, and the professional development approach based on prior research. The curriculum development will include supplementary materials for linear equations, systems of equations, quadratics and factoring, and graphing. These are core concepts for Algebra I courses nationwide. The goal of the proposed work is to first streamline the materials and improve the resources available for. They will also focus on the central role of explanation and discussion in the learning process. The research will focus on how teachers incorporate comparison, explanation and discussion into their teaching, how this impacts students' algebra knowledge, and how effective the approach is relative to business-as-usual instruction. The results of the research will inform teaching and learning for a central course in the mathematics curriculum since it is foundational to students' later mathematics learning. The approach also examines the entire classroom system including both students' knowledge and learning and teachers' development and implementation. This project is supported by NSF's EHR Core Research (ECR) program. The ECR program emphasizes fundamental STEM education research that generates foundational knowledge in the field.\r\n\r\nThe research will first refine the CEMS Algebra materials and then document the feasibility of their implementation and the effects on student learning. The project takes a holistic approach by incorporating materials for teaching, professional development, and the study of teaching practice. The work will expand theories of algebra learning to include both conceptual and procedural learning. It will include detailed analysis about fidelity of implementation to understand how instructional differences influence students' knowledge. The first phase of the study (refining the materials) includes implementation in classrooms, teacher professional development, collection of lesson videos, and the development of student assessments for each unit. The second phase of the study compares the effects of the treatment to the business-as-usual with one district. The teachers from year 1 will serve as the treatment group in year 2 and a comparison group of teachers will be selected. Data collection and analysis will focus on fidelity of implementation and assessments of students' learning. Year 3 will be similar to year 2 but expand to a second school district and include more teachers.",

Asking students to compare and discuss multiple strategies for solving the same problem encourages higher order thinking and develops students? knowledge of why and when to use different strategies. In addition, teachers need materials and routines to support their use of these practices in their classrooms. We revised and evaluated instructional materials and routines to Compare and Discuss Multiple Strategies (CDMS) for Algebra I topics, beginning with materials developed in a prior grant (DRL0814571).</p>\n<p>Our materials and instructional routines ensure that multiple strategies for solving the same problem are clear and visible simultaneously to students and use well understood terminology and visual cues to promote comparison (see example). These materials include reflection questions to encourage student explanation of key points. <br /><br />The major advances in this grant were instructional routines and expanded teacher professional development. Because many high school math teachers continue to structure their teaching around lecture and independent practice, we developed and scaffolded an instructional routine for supporting small group work and whole class discussion. A key discussion question is posed (e.g., \"Is there a situation where substitution would be better than elimination, or vice versa?\"), and then students think for a minute on their own, pair with another student to discuss their answers, and then share ideas in a whole class discussion (e.g., Think-Pair-Share). At the end of the discussion, the teacher summarizes the main points of the discussion and asks students to write a summary in their own words. This routine is supported by a graphic organizer that prompts students to engage in and take notes on each phase. Teachers are provided with sample questions to help draw out multiple student responses to the same question and to ask students to build on one another?s ideas. Although we had encouraged these practices in the past, developing and supporting a clear instructional routine with a graphic organizer led to much more consistent and high-quality implementation.<br /><br />Professional development (PD) occurred in the summer and throughout the school year. In the summer, teachers were introduced to our curriculum during a one-week, 35-hour professional development institute that we designed and administered. The PD included videotaped exemplars of other teachers using the curriculum, and experiences planning and teaching sample lessons to peers. During the school year, teachers received brief one-on-one support to help plan when to use the materials and feedback that highlighted what they were doing well and specific ways to improve implementation. <br /><br />In the first 2 years of the grant, 9 teachers integrated our CDMS lessons into their Algebra I instruction, as we refined our approach. We also tested whether the depiction of strategies as being used by particular fictitious students in our materials was effective and found that it was. <br /><br />This grant culminated with a yearlong evaluation of our approach in Algebra I classrooms in Massachusetts and New Hampshire. There were 16 treatment teachers leading 25 sections with 550 students and 13 control teachers leading 21 sections with 498 students.&nbsp; Control teachers used their typical algebra instruction while treatment teachers received professional development and access to our CDMS lessons. Treatment teachers typically used 28 of our 40 CDMS lessons during the school year, spending an average of 17 minutes per lesson. Treatment teachers dedicated extended time to comparison of multiple strategies, use of small group work, and use of class discussion in most observed lessons. In contrast, control teachers did these things infrequently. When using our materials, treatment teachers often asked conceptual and open-ended questions, elicited extended responses from students, and supported procedural flexibility. Students in the treatment condition had greater algebra knowledge than students in the control condition for the unit on linear equations, although not for three other units after we accounted for pre-existing differences between the groups.&nbsp; Thus, our CDMS approach shows promise for improving classroom instructional quality, but has not yet led to robust improvements in student knowledge. <br /><br />In summary, the intellectual merit of the project includes an expanded theory of algebra learning that incorporates how students develop robust knowledge for working with symbolic strategies, including how CDMS supports procedural flexibility, conceptual knowledge and procedural knowledge.<br /><br />In addition to the broader impact of this research on the quality of instruction that participating students received, dissemination efforts have made our CDMS instructional approach available to algebra teachers throughout the country at https://www.compareanddiscuss.com/.
