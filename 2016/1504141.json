 "awd_abstract_narration": "Arctic ecosystems are changing in response to arctic warming, which is proceeding more than twice as fast as the global average. The International Tundra Experiment (ITEX) was established in the early 1990s to understand the effects of warming and environmental variability on tundra vegetation properties and ecosystem function.  The ITEX program has been extremely valuable for detection of changes in tundra plant and ecosystem responses to experimental warming and to background climate change across sites that span the major ecosystems of the Arctic.  In 2007, the Alaskan and Greenland ITEX sites were combined into an Arctic Observatory Network (AON).  The current ITEX AON project will continue to document and understand Arctic terrestrial vegetation change and its ecosystem consequences by maintaining the long-term datasets of the ITEX-AON.  The warming experiment of ITEX-AON allows us to assign the cause for observed changes in response to warming instead of relying on simple correlations.  This project provides urgently needed data on changes in vegetation and the importance of these changes for ecosystem services from a variety of Arctic ecosystems.  This project will provide training for postdoctoral, graduate and undergraduate students in the emerging fields of remote sensing, cybertechnology and big-data analysis. The project will include outreach activities through strong relationships with the CLEO Institute in Miami; the Grand Valley State University Regional Math and Science Center; and K-12 school systems in Miami, Anchorage, Grand Rapids and El Paso. All data from this project are and will be freely available at the NSF Arctic Data Center.\r\n\r\nThe core datasets of the proposed research include manual observations of phenology, vegetation structure and composition, and ecosystem function (carbon flux and nutrient cycling) on long-term ITEX control and experimental warming plots, repeat measurement of vegetation plots on the long-term 1 km2 vegetation grids, and a multifactor warming/moisture experiment in Greenland. In 2009, the sampling scheme was expanded to include a larger spatial component to amplify the value of the measurements collected. This expansion included the addition of phenocams, automated mobile sensor platforms, and medium-scale aerial imagery. The automated platforms measure a suite of vegetation surface properties with minimal effort across focal transects spanning strong moisture and microtopographic gradients at a near-daily frequency. These measurements capture the fine-scale changes in vegetation over the growing season that are missed by lower frequency manual measurements and provide a bridge between manual measurements and aerial imagery. Medium-scale aerial imagery, using Kite Aerial or Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, is acquired throughout the growing season for scaling of manual and automated measurements; satellite imagery is referenced to medium-scale aerial imagery to aid scaling of responses to the regional level. In the newest phase of AON ITEX, we are particularly focused on understanding the relationship between landscape subsidence as a result of permafrost thaw and vegetation structure and function because of the potential for significant positive feedbacks to climate change.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project has been addressing how Arctic tundra plants, soils and ecosystems will be different in the future under a suite of likely climate conditions that reflect a New Arctic and how these systems are changing now, year after year after year.  This research is based in large part on 20+ years of field observations and an experiment at Toolik Lake, Alaska under the umbrella of the International Tundra Experiment (ITEX).  ITEX is a Pan Arctic Network of over 30 sites that are simultaneously measuring and monitoring tundra plants, soils and ecosystems.  This network uses similar techniques, such as warming with small open-toped fiberglass chambers, snow fences to manipulate snow depth (higher and lower) and the use of line-power to use warming lamps to create a range of future temperature regimes (i.e. ambient, a bit warmer and much warmer).  In addition, some studies use summer irrigation treatments to create a warmer and a wetter summer conditions in the Arctic, a New Arctic.  This framework of long-term observations of background changes and the use of experiments to determine how the Arctic has been changing and how a New Arctic will behave has made an entire suite of synthesis activities (comparisons between sites and regions) possible.  Many of these syntheses have taken place over the past 5 years.\n\nThis project has been addressing 4 very broad and comprehensive key issues:\n\n 1) How does the exchange of C between today\u2019s tundra and tundra of the future (New Arctic) behave and are the landscapes of today and those in the future sequestering more C, creating a negative feedback to climate warming or a positive feedback adding C to the atmosphere and amplifying warming. Especially how do these processes differ between the Low and High Arctic?\n\n2) How does the Arctic water cycle behave and the extent to which moisture that is generated over an ice free Arctic transported within the Arctic, how is it transported out of the Arctic and effecting landscapes and societies in the subarctic, and the heavily populated temperature regions of N America, Europe and Eurasia? And, what are the fine and large scale processes that govern this behavior within and between years.  In addition, our water cycle program has focused on the linkages between snow, snow melt water, and snow melt water\u2019s use by tundra plants during the growing season and how that my provide a buffer to summer drought and allow C fixation and growth into the autumn, enhancing C sequestration.\n\n3) What are the processes that are driving the variability in the greening and the browning of the Arctic that is reflected in part by the expansion of woody shrubs across the north that appear to be associated with sea ice loss and warming in places that a typically wet tundra and at the same time warming in places that are dry and arid tundra regions.\n\n4) How has the patterns of growth (phenology) respond to background trajectories of warming and how will the patterns of growth be different in a New Arctic that is dramatically warmer than today.  These shifts in the beginning of spring (advancing), the peak period of plant growth and the senescence period (end of growing season) of autumn are central to the synchrony of the Arctic especially the trophic interactions between plants and insects, insects and migratory birds and between predators and prey and the cohesiveness of Arctic food webs.\n\nThese science-based studies are complemented by a host of broader impacts of this program that include: a) training of postdoctoral scientists, graduate (PhD and MS students) and undergraduates (minority, male and female); b) the integration of multiple scientific disciplines including:  plant ecophysiology, isotope geochemistry, moisture source tracking, field ecosystem ecology, big data management, cyrosphere processes, landscape water balances, remote sensing, snow properties, and modeling;  c) spreading the findings of this research to the broader community including the general public via out lets such as Arctic Today, Arctic Update, featured on university web pages as cover stories, featured by ultra-high impact scientific journals and the results shared across classrooms globally in university lectures, and the results and discoveries shared in national and international meetings and interviews.\n\nWe have also developed an international component to this project associated with Dr. Welker\u2019s UArctic Research Chairship and his joint appointment between the University of Oulu, Finland and the University of Alaska, Anchorage.  For instance we are carrying out comparative C sequestration studies in Finland as a function of changes in snow depth, as we have been doing in Alaska and in NW Greenland and we are carrying out site-specific moisture source studies in Arctic Finland (Bailey et al. 2021) similar to those we have conducted in NW Greenland (Akers et al. 2020). \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/14/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jeffrey M Welker"
