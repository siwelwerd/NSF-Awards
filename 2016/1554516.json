An approach capable of visualizing functional and morphological markers of pathological conditions located deep within the tissue would be a breakthrough in optical imaging and its applications in biomedical research and the development of novel therapeutic and diagnostic approaches. Significant efforts will be dedicated to teaching translational applications of biophotonics with emphasis on helping students develop entrepreneurship skills in the field of biophonics and imaging.\r\n\r\nThis proposal will provide researchers, for the first time, a platform for three-dimensional, super-resolution imaging deep in living animals while simultaneously providing super-sensitivity molecular measurements in the cellular microenvironment. This new super resolution molecular imaging modality is based on analyzing harmonic distortions in a multiphoton microscope. This is an ambitious goal and the idea of using saturation to further localize fluorescence signals is innovative.",
