 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the Chemistry Research Instrumentation (CRIF) Program as well as the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), Professor Sean Parkin from the University of Kentucky and colleagues John Anthony, Susan Odom, Edith Glazer and Oleg Tsodikov have acquired a microsource single crystal X-ray diffractometer equipped with a complementary metal oxide sensor (CMOS). X-ray diffraction is a powerful tool to investigate the atomic structure of solid materials. This tool is able to probe beneath the surface of compounds and materials. The knowledge of the underlying atomic structure of materials is fundamental to understanding their properties and developing improvements. Consequently, modern developments in the development of X-ray sources, detectors and computer technology have made X-ray diffractometers important for chemical and materials research. The applications of microscopic structural knowledge ranges across fields from chemistry to biology, materials and medicine, to applications such as developing better agrochemicals, electronic devices or pharmaceuticals and many others. This state-of-the-art system is used for teaching in a laboratory-based crystallography course, for class assignments in undergraduate inorganic chemistry teaching laboratories, as well as in ad-hoc training of Faculty, post-docs, students, visiting scholars, summer students, high-school senior interns, and students from UK's high-school STEAM academy.\r\n\r\nThe acquisition of this diffractometer will advance research, especially in areas at the University of Kentucky such as (a) studies of organic electronic materials, (b) investigations of light-activated agents for gene regulation and cancer treatment, (c) design of energy storage materials and (d) analysis of biologically relevant natural products.  It will also be used broadly in other varied research groups in departments of Chemistry, Physics, Biochemistry, Pharmacy, the Center for Advanced Materials (CAM), and  the Center for Applied Energy Research (CAER) at the University as well as at other institutions in the region and out-of-state.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual Merit\n\nX-ray crystallography is both a technique and a science in its own right. The scienceties structural aspects of a wide array of fields including chemistry, physics, biology, and geology to mathematics and technology. The techniqueexploits all of these fields, making X-ray crystallography the primary source of structural information required to characterize new materials, and thereby link form to function.  This proposal was for the acquisition of an X-ray diffractometer to provide crystallographic services to research groups at the University of Kentucky and Primarily Undergraduate Institutions in the region.  Accurate and precise measurements of three-dimensional molecular structure, including bond distances, angles, torsions, and packing characteristics are essential to chemical and materials research.  The PIs and affiliated scholars are involved in a broad range of research fields including organic electronics, advanced battery additives, catalysis, pharmaceuticals, and polymorphism.\n\n \n\nBroader Impact\n\nThe new diffractometer has been in full time operation since late April 2017. Over the grant period, a total of 852 samples were investigated: 701 using the shorter wavelength Mo source and 151 using the Cu source.  Users of the new instrument thus far have included 24 UK Faculty research groups and 9 non-UK research groups.  These have included 13 post-doctoral scholars, 38 graduate students, and 12 undergraduate students.  The beneficiary research groups encompass organic, inorganic, and materials chemistry research programs, but also include pharmacy, environmental chemistry, engineering, and even dentistry.  The instrument forms the core of practical hands-on instruction in a graduate-level course in X-ray crystallography (20 students thus far), and is frequently used for product confirmations in our undergraduate organic and inorganic laboratory courses.  In addition, the speed of the diffractometer has enabled remote-access, in-class, real-time demonstrations for several sections of introductory organic chemistry (~100 students).  The instrument was used to collect data and solve structures for ChemCamp - a summer program for high-school students.  The results of research projects involving the MRI-funded instrument are widely disseminated by publication in peer-reviewed journals and as conference presentations at both national and international scientific meetings (including ACS, ACA, MRS).  At the time of this report, 20 papers have been published, and at least a further 8 are either submitted or are in preparation.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/17/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Sean R Parkin"
