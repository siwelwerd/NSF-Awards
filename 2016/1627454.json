 "awd_abstract_narration": "Sociolinguists have traditionally found strong correlations between occupation and linguistic variables. Some approaches rest on the assumption that occupational effects arise from the differential social needs and goals that speakers have in different occupations. However, this perspective has never been investigated using large-scale, quantitative data within a single workplace. The current study is an analysis of the use of six Southern vowels by speakers in a range of occupations within a single firm. The current study will address: 1) whether required job skills correlate with Southern features 2) which features individuals manipulate on the job versus in casual settings 3) experiences of linguistic discrimination within the workplace. \r\n\r\nThis work investigates the use of Southern features among workers at a single technology firm, providing a more nuanced picture of the relationship between occupation and linguistic features. Individuals may show linguistic grouping based on different job skills illustrating the role of the workplace in sorting individuals into the groups seen in the aggregate. With the addition of stylistic data from casual, work, and interview settings, this study can more accurately pinpoint which Southern features speakers avoid for workplace situations. Lastly, speakers' recounting of experiences of linguistic discrimination within the workplace will highlight the social consequences that Southern speakers may face on the job. \r\n\r\nThis study will further our understanding of how linguistic discrimination operates within the workplace, and it will specifically identify which features of the Southern Vowel Shift receive the greatest degree of stigma. The specific experiences of linguistic discrimination will help to bring awareness to the importance of language in promoting subconscious discriminatory practices, allowing for public policy that directly addresses these issues. Direct evidence tying the use of stigmatized dialect features with negative social outcomes will provide the foundation for legal protections for workers who speak with non-standard dialects.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nSociolinguists have long argued that work is both an important indicator of socioeconomic class and correlate of class-stratified linguistic variables, and it is often analyzed as representing a unique stylistic context.  However, the treatment of work and workplaces remains coarse-grained and poorly theorized, and the examinations of style at work only exist as case studies.  Work constitutes an important linguistic arena, as workers must negotiate expectations for how to look, act, and speak while on the job, and negative evaluations by customers or superiors can result in material consequences for the employee.  To connect the structural processes of workplace organization to sociolinguistic variation, this study examines the stylistic differences of white Southern speakers at a technology firm in a variety of social contexts.\n\nTo examine the relationship between work and language in detail, recorded data was collected from participants while they were performing their job duties, as well as when they were interacting with family and friends.  After they finished recording themselves, sociolinguistic interviews were conducted with each participant to talk about the details of their jobs, as well as discuss the perceptions they had surrounding Southern linguistic features and their treatment.  Results of both quantitative and qualitative analyses reveal a complex relationship between firm structure, linguistic performance, and social evaluation.  Regression models show a correlation between job skills and features of the Southern Vowel Shift, a prominent feature of the \"Southern accent\" for workers at the firm.  Those who held jobs with higher interpersonal skill requirements (sales, customer service) or analytical skill requirements (critical thinking) showed fewer elements of the Southern Vowel Shift while on the job.  In contrast, those who had higher managerial skill requirements (leadership, coordination) had more Southern features.  When assessed at the individual level, some workers shifted their speech to suit the needs of their job, with employees in customer-oriented positions showing more dynamic stylistic differences than others at the firm.  The linguistic differences between recording contexts were especially wide for younger women, who also expressed the greatest ambivalence about the treatment of Southern accents, both on the job and more generally.  Finally, qualitative analysis of interviews showed conflicting reports about the evaluation and treatment of Southern accents.  All interviewees reported that Southern accents were negatively evaluated in a general sense, through stereotypes of lack of education or low intelligence.  However, most employees also argued that Southern Tech did not have these same biases within the company, due to its foundation and roots in the South, suggesting the importance of local linguistic marketplace norms in the treatment of dialects at work.\n\nOverall, these results have important ramifications for the sociolinguistic understanding of the connection between jobs, workplaces, and language variation.  The nuanced connection between organizational position, job sills, and SVS features highlights the need for deeper treatments of work and workplaces in variationist analysis.  Workers spoke of the importance of organizational culture and practices creating a comfortable environment to use Southern linguistic features, further suggesting that firm-level practices may play a role in conditioning stylistic variation within those arenas.  These findings also illustrate the extra labor undertaken by workers who speak non-Standard dialects within the workplace to accommodate to more mainstream norms.  Not only do these individuals face possible consequences for the speech while on the job, they must expend extra effort to maintain stylistic control over stigmatized features.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/01/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jon Forrest"
