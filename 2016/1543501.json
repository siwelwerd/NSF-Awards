 "awd_abstract_narration": "Howat/1543501\r\n\r\nThis award will provide support to map the topography of the Antarctic continent at high spatial resolution and precision to measure ice sheet change, constrain models, correct satellite observations and support logistics. Antarctica remains the most poorly mapped landmass on Earth, yet, accurate and complete surface topography is essential for a wide range of scientific and logistical activities. The group  will use a combination of very high-resolution satellite imagery, existing ground and airborne survey data and the NSF's supercomputer infrastructure to construct the Reference Elevation Model of Antarctica (REMA): a continuous, time-stamped reference surface that will be one to two orders of magnitude higher resolution than currently available.\r\n\r\nREMA will be constructed from stereoscopic, submeter resolution imagery collected by the WorldView satellite constellation, obtained at no cost in partnership with the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency and the NSF-supported Polar Geospatial Center (PGC). The high spatial and radiometric resolution of the imagery enables photogrammetric digital elevation model (DEM) extraction over low contrast terrains such as snow, ice and shadows. These DEM's have horizontal and vertical offsets of up to several meters that can be reduced to the DEM relative accuracy of 0.2 meter with a single ground control point. We will use available control points from ground and lidar surveys to register individual DEMs and optimized, least-squares co-registration to provide control between overlapping DEM's over large regions. REMA will have a posting of 10 meters and accuracy better than 1 meter. It will be distributed openly by the Polar Geospatial Center. This project will involve substantial undergraduate participation, providing training in geospatial science and remote sensing, and REMA will be used extensively for the outreach programs of the Byrd Polar and Climate Research Center.  This project does not require field work in Antarctica.",
