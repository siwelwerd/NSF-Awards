 "awd_abstract_narration": "This National Science Foundation award funds Student Travel Fellowships for US students attending the 2016 Privacy-Preserving Information Retrieval (PIR) Workshop. The workshop is co-located with the ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval in Pisa, Italy. The Student Fellowships helps cover the travel costs for US students, making it possible for them to attend the workshop and discuss and disseminate their work. The workshop also provides an opportunity for them to interact with future national and international scientific collaborators. \r\n\r\nThe PIR Workshop brings together an interdisciplinary group of researchers and practitioners in Information Retrieval, Privacy and Security. Students benefit from not only the technical paper presentations, but also other activities such as talk from industry leaders, and panel/breakout sessions which pair information retrieval and privacy researchers together to discuss about emerging challenges across the two communities. These sessions provide students with an opportunity to learn the recent research developments in an emerging interdisciplinary field, while the informal settings of the breakouts also enable students to get critical yet encouraging feedback on their work from senior members of the community.",

The 2016 workshop happened in Pisa, Italy, which was far and expensive for US students to travel to, however, the grant has greatly encouraged submissions and attendance in the workshop. The workshop also successfully brought together many experts from the research fields of both privacy and information retrieval, fostered lively and insightful discussions.

The goals of this series of workshops are (1) bringing together the two research fields, (2) yielding fruitful collaborations, and (3) foster research in the green field of privacy-preserving Information Retrieval, with the hope to encourage a new research paper session in the following year&rsquo;s SIGIR main conference.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Outcome in terms of Intellectual Merit:<span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Outcome 1: The Workshop has brought together an interdisciplinary group of researchers and practitioners in Information Retrieval, Privacy and Security. We targeted on three themes: differential privacy and IR dataset release, privacy in search and browsing, and privacy in social media.We solicited papers and presentations in the following topics: Differential Privacy for Information Retrieval, Query log anonymization, IR dataset release, Privacy preserving search/browsing, Privacy in social media, microblog, and people search, Evaluation for privacy-preserving IR, Leak of sensitive information in natural languages, Privacy in location-based services, recommender systems, and other IR works on mobile app, and Privacy preserving IR for healthcare and other domains. The authors, presenters, and participants, have produced papers and talks on &ldquo;Differential Privacy in the Wild&rdquo;, &ldquo;Privacy Leakage through Innocent Content Sharing in Online Social Networks&rdquo;, &ldquo;Privacy-Preserving Inference of Social Relationships from Location Data&rdquo;, &ldquo;Private Information Retrieval from Encrypted Data&rdquo;, and &ldquo; Releasing True Data with Formal Privacy Guarantees&rdquo;.
