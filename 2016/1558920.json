 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent unusual conditions along the U.S. East Coast have dramatically demonstrated the importance of understanding the dynamics controlling shelf-deep ocean exchange at the confluence of the North Atlantic gyres near Cape Hatteras. Atypical Gulf Stream position, air-sea heat flux, extremes in ocean temperature, and sea level rise are potential harbingers of larger shifts in atmospheric and oceanic forcing. Effects on shelf-deep ocean exchange are unknown due to incomplete dynamical understanding of the present. Development of predictive capacity is particularly relevant at this time, as oil and gas exploration is being planned. The understanding of shelf-deep ocean exchange gained through this project will be applicable to other regions where shelf and basin-scale currents converge and could improve our capacity to anticipate the response of the coastal ocean to climate change in the coming decades. In addition to the physical interactions between scales and oceanic regions, the relevance of exported shelf waters at Cape Hatteras to global carbon budgets may be large, and is difficult to quantify due to carbon budget mediation by biological ecosystems that vary with season and water mass. Both ecosystems and export processes may change under predicted climatic shifts, so understanding export processes has broad biogeochemical importance. Collaborations with biogeochemists and ecologists will be pursued to utilize the data to study ecosystems in this area of high biological diversity that is home to many commercially important species. Insights gained through the project will also improve mitigation of pollutant spills. The outreach and educational efforts include a public exhibit and talks, opportunities for joining science cruises and participation in the Society of Women Engineers \"Girls Engineer It! Day\", a daylong event for girls in grades 6-12, and the Wood Hole Oceanographic Institution's summer program for undergraduates from underrepresented groups. The project will support two early career scientists, train one postdoctoral researcher and four graduate students, and give undergraduate students hands-on experience in the operation of the autonomous gliders.\r\n\r\nSubtropical and subpolar oceanic gyre boundaries are characterized by confluent western boundary currents and convergence in the adjacent shelf and slope waters. Together, they lead to large net export of shelf waters to the deep ocean, and complex, bidirectional shelf-deep ocean exchange, in response to strong forcing typical of mid-latitude western ocean margins. Shelf-deep ocean exchange processes at such dynamic sites remain poorly understood, due in part to the technical challenge of resolving broad ranges of relevant spatial and temporal scales. The understanding gained by investigating the wide seasonal range of parameter space will facilitate exploration of how shelf circulation and shelf-open ocean exchange may evolve due to observed and projected long-term shifts in regional and basin-scale circulation, hydrography, and atmospheric forcing. This project will deploy fixed, mobile, and remote observational platforms in combination with idealized and realistic numerical simulations to investigate exchange processes near Cape Hatteras. The sampling array will provide an observational data set with unprecedented temporal and spatial resolution in a region of large episodic export and exchange. These observations will be used to identify dominant exchange processes; correlate them with observed forcing; define ranges of forcing and shelf response; verify parallel developments within the realistic model framework; and establish causation through detailed assessment of momentum and vorticity balances, integrating observational and validated model products. In addition to physical data, the autonomous gliders will also collect chlorophyll fluorescence, oxygen saturation, and acoustic backscatter data that are of direct relevance to biogeochemical properties exported from the shelf to the deep ocean. These non-physical data will be used as water mass tracers and to portray the structure of the chlorophyll-a and dissolved oxygen at unprecedented resolution.",

Several features of the oceanography in this region promote exchange, making it a hotspot for this process, including convergence of shelf flows (southward flow north of Cape Hatteras and northward flow to the south), separation just offshore of Cape Hatteras of the northward-flowing Gulf Stream from the upper continenal slope to become a free jet in the northwest Atlantic, and the termination and offshore turn of the shelfbreak front, which separates shelf waters from the Slope Sea and extends southward from Georges Bank along the shelfbreak to Cape Hatteras. Currents measured with moorings, high-frequency radar and from gliders depict a complicated interaction of shelf flows with those in the open ocean. &nbsp;A unique aspect of PEACH was its ability to simultaneously observed both environments. &nbsp;A statistical decomposition of the moored currents found more than 60% of the current variability was associated with reversing alongshelf winds and onshore/offshore shifts of the Gulf Stream on 2-7 day timescales, the latter associated with the passage of instabilities (meanders) of the Gulf Stream past the study region. The combination of these forcings produce 4 distinct circulation patterns, which promote exchange in specific parts of the study region and which preferentially exchange waters of certain properties. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Air-sea interactions in the Cape Hatteras region are relatively mild during summer months, characterized by steady heating of ocean waters and steady, relatively moderate northward winds, with the exception of tropical storms. &nbsp;Interactions during winter months are forced by repeated passage of extra-tropical cyclones (1-3 times per week), reversing alongshelf winds and driving strong heat loss from the ocean to the atmosphere. &nbsp;This two-season forcing is consistent with the statistical depiction described above.

The IES yields a measure of the onshore/offshore position of the Gulf Stream, which was then compared to the current profiler observations. &nbsp;Slow variations (periods greater than 1 month) &nbsp;in Gulf Stream position and strength modulate the exchange of shelf and open ocean waters through variations in the bottom boundary layer transport. &nbsp;Faster variations (less than 1 week) in Gulf Stream position associated with the passage of meanders drive an energetic cross-shelf circulation and upwelling of deeper waters, the latter of speeds estimated to be up to 100 m/day.</p>\n<p>An unusual export event was captured during a winter research cruise, in which a large volume of cold, chlorophyll- and oxygen-rich shelf water (both indicative of highly productive photoplankton) left the shelf and flowed beneath the Gulf Stream. &nbsp;By quickly moving from the shelf to a position well below the ocean surface offshore, this process effectively sequesters organic carbon in the ocean, a natural process that removes carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. &nbsp;The observations led to an review of historical data from the area and a realization that this process is operative during most winter seasons and may constitute a regular form of energetic shelfwater export not previously known to occur in the area.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 07/30/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Harvey&nbsp;E&nbsp;Seim</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1558920/1558920_10417229_1690386091290_Buoy_w_armstrong-2-sm--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1558920/1558920_10417229_1690386091290_Buoy_w_armstrong-2-sm--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Buoy Deployment\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1558920/1558920_10417229_1690386091290_Buoy_w_armstrong-2-sm--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Buoy Deployment\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">This photograph, showing Sara Haines working on a weather buoy deployed as part of PEACH, was taken with a drone.
