 "awd_abstract_narration": "By using the electric power sector as an example of a critical infrastructure, this career project will examine the influence of computer and network security expertise on critical infrastructure organizations, the ways cybersecurity is becoming a new field of expertise and the role of global enactments of cybersecurity on reshaping conceptions of international security. This project will integrate research and teaching in order to identify options for policymakers, professional organizations and researchers to help engage cybersecurity research in professional organizations and analyses of organizational exercises. This project will inform practitioners, organizations, and policymakers about best practices for reducing risks to critical infrastructure. It will provide information to government and city planning for developing responses to global cybersecurity threats.  It will also develop interdisciplinary tools for teaching cybersecurity to the next generation of information security experts, control engineers, and public administrators.\r\n\r\nThis project will examines enactments of cybersecurity expertise at three distinctive organizational scales:  the micro - scale of small groups and individuals; the meso - scale of institutions such as corporations and standards - setting groups; and the macro - scale of political economy and international organization.  This multi-scalar analysis will explore technical and cultural approaches to risk to show how distinctive cultures of expertise negotiate risk are a multi - dimensional phenomenon; will identify the distinctive practices of information and physical  infrastructures and will address how cyberpower will impact within international relations. The project will develop best practices for critical infrastructure organizations to integrate computer and network security expertise into overall risk management strategies, drawing on participant-observation and semi-structured interviews with practitioners in the field.",
