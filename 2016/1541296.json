 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Cyber Infrastructure Engineer (CI Engineer) is a new role at NMSU. This role accelerates scientific discovery by bridging the gap between researchers, other CI professionals, and institutional leadership. This role helps researchers overcome technical barriers in areas like data acquisition, network throughput, computational analysis, software management, and the storage/retrieval of research data. To create sustainable and scalable solutions, the CI Engineer leverages two central IT divisions (Networking and Computer Systems), and also partners with faculty and graduate students within the various research projects. These partnerships increase scientific computing skills across campus. The CI Engineer role reports directly to the Chief Information Officer who has established a greater priority for CI to support research at NMSU. Additionally this new role is also uniquely positioned to give voice to research priorities within the broader University IT Governance process.\r\n\r\nNMSU's Cyber Infrastructure Engineer role is expected to expand and improve CI solutions for faculty researchers, graduate students, and undergraduates. This includes greater access to high performance computing, open science grid computing, high throughput networks, and better data storage/retrieval systems. CI solutions both on and off campus will be used to accelerate scientific discovery. Moreover, the University expects the CI Engineer to help broaden the general understanding of best practices for research-focused cyber infrastructure by participating in the growing community of CI engineers at universities throughout the country, and sharing CI solutions with other education institutions in New Mexico.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis CC*DNI Engineer proposal was in response to the need on campus for a liaison to (i) remove technical barriers, (ii) accelerate research, (iii) optimize research budgets, and (iv) create sustainable cyberinfrastructure that can be leveraged by other projects.  In Aug 2016, Dr. Diana V. Dugas became New Mexico State University's (NMSU) first Enterprise Cyber Infrastructure Architect (CIA).  Dr. Dugas was chosen for this position due to her cross-discipline research background which enhances her ability to communicate well with researchers and IT professionals.  After a no-cost extension through December 2018, the CIA position, per the aim of the proposal, has become a permanent position at NMSU.\n\nThe CIA has (i) removed technical barriers by catalyzing a change in how software is purchased for the NMSU system.  An example, is moving common statistical software to a per FTE basis paid at the college level, thereby removing the burden off of faculty to pay for the software and increasing the student software accessibility.  Given NMSU's status as a Hispanic Serving Institution and its many first-generation university students, access to this software is not only vital for classes, but an important experience for the students as they apply for positions after graduation.  Dr. Dugas and 4 permanently funded graduate students positions make up the CIA team.  This team has also decreased technical barriers by creating and hosting workshops on how to use the campus high performance computer (HPC), various software, Linux workshops, and general sessions on supercomputing.  Dr. Dugas also meets with faculty departments across the university once a year to inform them about technology available on campus as to continue the dialog about the types of support researchers would like to see NMSU implement or issues that they are encountering regarding technology.\n\nResearch has been accelerated (ii) and research budgets optimized (iii) by this HPC education and outreach.  Before the CIA position, the HPC was not well known or utilized with only 16 users, at the end of the project there were 207 users  and we are expecting continued growth.  The CIA team created a Canvas (NMSU's learning management system) course to help on-board new users, giving them tools they need for success on the campus HPC. This resource is modelled after the eXtreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE) network of supercomputers so as to be a stepping-stone environment.  In addition, Dr. Dugas in conjunction with the Systems team created an HPC condo model on campus to remove the computer administrative burden off of faculty so they can focus on research and grant writing in response to the need witnessed on campus in the form of underutilized or mismanaged, and therefore nonfunctional, systems.  Participants in the condo model add computational equipment to the campus HPC.  The equipment belongs to the researcher, but administered by professionals; they have priority access to it and have the ability to \"burst out\" into the general cluster.  Campus researchers benefit through the ability to utilize the condo nodes when the owners leave them idle.  This HPC condo model also creates sustainable cyberinfrastructure (iv), and has been supported by 3 funded proposals and several others awaiting review. \n\nDr. Dugas has also been key leading an effort along with Vice President for Research, Provost, and the Library to establish a data management system (DMS)  for data preservation and distribution to be used for all researchers at NMSU as required by NSF and funding agencies. This DMS is also sustainable cyberinfrastructure (iv) as it leverages both on campus and regional infrastructure.\n\nDr. Dugas is an active member of XSEDE Campus Champions, allowing her to assist NMSU researchers in leveraging national resources, and she is an active member of the Rocky Mountain Advanced Computing Consortium (RMACC), a regional network that leverages cyberinfrastructure and education opportunities across university and state borders to the benefit of all associated partners and researchers.  The CIA position has also increased the number of proposals leveraging campus infrastructure and inter-university collaboration.  These proposals have increased the campus HPC, continued the outreach of NMSU researchers towards other universities and researchers, and strengthened the interaction of NMSU researchers and the local area high schools.  Members of the CIA team won ?Best Student Poster? for ?The Influence of Cyber-Infrastructure on Scientific Computing at NMSU? at PEARC18 (Practice and Experience in Advanced Research Computing; formerly the XSEDE conference).\n\nThe NMSU CIA proposal aimed to find a true facilitator and advocate for campus researchers.  Its successful completion can be seen in the strengthened national recognition of NMSU, the effects it has had on the graduates on the team (several desire to move, or already have, to a facilitator position upon completion of their degree), the increased communication and collaboration between NMSU researchers and IT professionals, and the cultural shift on campus for the existence and use of campus resources.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/05/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Norma Grijalva"
