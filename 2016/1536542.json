 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project focuses on professional networking outcomes among faculty in the geotechnical engineering community which will lead to broader impacts for the nation by improving retention, advancement and scientific collaboration of especially female geotechnical engineering faculty.  Networking improvements will be facilitated by developing a cohesive intellectual community that provides access to mentoring, novel information and new resources, as well as collaboration partners.  Using an intervention into the existing - largely disconnected - scientific community, female faculty will participate in networking workshops, as well as pre- and post-intervention surveys to understand their current networking needs, improvement of their networking abilities over time, and the impact their network ties have on academic collaboration.  The goal of the intervention process is to lower isolation of female faculty in geotechnical engineering by creating and sustaining a supportive national network that drives career success in academia.\r\n\r\nThis project will apply social network analysis and professional development activities to improve networking and collaboration among geotechnical engineering faculty in order to bridge the geographical distance and connectivity gaps faced especially by female geotechnical engineering faculty.  Building on past efforts of NSF and others, the project will create a network that fosters active tie creation and provides access to collaboration opportunities among geotechnical engineering faculty in the U.S.  The intervention into the existing network combines face-to-face networking meetings and virtual networking practices to increase collaboration opportunities.  The core challenges are: (a) how to sustain the attention network, (b) how to maintain strong connections among female faculty in their immediate professional environments and, (c) how to create weak ties that will help them in situations where their strong ties are unable to provide the social support, collaboration and information that they need.  The outcomes of the research will improve the faculty's understanding of the importance of networking, provide opportunities for sustaining collaborative connections with colleagues across the nation, and equip participants with the knowledge and skills to collaborate in a networked world.  The summative evaluation, including a before and after social network analysis, will evaluate the effectiveness of the purposeful interventions into the existing network of mostly weak ties among geotechnical women faculty and recommend promising practices for use in other disciplines where women face similar challenges.",

In geotechnical engineering, women faculty face additional challenges to success, with fewer women in the field than other engineering disciplines, women faculty report often feeling isolated within their institution. This poses additional barriers to women when in their professional network development and collaboration, both of which are increasingly important to researchers working to solve new and complex problems through interdisciplinary and collaboration.</p>\n<p>The GTWF Project (Geotechnical Women Faculty Project), led by three women faculty from the geotechnical community and one with expertise in social network analysis, was started with the goal to create an enduring network for women?s career success through professional network building and collaboration.</p>\n<p>In 2016 the GTWF project built the very first national database that included all 300+ geotechnical faculty. First by gathering names of geotechnical faculty whose articles appeared in relevant journals, and later using individual university webpages to find and add faculty by hand. In 2021, the process was repeated, updating data of over 400 geotechnical faculty members across the country. The data showed that women were only 18% of geotechnical faculty and that many of them were the only faculty at their school, and thus still isolated.</p>\n<p>Considering the low absolute numbers of female geotechnical faculty, efforts focused on promoting network building and collaboration across the entire country. The GTWF Project hosted national workshops open to all female geotechnical faculty and all geotechnical faculty that had agreed to be a part of the GTWF Project, focused explicitly on these themes of Networking and Collaboration.</p>\n<p>The first workshop in 2017 was two-days long and focused on information, strategies, and skills necessary for faculty to build strong professional networks. A series of lectures and panel discussions were held, specifically aimed at increasing female faculty?s understanding of how social networks impact career success and productivity, and how to develop their own network building skills to enhance career outcomes and research productivity. At this two-day workshop, 63% of all female geotechnical faculty in the US spent time together learning and sharing their experiences. In 2018, a second workshop was held focused on the theme of ?Collaboration? in the context of academic career development. Attendees included female geotechnical professors representing 50% of all US-based female geotechnical faculty.</p>\n<p class=\"Pa1\">An intervention model of seed grants, small amounts of money provided to faculty for a specific project, was started to provide participants funding to find collaborators and mentors. Thirty-two small grants were awarded in two ?rounds,? with twenty in 2018 and twelve more in 2020. The first GTWF seed grants were offered for the development of ?transformative relationships? that would allow faculty to enhance their research and careers. The second round of seed grants were offered to junior male and female faculty and emphasized collaboration and mentorship. Seed grants were evaluated for both quantitative and quantitative results. A full 50% of all projects resulted in an additional grant project, and 55% of projects produced a publication. Seed grants participants, or Primary Investigators (PIs) were interviewed after the completion of their projects, and transcripts of these interviews were qualitatively analyzed by researchers.</p>\n<p class=\"Pa1\">PIs in both rounds started new research projects and were able to win additional funding using results from their GTWF research. While those in 2020 were unable to travel due to COVID, PIs felt the project and the work they completed were a net benefit to their career. As interviews from both rounds reveal, PIs enjoyed very high levels of both success and satisfaction.</p>\n<p class=\"Pa1\">During this project, 8 graduate and 1 undergraduate student received work experience: 5 females and 4 males, with several students coauthoring papers and attending workshops. The findings of this project have appeared in 3 conference proceedings, 1 journal article, and in GEOSTRATA magazine. A final report of the GTWF project titled, ?Building Foundations: Supporting Female Faculty in Geotechnical Engineering?, (DOI:10.48246/GEOENG-CR-02), was sent to leaders and geotechnical faculty members across the country. The most recent database of the geotechnical faculty in the USA was published in DesignSafe-CI. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.17603/ds2-8avc-9s93\">https://doi.org/10.17603/ds2-8avc-9s93</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"Pa43\">In 30 years of working to improve the field?s gender parity, themes of networking, collaboration, and mentorship remain as strong and relevant as ever.
