 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-technical Abstract\r\n\r\nWith the support from the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program, the research team will work on an interdisciplinary project in design-directed material synthesis that calls for close interactions with colleagues in the Physics department.  The project aims to prepare and characterize a so far unknown class of dielectric materials based on artificial dipolar molecular rotors arranged in a 2-dimensional grid.  Such materials do not occur in nature and would be useful for signal processing and specifically for minituarization of analog components in electronic circuitry such as that found in cellular telephones.  A post-doctoral student and several undergraduates will receive interdisciplinary training (organic synthesis, a variety of spectroscopic and other physical techniques, and underlying materials theory).  The project will attract undergraduate students, K-12 students, and under-represented minorities to nanoscience.\r\n\r\n\r\nTechnical Abstract\r\n\r\nThe new 2-dimensional materials are to be assembled on a Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) trough and transferred to a lithographically patterned solid substrate.  The specifically synthesized rod-like rotor molecules carry a dipolar rotator between two triptycene units on an axle normal to the surface, and a carboxylic group at one end (the term molecular rotor is used for a molecule with a rotatable part, which is called the rotator).  Initial grazing-incidence X-ray scattering and other data demonstrate that molecules of this type self-assemble into a Langmuir monolayer on an aqueous subphase.  The structure of the assembly is characterized by an interlocking of the triptycene units into a double-decker trigonal pattern, with almost freely rotatable dipoles between the decks.  The distance between the dipoles and their magnitude are such that as long as sufficiently large 2-dimensional single-crystal domains can be prepared, in the first approximation the ground state should be ferroelectric, with a Curie temperature above ambient.  Rotator dynamics in the transferred monolayers (and multilayers) are to be studied by electric dichroism in the infrared part of the spectrum in the Michl laboratory and by dielectric spectroscopy in the Rogers laboratory.  Theory predicts the existence of ferroelectric ordering with unusually low velocity polar sound waves when long-range dipolar interactions dominate local steric barriers to rotation.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n In this project, we produce surfaces and thin layers that contain regular arrays of dipolar rotors.  Our aim is to design them so as to assure strong mutual interactions and collective behavior, especially ferroelectricity, which is very useful in electronics.  Rotor-based ferroelectrics would permit a minituarization of analog circuitry.  In the just completed grant period, we managed for the first time ever to produce a surface containing a dipolar rotor array with the exact structure that is predicted by theory to be optimal.  However, it was not sturdy enough to survive the transfer from an aqueous surface to a solid substrate.  We then modified the molecular structure in a way that promises greatly improved stability and are now waiting for time on a synchrotron to verify the structure of the new array. \n\nWe have also worked with nanocrystals and thin layers of a material that contains channels capable of accommodating dipolar rotors of a different structure and detected signs of ferroelectric interactions, but no ferroelectric phase.  We have identified factors that need to be addressed in order to produce a ferroelectric phase. \n\nIn the process, two postdoctoral researchers and two undergraduates have obtained training and education in multidisciplinary nanoscience.  We collaborate closely with physicists at the University of Colorado, Boulder.  The results were reported at several lectures at conferences and mentioned in public lectures.  They were reported in four new publications; more are being written.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/04/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Josef Michl"
