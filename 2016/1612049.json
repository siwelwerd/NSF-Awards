 "awd_abstract_narration": "In General Relativity, spacetime and spacelike slices of spacetime are manifolds (objects that locally resembles Euclidean spaces) satisfying certain geometric conditions determined by the Einstein Equation and other physically natural constraints. The manifolds arising in General Relativity are curved by gravity and they can contain black holes or thin deep gravity wells, making it technically difficult to estimate how close the manifold is to a simplified model, like Euclidean space.  New compactness theorems with new notions of convergence are developed in this project providing fundamental new geometric tools that can be applied to address these challenges. The principal investigator has already been invited to present preliminary work in this direction at various mathematics and physics institutions around the world.  As she has in the past, the PI will include young mathematicians of diverse backgrounds in this research project.\r\n\r\nThe PI will seek intrinsic flat limits of noncollapsing sequences of Riemannian manifolds with uniform lower bounds on scalar curvature. For example, the PI will consider sequences of asymptotically flat Riemannian manifolds with nonnegative scalar curvature whose ADM mass is approaching zero, or regions in such spaces with a uniform upper bound on Hawking mass. Compactness theorems for such sequences would be useful to prove the Almost Rigidity of the Schoen-Yau Positive Mass Theorem or the Bartnik Conjecture. Similar methods will also be applied towards proving Gromov's Almost Rigidity of Flat Tori Conjecture. To avoid cancellation and bubbling, the PI proposes to forbid the existence of arbitrarily small closed minimal surfaces in these and other conjectures stated within the proposal. Various Compactness Theorems for Intrinsic Flat convergence have been proven in different settings by Prof. Wenger, Dr. Portegies, Prof. LeFloch,  Dr. Perales, Dr. Matveev, and the PI. Prior applications of intrinsic flat convergence to General Relativity have been completed in various papers by Prof. Lee, Prof. Huang, Prof. LeFloch, Prof. Stavrov, Prof. Jauregui and the PI.",

Some of these postdocs began working with Dr. Sormani in the Summer of 2017 at the Fields Institute in Toronto, while others only came on board recently when Dr. Sormani was visiting the Simons Center for Geometry and Physics and the Institute for Advanced Study during her sabbatical in Fall 2018-Spring 2019.   Located at a variety of universities around the world, the team came together through a series of workshops.  The funding has successfully supported not only the research and travel of the sixteen junior mathematicians on the team but also trained over two hundred additional mathematicians who participated in the 2020 Virtual Workshop on Ricci and Scalar Curvature.\nThe team has focused on both the direct applications of intrinsic flat convergence to sequences of curved spaces that arise in general relativity and the development of new mathematical techniques that can be applied to better understand these curved spaces.

However it is known that even with a tiny amount of mass, space can be strongly curved and have deep gravity wells.
