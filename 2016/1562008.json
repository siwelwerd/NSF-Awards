 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Northern New Mexico College Biology and Environmental Sciences Training (BEST) project will provide annual scholarships to 25 full-time academically talented and underrepresented students with demonstrated financial need majoring in Biology or Environmental Science (ES).  The BEST project will implement best practice supportive curricular activities, including Peer-led Team Learning study groups, Biology seminar series, faculty-mentored undergraduate research experiences (URE), and conference participation; and a suite of non-curricular activities including monthly cohort building activities, all known to foster retention. BEST will also support the entry of participants into the STEM workforce and graduate programs by providing paid summer workforce internships and URE.  This program is important for the advancement of scientific knowledge and understanding of those practices and services that most effectively recruit, retain and graduate underrepresented students in STEM, thereby increasing the number of underrepresented students entering the STEM workforce and diversifying the field.\r\n\r\nThe project objectives include: 1) increasing the number of students in Biology and ES programs by enhancing recruitment and retention; 2) increasing degree progress by increasing student credit hours taken per semester; 3) increasing graduation rates; and 4) implementing a longitudinal study that will generate a 'Risk of Leaving STEM' scale; analyze math anxiety among STEM and non-STEM majors; analyze student services that correlate with increases in a student's self-identity and sense of belonging in a STEM program; and analyze correlations between summer research/workforce internships and STEM career entry. The research will assess whether the support services and activities impact retention/graduation using a longitudinal cohort design. The measures employed are derived from the NSF Common Guidelines for Education Research and Development and involve qualitative and quantitative components.  Early attrition points are heavily targeted in the first four semesters to gain comparative samples and establish baselines. Tracking will occur at key points to collect additional measures to establish individual changes over time. Analyses will determine the effect of faculty and peer mentoring, summer internships, and engagement in professional activities as triggers for STEM leaving or enhanced STEM self-identification.  External evaluation will provide formative information to ensure continuous improvement of support services to ensure they foster retention and degree completion. Summative evaluation will gauge the project's effectiveness in meeting its goals and inform long range planning.",

NNMC is a Hispanic and Native American serving institution in rural New Mexico and implementation of the BEST program was challenging and rewarding at the same time. The main goals of the BEST grant included 1) increasing recruitment (50%), retention (50%), degree progress (32 more credit hours/semester, 150% graduation time), and graduation rates (50%) of students pursuing Bachelor&rsquo;s degree in Biology or Environmental Sciences, and support their entry into the local/ regional/ national STEM workforce or graduate programs; 2) implementing best practice supportive curricular activities, non-curricular and workforce development activities (paid summer internships); and 3) implementing a longitudinal study that will contribute to understanding the effectiveness of supportive curricular, non-curricular and workforce development activities on retention, degree attainment, and STEM career choices.</p>\n<p>During the program, a total of 37 individual students were awarded the BEST scholarship. The graduation rate among the BEST scholars was 54.4%, as 20 of the BEST scholarship recipients graduated by the end of the program, which was higher than the overall NNMC graduation rate and closer to the National 4 year graduation rate for 4-year institutions. The BEST program also impacted recruitment and retention during this period. In 2021, we had a 45% increase in overall enrollment compared to 2016. This increase in enrollment is also a result of the new radiation protection program at NNMC. Retention rate (academic year-year) among BEST scholars was 100% from Year I to II and Year II to III, 85% in Year III to IV, and 88% in Year IV to V. The dip in the last two years are attributed to student graduation and impact of COVID 19 on students. NNMC campus operated remotely since March 2020 and there was almost no campus presence during that period.</p>\n<p>The majority of the BEST scholars participated in undergraduate research, weekly seminars and engaged in interaction with faculty mentors. Interaction with faculty mentors and student initiative resulted in BEST scholars (10 students; 27%) being accepted for summer research internships in various national summer research programs. It also resulted in student (22%) initiatives for applications towards Post-baccalaureate programs (2 students), Master&rsquo;s program (3 students), professional school (3), and graduate school (1). Participation in undergraduate research in NNMC also led BEST scholars (25 students, 68%) to be part of national and international conferences and symposia as presenters. 100% of the BEST scholars attended weekly seminars to interact with speakers from diverse areas of expertise.</p>\n<p>The study to understand the effect of the implemented curricular, non-curricular, and workforce development activities on retention, graduation, and STEM career choices was carried out. The findings were disseminated through our presentation at the S-STEM symposium, 2019. Results of Undergraduate research conducted by BEST scholars were presented at conferences like the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium, NM Alliance of Minority Participation, Animal Behavior Society, etc. The undergraduate research projects have led to an increase in the submission of federal grants by the faculty mentors and have encouraged them to explore further avenues to enhance undergraduate research capacity at NNMC. Currently, NNMC has five different functional undergraduate research labs- Fish lab, cancer cell biology lab, plant biology lab, Geographic Information Systems (GIS) lab, and Environmental science lab.</p>\n<p>Overall, the BEST program has helped change the culture related to STEM education at NNMC with the implementation of good practices for increased recruitment, retention, and graduation. The BEST program has significantly changed student attitudes towards science and has helped students gain confidence and develop skills for further science careers in academics and/or industry. The BEST program has not only served existing students but has also incited an interest in Biology and Environmental Science programs in the Northern student community. It has impacted the student perspective about Biology and Environment Science fields and has provided students with the opportunity to explore the STEM career possibilities in these areas.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 11/27/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Sushmita&nbsp;B&nbsp;Nandy</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1562008/1562008_10450002_1637993338509_BESTstudents-labwork-2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1562008/1562008_10450002_1637993338509_BESTstudents-labwork-2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"BEST students in the lab/ field-2\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1562008/1562008_10450002_1637993338509_BESTstudents-labwork-2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"BEST students in the lab/ field-2\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">BEST students working in the New Mexico Consortium labs (A, B), Fish lab at NNMC (C) and on a field trip to the Bahamas with one of the BEST faculty mentors.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Sushmita Nandy</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Sushmita&nbsp;B&nbsp;Nandy</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">BEST students in the lab/ field-2</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1562008/1562008_10450002_1637993135187_BESTstudents-labwork-1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1562008/1562008_10450002_1637993135187_BESTstudents-labwork-1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"BEST students in the lab-1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1562008/1562008_10450002_1637993135187_BESTstudents-labwork-1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"BEST students in the lab-1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">BEST students working in the Cancer cell biology lab, NNMC with one of the BEST faculty mentors</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Sushmita Nandy</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Sushmita&nbsp;B&nbsp;Nandy</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">BEST students in the lab-1</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1562008/1562008_10450002_1637993047980_Enrollment,Retention,Undergraduateresearchparticipation--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1562008/1562008_10450002_1637993047980_Enrollment,Retention,Undergraduateresearchparticipation--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Enrollment, Retention and Undergraduate research participation\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1562008/1562008_10450002_1637993047980_Enrollment,Retention,Undergraduateresearchparticipation--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Enrollment, Retention and Undergraduate research participation\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Enrollment, Retention and Undergraduate research participation</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Sushmita Nandy and NNMC Institutional Research</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Sushmita&nbsp;B&nbsp;Nandy</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Enrollment, Retention and Undergraduate research participation</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1562008/1562008_10450002_1637993540643_BESTstudents-researchpresentations--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1562008/1562008_10450002_1637993540643_BESTstudents-researchpresentations--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"BEST students-research presentations\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1562008/1562008_10450002_1637993540643_BESTstudents-researchpresentations--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"BEST students-research presentations\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">BEST scholars presenting their research  at the NM AMP conference (A), NMAS conference (B) and at the NNMC Annual research symposium (C)</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Sushmita Nandy</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Sushmita&nbsp;B&nbsp;Nandy</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">BEST students-research presentations</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
