 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit: The University of Colorado at Boulder, in collaboration with the University of Texas at Austin, the University of Virginia, and the University of Washington are supporting an extension service project that is synergistically serving the disciplines most in need of help for improving women?s representation: computer science, computer engineering, electrical engineering, and mechanical engineering. At each of 30 institutions, interdepartmental teams of change agents from computer science, computer engineering, electrical engineering, and mechanical engineering departments are being established. In each institution, high-level administrative commitment is elicited. At each ?client? institution, the interdepartmental teams recruit cooperatively for ?net new women,? as opposed to raiding each other?s pool of potential majors. Each department is adopting research-based methods for retaining undergraduate women, such as improved faculty-student interaction, and will be held accountable for initiatives, evaluation, and reporting. Cooperative department teams are supported and guided by a cadre of highly trained and experienced consultants. These train their assigned interdisciplinary teams on proven practices and methods for recruiting and retaining women. In addition, experienced staff and external evaluators will support departments and consultants with tracking and evaluation tools, collect and review periodic progress reports, and recommend improvements. This extension service focuses on reforming departmental and faculty practices in sustainable ways for long-term improvement in their undergraduate gender balance. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: The project will significantly raise the number of women of all races and ethnicities who receive bachelor?s degrees in the neediest fields: computer science, computer engineering, electrical engineering, and mechanical engineering. Explicitly including minority-serving institutions will help to meet national diversity goals in these areas. Use of data to identify minority women?s typical major choices will support local recruiting on each campus. The project will bring explicit, widespread attention to the exemplar institutions and document their approaches so that others may emulate their practices.",

NCWIT Extension Services takes a systemic change approach to increasing women&rsquo;s participation. Changing the educational system experienced by all students is a sustainable approach to overcoming underrepresentation. We promote customized strategies that maximize return on investment, use the least time to see results, have the least impact on resources, and improve the experience for all students. To attract students to computing majors, we recommend that departments target students who can be in the major in the next year or two; inform students and their influencers; leverage existing programs; develop and share persuasive methods for their own and others&rsquo; use; and evaluate what works and what does not to attract women to the major. To retain students, we recommend department-wide efforts that focus on cultivating student-student and student-faculty interaction in classrooms and labs, resulting in greater sense of belonging and the development of professional identity with the field; and develop curriculum, assignments, and examples that are more relevant and meaningful to students.</p>\n<p>Project Outcomes to Date</p>\n<p>Systemic change takes time. For example, NCWIT served 32 clients between 2007-2011. In 2016, we observed that these clients awarded 21% of their BS to women, having gone from some of the worst performers nationally to 3% above the national average of 18%. In the five-year Expanding the Pool Project, we have seen positive short-term gains. We combined data using the NCWIT Tracking Tool, into which clients submit data on applications, acceptances, and new enrollments; total declared majors and retention; and graduations. We also use graduation data from the National Center for Education Statistics. We analyzed clients&rsquo; outcomes using a matched analysis of a baseline year immediately prior to consultation (either 2011 or 2013, depending on clients' starting year) and a post-consultation year immediately after (either 2014 or 2016). We found that more and a higher percentage of women students applied to majors, were accepted, actually enrolled, made up the body of declared majors, and graduated even in this short time frame</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">More Women Applied to Client Departments&rsquo; Majors over Baseline</span>.
