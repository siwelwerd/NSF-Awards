  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Trinity College Next Generation Science Network and DMZ project was designed to allow the college?s researchers and instructors a low latency high speed data pathway to remote resources.  This project replaced networking hardware in our science facilities and wide area connection to our regional Research and Education Network (Connecticut Education Network).  The project also creates a ScienceDMZ for defined data intensive workflows and deploys a PerfSONAR node for performance monitoring.  The project work is now substantially complete, and the Trinity science community is now able to participate in the collection, processing, and dissemination of large datasets that were previously difficult to accomplish with our cyberinfrastructure.  Our final ScienceDMZ configuration and associated PerfSONAR node will go into production in June 2018.  \n\n \n\nFaculty has already noted significant improvement of data flows with the first two phases of our project complete.  Phase I brought online a 10gbit connection to Internet2 via Connecticut Education Network with new high-speed WAN routers.  Phase II replaced network LAN switches in science buildings used by faculty and researchers to connect to both WAN resources and local servers.  Phase III will allow us to enable ScienceDMZ capabilities on this new hardware direct to researchers when needed.  Now that the hardware is installed, and we are will finishing its configuration, we will begin to work with faculty on how to best utilities the resource.  Some faculty have already noted significant increases of 8-10 times the pre-grant transfer levels, however work must still be done to utilize the ScienceDMZ, streamline workflows, and measure improvement.  We look forward to the process of education, incremental improvement and monitoring of this resource as our faculty and researchers begin to more fully utilize it for scientific discovery.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/31/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Frederick Kass"
