 "awd_abstract_narration": "Turbulent dissipation and non-hydrostatic pressure perturbations have profound effects on the structure and evolution of cloud fields. For example, turbulent mixing of dry environmental air into cumulus clouds may greatly reduce their buoyancy and moisture content. Viewing this process as a problem in entrainment has led to controversy in part because entrainment is difficult to define in a precise and practically useful way. Instead, it may help to focus attention on the turbulent scalar dissipation of, e.g., total water content, which has a mathematical definition and appears explicitly in the equation for the variance of total water. To cite another example, wind fields are highly anisotropic in stratocumulus layers just below the inversion, with the static stability above suppressing vertical motion but not horizontal motion. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:\r\nStudy of these phenomena has been impeded in part by the difficulty of making observational measurements. Recently, however, two new opportunities have arisen. First, new and useful diagnostics are becoming available in large-eddy simulation (LES) models that have simulated a variety of cloud cases. In particular, budgets of velocity and scalar variances are becoming available, along with estimates of dissipation rate. Second, higher-order closure parameterizations that can take advantage of improved understanding of turbulence and pressure effects have now been implemented in weather forecast and climate models. This enables the possibility of exploring how small-scale turbulent processes influence large-scale emergent cloud properties.\r\n\r\nTo explore turbulent and pressure processes in cloud fields, several steps will be undertaken.  First, additional budgets and diagnostics will be implemented in a LES model. Second, LES of cloud cases will be analyzed in order to better understand the turbulent and pressure-related behaviors. Third, the LES output will be used to evaluate existing and new parameterizations of turbulent dissipation and pressure covariances. Finally, regional and global simulations with various parameterizations will be performed in order to better understand how different assumptions influence large-scale fields.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:\r\nThe research group has been offering internships since 2007 to software engineering students at a local undergraduate institution. Those undergraduates see firsthand both the power and pitfalls of working with large pieces of software. In return, the students help the project to improve software development.  Eleven undergraduates have completed the internships, and all have obtained good jobs in software. This program will be continued this student training.  In addition, the project will train a graduate student, disseminate research broadly, and improve modeling techniques that may be of use in weather forecast and climate models.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n \nEffects of Turbulent Dissipation and Pressure Perturbations on Clouds\n\n\n\n\nThis project investigated turbulence in clouds in the Earth's atmosphere.  Turbulence provides an obstacle to the horizontal wind, creating a \"cumulus friction\" that applies a brake to wind speeds.  The effects on wind have effects, in turn, on low and high pressure systems that make up our weather.\n\n \nIntellectual Merit\n\n \nA simple model of the effects of turbulence on the mean wind assumes that the vertical wind profile is diffused down the gradient of wind.  This was found to be an oversimplification even in a case of non-precipitating trade-wind cumulus clouds.  A detailed simulation of such a cloud field indicated that in fact the transport is upgradient in the region of the profile above the maximum value of the wind.  A revised model that accounts for such upgradient transport was developed and implemented in a global model of the atmosphere.\n\n \nBroader Impacts\n\n \nFirst, the revised model improved a variant of an atmospheric model that is in wide use.\n\n \nSecond, the project provided training in turbulence theory and software development for a postdoctoral research associate, a graduate student, and an undergraduate.  The undergraduate was attending a nearby college that does not offer Ph.D.-level research.  The undergraduate was exposed to such research through this project.\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/30/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Vincent E Larson"
