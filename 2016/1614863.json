 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant supports an interdisciplinary team of three investigators using mathematical modeling, computer simulations, and experiments to develop improved predictive models for the behavior of cell membranes in certain contexts.  This research project concerns the mathematical modeling of the interaction between a cell membrane and a solid particle, a physical process that is essential to cell adhesion to a solid surface and cellular uptake (endo/exocytosis) of colloidal nanoparticles (e.g., drug carriers).  Advances in nano- and biomedical engineering have made it possible to design smart materials for more effective medical treatments (e.g., targeted drug delivery).  These technical developments are based on understanding how a cell membrane interacts with colloidal particles in a fluid environment filled with ions and macromolecules.  It is imperative to better understand the physical processes that underpin such ubiquitous membrane-solid interactions in a complex fluid environment.\r\n\r\nThis project aims to develop new mathematical models and numerical algorithms to describe quantitatively the particle-membrane interactions by considering random thermal fluctuations, electrokinetic effects, and nanoscale phenomena (e.g., molecular layering) that are commonly ignored in conventional continuum-based approaches.  Microfluidic experiments will be developed in parallel to guide the mathematical and computational modeling of a membrane interacting with solid surfaces with curvature and/or localized features.  This project will advance the mathematical modeling of a lipid bilayer membrane (LBM) interacting with solid surfaces and particles by considering the presence of the thin liquid film filling the gap between the LBM and other solid surfaces.  It is hypothesized that, through physically consistent effective interaction potentials, a continuum-based thin film equation can capture the macroscopic spreading dynamics of LBMs on surfaces with variable wetting properties and zeta potentials, under different ionic strengths.  One of the main results from the mathematical modeling will be the stochastic nonlinear lubrication equation for the height of the thin liquid film between the LBM and a solid surface.  Theoretical predictions, such as LBM adhesion and spreading time, will be compared against experimental results for validation and model refinement.  The developed model will be employed to investigate the adhesion of a LBM (1) under different ionic concentrations in the liquid and (2) on solid surfaces with curvature and localized features.",

Such interactions are important in cellular biophysics and soft matter physics, where the cellular membrane is modeled as an elastic sheet, and the macromolecules (such as proteins) are modeled as rigid particles. Throughout the entire duration of the award, PI Young worked with two other PIs and investigated three main subjects.</p>\n<p>(1) Hydrodynamic interactions between an elastic sheet and a rigid surface, and between two elastic membranes. Works on this subject had been published in three journal papers. In particular, in the work on \"The effect of rigid cells on blood viscosity: linking rheology and sickle cell anemia\", we report systematic experimental measurements of the viscosity of a suspension varying the fraction of rigid particles within a suspension of healthy cells. We also perform systematic numerical simulations of a similar mixed suspension of soft RBCs, rigid particles, and their hydrodynamic interactions. Our results show that there is a rheological signature within blood viscosity to clearly identify the fraction of rigidified cells among healthy deformable cells down to a 5% volume fraction of rigidified cells. Although aggregation of RBCs is known to affect blood rheology at low shear rates, and our simulations mimic this effect&nbsp;via&nbsp;an adhesion potential, we show that such adhesion, or aggregation, is unlikely to provide a physical rationalization for the viscosity increase observed in the experiments at moderate shear rates due to rigidified cells. Through numerical simulations, we also highlight that most of the viscosity increase of the suspension is due to the rigidity of the particles rather than their sickled or spherical shape. Our results are relevant to better characterize SCA, provide useful insights relevant to rheological consequences of blood transfusions, and, more generally, extend to the rheology of mixed suspensions having particles with different rigidities, as well as offering possibilities for developments in the field of soft material composites.</p>\n<p>(2) Effects of membrane properties (semipermeability, hydrophobicity, and surface viscosity) on membrane-solid interactions. Works on this subject had been published in seven journal papers. In particular, in the work on \"Hydrodynamics of a semipermeable inextensible membrane under flow and confinement\", &nbsp;we use boundary integral simulations to investigate the effects of water permeability on the hydrodynamics of an inextensible membrane under a mechanical load, such as the viscous stress from an external flow deforming an inextensible membrane in free space or pushing it through a confinement. Incorporating the membrane permeability into the framework of Helfrich free energy for an inextensible, elastic membrane (a vesicle), we illustrate that, in the absence of an osmotic stress gradient, the semipermeable vesicle is affected by water influx/efflux over a sufficiently long time or under a strong confinement. Our simulations quantify the conditions for water permeation to be negligible in terms of the timescales, flow strength, and confinement. These results shed light on how microfluidic confinement can be utilized to estimate membrane permeability.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>(3) Using machine learning to construct a physics-based model for membrane-solid interactions in a viscos solvent. Yuexin Liu, the student supported by this project, planned to use machine learning to aid the modeling of membrane-solid interactions. In her pursuit she learned reinforcement learning and became an expert on using machine learning to design and train a swimmer in low Reynolds number flow. Work in this subject led to two published journal papers and one is under review. In particular, in the work on \"Gait switching and targeted navigation of microswimmers via deep reinforcement learning\", we use a deep reinforcement learning approach to enable a model microswimmer to self-learn effective locomotory gaits for translation, rotation and combined motions. The Artificial Intelligence (AI) powered swimmer can switch between various locomotory gaits adaptively to navigate towards target locations. The multimodal navigation strategy is reminiscent of gait-switching behaviors adopted by swimming microorganisms. We show that the strategy advised by AI is robust to&nbsp;flow perturbations and versatile in enabling the swimmer to perform complex tasks such as path tracing without being explicitly programmed. Taken together, our results demonstrate the vast potential of these AI-powered swimmers for applications in unpredictable, complex&nbsp;fluid environments.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Yuexin's work has been affected by the pandemic, as she had to take care of her new born during the pandemic.
