 "awd_abstract_narration": "A goal of the Tribal Colleges and Universities Program (TCUP) is to increase the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) instructional and research capacities of specific institutions of higher education that serve the Nation's indigenous students. The PEEC-II track provides support for studies or educational research conducted by institutions that have had earlier Pre-Engineering Education Collaborative (PEEC) awards.  The intent of PEEC-II is to capture, analyze, and disseminate the impact of these awards on the participating institutions, faculty, or students, and their communities. PEEC and PEEC-II are partnerships between TCUP and the Directorate for Engineering.\r\n\r\nThis collaboration among TCUP colleges Sitting Bull College (SBC), Cankdeska Cikana Community College (CCCC), Nueta Hidatsa Sahnish College (NHSC), and Turtle Mountain Community College (TMCC), and North Dakota State University (NDSU), is the culmination of more than 15 years of active engagement in STEM education on North Dakota reservations. It builds on the foundation of their PEEC award which created formal partnerships, implemented student support structures at NDSU, and developed means to support pre-engineering coursework at remote tribal college locations through distance learning and support of tribal college faculty.  The goals of this project are to 1) investigate and document the relationship between a new hybrid distance learning model applied to engineering education and its impact on recruitment, persistence and graduation of American Indian students, and 2) investigate and document the critical elements of the learning and support environments that can improve student success within engineering majors.\r\n\r\nAlong with creating sustainable and supportive pathways to engineering degrees for American Indian students, the broader impact of this project will come from the value of the distance learning model and its assessment, disseminated broadly, which can support STEM learning at the participating institutions as well as at other institution partnerships that are trying to improve pathways between rural or isolated schools and four-year institutions.",

At its beginning, the Phase II grant had 13 students receiving support and over its existence and was able to graduate with engineering degrees nine of those students plus one additional transfer student, which brought the total for both phases of the PEEC project to 13 graduated degreed engineers. One of the original 13 supported students went on to receive a baccalaureate degree in computer science and another is completing a Master's degree in anthropology. A third student of the original 13 is completing a degree in Arizona, closer to family members. Also, during this period of support, five additional students transferred to North Dakota State University, NDSU, from tribal colleges with up to three additional students scheduled to transfer in the next academic year. During this same funding period, the Introduction to Engineering with CADD course (the initial course in the pre-engineering sequence) was offered 10 times allowing 65 students to get a glimpse of the engineering curriculum to determine their own potential fit in the profession. For students moving past this introductory class, every semester around 8 to 10 engineering and math classes were taught in the program. Nearly 20% of students persisted beyond the introductory class. Many factors contributed to the relative lack of persistence, including: shift of personal goals away from engineering, time commitment conflicts with personal priorities, lack of suitable family support situation(s), medical condition or situation (personal or family member), employment constraints, travel constraints, legal issues, Covid-19 pandemic, etc.</span></p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.2; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\" dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Beyond these direct human results, the funding led to the collaborative giving seven reviewed presentations at the 2019, 2020 and 2021 Annual Conference and Exposition of the American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE) and the First-Year Engineering Experience Conference, also sponsored by ASEE. These presentations focused on how the following topics impacted indigenous student education: improvement of math preparation, development of metacognitive skills, improvement of quantitative reasoning, interactive learning opportunities through distance education, recruitment of minorities into engineering, lessons learned from teaching during a pandemic and utilization of such a program to facilitate decolonization of education. One of the 2019 presentations was also referenced in a 2020 presentation given by another group at the ASEE annual conference.</span></p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.2; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\" dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Beyond the presentations at ASEE conferences that directly or indirectly reported on the work supported by this grant, the work outcomes were also reported by members of the collaborative at other events. One such event was the Waasamoogikinwaa'amaading Virtual Conference regarding Post Pandemic Online and Distance Learning at Tribal Colleges sponsored by Leech Lake Tribal College, April 14-15, 2021. Two presentations were made at this event. Another report was delivered as a requested presentation at a special virtual workshop conducted by the National Academy of Engineering entitled \"Sharing Exemplary Admissions Practices That Promote Diversity and Engineering\", May 24-26, 2021. The presentation was entitled \"Native American Students into Engineering: Pre-Engineering Education Collaboration (2+2+2+infinity) &amp; Connections Matter\"</span></p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.2; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\" dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">All of the above-mentioned accomplishments were made more significant by the ramifications of the worldwide pandemic experienced from March 2019 to the present. The constraints and practices put in place while combatting the pandemic had a significant impact on the intended operation and full attainment of all goals proposed in the grant application. It is hard to fully quantify all impacts imposed upon indigenous student learning by the pandemic. These impacts included: school closures, mandated isolation, restricted access to the web (in spite of NSF efforts to maintain or improve web connections), loss of personal support networks, learning environment disruptions, online teaching quality variations, personal motivational uncertainties and variations, health and income uncertainties, individual and family infections with the disease and loss of family members, among others. Reduced infection rates during the summer of 2021 allowed the resumption of an in-person summer session. All of these factors seem to highlight the necessity of personal connections to student success in a stronger fashion than formerly demonstrated.</span></p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.2; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\" dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">However, perhaps the most rewarding of all outcomes was the ongoing support from tribal colleges to institutionalize access to engineering education for their student populations. This was demonstrated by the expansion of the program to include an additional North Dakota tribal college, and also by several of participating tribal colleges receiving individual grants to carry on the work.</span></p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 04/29/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Koreen&nbsp;Ressler</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div
