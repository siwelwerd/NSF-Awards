 "awd_abstract_narration": "To ensure sustained U.S. competitiveness and prosperity in the global economy, the United States must promote greater growth in its engineering workforce, especially among underrepresented populations. Since its inception, the National Science Foundation has maintained great interest in activities that promote broadening participation among underrepresented groups. To increase participation in engineering, new knowledge must be generated on how best to broadening participation at every juncture of the educational pipeline, including the K-12 level. Very little, if any, research has investigated the factors that influence broadening participation among rural, underrepresented students within the K-12  educational enterprise. In the southern region of the United States, the Alabama Black Belt bears an uneven burden of poverty, where many low income and underrepresented groups are disproportionately affected. With this in mind, the investigators proposed to collect multiple levels of data across 15 school districts in the Black Belt region to pinpoint educational barriers and create action plans that can mitigate and/or eliminate these educational obstacles for rural underrepresented students. This project will likely have a tremendous impact on the engineering workforce in the Black Belt region and beyond. \r\n\r\nUsing Social Cognitive Career Theory as the theoretical framework, the investigators outlined a comprehensive project to study the issues often associated with low income students and underrepresented students entering the engineering enterprise and determine the educational challenges that they experience with pursuing engineering. Because of the cross-cutting nature of the project, a multi-disciplinary research team, composed of engineers, scientists, education faculty, and research staff, will be formed to execute this comprehensive study. Additionally, advisory committees, representing local, state, and federal interests, will be created to help promote the project and ensure its success with identifying the educational challenges and recommending specific strategies to address the identified challenges.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe goal of this project was to determine the \"state of STEM\" in rural school districts throughout Alabama.  A total of 18 school districts participated generating a large data set for analysis.  From those 18 school districts, 3,552 lower elementary (1st-3rd grade) students  2,462 upper elementary (4th and 5th grade) students , 4,912 secondary (6th - 12th grade) students, 11,030 parents, 1,217 teachers, and 128 principals participated in this study.  From this study a new instrument was developed to measure all five constucts of the Social Cognitive Career Theory and is available for use by other researchers.  Results from this study showed that students in rural areas of the state are interested in STEM fields, however resources are constrained and opportunities are few for those interested students.  Three STEM educational activities were developed as a part of this project that are now in use across several school systems in Alabama in an effort to provide additional opportunities for interested students.  Additionaly, the data and results from this study formed the impetus for the development of the Virtual Engineering Academy (VEA) for Alabama.  Once complete, courses at the middle school and high school level will be available to all students throughout the state of Alabama.  We also envision the VEA providing information regarding admission and financial aid to all seven of the colleges of engineering within the state. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/09/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Michael P Benfield"
