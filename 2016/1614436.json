 "awd_abstract_narration": "With current research indicating that up to one in 68 children is on the autism spectrum, it is critical to create programs that prepare students with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) to achieve their full potential in the workforce. This three-year project will bring together a team of researchers, Maker program developers from New York Hall of Science, educators with expertise in supporting students with ASD, and students on the autism spectrum to create a hybrid formal/informal program that prepares middle-school students with and without ASD for careers as inventors, designers, and engineers. The goal is for the program to be sustainably implemented in New York City's ASD inclusion middle schools by educators in those schools. Not only will this project benefit students, educators, and staff in the largest and most diverse ASD inclusion program in the country, it also will serve as a model of collaborative program development and implementation that other ASD inclusion programs in urban school districts can follow. This project will advance efforts of the Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program to better understand and promote practices that increase students' motivations and capacities to pursue careers in fields of science, technology, engineering, or mathematics contributing new knowledge about how theoretically grounded, research-based techniques for supporting students with ASD can be incorporated into Maker programs, and how to implement such programs in formal and informal inclusion education settings. This will expand our understanding of design and engineering workforce preparation for middle school students with ASD, provide a model for how to translate informal STEM programs to school-based environments, and demonstrate how such cross-setting programs can be tailored by stakeholders to various educational contexts. The resources made available through this project will support the adaptation of the program by other districts.\r\n\r\nThe researchers will use Clements' (2007) Curriculum Research Framework to structure a collaborative co-design approach, organized around the following phases of work. Phase 1: Collaborative program redesign. Test and redesign a museum-based Design and Fabrication Make Academy afterschool program to include techniques for supporting students with ASD, and to add classroom and lunchtime components to the afterschool program. Phase 2: Pilot test and revise. Conduct a pilot test of the redesigned program and research instruments in three inclusion middle schools, and make revisions based on findings. Phase 3: Research study. Implement the revised program and conduct research that examines whether it shows promise for (a) helping program participants learn the Engineering Design Process, (b) increasing the science and engineering interest and career motivation of program participants, and (c) creating a sustainable program and implementation process for urban ASD inclusion programs.",

The rationale for this project was that autistic students have great potential to be as successful as their neurotypical peers; they just need the opportunity to learn in a setting that builds on their strengths. Maker programming--which is characterized by hands-on tinkering that is interest-driven and pursued at one's own pace, demanding whatever level of socialization the individual decides is needed--seemed like a good fit for deeply engaging autistic youth with their peers. The project brought together a team that was highly skilled in maker programming (New York Hall of Science), in autism support strategies (New York University's ASD Nest Support Project), in engineering (NYU's Tandon School of Engineering), in educating diverse autistic and neurotypical students (ASD Nest-trained educators in NYC schools), in collaborative education program design, particularly for students with disabilities (Education Development Center), and in quantitative research on educational outcomes for students with disabilities (SRI International). Together, this group engaged in our own engineering design process as we adapted a maker program that originally had been run at the New York Hall of Science so that it could be run by teachers in NYC public middle schools as an afterschool or lunch club. This required two years of redesign and piloting before the program could be facilitated successfully by the teachers on their own in Year 3.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Intellectual Merit</strong></p>\n<p>The IDEAS project brought together two different areas of research--interest-driven youth development and interest-driven interventions for supporting autistic students' social, functional, and academic development. Both of these areas of research have a foundation in Ryan and Deci's (2019)1 self-determination theory, the idea that creating educational experiences that promote learner autonomy, competence, and relatedness can motivate people to learn and can enhance wellbeing. Our quantitative research demonstrated that the program increased science, technology, and engineering career interest and self-efficacy in participants, as well as their understanding of the engineering design process, and that autistic students' levels of social interaction were the same as those of neurotypical students. Our qualitative research demonstrated that autistic students were able to fully engage in and complete program activities and design final projects that expressed their interests. Teachers reported that autistic participants needed less support and prompting from them to engage in the activities than they typically did during normal classroom instruction. Teachers also reported that spending time with these students in an informal maker program enabled them to better understand what the students were capable of accomplishing.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Broader Impact</strong></p>\n<p>This project has had, and will continue to have, a broad impact on students, educators, and researchers. Most importantly, the program reached 140 students (57 autistic and 83 neurotypical) over three years, enabling them to build engineering and design skills as they socialized with their peers. In addition, the project gave ten teachers the opportunity to learn how to facilitate maker activities, a skill they can continue to use to run the IDEAS program and which can also enhance their classroom teaching. The team has disseminated information about this program through an NSF showcase video, two legislative visits, two podcasts, blog posts, an article in Spectrum News, 18 conference presentations, and three peer-reviewed publications, with one more under review. We also have produced a final curriculum that is available on the EDC, NYU, and New York Hall of Science websites. Finally, we received a scale-up grant from the ITEST program to adapt the IDEAS program so that it can be used in all 50+ autism-inclusion elementary, middle, and high schools in NYC and can be made available to any other district in need of autism-friendly informal programming.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><sup>1</sup>Ryan, R.
