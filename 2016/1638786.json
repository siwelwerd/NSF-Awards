 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biomarkers are objective measures of biological processes that help to describe an individual's physiological condition. In this project, the investigators will develop and validate six minimally-invasive dried blood spot biomarkers with relevance to studies of modern human populations, adaptation, and life history. Despite significant progress on the development and application of biomarkers for use in the social and behavioral sciences, there is a need to address critical issues and limitations, and to systematically develop and optimize biomarkers. The biomarkers developed in this project will support the investigation of important theoretical questions in biological anthropology and human biology about stress, aging, and immune function, and will set the standard for future dried blood spot assay development. A biobank of quality control samples will be created and shared with other laboratories that wish to develop their own biomarkers, so that results will be comparable across studies and laboratories. The project will also provide educational training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students. \r\n\r\nThis research will develop and validate six dried blood spot immunoassay biomarkers in order to expand the methodological toolkit in biological anthropology for application to four topics of major interest to the field: 1) autoimmune disease (myeloperoxidase [pANCA], an indicator of inflammatory bowel disease, and anti-thyroid peroxidase antibody [TPOAb], a marker of autoimmune thyroid disorders); 2) regulation of systemic inflammation (the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 [IL-10]); 3) bone turnover (carboxylated osteocalcin [cOC], a marker of bone formation, and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase 5b [TRACP5b], a marker of bone resorption); and, 4) stress-related aging (the protein marker Klotho). The project team will develop these assays using matched dried blood spot and venipuncture-obtained whole blood samples from 200 adults from the Eugene, Oregon area. The systematic process of evaluation, modification, and validation to be used in this study is the most rigorous strategy to develop DBS biomarkers and the resulting publications will serve as benchmarks for further biomarker validation efforts. The research will result in: 1) six technical publications with assay validations and protocols; 2) detailed written assay protocols (in multiple languages) and video instructions available in a publicly available repository; 3) biobank materials for cross-laboratory harmonization available upon request to other labs; 4) technical training of a graduate student; 5) undergraduate research opportunities for 12 undergraduates, including those from underrepresented populations; and 6) a session at a national conference on the state of the science with respect to dried blood spots.",
