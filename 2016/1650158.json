 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a conference that will inform the design of \"backbone\" organizations for the NSF INCLUDES (Inclusion across the Nation of Communities of Learners of Underrepresented Discoverers in Engineering and Science) program. NORC at the University of Chicago (an independent research institution that delivers reliable data and rigorous analyses to guide programmatic and policy decisions) and TERC (a nonprofit education research and development organization based in Cambridge, MA, dedicated to improving STEM learning for all) collaborate on Envisioning Impact, a two-part in-person and virtual event that will inform the design of INCLUDES Alliance and National Network backbone organizations. \r\n\r\nThe objectives of the conference are to: (1) facilitate a shared vision of impact for INCLUDES broadening participation projects and program; (2) stimulate discourse on key elements of a shared measurement system for continuous improvement and outcome assessment; and (3) inform decisions on the infrastructure and priority services INCLUDES backbone organizations will provide to assist grantees (and others) in assessing progress towards collective impact. The conference will bring members of three communities together: PIs and evaluators of INCLUDES Design and Development Launch Pilots; investigators and evaluators of other NSF-supported broadening participation alliances, extension projects, and other collective efforts to support inclusion and diversity in STEM; and members of prior and extant NSF-supported knowledge-networking, collaboratory, and resource network initiatives. Members of these communities will collaborate in two separate events: an in-person, 1.5 day conference, and a follow-on virtual Video Hall that will allow a larger number of participants to engage, over a one week period, in facilitated community discourse around short video narratives produced by each project.",

It offered a two-part, in person and virtual, convening for the first cadre of NSF INCLUDES Launch projects. The NSF INCLUDES (Inclusion across the Nation of Communities of Learners of Underrepresented Discoverers in Engineering and Science) program was created by NSF to increase participation, improve preparation, and ensure the contributions of underrepresented and underserved groups in STEM.</p>\n<p>Both conferences were intended to bring the first group of NSF INCLUDES projects together, in order for them to learn from each other, share their ideas, challenges and strategies, and mechanisms to measure their intended impact. This effort was a collaborative grant between NORC, an independent research institution at the University of Chicago, and TERC a nonprofit education research and development organization based in Cambridge, MA.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>At both of these events, participants were asked to envision the potential of their work and the short and longer-term impacts that they hoped to achieve. Projects shared the policies, programs, and resources that they intended to employ, as well as their thoughts on how they would measure progress towards attaining their goals. By considering impact from the outset, projects were able to explore and share expectations for how other communities would benefit from their work, how their efforts could be disseminated to others, adapted or scaled, and how they could measure the impact of their efforts on broadening participation and improving access to STEM to underserved communities.</p>\n<p>This effort had two distinct, yet thematically related events. The first was a face-to-face conference that took place in Chicago, January 17<sup>th</sup> and 18<sup>th</sup>, 2017, which was led by NORC. Members of fourteen NSF INCLUDES Launch projects attended the conference, as well as NSF program officers. Sessions on conceptualizing impact discussed the importance of considering knowledge generated, evidence utilized; training/professional development provided, innovations made, models replicated, and outcomes sustained. Interactive exercises mapped the NSF INCLUDES landscape, in regard to the different types of efforts underway and the diverse communities being served. Projects discussed common themes, with an eye to developing future potential collaborations with each other as their efforts matured. Business-Higher Education Forum (BHEF) led a session discussing alignment between higher education and industry efforts.</p>\n<p>The second convening was the NSF INCLUDES Video Showcase which took place May 20<sup>th </sup>- 27<sup>th</sup>, 2017, and can be viewed at: <a href=\"http://includes2017.videohall.com\">http://includes2017.videohall.com</a>. TERC led this effort, creating the interactive Video Showcase platform and facilitating the online interactions that took place. Thirty-six NSF INCLUDES projects created short video narratives of their project in preparation for this event. Each video had its own facilitated discussion to which many constituencies were invited to participate.</p>\n<p>The Video Showcase provided a mechanism to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Showcase the efforts of the first cadre of NSF INCLUDES projects, </li>\n<li>Enable projects to articulate how they would measure their own individual impact, while providing a broader view of the potential collective impact of the program. </li>\n<li>Enable each NSF project to learn from related NSF INCLUDES &nbsp;projects, sharing strategies, ideas, contacts and resources.</li>\n<li>Provide each NSF INCLUDES project with a way to broadly disseminate their work.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Each of the 36 videos had its own online discussion. Facilitators were assigned to seed reflective, collegial discourse focused on the issue of envisioning impact. Over the week-long event, 588 discussion posts were exchanged. All of these discussions and videos are still accessible online to the public at large.</p>\n<p>In a post-event survey, 97% of presenters wrote that participating in the video showcase was a worthwhile experience. Respondents reported that it provided them with new ideas and resources relevant to their work, offered valuable feedback on their project to date, made them become more aware of related work being conducted by others, and enabled them to make new contacts and connections that could possibly lead to future collaborations. Last, many commented that it provided an excellent opportunity to disseminate their project work to others interested in broadening participation of underrepresented groups in STEM.</p>\n<p><strong>Intellectual Merit: </strong>This work benefitted each of the participating projects by bringing the first cadre of NSF INCLUDES projects together to learn from and with each other. It allowed each project to consider how they will measure impact from the outset and provided a forum for the NSF INCLUDES program to capture, through the video showcase videos and discussions, the potential collective impact of the program.</p>\n<p><strong>Broader Impact: </strong>The video showcase allowed NSF INCLUDES projects to disseminate their early efforts to researchers, practitioners, policy makers, industry leaders and higher education administrators interested in broadening access and participation to underserved communities to high quality STEM experiences.
