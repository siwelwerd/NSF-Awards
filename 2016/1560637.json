 "awd_abstract_narration": "General Summary:\r\n\r\nWhy are immigrants better able to integrate - economically, socially, and politically - in some locations than others? Why do natives oppose or support immigrants more in some locations than others? Upon arriving in new countries, immigrants' experiences vary greatly across both space and time. In some cases, immigrants are able to thrive in their new location, succeeding economically while peacefully coexisting with nationals. Yet in other cases, immigrants are lodged in perpetual poverty and have strained relations with nationals.  One important determinant of successful integration is the context in which immigrants settle. The PI contends that locations governed by anti-immigrant parties will hinder immigrants' successful immigration. The PI argues further that highly homogenous immigrant communities foster anti-immigrant attitudes. The PI tests these arguments by leveraging the random assignment of refugees to localities in Denmark together with a survey experiment on the effects of diversity. Overall, this study intends to bring important light to how society can best overcome the challenges presented by immigration in the coming years.   \r\n\r\n\r\nTechnical Summary:\r\n\r\nThis project will ascertain the role of local political contexts in both immigrant integration and the development of anti-immigrant attitudes among natives. The PI argues that locations governed by anti-immigrant parties will hinder immigrants' successful immigration. The PI argues further that highly homogenous immigrant communities foster anti-immigrant attitudes. These arguments will be tested by leveraging a quasi-experiment in refugee location that occurred in Denmark.  The quasi-experiment comes in the form of the Spatial Dispersion Policy of 1986-1998, in which refugees were assigned to municipalities around Denmark. Combined with micro data from government registers, this will allow the PI to test the expectations described above. Second, this project will investigate the role of local-level diversity among immigrants as a determinant of native opposition to immigration. This argument will be tested with a survey experiments in Denmark. Respondents will be randomly selected to view a vignette about either a high or low diversity immigrant community and then asked their opinion about immigrants and immigration. Reported opinions between the high and low diversity groups will be compared to evaluate the theoretical expectation. Overall, this study intends to bring important light to how society can best overcome the challenges presented by immigration in the coming years.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe goal of this project was to provide causal evidence on the impacts of local political contexts on immigrant integration. Migration has increased substantially in recent years, putting integration to the forefront of the agenda for scholars and policymakers alike.  Despite this, little is known about how the characteristics of where immigrants live impact the success or failure of the integration process.  This project examines two specific features of the contexts where immigrants live: the ideology of the local governing parties and the level of diversity within immigrant populations. \n\nRegarding the impact of local governing parties, the main theoretical argument put forward in this project is that integration will be more successful in places governed by politicians and parties with leftist ideologies. There are two main reasons for this prediction.  First, leftist politicians and parties' emphasis on intervention in the economy will disproportionately benefit immigrants, who tend to have few resources when arriving in their destination country. Second, because leftist politicians and parties more often include immigrants in their electoral coalition, they will have incentives to ensure that integration is successful.\n\nTo study the effects of local politics, this project leverages a natural experiment in Denmark created by their Spatial Dispersion Policy (SDP) for refugees.  In effect from 1986 to 1998, the SDP settled refugees across Denmark in a quasi-random fashion; settlement was independent of local politics or municipalities' economic conditions.  This natural experiment, therefore, eliminates selection bias which occurs when unobservable characteristics of immigrants impact both their choice of residence and their ability to succesfully integrate.\n\nThis project studies the SDP using data from Denmark's statistical registers, allowing for time-series observations on refugees settled according to the SDP.  The main finding is that integration, measured as the number of years that refugees live in Denmark, is higher for refugees settled in municipalities governed by leftist parties.  Additional tests, however, show that this effect only occurs among leftist parties that are electorally secure: when settled in municipalities governed by left parties at risk of losing their electoral majority, refugees are more likely to leave Denmark than if settled in municipalities governed by centrist or right-wing parties. \n\nThe argument put forward by the project regarding diversity within immigrant communities makes the prediction that increased levels of diversity among immigrant populations can reduce anti-immigrant attitudes, and thereby, promote more successful integration.  Diversity has this effect because it prohibits the formation of stereotypes, which are known to play an important role in the formation of anti-immigrant attitudes. It prohibits the formation of stereotypes by preventing natives from viewing immigrants as a single, homogenous, outgroup and also by making it harder to detect correlations among members of the immigrant community. \n\nThis project uses a conjoint survey experiment to test diversity's effect on attitudes toward immigrants.  The project adopts this approach to isolate the effect of diversity from other potential characteristics of immigrant populations, such as their national origin(s), education levels, reasons for migrating, and religion, which may confound observed relationships between diversity and attitudes toward immigrants.  The conjoint study asked respondents to compare two groups of 60 immigrants where the share of each group from any particularly origin country was randomized, as was each group's level of diversity, share of young men, and education level.  The conjoint experiment was fieled to a sample of 2,000 Germans in December 2016.  The main finding from the conjoint study is that respondents preferred immigrant groups with the highest level of diversity over groups with medium and low levels of diversity, but that they had no preference for groups with medium levels of diversity over groups with low levels of diversity.  \n\nTogether, the two halves of this project show that the characteristics of where immigrants live play an important role in the success or failure of the integration process.
