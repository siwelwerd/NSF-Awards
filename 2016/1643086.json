 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funding for US participation in the conference entitled, \"Conference on Mathematical Results in Quantum Physics,\" to be held in Atlanta, Georgia, with events at Georgia Tech and Emory University on October 8-11, 2016. The interaction between mathematics and quantum physics dates from the very beginning of quantum theory, and to this day it continues to provide fundamental ideas for both mathematics and physics. Among many significant implications for physics, mathematical analysis helps to understand physical and electrical properties of large-scale matter, nanoscale devices, and atoms and molecules.  The growing field of quantum information provides new mathematical challenges together with potential applications to area outside mathematics and physics.  The latest developments in each of these topics will be recounted at the meeting, and made available afterwards through a proceedings volume and archiving of selected talks and events.\r\n\r\nThis conference focuses on recent developments in Analysis, especially in the subfield of mathematical physics. Cutting edge research will be presented on topics such as quantum mechanics with random features, quantum mechanics on graphs, many-body systems, statistical mechanics, and quantum information science. In addition, a number of speakers have been asked to discuss new mathematical challenges currently arising in theoretical physics.  This award gives early-career researchers, researchers who are members of underrepresented groups, and researchers who are not funded by NSF an opportunity to attend and participate in this conference. The organizing committee will strive to make this funding opportunity known to target groups. More information can be found at: http://qmath13.gatech.edu.",
