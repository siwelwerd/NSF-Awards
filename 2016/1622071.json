 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is to conserve food supply and reduce waste from farm to consumer. According to a Natural Resources Defense Council report, 40% of US food goes uneaten, roughly $165 billion in wasted food/year, much of it due to produce spoilage. Reducing food losses by just 15 percent could feed over 25 million Americans per year when 1/6th lack a secure food supply and many, especially children, lack affordable sources of healthy foods like fresh fruits and vegetables. Through diminished spoilage losses and extended shelf life, the proposed ozonation evice could improve quality, nutritional value, and accessibility of healthy foods and thereby help reduce obesity. Minimizing losses while maintaining safety and quality may promote agricultural production through elimination of spoilage organisms and premature ripening, yielding higher profits. Potential markets include produce supply chain harvest, transport, storage, and distribution businesses that use shipping and storage containers.  \r\n\r\nThe technical objectives in this Phase I research project are fabrication and development of a prototype APM (Active Packaging Module) to reduce fresh fruit and vegetable spoilage losses during storage and transit using patented and patent pending ozonation technologies. Activities will include: 1) Design and construction of small (~ 1 inch cube) modular self-contained battery powered units designed to go inside shipping containers containing perishable produce; 2) Determination of electrical and operational (exposure time, temperature, humidity, placement in container) parameters required to initiate and maintain different levels of spoilage control within industry standard containers of different sizes; 3) Correlation of these parameters with effective log reductions in viable counts of known inoculated or natural spoilage and pathogenic microorganism when utilizing the APM as compared to baseline; 4) Repetition of activities iteratively (design considerations, lifetime and efficacy testing) to optimize the desired outcomes.",

The APM uses existing patented and patent pending SurfPlasma technology that employ miniature plasma reactor adapted to prevent fruit and vegetable losses due to growth of spoilage organisms (Figure 3).&nbsp; The APM can also inhibit and kill a variety of germs that can be present on fresh produce. SurfPlasma has developed and tested battery powered APMs designed for use in GreenBox containers at ambient temperature. The energy budget for 2 cubic feet GreenBox is less than 1 watt-hour.&nbsp; Depending upon produce weight and container volume, one or more APMs could be placed in the tote at the point of origin and recycled or disposed of by the end user at retail &ndash; a new paradigm. A second version of the APM called GreenFreeze operates with household wall outlet and is suitable for use in refrigeration applications.&nbsp; The APM is designed to be modular and can be configured for a large range size and temperature of storage area. Besides size and minimal power requirements, SurfPlasma&rsquo;s APM value proposition includes: no long-term toxic material used or produced, minimal carbon footprint, low maintenance, eco-friendliness, and low cost. This shows the great versatility of the technology.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>The potential market for this low cost technology includes companies that harvest, transport, store, and distribute fruits and vegetables around the world using reusable shipping and storage containers at ambient or refrigeration temperatures. It should be applicable to a large range of other perishable commodities such as grains, spices, confectionery and many other commodities shipped in closed cartons/containers. Proper transport and handling of food is critical throughout the entire supply chain. Perishable products that require refrigeration have additional cost and traceability requirements. Handling issues can occur when produce experiences improper temperatures, such as during transportation delays due to weather, traffic, equipment or vehicle malfunction, or due to congestion at harbors, terminals, or when on loading docks or in warehouses. Products can wait days at the ports for testing, significantly reducing their shelf life. Targets for our core plasma technology include fruit and vegetable containers, and other perishables up and down the produce distribution chain.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In summary, SurfPlasma has demonstrated that our Active Packaging Module (APM) is effective at extending at least two fold the storage life of a variety of fresh fruits and vegetables at either room temperature or refrigeration temperature. The APM controls spoilage organisms and germs on produce.&nbsp; The primary market driver is expected to be reduced expenses relative to current practices to maintain produce freshness. The units will require little maintenance, be cheap, even disposable, and generate more profit for the produce market by reducing product loss due to spoilage, enhancing gross margins and net revenue bottom lines. &nbsp;This Phase I work has provided a strong basis for continued development activities and SurPlasma, Inc would like to thank the National Science Foundation for this opportunity.&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 06/16/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: David&nbsp;Maneval</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1622071/1622071_10435779_1497630424020_SPOPicture1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1622071/1622071_10435779_1497630424020_SPOPicture1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Tomatoes Without (left) and With (right) APM show stark difference\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1622071/1622071_10435779_1497630424020_SPOPicture1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Tomatoes Without (left) and With (right) APM show stark difference\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Grape tomatoes held at room temperature without (left) and with (right) APM show stark difference</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">SurfPlasma, Inc.</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">David&nbsp;Maneval</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Tomatoes Without (left) and With (right) APM show stark difference</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1622071/1622071_10435779_1497630580016_SPOPicture2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1622071/1622071_10435779_1497630580016_SPOPicture2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Produce held at room temperature without (left) and with (right) GreenBox APM\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1622071/1622071_10435779_1497630580016_SPOPicture2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Produce held at room temperature without (left) and with (right) GreenBox APM\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The cucumbers were photographed after 10 days and the green beans after 18 days</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">SurfPlasmam Inc.</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">David&nbsp;Maneval</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Produce held at room temperature without (left) and with (right) GreenBox APM</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1622071/1622071_10435779_1497630826058_SPPicture4--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1622071/1622071_10435779_1497630826058_SPPicture4--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\": Green bean and tomato spoilage organisms do not grow when plates are protected by the APM\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1622071/1622071_10435779_1497630826058_SPPicture4--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\": Green bean and tomato spoilage organisms do not grow when plates are protected by the APM\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Picture of equal amounts of  mixed spoilage organisms spread on agar plates and incubated at room temperature for nine days.
