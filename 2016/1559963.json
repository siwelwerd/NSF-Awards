 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site program at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI), entitled, \"Bioengineering and Biomanufacturing\", will engage a diverse cohort of students in research projects with an intellectual focus on engineering biological systems and biomanufacturing. A combination of computational and experimental research will be conducted on projects related to biomedical, chemical or biological engineering. The development of engineered biological systems for medical, biotechnological or chemical applications remains an important research challenge for a broad range of applications.  The proposed REU site will focus on both the research and development that goes into developing new bio-based technologies and their manufacture.  The proposed integrated training experience will guide undergraduate students, recruited from underrepresented groups from non-research-intensive schools, through a research project; while also helping them understand how they could pursue an engineering career. Cohort building and inter-cohort interactions between REU students and graduate/high-school students will be integrated into the program for community building and to provide students with opportunities for mentoring and to serve as mentors to future engineers and scientists. The programs' research results will be disseminated broadly by the PIs, participating faculty, and students via scientific publications, conference presentations, and internet-accessble materials. \r\n\r\nEach undergraduate student will conduct research over a ten week summer experience on a project that is designed for his/her abilities, under the mentorship of both a faculty member and graduate student. The twenty participating REU faculty have highly active, externally funded research programs and include undergraduates in their research teams and as co-authors on publications. Weekly workshops that address communication, ethics, mentoring, and the nature of research will help the students gain professional skills and personal confidence that are critical for their success.",

The results of these efforts were that the REU program received 131 applications for summer 2017, 144 applications for summer 2018, and 137 applications for summer 2019. The REU program was very successful in attracting a large number of applications in each of the three years and overall the application profiles were stable throughout the period of the grant. The number of female applications fluctuated between 78 and 75, which corresponds to 54-55% of the applicants being female, and the number of URM applications was between 24 and 27 which is approximately 20% of the received applications for each year. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">These numbers clearly show that the recruiting efforts were able to attract a large, and diverse number of applications.</span></p>\n<p><strong>REU Student Data</strong></p>\n<p>The quality of the applications received was also excellent. This enabled the PI to accept a diverse group of excellent students for each year of the program. Additionally, the students&rsquo; acceptance rate of the offer to participate in the REU was very high (&gt;80%). A total of 30 students participated in the program during the three year time frame. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">At least 60% of the REU students for each of the three years were women</span> and the program hosted between three and seven REU students each year who belonged to an underrepresented group. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">The average GPA of the students participating in the program was very high</span>, between 3.8 and 3.9, for each year in the program.

In addition to this, the students were asked to participate in the activities of the groups that they were assigned to.</p>\n<p>As a general rule, each REU student was assigned to one faculty mentor and one graduate student mentor.

The students were given the same survey at the end of the REU. 8 of the 9 students stated that they wanted to go to graduate school and obtain a PhD and one student expressed an interest in getting a job after obtaining a BS degree.

The students were given the same survey at the end of the REU.

All students stated that the REU helped them with forming an opinion on what they wanted to do in their careers.</p>\n<p>For the 2019 REU, half the students had either no prior exposure to research or only in an unstructured setting.
