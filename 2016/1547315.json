 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. David Chicoine and doctoral candidate Ms. Kimberly Munro, both of Louisiana State University, examine the long-term use of ceremonial landscapes and construction of religious buildings in the ancient Andes. Their research focuses on the persistence of sacred monuments as places of public gatherings, collective memory, social interactions, and political negotiation. Archaeology is particularly well positioned to provide longitudinal perspectives on religious and political movements and their role in shaping the trajectory of ancient civilizations, especially their material manifestations. Such traditions in many regions of the world continue up to the present day and play an important role in shaping peoples' behaviors. Thus studies such as this one have relevance in a modern day context. In the Central Andes, the unique mountainous terrain has shaped the development of subsistence strategies, trade and religious networks. Previous archaeological research has focused either on the Pacific coast or the high elevation plains, lagoons, and mountain peaks, leaving mid-elevation regions under studied. Yet, these regions provide unique geographic conditions, ecologies, and landscapes with significant potential to become valued and powerful agents of symbolic constructs and religious worship.\r\n \r\nThe researchers employ mapping and excavation methods to study successive episodes of monumental ceremonial constructions at the Cosma Archaeological Complex, a basin located 2600 meters above sea level in the upper reaches of the Nepe\u00f1a Valley, north-central Peru. Data from architectural designs, visual arts, ritual objects, mortuary contexts, landscape features and occupation sequences are used to shed light on the development of local identities, their materialities, and relation to overarching political networks from the late Preceramic Period (3000-1800 BCE) to the Early Horizon (900-100 BCE). Ultimately, the project examines the rise to regional prominence of a ritual, and likely pilgrimage center with a long and persistent history of religious influence. Previous archaeological work has often focused on the collapse and regeneration of polities and associated ideologies. Instead, this project seeks to understand the stability of a place over time and the changing influences of trends that go in and out of favor. Data obtained may shed light on the plurality of identity in zones of dynamic cultural interactions. This project will produce comparative data of interest to broad sections of anthropology and archaeology. It will provide training to doctoral candidate Ms. Kimberly Munro, as well as generate primary data for her PhD dissertation. All primary data will be stored permanently and made publicly accessible. Results will be disseminated through various venues including official field reports, peer-review manuscripts and conference papers. Finally, the researchers will help train US and Peruvian students in archaeological field techniques. Such collaborations strengthen academic bonds between US and Peruvian institutions and have broader impacts for the development international relationships.",

Fieldwork yielded architectural, geographic, and artifactual data to examine the role of religion in the development of Andean social complexity. The site of Cosma is located on the western slope of the Cordillera Negra Mountains of Ancash, at the headwaters of one of the Jimbe tributaries which feeds into the Nepe&ntilde;a River (Fig 1). Archaeological vestiges at the site range in elevation from 2600-3600masl. Excavations carried out between 2014 and 2016 focused on the two large mounds that appear to be the nexus of ritual activity in the Cosma basin (Fig 2).</p>\n<p>Cosma was first founded and used extensively as a ritual center during the Late Preceramic (3000-1800 BCE) period (Fig 3). There was a significant period of re-use during the Early Horizon (900-200 BCE) when infant burials and large feasting vessels were interred in the larger of the two mounds within the basin (Fig 4). Materials diagnostic of the Early Horizon were excavated in association with those events (Fig 5). Finally, a third re-occupation of the site took place during the Middle through Late Horizons, (600-1470 CE), when the ridge-tops surrounding the basin were occupied for domestic purposes.</p>\n<p>Our work was the first to establish a relative ceramic chronology for the upper Nepe&ntilde;a River region. Excavations revealed that during the Preceramic, a number of ritual chambers, associated with the Kotosh-Mito tradition of the central highlands were constructed and utilized at the site. The two main mounds were originally erected during this time period. As the original Kotosh-Mito structures were no longer used, they were ritually sealed off before new structures were built over the original in a process known as &ldquo;Ritual Entombment.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>By the following Early Horizon Period there is a significant period of re-use within the basin. A hilltop fortress is built on the western ridge-top overlooking the Cosma drainage. This corresponds to a considerable amount of re-use on the larger Kareycoto mound. Our excavations have revealed a peak in ritual activity by the terminal Early Horizon, associated with evidence for feasting, and the placing of infants and fetuses along with the burning and smashing of offerings.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>By the Middle Horizon and succeeding Late Intermediate Period, the smaller mound on the basin is extensively reoccupied by Casma-Chimu groups. The top stratum on the mound is associated with large episodes of burning. Several intrusive chamber tombs had been looted in antiquity, but our team was able to recover the remains and associated artifacts with a high status member of the Chimu culture, a coastal empire eventually conquered by the Incas. The presence of a high-status Chimu burial, so far up into the mountains speaks to the importance of the Cosma basin.</p>\n<p>Archaeological excavations in the Cosma basin establishes an empirical basis for the cultural history of the upper Nepe&ntilde;a River valley. No excavations or in depth surveys had yet to be conducted above the Jimbe area zone prior to this work. Yet, it is a critical zone for studying inter-regional interactions. Data shed light on the role that intermediary, or &ldquo;in between&rdquo; zones play into the socio-political dynamic of larger polities. In the Andes, both ends of the inter-regional interaction spectrum (the highlands and the coast) have been more thoroughly examined, work in Cosma is providing us with a better understanding of the role intermediate zones play within interaction networks.</p>\n<p>Research in Cosma is imperative in understanding religious complexity and its role in the early socio-political expansions in the central highlands. To date, only a handful of Preceramic sites in the highlands have been excavated. In addition, our understand of the transition, both temporally and geographically, of the different traditions of ceremonial architecture and visual arts from the Preceramic period into the Initial Period and subsequence Early Horizon is still limited. Excavations at Cosma have shed light on inter-regional interaction networks, but also on early highland Preceramic religious developments, specifically those of Kotosh/Mito tradition, and the transition of private ritualized structures to the more public and spectacular Chav&iacute;n cult. This work contributes to our understanding of human mobility and the movement of material goods and ideas, in particular the ways through which communal identity is developed, maintained, and negotiated through religious influence. Cosma&rsquo;s initial founding, and consistent occupational sequence will help to develop our understanding of why and how certain places become persistent throughout millennia, while others fall out of use or influence. The project also reached out to the modern community of Cosma through various talks, site tours, workshops and pamphlet distribution (Fig 6).</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 11/14/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: David&nbsp;Chicoine</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1547315/1547315_10402946_1510681917471_Fig1CosmaLocation--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1547315/1547315_10402946_1510681917471_Fig1CosmaLocation--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1547315/1547315_10402946_1510681917471_Fig1CosmaLocation--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Map of Peru showing the location of Cosma</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">K.
