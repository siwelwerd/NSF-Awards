 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Texas, El Paso proposes to extend the work of the Computing Alliance of Hispanic-Serving Institutions (CAHSI) in collaboration with their partners: California State University-Dominguez Hills, California State University-San Marcos, Dade College, Florida International University, New Mexico State University, Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi, University of Houston Downtown, University of Puerto Rico Mayaguez, and the University of Texas Pan American. Together these Hispanic-Serving institutions will work to adapt proven strategies that have positive impact on (1) the number of Hispanic students who enter the workforce with computing degrees; (2) the retention and advancement of Hispanic students and faculty in computing, and (3) the development of sustainable, competitive education and research programs. \r\n\r\nTo accomplish this, CAHSI has already implemented a number of programs, including Peer-Led Team Learning (PLTL) that creates an active learning experience for students and leadership experiences for undergraduates serving as peer leaders, the Affinity Research Group (ARG) model that emphasizes the deliberate and intentional development of technical, team and professional skills and knowledge required for research, and Mentor-Grad that engages undergraduates in experiences and activities that prepare them for graduate studies and the professoriate. CAHSI has a strong record of success: recent bachelor's graduation rates of Hispanics in computer science increased by nearly 25% within their member institution, while over the same time period, the national trend showed a 39% decline. This extension will further existing goals and intentionally develop a sustainable ecosystem to (1) institute a sustainable infrastructure that supports CAHSI's continued impact and (2) become recognized as an organization that affects decision-making and cultural change at the local, regional, and national levels. To achieve these goals CAHSI will establish the cyber infrastructure to support collaborations and dissemination of CAHSI practices, establish collaborations beyond the Alliance with organizations and institutions sharing common goals, and promote multicultural awareness in administrators, faculty, and students.",

CAHSI institutions have graduated Hispanic students at a rate higher than the national rate of Hispanic computing baccalaureates; served as a significant pipeline to entry into a competitive workforce; and increased students in graduate studies and the professorate across the nation.

The project focused on strengthening: <strong>structures and networks</strong> contributing to the national knowledge base and supporting student growth, implementation, and dissemination of evidence-based initiatives; <strong>student connections</strong> developing future leaders; <strong>community connections</strong> strengthening involvement of individuals and organizations; and <strong>strategic partnerships</strong> expanding partnerships to secure funding and exchange resources.</p>\n<p><strong>Structures and</strong> <strong>Networks</strong>. CAHSI studies, publishes, and disseminates its signature practices and deepens knowledge of factors for recruiting and retaining Hispanics in computing. CAHSI has contributed new knowledge on the impact of culture and environmental factors that advance Hispanics. Through its research on departmental climate and culture, CAHSI promotes environments that facilitate the success of students. The CAHSI website documents evidence- and research-based practices and theory, serving as a resource to inform the nation on what works best for whom and under what conditions. &nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Student Networks</strong>. CAHSI Student Advocates and Scholars programs, and its signature practices support student growth. The Advocates program engages students at their institution to support students through promotive interactions and dissemination of CAHSI opportunities via social media and email. Advocates arrange professional development workshops, collaborate with student organizations, define engagement strategies, and promote corporate recruitment. In addition, the network of Advocates fosters community building where Advocates learn from each other and share effective practices. Advocates serve as role models for defining innovative ways for fostering community building and collaboration. The CAHSI Student Scholars program was created to recognize students who demonstrate excellence in four core areas: professional development, scholarly achievements,&nbsp;community outreach,&nbsp;and co-curricular engagement. The program provides scholarships to students who&nbsp;exude a&nbsp;commitment to CAHSI's mission and&nbsp;are&nbsp;poised&nbsp;to become the&nbsp;next generation leaders. CAHSI signature practices (e.g., Affinity Research Groups-ARG, Peer-Led Team Learning, Fellow-Net, CAHSI-Google problem-solving) are documented for broader adoption. The CAHSI Collaborative Learning Community provides on-line materials and a platform for participants to share their experiences and practices. Despite the addition of many new CAHSI members, the adoption of CAHSI signature practices is relatively high throughout the network. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>CAHSI established the Doctoral Scholars Network, a community of doctoral students who connect across CAHSI institutions to develop research capacity and empower students as leaders. The Network cultivates support by affirming students' assets and develops community and belonging in computing through professional development aimed at providing students with the social and professional capital required to succeed in the doctorate and beyond.</p>\n<p><strong>Community Connections</strong>. The project enhanced community connections through its regional meetings where best practices and innovations are shared. Connections are enhanced through efforts that advance students' research skills, such as the virtual Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program (pairing students with a CAHSI faculty mentor in an on-line REU), the Local REU program (pairing students with a faculty mentor from their home institution), and the CAHSI Research Celebration (recognizing students and faculty involved in research at the Great Minds in STEM conference). The REU efforts included weekly meetings with mentors to adopt ARG modules focused on deliberate development of students' skills. &nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Partnerships</strong>. Engagement of leaders from diverse sectors in purposeful dialog resulted in improvement of curriculum and student advancement. Partnerships were strengthened through CAHSI's Annual Summit held at the GMiS conference. The industry partners that support CAHSI sessions included: Boeing, Capital One, Cummins, Dell, Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Lab, Visa, Leidos, Lockheed Martin, NCWiT/TECHNOLOchicas, Google, Reboot Representation, and Microsoft. Students develop skills vital to their future careers (cybersecurity, AI, data science, financial literacy, leadership, research poster presentation). The CAHSI-Google Institutional Research Program (IRP) is building research capacity of faculty and Hispanic students at CAHSI institutions by pairing investigators from doctoral-granting with those at non-doctoral granting institutions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Outcomes</strong>. A key outcome has been the transformation in values and practices among members. Through their CAHSI participation, many members have reinforced or even transformed their values and approaches towards a mindset centered on students and learning. Most importantly, veteran CAHSI participants describe shifts in values and how CAHSI values have become ingrained in their practices over time. CAHSI secured key partnerships and diversified its funding sources to advance its efforts toward sustainability. CAHSI's approach is documented in an NSF INCLUDES brief with QEM.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 12/14/2023<br>\nModified by: Ann&nbsp;Q&nbsp;Gates</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1551221/1551221_10457026_1702575523766_Introduction_CAHSI_Resarch_Celebration--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1551221/1551221_10457026_1702575523766_Introduction_CAHSI_Resarch_Celebration--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Intro CAHSI Research Celebration\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1551221/1551221_10457026_1702575523766_Introduction_CAHSI_Resarch_Celebration--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Intro CAHSI Research Celebration\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The CAHSI Research Celebration recognizes students and faculty involved in research.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">CAHSI</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Ann&nbsp;Q&nbsp;Gates\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Intro CAHSI Research Celebration</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1551221/1551221_10457026_1702575903652_Dissertation_Award--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1551221/1551221_10457026_1702575903652_Dissertation_Award--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"CAHSI-Google Dissertation Awardee\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1551221/1551221_10457026_1702575903652_Dissertation_Award--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"CAHSI-Google Dissertation Awardee\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Yair Cabrera-Melendez, UTEP Ph.D. student, recipient of one of five 2023 CAHSI-Google Dissertation awards for completing the last year of their dissertation with a commitment to enter academia.
