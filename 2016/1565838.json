 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports travel for US participants in the International Conference on Evolution Equations held at Vanderbilt University from May 16 to May 20, 2016.  Evolution equations are the large class of partial differential equations used to describe the time development of a wide variety of systems, from physical systems such as fluid flow and gravitation to models for transportation and other economic systems.  The conference focuses on recent developments in the analysis of partial differential equations and features presentations by leaders in the field.  The award provides opportunities for early career researchers, researchers who are members of underrepresented groups, and researchers without other sources of travel support to attend and participate. \r\n\r\nThis conference focuses on recent developments in partial differential equations connected to evolution problems.  Topics include, but are not limited to, fluid dynamics, free boundary problems, dispersive equations, parabolic equations, Einstein?s equations, and non-linear wave equations.  The activities include fifty-minute talks by the keynote speakers, parallel focus sessions with twenty-five-minute presentations, and 10-minute contributed talks.  More information is available at the conference web site: \r\nhttps://my.vanderbilt.edu/shanks2016/",
