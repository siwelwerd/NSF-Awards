 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Delaware and its partners are building on their previous, NSF-funded Partner4CS project to create research-based, sustainable models for teacher preparation and promote the implementation of the AP CS Principles curriculum throughout Delaware. Partner4CS has provided professional development (PD) for high school and middle school CS teachers, created a Field Experiences in Teaching Computer Science university course for CS undergraduate, and established strong partnerships with school districts, teachers, policy makers, CSTA, and state-level STEM leaders supporting teachers in their classrooms. \r\n\r\nThis project seeks to build on that work to increase its reach and sustainability through a coherent set of activities that partner higher education institutions, faculty in CS, educational researchers, and policy makers. The implementation plan focuses on 4 objectives. The first establishes university certificate programs that prepares pre-service and in-service teachers from a variety of STEM fields to teach CS with evidenced-based pedagogy. The second expands the Field Experience in Teaching Computer Science course for undergraduates to other institutions of higher education. The third develops a new track of summer PD that prepares teachers to support creative project-based CS learning, and the fourth organizes a day-long summit for educators in K-12 and higher education, district leaders, and industry professionals, to discuss the teaching of CS in K-12 schools and strategies for increasing diverse participation in the new CS Pathway. \r\n\r\nOver the 3-year period, the proposed work is expected to reach 100 additional teachers, 120 undergraduates across multiple universities, and approximately 2,500 students.",
