 "awd_abstract_narration": "On August 21, 2017, a total solar eclipse will traverse the United States from Oregon to South Carolina. Millions of Americans will witness totality, in which the Moon completely blocks the Sun, and over 500 million people across North America will experience a partial eclipse. In this project, the American Astronomical Society (AAS) will forge an umbrella organization consisting of an eclipse project manager, a centralized website of resources, and a mini-grants program to coordinate and facilitate local and national activities that will educate the public about the science of this rare event. The project will leverage this fascinating display of beauty to engage as many people as possible in the endeavor of science.\r\n\r\nThis project will involve scientists, educators, and amateur and professional eclipse observers in developing extensive plans for unique outreach activities to reach a significant fraction of the diverse U.S. population. The goal is to use the eclipse, which will generate significant media attention, to educate a broad audience about the associated science and to encourage young people from widely diverse backgrounds to pursue careers in science. Special emphasis will be placed on citizen science projects and on educational activities targeting groups that are underrepresented in STEM disciplines. A mini-grants program will be established to fund efforts specifically targeting underrepresented groups in order to increase their participation. The evaluation plan will focus on the utilization of the materials on the website and the learning gains of participants in specific activities funded by the mini-grants. All lessons learned will be collated in a publicly available formal report and will lay the groundwork for a strategic plan to fully capitalize on the next U.S.-based solar eclipse in 2024. Because this project aligns well with the objectives of multiple NSF directorates, this award is co-funded by the Division of Undergraduate Education and the Division of Research on Learning in the Directorate for Education and Human Resources; the Division of Astronomical Sciences in the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences; and the Division of Atmospheric and Geospace Sciences in the Directorate for Geosciences.",

  "por_cntn": "<div class=\"porColContainerWBG\">\n<div class=\"porContentCol\"><p>On 21 August 2017 a total eclipse of the Sun crossed the United States of America from coast to coast but touched no other country. Millions of people in a 60-mile-wide, 2,400-mile-long path of the Moon's shadow got a rare chance to see the solar corona and experience \"darkness at midday.\" The eclipse presented a great opportunity to excite people about science and connect them to the cosmos. Yet it also presented a great challenge: more than 300 million residents and visitors needed to learn where to see totality and how to view the eclipse safely.</p>\n<p>To address this opportunity and challenge, in 2012 the American Astronomical Society established the AAS Solar Eclipse Task Force to function as a think tank, coordinating body, and communication gateway to the vast resources available about the 2017 eclipse and solar eclipses more generally. The funding we subsequently received from the National Science Foundation was used mainly for three purposes: (1) to build a website (<a title=\"Solar Eclipse Across America Website\" href=\"https://eclipse.aas.org\" target=\"_blank\">https://eclipse.aas.org</a>) containing basic information about solar eclipses, safe viewing practices, and eclipse imaging and video, along with resources for educators and the media and links to other authoritative websites with more detailed information; (2) to organize workshops across the country to prepare communities for the eclipse and to facilitate collaborations between astronomers, government officials, school administrators, and public-safety professionals; and (3) to solicit, receive, evaluate, and fund proposals for mini-grants to support eclipse-related education and public outreach to underrepresented groups both inside and outside the path of totality, including women/girls, ethnic minorities, and people with physical and/or mental disabilities.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Our \"Solar Eclipse Across America\" website proved exceedingly popular, attracting increasing numbers of visitors over time, and peaking with millions of pageviews in the days before the eclipse. One goal of the site was to encourage people to get into the path of totality. The difference between a total eclipse and a partial eclipse, we emphasized, is literally the difference between night and day. About 10 million Americans were already in the path of totality, and a study from the University of Michigan suggests that about 10 million more people traveled into the path, making this the most-viewed total solar eclipse in history.</p>\n<p>The AAS and NASA jointly developed safety messaging that won the endorsement of several major professional associations of optometrists and ophthalmologists. Our basic message was simple: Except during totality, look at the Sun only through viewers that are certified to meet the ISO 12312-2 international safety standard, which was adopted in 2015. We put more detailed instructions on a 1-page flyer that was available for free download from our website and NASA's, in both English and Spanish.</p>\n<p>After the eclipse, three leading associations of eye doctors canvassed their collective 6,900 members for reports of eclipse-related eye injuries and received only 48, none of them serious or permanent, suggesting that our safety messaging was heard and followed. NASA recognized our efforts to promote eclipse eye safety with an Exceptional Public Achievement Medal.</p>\n<p>In each of five years leading up to the eclipse, we held annual planning workshops in cities from coast to coast. Each attracted more than 100 professional and amateur astronomers; formal and informal educators; representatives of tourism bureaus, Chambers of Commerce, and the hospitality industry; and officials from departments of transportation, state and national parks and forests, law-enforcement agencies, and emergency-management organizations. These workshops were instrumental in helping communities in the path of totality manage an influx of visitors. This planning paid off; aside from some massive traffic jams as people left their eclipse-viewing sites, almost no other problems were reported.</p>\n<p>After issuing a call for mini-grant proposals, we received 100 responses asking for a total of $368,000&nbsp;&mdash; similar to the oversubscription rate for professional telescopes given our $100,000 budget. A total of 31 projects, distributed among 21 states both within and outside the path of the Moon's shadow, were selected to receive mini-grants averaging about $3,000 each. Our professional evaluation of the funded public-outreach events found that people attended with no particular interest in learning anything &mdash; they just wanted to have fun and see the eclipse &mdash; but many left wanting to learn more about eclipses.</p>\n<p>The AAS Solar Eclipse Task Force is now working to prepare North Americans for the annular and total solar eclipses that will occur just six months apart in October 2023 and April 2024, respectively. We've begun updating <a title=\"Solar Eclipse Across America Website\" href=\"https://eclipse.aas.org\" target=\"_blank\">eclipse.aas.org</a> and have held two planning workshops, one in 2019 and another, virtually in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, in 2021. We expect to attract many more people into the eclipse paths thanks to the huge numbers of people who experienced the 2017 eclipse and will want to see another, as well as the fact that there were so few eye injuries or other problems.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 09/30/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Richard&nbsp;T&nbsp;Fienberg</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1564535/1564535_10441050_1632937570728_TSE2017Aug21-Sequence-RTF-TQI-2048x1152--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1564535/1564535_10441050_1632937570728_TSE2017Aug21-Sequence-RTF-TQI-2048x1152--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Total Solar Eclipse Sequence\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1564535/1564535_10441050_1632937570728_TSE2017Aug21-Sequence-RTF-TQI-2048x1152--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Total Solar Eclipse Sequence\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The solar eclipse of 21 August 2017 as seen from Madras, Oregon.
