 "awd_abstract_narration": "This collaborative project will use imaging and spectrophotometry to study 2,000 of the nearest stars. The high spatial resolution images will be capable of revealing bound planets. The spectrophotometry will provide information about the systems? temperatures and orbital characteristics. The work will focus on a type of star called M-dwarfs, which are cooler and less massive than the Sun. These stars are also considered more likely to have rocky planets habitable to life than stars like the Sun. Observations will be made with two telescopes in Arizona and one in California. Scientific results will be incorporated into an outreach program with the Discovery Channel. Students from Northern Arizona University and Southern Connecticut State University will participate in the research.\r\n\r\nThe team will use the Differential Speckle Survey Instrument (DSSI) on Lowell Observatory 4.5m telescope and the R=600 visible-light multi-object spectrophotometer on Lowell?s 31-inch telescope.  Through the comparison of speckle patterns simultaneously observed at two wavelengths, DSSI can measure separations of companions below the diffraction limit. Follow-up spectrophotometry will provide data for stellar characterization and spectral energy distribution fitting. The team will also use the Palomar 200-inch telescope to assess bound companions using data from an infrared camera or optical integral field spectrometer and isochrone modeling.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe intent of this project was a survey of all the 'M-dwarf' stars near to our own solar system, limited only by the size of the telescope used for the survey.  M-dwarfs are the smallest stars found, and are half to a tenth the size of our sun; though they are small, these stars make up the majority of all stars in the universe.  It is thought that roughly a third of these stars have an even smaller companion star in orbit about them, but the precise rate of companionship is poorly known.  This study used a much bigger telescope than has been previously employed for such a survey (the 4.3-meter Lowell Discovery Telescope), and improved our knowledge of that companionship rate by detecting a few dozen previously unknown companions - roughly an 8% increase in the number of nearby M-dwarfs that have a known stellar companion.  Improving this knowledge of companionship rate has a significant impact on our expectations for planetary systems that these M-dwarf stars may host.\n\nThis project also allowed the opportunity to upgrade our telescope's main instrument used int this study, the speckle camera, now renamed 'QWSSI'.  This upgrade allowed a more detailed characterization of the newly discovered companions, by opening up a greater number and range of observing colors of light captured by the telescope.\n\nTwo graduate students also benefited from participation in the project and completed, or are near completing, their doctoral studies.  \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/19/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Gerard Van Belle"
