 "awd_abstract_narration": "Conventional microprocessors are designed primarily for sustained\r\nperformance; they can operate at near-peak performance essentially\r\nindefinitely until their energy source is exhausted. In battery and\r\ncooling constrained environments such as mobile devices, sustained power\r\n(and, consequently, peak performance) must be limited to at most a few\r\nwatts so that the device can dissipate heat using only passive\r\nconvection. However, many interactive mobile applications (such as\r\nhandwriting/speech recognition or image-based search) instead call for\r\nbursts of intense computation in response to user input, creating the\r\nneed for a new ultra-responsive operating regime: rather than limit peak\r\npower assuming sustained operation, systems should instead exploit heat\r\nstorage to enable brief computation bursts that greatly exceed\r\nsustainable thermal limits without overheating.  This project\r\ninvestigates an approach called \"computational sprinting\", the central\r\nessence of which is to compute at unsustainable rates but only briefly\r\nso that temperatures do not reach unsafe levels.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to address the architectural, thermal,\r\nelectrical, and software barriers to ultra-responsiveness via\r\ncomputational sprinting. In particular, the project explores: (1)\r\narchitectures and memory systems that sprint via parallelism (activating\r\ntens of reserve functional units/cores) and voltage boosting\r\n(overdriving cores for single-thread performance) while facilitating\r\nfast burst onsets; (2) thermal designs that improve thermal response\r\nbehavior to enable longer and more intense sprints; (3) mobile-optimized \r\nelectrical designs that provide stable supply voltages\r\ndespite current surges of an order-of-magnitude or more; and \r\n(4) software mechanisms that explicitly manage limited thermal budgets \r\nand anticipate and stage data needed during the sprint.  The project\r\nincludes the fabrication of an experimental testbed to approximate the\r\ncomputational, thermal and electrical capabilities of a future many-core\r\nmobile device and to provide practical experience with sprinting.\r\nProject impacts include (1) developing and advancing techniques for\r\nimproving the responsiveness of mobile devices and (2) integrating the\r\ndiscoveries into a new cross-departmental course on computer system\r\ndesign.",
