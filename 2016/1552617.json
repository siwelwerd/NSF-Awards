 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-technical: \r\nThis CAREER proposal aims to develop a bio-inspired and sustainable material called nano-dendrimers. This protein-based technology allows different types of functional molecules and nanoparticles to be assembled in a highly ordered fashion. This technology will help advance our basic understanding on magnetic and plasmonic properties of nanoparticle-based assembly. The approach will also find wide applications in areas such as drug delivery, imaging, tissue engineering, and catalysis. Integrated into the proposal is a vigorous education plan that provides education opportunities at different levels. It aims to improve higher education by training well-rounded graduate and undergraduate students in nanobiotechnology. The plan also includes promoting public science learning by bringing state-of-the-art research progress to the public in an appealing manner.\r\n\r\nTechnical: \r\nThe main research objective of the CAREER proposal is to develop a novel, bio-inspired assembly technology called nano-dendrimers that allows specific numbers of nanoparticles to cluster into higher nanostructures. The central player, ferritin, is a protein nanocage that contains 24 subunits. Ferritins can be engineered, through either chemical or genetic methods, to present exactly 24 coupling ligands, such as biotin, on the surface. The resulting ferritins will go through a unique hybridization approach with native ferritins to achieve derivatives presenting discrete numbers of coupling ligands. Using the hybrid ferritins as building blocks (referred to as FBBs), one can construct different supramolecular structures in a manner similar to dendrimer growth. Meanwhile, the interiors of ferritins can be loaded with a wide range of functionalities. Multiple cargos can be loaded into separated FBBs and then integrated into nano-dendrimers with high accuracy. The approach will also find wide applications in areas such as drug delivery, imaging, tissue engineering, and catalysis. The proposed research is highly interdisciplinary and provides many cutting-edge research opportunities. It will train graduate and undergraduate students who understand a broad range of multi-disciplinary approaches and attack problems with a wide range of tools. It also provide education opportunities to high school and K-12 students with an emphasis on minority students.",

Multiple ferritin derivatives have been prepared and their potential in applications such as a drug delivered was explored. In particular, their applications as a photodynamic therapy (PDT) agent was investigated. The team published more than 30 papers during the funding period and filed 1 patent. Ferritins presenting different ligands on surface were created so that they can target cancer cells, endothelial cells, and cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs). Hybrid nanoparticles with a core/satellite architecture were also created to allow for delivery of multiple cargos. Under photo-irradiation, photosensitizer-loaded ferritins can generate reactive oxygen species, most prominently singlet oxygen. Due to short-lived nature of singlet oxygen, treatment selectivity is high, depending on the surface ligand. For instance, our studies showed that folate-ferritin PDT can selectively kill cancer cells. Moreover, RGD-ferritin can target tumor endothelial cells by interacting with integrin; at low photo-irradiation doses, the treatment causes vessel permeabilization that enhances delivery of nanoparticles to tumors. More recently, FAP-targeted ferritin was created and the resulting conjugate was able to selectively kill CAFs in tumors. The elimination of CAFs alters the tumor microenvironment, promoting an anti-tumor immunity. Last but not least, our studies showed a hybrid, ferritin/polymer nanoparticle can deliver both photosensitizer and IDO inhibitor to tumors, and the combination treatment leads to abscopal effect. This project is highly interdisciplinary and provides research opportunities to graduate, undergraduate and high school studies. In the past 5 years, 10 students graduated from the group with a PhD degree, 5 of them are female. In addition, more than 10 undergraduates and 6 high school students worked in the group during this time.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div id=\"haloword-lookup\" class=\"ui-widget-content ui-draggable\" style=\"position: relative;\">\n<div id=\"haloword-title\"><span id=\"haloword-word\">&nbsp;</span><a id=\"haloword-pron\" class=\"haloword-button\" title=\"&#21457;&#38899;\"></a>\n<div id=\"haloword-control-container\"><a id=\"haloword-add\" class=\"haloword-button\" title=\"&#21152;&#20837;&#21333;&#35789;&#34920;\"></a><a id=\"haloword-remove\" class=\"haloword-button\" title=\"&#31227;&#20986;&#21333;&#35789;&#34920;\"></a><a id=\"haloword-open\" class=\"haloword-button\" title=\"&#26597;&#30475;&#21333;&#35789;&#35814;&#32454;&#37322;&#20041;\" href=\"#\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a id=\"haloword-close\" class=\"haloword-button\" title=\"&#20851;&#38381;&#26597;&#35810;&#31383;\"></a></div>\n<br style=\"clear: both;\" /></div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"haloword-lookup\" class=\"ui-widget-content\">\n<div id=\"haloword-title\"><span id=\"haloword-word\">&nbsp;</span><a id=\"haloword-pron\" class=\"haloword-button\" title=\"&#21457;&#38899;\"></a>\n<div id=\"haloword-control-container\"><a id=\"haloword-add\" class=\"haloword-button\" title=\"&#21152;&#20837;&#21333;&#35789;&#34920;\"></a><a id=\"haloword-remove\" class=\"haloword-button\" title=\"&#31227;&#20986;&#21333;&#35789;&#34920;\"></a><a id=\"haloword-open\" class=\"haloword-button\" title=\"&#26597;&#30475;&#21333;&#35789;&#35814;&#32454;&#37322;&#20041;\" href=\"#\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a id=\"haloword-close\" class=\"haloword-button\" title=\"&#20851;&#38381;&#26597;&#35810;&#31383;\"></a></div>\n<br style=\"clear: both;\" /></div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"haloword-lookup\" class=\"ui-widget-content\">\n<div id=\"haloword-title\"><span id=\"haloword-word\">&nbsp;</span><a id=\"haloword-pron\" class=\"haloword-button\" title=\"&#21457;&#38899;\"></a>\n<div id=\"haloword-control-container\"><a id=\"haloword-add\" class=\"haloword-button\" title=\"&#21152;&#20837;&#21333;&#35789;&#34920;\"></a><a id=\"haloword-remove\" class=\"haloword-button\" title=\"&#31227;&#20986;&#21333;&#35789;&#34920;\"></a><a id=\"haloword-open\" class=\"haloword-button\" title=\"&#26597;&#30475;&#21333;&#35789;&#35814;&#32454;&#37322;&#20041;\" href=\"#\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a id=\"haloword-close\" class=\"haloword-button\" title=\"&#20851;&#38381;&#26597;&#35810;&#31383;\"></a></div>\n<br style=\"clear: both;\" /></div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"haloword-lookup\" class=\"ui-widget-content\">\n<div id=\"haloword-title\"><span id=\"haloword-word\">&nbsp;</span><a id=\"haloword-pron\" class=\"haloword-button\" title=\"&#21457;&#38899;\"></a>\n<div id=\"haloword-control-container\"><a id=\"haloword-add\" class=\"haloword-button\" title=\"&#21152;&#20837;&#21333;&#35789;&#34920;\"></a><a id=\"haloword-remove\" class=\"haloword-button\" title=\"&#31227;&#20986;&#21333;&#35789;&#34920;\"></a><a id=\"haloword-open\" class=\"haloword-button\" title=\"&#26597;&#30475;&#21333;&#35789;&#35814;&#32454;&#37322;&#20041;\" href=\"#\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a id=\"haloword-close\" class=\"haloword-button\" title=\"&#20851;&#38381;&#26597;&#35810;&#31383;\"></a></div>\n<br style=\"clear: both;\" /></div>\n</div><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 07/15/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Jin&nbsp;Xie</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"></div>\n</div>",
