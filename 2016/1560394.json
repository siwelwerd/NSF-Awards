 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will provide three years of support for Purdue University to offer an eight week summer residential program for undergraduate students to conduct research in pure mathematics. The program, entitled Purdue Research in Mathematics Experience (PRiME) will host eight undergraduates each summer. The main goals of the program are (1) to provide undergraduate students with a research experience in algebraic geometry, number theory, or probability with the aim of producing new results worthy of publication or presentation at a national mathematics meeting, and (2) to prepare undergraduates for a post-baccalaureate degree in mathematics. The program will also work to increase the diversity of mathematicians both at Purdue University and more broadly. The program directors will place a high importance on recruiting participants from groups traditionally underrepresented in mathematics. Additionally, the directors of the program will invite mathematicians from underrepresented groups speak in a Summer REU Colloquium series in which they will discuss with the PRiME participants their professional journey. \r\n\r\nThe PRiME program will be directed by Professors Edray Goins (Purdue University), Jonathon Peterson (Purdue University) and Pamela Harris (United States Military Academy). The three co-directors will also be assisted by two graduate students who will help provide additional guidance in the undergraduate students research. Each summer the program will select eight students to participate in the PRiME program at Purdue. Four of the students will participate in research in algebraic geometry/number theory, and four students will participate in research on random walks/stochastic processes. To prepare students for research there will be  a two week period with short courses on topics such as Abstract Algebra, Complex Analysis, Differential Geometry, Graph Theory, Number Theory, Markov Chains, and Stochastic Processes. During the course of the program, students will also be taught important skills such as how to write with the mathematical typsetting language LaTeX, how to use advanced symbolic computing packages such as Sage or Mathematica, and how to prepare a technical paper of their results. At the conclusion of the eight week program, students will present a summary of their findings. Following the completion of the program, students will be encouraged to present their research at a national conference and/or submit their research for publication in a mathematics journal.",
