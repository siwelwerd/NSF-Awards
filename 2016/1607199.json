 "awd_abstract_narration": "Embedded deep in the ice cap at the South Pole, the IceCube Neutrino Observatory (ICNO) is the world's largest and most sensitive high energy neutrino telescope. It is a 1 billion-ton detector using the Antarctic ice as a detection medium for high energy atmospheric and astrophysical neutrinos. Most of the neutrinos observed by IceCube exhibit energies in the range expected for atmospheric neutrinos originating from decays of particles produced in extensive air showers by cosmic rays coming from nearby sectors of the Milky Way Galaxy. These may be used to measure the fundamental properties of neutrinos. At higher energies, astrophysical neutrinos are key probes of the high-energy universe. Because of their unique properties, neutrinos escape even dense regions, are not deflected by galactic or extra-galactic magnetic fields and traverse the photon-filled universe unhindered. Thus, neutrinos provide direct information about the dynamics and interiors of the powerful cosmic objects that may be the origins of high energy cosmic rays: supernovae, black holes, pulsars, active galactic nuclei and other extreme extragalactic phenomena. This award will fund this UCB group to use IceCube data to better characterize this astrophysical neutrino flux. They will measure the flux at higher energies than has currently been done, testing for the presence of a high energy cutoff. \r\n\r\nIceCube's discovery of an astrophysical neutrino flux has attracted great attention from students at all levels and from the general public and garnered much media attention. This group will educate undergraduate and graduate students and postdocs who are attracted to this important question. The award will fund a broad spectrum of outreach activities targeted at the general public and younger students, through classroom and public presentations and popular writing.\r\n\r\nThis group's study will extend IceCube measurements of the energy spectrum both upward and downward in energy, through two searches. The first will use the data for a more accurate measurement of the neutrino flavor ratio: the relative proportion of electron, muon and tau neutrinos in the astrophysical flux. The second study will employ a fit to the energy and zenith angle distributions to separate conventional and prompt atmospheric neutrinos and astrophysical neutrinos. This fit should allow a sufficiently accurate measurement of the atmospheric pion:kaon ratio to constrain air shower models. It will also detect, for the first time, diffractive neutrino interactions, and will also provide constraints on parton distribution functions and nuclear shadowing at high energies.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe neutrinos observed by IceCube have energies up to 1,000 times higher than those that are produced at CERNs Large Hadron Collider (which have not yet been observed), and 10,000 times higher than those that are studied at fixed-target particle accelerators.   A major goal of \"Astrophysics and Neutrino Physics with IceCube\" is to use these events to study how neutrinos interact at very high energies.    We do this in two different ways. \n\nThe first is to study how energetic neutrinos are absorbed in the Earth.  Because the neutrino interaction cross-section (absorption probability) increases with increasing energy, in the IceCube energy range, neutrinos passing through the Earth are likely to be absorbed. Figure 1 shows how the neutrino transmission probability depends on zenith angle and energy.\n\nBy fitting the measured two-dimensional (energy and angle) distribution to models with different cross-section, we can measure this absorption.   Figure 2 shows the result, along with previous lower-energy measurements at accelerator laboratories.  The measurement probed the neutrino energy range from 6.3 to 980 TeV, 10 to 2000 times the energy of previous measurements.   The result agrees with the standard model of particle physics. This consistency can eliminate some speculative models for new (beyond standard model) physics, such as those involving extra, rolled-up spatial dimensions or new hypothetical new particles like sphalerons, which might explain some aspects of the big bang.  This work appeared in Nature 551, 596 (2017).\n\nThe second approach studied interactions of muon neutrinos in the ice within IceCube.  Muon neutrinos interact with target nuclei, transferring a fraction of their energy to this target, with the remainder carried away by the produced muon; this fraction is the inelasticity.    We selected 2,650 muon neutrino interactions where we saw enough of the produced muon track to be able to estimate its energy.  With that plus the energy of the shower from the recoiling target, we could determine the neutrino energy and the inelasticity of the interaction.   This measurement was sensitive for neutrino energies from 1 TeV to 300 TeV, - again, energies far above those that are accessible at accelerator laboratories.   As Fig. 3 shows, the measured inelasticity is consistent with the predictions of the standard model; inelasticity decreases slowly with increasing neutrino energy.   This data can also be used to set limits on some new-physics models.   The inelasticity work was published in Physical Review D99, 032004 (2019).\n\nWe also used the inelasticity measurements to probe the production mechanisms for astrophysical neutrinos.  The most energetic neutrinos in the sample are mostly from astrophysical sources.  This fact allowed us to explore a mystery seen in previous IceCube measurements of the neutrino energy spectrum.  The neutrino energy spectrum is typically fit with a power law:\n\ndN&nu;/dE&nu; ~ E&nu;-a\n\nwhere N&nu; is the neutrino flux, E&nu; is the neutrino energy and a is the spectral index.  There have been two approaches to measure a.  The first uses contained events of all flavors, or of selected electron neutrinos.  The second uses through-going muon events from neutrino interactions outside of IceCube.  The latter neutrinos have a higher typical energy than the contained events, and found an a smaller than the contained event studies.   If the spectrum was not a single power law, then a would depend on neutrino energy.  Our study used starting track events with a neutrino energy distribution similar to the contained events, and found a preferred spectral index in between the two other studies, so did not confirm or refute the energy difference as an explanation for the difference in spectral index.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/15/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Spencer Klein"
