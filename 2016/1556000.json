 "awd_abstract_narration": "An award is made to Louisiana State University to develop an instrument for localized sampling of genomic material from single cells in tissue.  The proposed spatially resolved single cell genomics instrument will enable studies of cellular processes on a single cell level with high resolution. The instrument will facilitate local sampling of single cells and determination of genetic differences from cell-to-cell within a heterogeneous population. It will enhance the ability to study the genomics of stem cell development and the study of genetic mosaicism in the brain, which has important implications in understanding neurological diseases and their treatment. The project will involve students and teachers as well as undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdocs in several initiatives that will advance STEM education and career development in Louisiana and the Gulf Coast region. The results of the project will be disseminated using an array of social media platforms that are aimed at demonstrating the capabilities of the approach broadly to the general public.\r\n\r\nGenetic differences between individual cells cause differences in their biological function; however, extracting DNA and RNA from large numbers of cells obscures important information about individual cells. High performance next-generation sequencing can be performed on isolated cells, but only after they have been extracted, which loses the information about their location in the organism. This project is aimed at creating a device that can extract material from single cells while preserving its location in the tissue. The instrument uses an atomic force microscope to image the tissue and high-precision tip-enhanced laser ablation to select material for quantification and sequencing. The material is sampled with high precision from individual cells in spatially selected regions. The project goals are construction of the laser ablation system, automated imaging and sample collection, and demonstration of the instrument with breast cancer tissue samples.",

The instrument uses an atomic force microscope to image the tissue and high-precision tip-enhanced laser ablation to select material for genomic analysis from regions that are smaller than a single cell. Genetic differences between individual cells cause differences in their biological function; however, extracting DNA and RNA from large numbers of cells obscures their unique genomic and transcriptomic information. High performance next-generation sequencing can be performed on isolated cells, but only after the cells themselves have been extracted, which removes the information about their location in the organism.

A high resolution image of a flat surface can be recorded by tapping the tip against it and measuring the value of the tip deflection. The AFM has an open sample stage which allows a laser to be directed at the gold coated silicon tip which has a diameter of 80 nm. As the tip moves up and down at a distance of 15 nm above the surface, a pulsed laser is fired which heats the tip and transfers the energy to the sample. The rapidly heated sample is ejected from the surface and is collected on a metal wire or small liquid droplet. The heating is rapid and large molecules such as DNA and RNA are not damaged and can be collected and further analyzed.</p>\n<p>The effect of laser irradiation on the AFM tip was evaluated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Figure 2 shows a SEM image of the tip before and after laser irradiation using a green pulsed laser (532 nm wavelength). The diameter of the tip after laser irradiation increases to approximately 1000 nm, but it can still be used for imaging. One of the main goals of this project was to find the best laser wavelength for precision sampling of DNA and RNA from cells and tissue. A thin film of the molecule anthracene was used to test the system and craters were ablated with wavelengths in the visible and near-infrared regions (Figure 3).

Three dyes with absorption at different wavelengths were ablated and the size of the crater was measured. The dyes were rhodamine B which absorbs yellow-green light (around 550 nm), methylene blue which absorbs red (650 nm) and IR 797 which absorbs infrared (800 nm). The ablated crater volume and dye absorption are plotted in Figure 4. The result shows that the absorption of the dye surface does not drive the ablation: heating of the tip is followed by transfer of the energy to the surface.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Tip-enhanced ablation was used to capture DNA for genomic analysis.

A test was made with 3200 base-pair plasmid DNA and the results are shown in Figure 5.
