 "awd_abstract_narration": "PI: Louge, Michel\r\nProposal Number: 1637531\r\n\r\nThe proposed research will utilize the microgravity environment on the International Space Station (ISS) to improve understanding of imbibition, a process in which water is absorbed by solids. An array of capillaries is going to be used as the experimental set up for investigating contact line pinning and de-pinning as a liquid wets the capillaries. The reason for conducting experiments at the ISS is to take advantage of the long time scales for these phenomena that increases when there is no gravity in space, so that the measurement resolution is much higher than on Earth. The imbibition process is important to many engineering and industrial processes. For example, understanding of how solids and liquids interact, can lead to major improvements in flooding control, which is estimated to cause $11 billion annually. Another engineering application of this work is the process of wet granulation, an important process used by pharmaceutical companies for drug manufacturing. \r\n\r\nThe PIs propose to exploit the OASIS facility on the ISS to observe the imbibition of water into well-characterized cylindrical capillaries on time and length scales long enough to observe details hitherto inaccessible under Earth gravity. The data set will be used as a benchmark for validating numerical simulations on complex capillary geometry. When a drop touches a porous medium, it spreads as if laid on a composite surface. The surface first behaves as a hydrophobic material, as liquid must penetrate pores filled with air. When contact is established, some of the liquid is drawn into pores by a capillarity that is resisted by viscous forces growing with length of the imbibed region. This process always begins with an inertial regime that is complicated by the motion and possible pinning of gas-liquid-solid contact lines jumping over newly-wetted capillaries. A question is whether simulations capture such crucial subtleties. To study imbibition on Earth, time and distance must be shrunk to mitigate gravity-induced distortion. These small scales make it impossible to observe inertial and pinning processes in detail. Instead, OASIS will slowly extrude water spheres until they touch the capillary plate. Their 12mm diameter will be large enough for the GX1050C camera to visualize details near individual capillaries, and long enough to observe dynamics of the entire imbibition process. To investigate the role of contact pinning, it is proposed to test a matrix with ten kinds of porous capillary plates made of metal treated with Self-Assembled Monolayers (SAM), thereby fixing advancing and receding contact angles at known values. These detailed observations will be contrasted with lattice-Boltzmann and Direct Numerical simulations. Prototype testing will take place at Cornell's 1.2s free-fall tower with a unique mechanism producing relatively large water spheres. The wetting of porous surfaces is central to applications where three states of matter coexist, such as fuel cells, filtration, CO2 sequestration, heat pipes, or the wetting of soils. Performance of these systems is determined by capillary forces, geometrical constraints imposed by the contact angle, and contact angle hysteresis. Imbibition can be detrimental (e.g., earth dam collapse after water infiltration), or useful (e.g., irrigation, or wet granulation in drug excipient manufacture). This work will be conducted with undergraduates and a doctoral student. It will also strengthen an outreach program to Technology Education at a local Middle School, which the PI created in 2000.",
