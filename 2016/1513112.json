The project will develop and study the outcomes of a program that includes a concentrated two-week summer program coupled with academic year mentoring, support, and research opportunities.  Nanotechnology teaching modules will be developed and tested, with the aim of implementing, researching, and refining a nanotechnology-focused program for secondary students, along with a professional development program for teachers.  The project is intended to generate student awareness and interest in emerging workforce opportunities, particularly among students from low-income and underrepresented populations.\r\n\r\nThe project aims to increase nanotechnology content knowledge among students and teachers, increase associated pedagogical content knowledge among teachers, increase scientific research knowledge and skills among students and teachers, foster career readiness in nanotechnology-related fields among students, and foster increased teacher self-efficacy as it relates to teaching nanotechnology concepts.  A mixed-methods research approach will be used to study outcomes among teacher and student participants, with pre-test and post-test data being collected in association with each implementation of summer sessions and academic-year modules.  A quasi-experimental design will be used to compare results from treatment and comparison groups.  Content assessments and interest surveys will be used to measure program impacts on student and teacher knowledge and interests, and a series of observations, interviews, and surveys will be used to guide interpretation of patterns detected in results from the treatment and comparison groups.",

Here, the multidisciplinary field of nanotechnology represented a topic at the forefront of discovery-based science and, with applications in nearly all STEM sectors could impact and excite students and teachers with varying STEM interests. It also provided cross-discipline connectivity to offer real-world context to skills students develop in the classroom. With a long-term goal of increasing student awareness and interest in STEM and its emerging workforce opportunities, this program provided high school students and teachers from high-needs school districts, with large populations of underrepresented students and socioeconomic diversity, concentrated two-week nanotechnology summer programming coupled with academic year mentoring, support, and research opportunities. To achieve this goal, NEST had three specific aims: 1) Develop, implement, research, and refine an innovative nanotechnology-focused program for secondary students, 2) Develop, implement, research, and refine an original professional development program for STEM secondary teachers using nanotechnology content, and 3) Disseminate new, teacher-developed nanotechnology classroom learning modules that could impact students in Indiana and across the nation. With these aims, the program was able increase nanotechnology content knowledge and in general, scientific research knowledge and skills, among both students and teachers, while also fostering career readiness in nanotechnology-related fields among students and confidence in designing and implementation of new inquiry-based learning content among teachers. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Annually, NEST set out to recruit 15 teachers and 20 students to take part in separate 2-week nanotechnology-focused summer programs. However, student response was overwhelming, highlighting the need for this programming in the Indianapolis area, and by 2019 the number of student participants had increased to 33. In total, NEST directly served a diverse group of 132 students (41% female, 33% African American, and 11% Hispanic). The students completed an intensive two-week summer program that included: Week 1 - an introduction into nanotechnology concepts, applications, and career options through hands-on activities, and Week 2 - research immersion created through multi-day experiments that allowed students to dive into hypothesis-driven work where they could brainstorm, develop, and test their own ideas. With respect to teachers, NEST served a total of 47 participants (53% female, 17% African American, and 4% Hispanic), where Week 2 activities differed and were focused on teacher professional development, training in inquire-based learning, collaboration, and the creation of nanotechnology-learning modules for their classrooms. To date, a total of 39 teacher-developed learning modules have been disseminated broadly. Furthermore, many past teacher participants continue to use their modules each year, some have gone on to present them at conferences, and others have used the training acquired through NEST to independently create additional modules.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>NEST also improved understanding in practices that promote and increase students' motivations and capacities in STEM. As a result, student and teacher programs were refined over the years based on some key lessons learned; some examples include: 1) accelerated use of scientific notebooking within the student programming dramatically improved gains in content knowledge, retention, and problem solving (as students generated hypotheses, recorded observations, and thought processes in their notebooks); 2) creation of ?scenario? experiments (e.g., building of solar power amid a zombie apocalypse with limited supplies in a building locked down) increased content knowledge, classroom participation, and critical thinking in students; 3) ensuring teacher-follow through with new module classroom implementation required them leaving with a plan on both when and how it would be integrated in their classroom as state requirements provide little time to deviate from current curricula; 4) career content information was highly revered by teachers as a component needed to grab student interest; and 5) learning module development, both quantity and quality, was highest when teacher cohorts consisted of a mix of new and past participants, solidifying content knowledge and confidence in returning participants, and providing new participants with a resource for guidance and collaboration. Using a mixed-methods research approach, study outcomes showed statistically significant increases in content knowledge, attitudes towards nanotechnology, and 21st Century Learning Skills among both student and teachers. In addition, teachers showed elevated self-efficacy towards nanotechnology and science teaching and the understanding of STEM careers options. Teachers also greatly highlighted how this program was revamping their curriculum for the betterment of students, with quotes that include, ?We teach old science, but this program helps us connect old science with modern science? and ?I had lots of preconceptions. I thought it [nanotechnology] was just applicable to engineering but didn?t anticipate that it?s in everything. I appreciated how this informs so many of the standards that I already teach.? By directly impacting students and providing pedogeological training to teachers, disseminating developed classroom learning modules, and publishing educational research to inform other secondary school programming, NEST has made strides to overturn trends and increase diversity in Indiana?s, and the nation?s, future STEM workforce.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified:
