 "awd_abstract_narration": "\"Fast Radio Bursts\" (FRBs) are linked to exotic astronomical objects in distant galaxies that produce a sudden and very dramatic burst of radio waves. The burst lasts a fraction of a second. Yet modern radio telescopes like the Green Bank Telescope (GBT) in West Virginia can detect these remarkable events - if they are equipped with sensitive equipment and sophisticated computer programs to analyze the data. A collaboration of scientists and students (both graduate and undergraduate) from the University of West Virginia and Virginia Tech plan to develop these programs for the GBT. Astronomers do not yet know what produces FRBs. They could be the result of colliding stars, or perhaps black holes swallowing neighboring stars. Either way, telescopes like the GBT should lead astronomers much closer to an answer.\r\n\r\nThe detection of FRBs, believed to be extra-galactic in origin, and other potentially exotic radio transits, has in recent years been enabled by a revolution in radio instrumentation and computing power. The latter has lead to the development of sophisticated signal processing algorithms. The principal investigator, working with her graduate and undergraduate students and a collaborator at Virginia Tech., aims to develop such algorithms with a view to deploying them on the GBT and detecting radio transients in real time. The techniques will be prototyped on radio receivers already in place and in operation at the GBT; the software will run in parallel with existing data processing systems. The algorithms will enable sensitive, wide-field surveys of pulsars and other radio transients, in additions to the FRBs mentioned above. The algorithms and source code will be made freely available to the astronomical community once commissioned on the GBT. The PI also aims to develop a \"Statistical Signal Processing for Sensor Arrays\" undergraduate course to help make the technology more accessible to a wider audience and to educate the next generation of scientists and engineers.",

Due to its propagation through interstellar medium composed of free electrons, the high frequency component of the signal arrives to the telescope before the low frequency component of the signal. This phenomenon is known as dispersion.  The traditional approach aligns all frequency components by applying a de-dispersion method and then adds the image columns along the frequency components which results in a one-dimensional signal with Signal-to-Noise Ratio much higher than each individual frequency component of pulse in the spectrogram.\n\n \n\nThe first newly developed pulse detection algorithm displays a spectrogram of a pulse in a space reciprocal to time and frequency space of the spectrogram.  The dispersed pulse is observed as a fan in the transformed image.  A basic calculation of the energy of pixels composing the fan leads to a new pulse detection rule.  A similar idea is involved in the development of the other detection algorithm, where the energy of the spectrogram projected along several lines is analyzed.   The description of the algorithms and the analysis of their performance were presented at ICASSP 2017 and GlobalSip 2018 and published in the fifth issue of MNRAS in 2018.  Xiaoqian He, one of the graduate students working on the project, applied the algorithms to analyze performance of ten Rotating Radio Transients (RRAT) and summarized the results of her analysis in her MS thesis, which she presented to her committee in Spring 2018.  The theory and performance analysis of the second developed algorithm are the foundation for two chapters of the PhD dissertation of Marwan Alkhweldi. He is planning to defend his dissertation in Fall 2020.  Marwan is the second graduate student involved in the project. \n\n \n\nIn summers of 2017 and 2018 Richard Prestage worked with several undergraduate students during the summer program at the Green Bank Observatory.  He and his advisees have developed a new algorithm capable of detecting and mitigating Radio Frequency Interference in raw radio astronomy data.   The algorithm was implemented in hardware, which ensured that the mitigation of Radio Frequency Interference is performed in real time.  This algorithm is currently implemented at the Green Bank Telescope.  The developed algorithms for the detection and mitigation of Radio Frequency Interference in raw radio astronomy data demonstrate a considerably reduced number of false alarms compared to the methods previously applied for the suppression of Radio Frequency Interference.
