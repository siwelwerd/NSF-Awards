 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site program at California State Polytechnic University, Pomona (CPP), offers state-of-the-art, multi-disciplinary research experiences in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) technologies, engineering, and computer science to diverse and talented cohorts of undergraduates, particularly women and Hispanic students, from 2 and 4 year institutions with limited or no research opportunities. UAV's have the potential of replacing manned aircraft for dull, dirty, and dangerous missions. In addition, UAV's are less expensive than manned aircraft and pose no risk to human operators. Military applications include intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR), battlefield damage assessment, and force protection.  Civilian applications include remote sensing, scientific research, search and rescue missions, border patrol, surveillance of disaster-affected areas, aerial photography, aerial mapping for geotechnical survey, vegetation growth analysis, crop dusting, and precision agriculture.  The UAV industry is the fastest growing sector of the aerospace industry.  However, there is a lack of professionals entering the workforce for UAV related jobs.  This REU program is designed to increase students' interest in UAV technologies by means of first-hand experience on UAV research with direct mentorship by faculty advisors from various departments within the CPP Colleges of Engineering and Science.  \r\n\r\nThis REU Site offers undergraduates, in collaboration with CPP faculty and graduate students, opportunities to conduct research during a 10-week summer program, on state-of-the-art technologies and advanced research projects in UAV flight dynamic and control, computer vision, artificial intelligence, embedded systems, and robotics. In addition to their research, students will participate in weekly research seminars, research meetings, and professional development seminars. The seminars will include topics such as literature review, writing a scientific paper, improving written and oral communication skills, technical presentations, graduate education, career paths, resume building, and ethics in science and engineering. The 10-week program will also include outreach activity. The students will give presentations on UAV technologies, engineering, and computer science to K-12 students at local schools. This will enhance students' communication skills, allow them to see the broader implications of their research, and see how they can positively impact society through research. The discoveries made during these collaborations will be communicated to the broader scientific community via publications and presentations. \r\n\r\nThis site is supported by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program.",

The students were carefully mentored by an interdisciplinary team of faculty members from Aerospace Engineering, Electrical &amp; Computer Engineering, and Computer Science departments. The learner-centered and team-based summer research program covered a wide range of disciplines such as Flight Dynamics, Guidance, Navigation, and Control, Computer Vision, Autonomy, Aerospace Robotics, Artificial Intelligence, Modeling &amp; Simulation, Collision Detection and Avoidance, 3-D Mapping, Localization and Mapping, Flight Testing, etc. Students learned fundamental skills in engineering and computer science, and were trained to use computational tools needed to engage in multidisciplinary UAV research.

Others joined aerospace industry involved in UAV research &amp; development, US Navy, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and other related industries. &nbsp;Two students have received DOD?s <em>Science, Mathematics, and Research Transformation</em> (SMART) scholarships, and will pursue graduate degrees upon completion of their BS degrees. Five of the six participants from Community Colleges have already transferred to 4-year institutions including Cal Poly Pomona for BS degrees in Engineering. All of the graduated and non-graduated participants are planning to pursue their studies for graduate degrees, either full-time or part-time. Participants who have not yet graduated or are graduating soon were or have been accepted for summer internship and full-times positions at companies such as Northrop Grumman, Aerovironment, and Lockheed Martin Corporation.

The Program has also been helpful in upgrading our labs and getting funding from other Government agencies (State/Federal) or
