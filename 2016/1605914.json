 "awd_abstract_narration": "PI:  Donzis, Diego\r\nProposal Number: 1605914\r\n\r\nMixing of substances or species (commonly called \"scalars\" in the literature) in turbulent flows is a topic of paramount importance from both fundamental and practical standpoints. The focus of this proposal is on the investigation of compressible turbulent flows and mixing. In order to achieve this goal, it is proposed to use simulations of unprecedented high fidelity, pushing the boundaries of the class of simulations known as Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS). \r\n\r\nWhile substantial work has been accumulated over decades on mixing in incompressible flows, there is no similar level of exploration or data on mixing in compressible turbulence in spite of its critical importance in diverse areas such as air transportation and aerodynamics, physics of solar wind, flows in stars and supernovae, chemically reacting flows in engines or the atmosphere, among many others. In applications, compressible mixing is commonly modeled using incompressible results based mainly on classical phenomenology. There is, thus, a gap in knowledge which this proposal aims to close by providing groundwork for understanding the fundamental physical processes through controlled and systematic studies in new canonical configurations and the resulting databases of high-fidelity DNS data for the community to explore. The proposed research will comprehensively investigate the effects of Reynolds number, Mach number and Schmidt number. The work proposed includes the definition of a class of canonical flows that can be used to obtain high fidelity results that could lead to advances in compressible scalar mixing. Results for these canonical flows would provide reliable data that can be used as benchmark for theories and models. Furthermore, it is proposed to develop a so-called Langley curve for compressible mixing. The high performance computing techniques to be developed as the side effect of this project and the data will be available to the community of interested scientists and engineers.",

While substantial work has been accumulated on mixing in low-speed (incompressible) flows, there has been virtually no work, and even less reliable data, on mixing in compressible turbulence in spite of its critical importance in diverse areas such as air transportation and aerodynamics, flows in stars and supernovae, the solar wind, chemically reacting flows in engines or the atmosphere, among many others. Due to its complexity, compressible mixing has been commonly modeled using incompressible results based mainly on classical phenomenology which does not account for fluctuations in thermodynamics variables and their interaction with hydrodynamic variables which only happens in compressible flows. This project aimed at closing this gap in knowledge by providing groundwork for understanding the fundamental physical processes through systematic studies in canonical configurations and the resulting databases of high-fidelity DNS data for the community to explore.\n\nA number of important results have been obtained in this project. We have generated a massive database of high-fidelity simulations that captures all the relevant physics and can be used to further our understanding of mixing in turbulent flows. This database is perhaps the largest in homogeneous isotropic compressible turbulence in the literature which allowed us to explore a number of long-standing a new issues.\n\nWith it, we have developed a novel two parameter asymptotic expansion of Navier-Stokes which shows that the state of turbulence can be determined by two parameters, one that represent the level of dilatational motions (), and the turbulent Mach number (Mt). We demonstrated that it was not possible to collapse any relevant statistics of the flow using only Mt, as have been the practice in the literature for decades. Instead we show that small-scale universality is indeed possible in compressible turbulence by robustly collapsing many dynamically important statistics when  and Mt are known. These include pressure fluctuations, the skewness of velocity gradient, the dilatational dissipation, and spectral distributions. This result, which has been extended to include more complex flows with reacting species, mean shear, bulk viscosity and thermal non-equilibrium, is among the most important in this project as it opens the door for physics-based robust models for turbulence in compressible environments. This is based on the Mt phase plane we introduce in this project which allowed us to identify, for the first time, specific regimes compressible turbulence can be in, which are dominated by distinct physical process.

We demonstrated that scalar spectra collapses under a modified Obukhov-Corrsin scaling where normalization is done using the solenoidal component alone.
