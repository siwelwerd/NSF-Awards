 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many areas of the United States are subject to seasonal and cyclical natural disasters like floods, earthquakes and hurricanes, while all areas may experience technological or human-caused events leading to communications disruptions. Following a disaster, it is essential for professional emergency responders to have a comprehensive understanding of the damage in the community in order to prioritize resources to save lives and protect the environment. Failure to develop an accurate picture of community conditions may lead to ineffective allocation of scarce response and rescue resources. Current technologies used for day-to-day emergency response information gathering from the public, such as 9-1-1 calls and social media, are often disrupted by the disaster?s impact, which may persist for days after an event. One of the key factors enabling a coordinated emergency response and community resilience to disaster is rapid communication from community members such as residents, businesses, schools and hospitals to public safety services about community conditions, such as the location of trapped people, collapsed buildings, fires and hazardous materials accidents, highway damage, and traffic congestion. Robust and resilient communication systems incorporating and enhancing existing technologies are the solution.     \r\n\r\nThe City of San Jose has recognized the likelihood of post-disaster information deficits which can be resolved through increased connectivity of diverse community elements to public safety communications. Recognizing the presence of privately-owned Smart phones throughout the community, the City is seeking an information gathering and dissemination solution that would enable Smart phone users to maintain communication with public safety services even in disaster conditions. San Jose State University, partnered with the San Jose Office of Emergency Services (OES), proposes to develop a novel method for maintaining connectivity for residents to public safety services.   The proposed connectivity and networking technologies will keep citizens connected to vital services and information, and allow them to provide disaster assessment information to public safety agencies. This project will also create a cloud dashboard for emergency responders, and create a comprehensive view of community conditions which leads to an effective emergency response. The prototype system will enable the city's public safety agencies to prioritize emergency response demands and respond quickly, and minimize the catastrophic impact on the City of San Jose and its community and economy. \r\n\r\nThe prevalence of disruptive events across the United States makes the development of a resilient communication solution imperative. The available collaboration with the City of San Jose provides a real-world partner and testbed for new technology applications with nation-wide application potential. As climates change, storms become stronger, sea levels rise, the electricity grid ages and social disruptions increase, time is of the essence for creating a resilient and accessible solution to reliable communication connectivity. This Early Concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) will solve the key challenges that must be tackled to achieve this timeliness and provide strategies and system solutions to spur emergency awareness, management, and preparedness. Finally, all code and data in this project will be released openly, supporting future research, development, and training.\r\n\r\nFirst responders to disasters need a complete picture of the community's status in order to accurately assess the condition of the inhabitants and organize available resources to save lives, protect the environment and prevent further damage in the community. In normal circumstances public safety services rely on 9-1-1 calls and social media to gather information from residents about community conditions. However, under disaster conditions, these normal communication methods will be interrupted, including landline and cell phones, internet connectivity and power. In these circumstances, novel systems must be available to substitute for the lost connectivity, to allow residents to connect to the public safety answering point, and to allow the Emergency Operations Center to collect and aggregate critical information across sectors to ensure that lifesaving operations are conducted expeditiously.\r\n \r\nThe solution to managing risks to disaster-prone communities includes integrating existing technologies, applications, data and e-services in sustainable networks that will support emergency communications even in catastrophic events. This research proposes to develop a community infrastructure for interoperable emergency connectivity that can operate in austere conditions, provide its own power, and create linkages throughout the community and across jurisdictional boundaries. This project will deploy the edge devices in local communities with multi-modal communication modules as well as an external long range radio. The proposed resilient and participatory networking framework on top of the remote edge devices will enable collaborative communication as well as participatory sensing. To solve current deficiencies in the ability of allowing city emergency responders to control and automate the remote edge devices, this project extends existing cloud orchestration frameworks to edge devices that are agnostic to the network media. For this demonstration project, the central cloud deployed in the City of San Jose?s Emergency Operations Center will control the remote edge devices, and be responsible for resilient quality testing, automatic validation, disaster assessment, resource allocation, and the automation of remote edge devices.",

  "por_cntn": "<div class=\"porColContainerWBG\">\n<div class=\"porContentCol\"><p>In this NSF-funded project, we have developed two edge infrastructure nodes with supporting software frameworks to enable the community infrastructure for interoperable emergency connectivity: 1) we developed a community gateway node from scratch for interoperable emergency connectivity, codenamed SJGateway and 2) we developed a new edge infrastructure with multi-modal AI computing capability as well as interoperable connectivity, codenamed SJAIedge. Our developed SJGateway and SJAIedge are designed to work cooperatively to meet various current and future needs of a community infrastructure including multi-modal sensing, localization, smart surveillance, interoperable connectivity, on-board machine learning, low-latency inference, multi-tenant support, high energy efficiency design, and emergency response. Our developed SJGateway and SJAIedge can be potentially deployed in wide areas, for example, utility poles, streets, water lines, buses, trains, and traffic lights. Community stakeholders or smart services providers can all use our system as their infrastructure, providing data, activity, and location awareness. The interoperability feature of our system can help them save their existing investment. For example, our system can interoperate with their current deployed network (WiFi, Ethernet) and IoT solutions (LTE-M, LoRA, Bluetooth 5.0, Zigbee, XBee, 6LoWPAN, sub-1Ghz).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We further deliver the associated software/service frameworks to enable the edge infrastructure. Many existing deployed infrastructures are dedicated to single applications, which leads to inefficient use of the infrastructure and waste of engineering efforts. Our framework is designed to solve the interoperation problems between different infrastructures, protocols, and devices via our designed SJGateway. Different local existing infrastructures (even with different hardware and communication signal) will be connected to the multi-modal connectivity interface of our SJGateway, and then to the IPv6 core network. Our SJGateway will help systems with lost connection route to nearby IPv6 core networks via our multi-modal connectivity interface. We propose software frameworks on top of the remote deployed edge nodes to enable the Infrastructure-as-a-Development-Platform (IaaDP). To solve current deficiencies in the ability to allow developers and researchers to control and automate the remote edge nodes over sparse and intermittent connections, we extend existing cloud orchestration frameworks to edge clusters that are agnostic to the network media. Specifically, we create an edge infrastructure with interoperable connectivity and edge computing as two core services, and propose approaches that automate the deployment, monitoring, and intelligence of distributed multi-tenant applications of students, citizens, companies, and societal organizations.</p>\n<p>Our developed system has been tested in two different scenarios: 1) It was deployed at the roof of the engineering building of SJSU. We integrated our SJGateway, SJAIedge, and long-range WiFi antenna with IP cameras for security surveillance and emergency monitoring applications. Our developed edge infrastructure processes the video feed of the IP camera continuously and sends emergency notifications when an abnormal event has been detected via the onboard processor in our SJAIedge board. This extended project is now sponsored by Cisco. 2) We tested the communication integration at Sacramento Fire District. We worked with fire captains from the Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District, and demonstrate that our gateway device can be used for firefighter monitoring and safety assurance applications. We received the first-round funding from Red-line Safety to fully develop the firefighter sensing and communication system via our developed SJGateway.</p>\n<p>To improve the emergency preparedness of the local community, we developed one emergency mobile app for the residents. We focused on the following key features: alerting the users when an emergency happens; allowing users to send SOS messages over long-range radio; interactive alert reporting with chatting assistance, and emergency information recommendation for residents. Users can plug one external radio to their smartphone via the USB interface. When the normal communication interface is not working, our developed mobile App will send emergency messages through the long-range radio to reach remote SJGateway nodes and deliver the message to first responders.</p>\n<p>We also conducted a line of research with undergraduate and graduate students that focuses on the practical application of knowledge and skills through labs, real-world projects, and scientific research experiences. Here, students have the opportunity to participate in research as it is performed in reality, and not just read about its results in textbooks or walk through canned laboratory assignments whose outcomes are known in advance. Three new courses have also been created based on the result of this project. We also created a dedicated website to host the results and learning materials of this project: http://kaikailiu.cmpe.sjsu.edu/sjgateway/. The developed system serves as a learning kit and helps students extend concepts acquired in classes to active research settings, and gain a holistic understanding of disciplines.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 04/29/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Kaikai&nbsp;Liu</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1637371/1637371_10447346_1556594000330_SJgatewaycase--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1637371/1637371_10447346_1556594000330_SJgatewaycase--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"SJGateway with case\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1637371/1637371_10447346_1556594000330_SJgatewaycase--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"SJGateway with case\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Our developed SJGateway with the solar panel case and external antenna</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Kaikai Liu</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Kaikai&nbsp;Liu</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">SJGateway with case</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1637371/1637371_10447346_1556594138830_edgecomputingnodeprint--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1637371/1637371_10447346_1556594138830_edgecomputingnodeprint--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"SJAIEdge\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1637371/1637371_10447346_1556594138830_edgecomputingnodeprint--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"SJAIEdge\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Our developed edge infrastructure node with multi-modal AI computing capability as well as interoperable connectivity</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Kaikai Liu</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Kaikai&nbsp;Liu</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">SJAIEdge</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1637371/1637371_10447346_1556593915479_SJGatewayprint2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1637371/1637371_10447346_1556593915479_SJGatewayprint2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"SJGateway\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1637371/1637371_10447346_1556593915479_SJGatewayprint2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"SJGateway\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Our developed community gateway node for interoperable emergency connectivity</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Kaikai Liu</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Kaikai&nbsp;Liu</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">SJGateway</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1637371/1637371_10447346_1556595299281_smartphoneradionew--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1637371/1637371_10447346_1556595299281_smartphoneradionew--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Smartphone with external radio\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1637371/1637371_10447346_1556595299281_smartphoneradionew--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Smartphone with external radio\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Users can plugin one external radio to their smartphone, our developed mobile App will send emergency messages through the long-range radio to reach remote SJGateway nodes and deliver the message to first responders.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Kaikai Liu</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Kaikai&nbsp;Liu</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Smartphone with external radio</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
