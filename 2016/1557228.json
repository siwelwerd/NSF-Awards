 "awd_abstract_narration": "Animal behavior is affected by an individual's internal conditions. For example, as animals feed, their strategies for acquiring food changes. The impact of food odors has a very different effect on a hungry person than one who has just had a large meal. This project brings together laboratories from the Case Western Reserve University Biology department and the Cleveland Museum of Natural History to examine changes in hunting strategy that occur as praying mantises feed. The biology laboratory will examine changes in brain systems that control movement as the insect feeds or receives injections of hormones associated with feeding. Insects provide advantages for monitoring brain activity for long feeding periods. Results will demonstrate how brain systems that are altered by hormones associated with feeding affect hunting and will increase our general understanding of the mechanisms by which hormonal changes alter animal behavior. The museum laboratory will expand the study to a wider range of praying mantis species. The project also has a unique educational component. Project related material will be developed into new high- and middle-school teaching modules for the Cleveland Museum of Natural History's award winning distance learning program, which has reached thousands of students in 48 states. These programs align with Ohio's New Learning Standards. Modules will be offered for free for the duration of the project and 3 subsequent years.\r\n\r\nThe project focuses on the highly structured central complex insect brain region that has received much recent attention. Numerous forms of sensory information coupled with motor effects and the presence of behaviorally relevant neuromodulators imply an important role for the central complex in behavioral adaptation. Yet, no study has brought all these components together to demonstrate how these brain circuits generate context dependent adjustments in natural behavior. This project seeks do that by relating changes in praying mantis hunt strategies to central complex activity patterns recorded by multi-channel tetrode implants as the hunt takes place in one generalist and two specialist praying mantis species. Tetrode wires will be implanted in the insect's central complex. Then after recovery the subject will be moved to an arena where it hunts either live prey (cockroach nymphs) or artificial prey (moving dots on a computer screen that makes up the floor of the arena). The artificial stimulus allows repeated trials to provide quantitative data on neural activity associated with hunting. Neural and behavioral changes will be documented as physiological state is modified by feeding or insulin injection. Comparative studies will clarify how evolution acts on brain structures to shape behavior for specific niches. Successful completion will be transformative both in our understanding of the central complex's role in behavioral adjustment and, more generally, in defining mechanisms by which brain regions in all animals can alter adaptive behavior, thereby establishing the praying mantis as a new general model for behavioral selection.",

Far from the automatons that many people think of, insects must adjust their behaviors relative to a range of internal and external conditions. In this project, we examined the role of a brain region called the central complex in directing the praying mantis?s hunting. This may seem straightforward. The mantis sees prey, stalks it and then attacks and eats it. But we found it not to be so simple. If the mantis had not eaten for several days, it stalked distant prey (fig. 1). However, after feeding, that distance diminished. This effect could be mimicked by injecting insulin into starved mantises (fig. 2).</p>\n<p>We then recorded from the central complex during hunting and found cells that responded to prey movements. The hunting seen in figure 3 shows frames from a mantis hunting a cockroach nymph. The graph in B shows the prey movements and the activity level of a single neuron in the central complex. Initially, the neuron increases activity associated with the mantis?s movements. But when the mantis focused on its prey, the unit switched to monitoring the prey?s movements. The frames in part D show the mantis targeting a nymph that is on its back struggling to right itself. As it struggles the neuron fires with the prey?s leg movements (lines on the bottom of the frame indicated timing of neural spikes). The prey then stops in the second frame and the unit goes silent. Unfortunately for the prey (but fortunately for the mantis) the prey starts struggling again in the third frame and the neuron again starts firing, guiding the mantis?s stalking movements toward a successful attack.</p>\n<p>We next used simulated prey to quantify distance and angles around the mantis?s head to which individual neurons attend. We were able to generate maps for numerous central complex cells that showed specific distances and angles around the mantis?s head to which each neuron responded. Other cells fired just before the mantis turned suggesting that they could control its stalking movements. Finally, stimulating through the electrodes typically generated similar turns.&nbsp; Thus, the central complex contains neural circuits that could control stalking. Preliminary recordings indicated that insulin could alter these neuron?s firing characteristics. Hence the feeding effect could alter stalking through insulin induced changes in these circuits.</p>\n<p>Are there other factors that could alter hunting. Yes, we looked at a range of variables. We found that a rectangle moving back and forth on a screen in front of the mantis evoked attack movements, while a rapidly expanding disk generated defensive retreat. This looming image mimics a predator closing in on a prey. The mantis is not only a predator, but also a prey and must consider the dangers of hunting against being hunted. While the looming stimulus typically generates a defensive movement, immediately after an aggressive strike, the looming stimulus either fails to evoke any movement or the mantis tries to push the image away. This suggests that having just attacked, the mantis is not in a mood to retreat at all and may actually fight the other aggressor.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Other factors include sex (females are more aggressive than males) and age (they are most aggressive in a 5 ? 25-day period after they become adults). Finally, the environment in which they were raised affects their adult behavior. Mantises that were raisedcompletely in the lab were less aggressive than wild caught individuals. The lab reared mantises were isolated at a young age due to their unfortunate cannibalistic tendency. They were then fed and watered regularly. The individuals that grew up in the wild had to fend for themselves for food and deal with other predators. In the 5 - 25-day aggressive period for these two groups, the lab reared individuals would note the target more often during this period and turn toward the prey. But they might not actually strike. In contrast, the individuals raised in the wild immediately struck at the target. Thus, it seemed like the lab reared individuals who had an easy life growing up were ?couch potatoes?.
