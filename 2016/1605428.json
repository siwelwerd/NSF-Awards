 "awd_abstract_narration": "CBET - 1605283/1605428\r\nPI: Morris, Jeffrey F./Chakraborty, Bulbul\r\n\r\nThis collaborative project comprises computational and theoretical studies of the flow of suspensions consisting of solid particles in liquids. The project focuses on concentrated suspensions, where particles occupy more than half of the mixture volume. These are often called dense suspensions, and they are found in application as cement, concrete, and mineral ore slurries.  Dense suspensions can change properties suddenly when flow conditions change.  In some cases, as the strength of the flow, or shear rate, increases, the mixture can suddenly exhibit an extremely large increase in flow resistance, a phenomenon known as \"discontinuous shear thickening\" (DST).  The flow can even stop, which is known as \"shear jamming.\" DST can have major negative effects on industrial processes involving the mixtures.  While DST has been known for many years, it has not been explained.  The goal of this project is to determine why this phenomenon happens, which could provide guidance how to design suspensions and processing operations to diminish negative effects of DST.  Results of the research will be used in modules that will enable high school students to visualize how many-particle systems result in large-scale behavior, such as DST in cornstarch suspensions, where small grains of starch cause enormous changes in flow properties.\r\n\r\nThe project will explore recent observations that DST can be explained by particle contacts and friction.  The work will explore the structure of networks of forces between the particles and how this structure changes as the flow rate is increased to a level causing abrupt changes in properties.  In particular, the team will explore whether the flow property transition has the characteristics of a phase transition through simulations of discrete particles in different flows and applications of theoretical concepts from statistical physics.  The role of the liquid will be considered by comparing results with the behavior of dry granular systems in which the force network concept and its relation to jamming have been examined by others.  This work will probe the relationship of flow-induced property changes to thermodynamic phase transitions and will establish the similarities and differences between different particulate flows.   Because solid-liquid mixtures are commonly used in industry and are found in geophysical settings such as mud flows, the project will significantly expand our ability to understand and ultimately predict the dynamics of these complicated systems in important applications.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nImages of people running on vats of cornstarch and sinking when they stop abound on the web (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4xkvCcAers).  Transient solidification of such dense suspensions belongs to a broader class of phenomena where shearing granular materials and dense suspensions of large particles at high rates leads to solidification or a sharp rise in their viscosity.  These phenomena are counterintuitive:  our experience with every day solid materials ranging from plastics to metallic glasses show that strong shear leads to failure.  Scientists have been studying yielding and plastic failure for centuries.  Shear-induced jamming or thickening has a relatively recent history of being investigated in depth.  Our work, funded by this NSF grant, has been focused on constructing a predictive theory for this class of phenomena.\n\n \n\nStudies over the last decade have shown that shear jamming and discontinuous shear thickening, where the viscosity jumps by orders of magnitude, is triggered by the creation of contacts between macroscopic particles that have poorly characterized surface properties.  For example, roughness leads to friction but minute details of the surface roughness could change the friction coefficient and cause it to vary from particle to particle.  Constructing a theory of the collective behavior of such systems poses unprecedented challenges since the interactions at the microscopic level are ?noisy? and often extremely sensitive to external driving.\n\n \n\nOur approach to this class of systems has been to focus on the constraints imposed on a system.  For example, in the you tube videos of corn-starch suspensions, every particle is in force and torque balance.  As a person runs on the suspension, the particles have to organize in structures that balance the forces and torques exerted by the person and the internal forces and torques.  The question that we have to address then is what types of structures and ?how many? of them are available as the person runs fast or slow ?  What determines which of these constrained structures are chosen ?  This type of approach has led to fundamental understanding of other condensed matter systems, notably frustrated magnets.  We have adopted and adapted these tools from condensed matter theory to construct a theory of the collective behavior of suspensions such as corn starch and of static granular media. The success of our approach has been illustrated by a predictive theory of discontinuous shear thickening (Phys. Rev. Lett. 121, 128002 (2018)) and a theory of elasticity of amorphous solids that is based on constraints rather than broke symmetry (Phys. Rev. Lett. 125, 118002 (2020)).\n\n \n\nThe simulation and theoretical developments from this work have fundamentally altered the way that researchers in this field conceive of the interactions between particles. In particular,  a robust theoretical framework  that starts from the perspective of constraint satisfaction rather than details of interactions has provided a new path forward.  This is indicated by the interest in the area of dense suspensions exhibited by contributors to the recent J. Rheology special issue (March 2020) followed by a 300-person attendance over two days at a virtual symposium to discuss the papers in this issue, and the plenary lecture at StatPhys2019.  Our efforts have truly ?moved the needle? and caused a convergence of diverse communities to transform the understanding of suspension mechanics. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/27/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Bulbul Chakraborty"
