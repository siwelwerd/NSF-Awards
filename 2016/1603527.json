A number of distinguished mathematicians have agreed to attend and speak at this conference. The award gives early career researchers, researchers who are members of underrepresented groups, researchers not funded by NSF a chance to attend and participate in this conference.  The organizing committee will strive to make this funding opportunity known to target groups through a number of different activities.

The school was aimed at senior undergraduate and beginning graduate students and was organized by the mathematics faculty at Universite Laval and the University of South Florida in Tampa. The goal of the school was to give an overview of a selection of topics from Spectral Theory, interpreted in a broad sense. It covered topics from pure and applied mathematics.  At the summer school, there were six mini-courses, complemented by supervised  computer  labs  and exercise sessions. In addition, five invited speakers gave hour-long specialized talks.

Supporting the travel of promising undergraduate and graduate students to such an event where scientists from North America, Europe and Asia, old and young, prominent and just beginning, were essentially spending 24 hours together in an inspiring and congenial environment, discussing appealing and important problems in mathematics and physics, certainly encouraged many younger students to pursue some of these topics in their future research.\n\nThe subject matter covered by the topics of the school incorporated a broad territory between analysis, numerical and applied mathematics, and physics, as is evidenced by the work of all the teachers of the mini-courses.
