 "awd_abstract_narration": "The nervous system is one of our most important organs.  It senses our surrounds, enables us to respond to stimuli with complex motor behaviors, and provides us with cognitive and emotional capacity. To improve our understanding of nervous system development, this project uses a vertebrate animal model to study how a specific group of nuclear proteins affect genes expressed in the nervous system. These proteins regulate how DNA is packaged.  Thus, they control the transition of DNA from a tightly packed form to loosely packed form, and consequently from inaccessible to accessible for subsequent gene transcription. Mistakes in these proteins can result in defective structure or function of the nervous system. This project will explain how these proteins function, and what parts of the nervous system they regulate.  This project will be performed by students, including summer high school and college students, thus providing an excellent opportunity to train the next generation of scientists. \r\n\r\nThis project investigates how distinct epigenetic factors regulate neural and neural crest development in vertebrates, and how they do so in collaboration with transcription factors and other nuclear proteins. Epigenetic factors regulate gene expression by modulating chromatin structures, often via histone modification and DNA methylation. Epigenetic mechanisms are known to be crucial in stem cell maintenance and differentiation, but their roles in neural development during vertebrate embryogenesis are not understood in depth.  ChIP-sequencing analysis will be performed to map the changing epigenetic landscapes in developing neural tissues in early Xenopus embryos, and proteomics studies will be conducted to identify nuclear binding partners of the specific epigenetic factors HP1 and SETD8, two proteins that are often associated with repressive chromatin structure. The project will then examine the function and the crosstalk of three epigenetic pathways: the polycomb repressive complexes, the histone H3K9 methylation/HP1 cascade, and the histone H4K20 methylation pathway. Results from these studies will help shed light on how epigenetic mechanisms influence neural specification, differentiation and morphogenesis to control proper formation of the nervous system in vertebrate embryos.",

Knockdown of HP1b results in expansion of Oct25 domain and inhibition of cell fate transition from precursor to more differentiated states.  Simultaneous knockdown of HP1b and Oct25 partially rescues the defects in neural and neural crest marker expression.  Knockdown of the PRC2 component ezh2 result in similar marker defects and expansion of Oct25 domain as knockdown of HP1b does.  Some of the results are shown in Figure 1.\n\n \n\n2) We showed that the transcription factor Hic1, which can interact with the polycomb repressive complex 2, regulates neural crest cell migration but not its specification.  Knockdown of hic1 leads to craniofacial defects.  The canonical Wnt signaling was upregulated in neural crest explants and cadherin expression was dysregulated.  The data suggest that hic1 modulates neural crest development via the Wnt signaling.  Some of the results are shown in Figure 2.\n\n \n\n3) We showed that the key components of the COMPASS H3K4 methylation complex, dyp30 and ash2l, regulates late neural and neural crest markers, but knockdown of these components does not affect early neural or neural plate border gene expression.

Future experiments are aimed at understanding the underlying molecular mechanisms in more detail.

The grant allowed training of 1 postdoctoral fellow, 1 graduate student, and 4 undergraduate students.

We have attended and presented data at multiple meetings.  I have sent my postdoctoral fellow to the Xenopus course at CSHL and the Teaching Developmental Biology workshop in Maine to enhance her career development.  She is currently on the job market seeking a position in a liberal art college to engage in teaching and research and education of the next generation of scientists.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/23/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Chenbei Chang"
