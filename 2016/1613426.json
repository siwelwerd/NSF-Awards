 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award funds research on an extensive dataset that will provide firm tests of the types of stars that end their life as Type Ia supernovae.  The researchers will recalibrate data to higher precision and gain a better understanding of systematic errors and uncertainties.  Results from this work will help provide tests of general relativity and improve our understanding of dark energy.  Graduate students and postdoctoral researchers will be trained and mentored in research. Public outreach programs incorporating research results will be carried out at the home institutions of the PIs. The final reduced data will be made available to the astronomical community. \r\n\r\nThis project will be accomplished by completing data reduction of optical and near-infrared wavelength images to produce final light curves of supernova explosions. They will also complete data reduction of near-infrared spectra of supernova explosions with an emphasis on improved removal of telluric absorption. They will produce new spectral templates for the community, analyze host galaxy properties, and produce Hubble diagrams. Finally, they will compare theory with observation and look for evidence of interaction with non-degenerate companions or circumstellar material. They will also probe the explosion physics as a function of luminosity and light curve decline rate. The dataset will also be used to improve the precision of using supernova Type Ia data as distance indicators for constraining the nature of dark energy.",

Leveraging the discovery by Henrietta Swan Leavitt that a class of variable stars -- Cepheid variables -- could be used to measure relative distances, as well as the newly built 100-inch diameter Hooker telescope at Mount Wilson Observatory, Hubble conclusively showed that the Andromeda nebula was in fact a galaxy like our own Milky-Way. He then went on to show that the farther away a galaxy is from us, the faster it appears to be moving away:&nbsp; the famous Hubble law. He didn't know it at the time, but this observation is precisely what is expected in an expanding universe described by Einstein's General Theory of Relativity (GR). Not only that, but thanks to GR, by measuring the slope of the Hubble law, we can infer the age of the universe. This slope -- what we now call the Hubble constant -- is therefore an important measurement to make in cosmology!</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To make the measurement as accurate as possible, we want to repeat Hubble's experiment with galaxies that are farther away, so that the expansion velocity is large compared to the random motions the galaxies possess due to the clumpy nature of the universe. Not only that, thanks to the finite speed of light, as we look to galaxies that are farther and farther away, we see them as they were further and further into the past. GR tells us that the expansion rate of the universe is not constant:&nbsp; gravity is trying to pull the galaxies together. If we look far enough away and therefore far enough back in time, we can actually measure this change in the expansion rate and measure how much \"stuff\" is in the universe. But for all this, we need brighter standard candles.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Type Ia supernovae are such a standard candle. They are one of the most energetic explosions in the universe and can be seen much farther away than Cepheid variables. By measuring how bright they look in our telescopes and comparing that with how bright they really are, we can infer a distance. However, it was determined early on that not all type Ia supernovae are the same: some fade more slowly than others and some appear to be redder than others. Astronomers, including the CSP's Mark Phillips, determined that the type Ia's that fade more slowly are intrinsically brighter than fast fading ones and the redder ones are dimmer than the blue ones. The color effect is primarily due to interstellar dust grains that preferentially absorb blue light. All these effects need to be taken into account in order to get the most precise distances possible. As a result, type Ia supernova distances were used to show that the universe's expansion is not slowing down, but is in fact speeding up. This discovery seems to indicate there isn't just normal \"stuff\" in the universe, but something else that acts repulsively as an anti-gravity, which we have named Dark Energy.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The CSP's goal has been to make the type Ia supernova distance ladder as precise as possible, thereby improving the accuracy of cosmological experiments like measuring the Hubble constant and constraining the properties of Dark Energy. Furthermore, we need to better understand the physics of these explosions in order to determine if they could change over cosmic time and mimic the effects of Dark Energy. The CSP-I project was a first attempt to do so and ran between 2004 and 2010, using the facilities at Las Campanas Observatory in Chile. This project, CSP-II, built on its success and went further out into the universe.

CSP-II nearly doubled the number of supernovae and their average distances, thereby improving the accuracy with which we can measure the Hubble constant. The small red box in the CSP-I Hubble diagram corresponds to the limits of Hubble's original 1929 diagram, which only had about 20 distances.
