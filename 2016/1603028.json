 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will investigate the locations of auroral breakup events with respect to the large-scale electric current system connecting the magnetosphere and ionosphere. This framework of large-scale field-aligned currents is created as a result of the interaction between the Earth's magnetic field and the solar wind.  The closure of these field-aligned currents through the polar ionosphere is responsible for the auroral oval.  Another consequence of the interaction with the solar wind is the extremely stretched magnetic field lines on the nightside of the Earth that form an extended magnetotail.  The stretching increases until the energy stored in the magnetic fields is released explosively and the stretching decreases.  During this time, the electric current across the magnetotail is disrupted and shunted through the high-latitude ionosphere forming the substorm current wedge.   This stretching-release-recovery cycle is called a substorm.  The interval during which the stretching increases is called the substorm growth phase; the explosive energy release is an element of the substorm expansion phase (or auroral breakup). The auroral breakup begins with a brightening of an existing arc near midnight close to the lower latitude edge of the auroral oval.  This is followed by an initially localized region of bright and rapidly varying auroras that spreads westward and poleward with time.  The auroral breakup is thought to be associated with the upward current leg of the substorm current wedge.  This study answers important questions about the connection between the large-scale current systems and the disturbed substorm currents associated with the auroral breakup using satellite observations of global field-aligned electric currents and ground-based observations of auroras and geomagnetic field disturbances.  An important element of this project is the unique global view enabled by new data products.  The project will have significant broader impacts.  Summer interns including high school science students and teachers will be involved in the research, receiving training on automatic identification of auroral break-up candidates and other aspects of the research.  In the longer term, an increased understanding of explosive space weather disturbances in the vicinity of Earth will improve forecasting capabilities of value to a technology-dependent society.\r\n\r\nThe primary objective is to determine how auroral breakups relate to the global magnetospheric current systems.  The methodology consists of case studies and statistical correlations of auroral breakup timing and location relative to the current systems.  This study is only now possible because of the groundbreaking development by the NSF-NASA AMPERE program of global maps of field-aligned currents on a ten-minute cadence utilizing existing engineering magnetometers onboard 66 commercial Iridium communications satellites.  These maps will be combined with ground-based maps of geomagnetic field perturbations from the NSF-NASA-ESA supported SuperMAG Program, which is a worldwide collaboration of organizations and national agencies that currently operate more than 300 ground based magnetometers.  SuperMAG turns these observations into global maps of magnetic field disturbances and other parameters that measure the level of geomagnetic activity.  Finally, auroral breakup images will be obtained from 20 THEMIS ground-based All Sky Imagers (ASIs) distributed across the entire North American polar region (some stations funded by NSF).",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe terrestrial magnetosphere stores a part of energy carried from the sun by the solar wind and suddenly release it as an auroral substorm.  It causes not only an explosive enhancement of auroral emission on the night side but also a current system, substorm current wedge, which links the magnetosphere with the ionosphere, and its ionospheric segment, auroral electrojet, causes magnetic disturbances on the ground.  The trigger mechanism of auroral substorm has been a mystery since the discovery of this phenomenon more than 50 years ago.  Whereas the development of auroral substorms reveals a recurrent pattern, the onset location changes from event to event.  The goal of this project is to understand the location of their onsets, auroral breakup, in terms of a structure of the magnetosphere-ionosphere system, especially, a structure of ionospheric convection.\n\nBy combining various data sets such as ground magnetometer data, satellite and ground auroral images, and radar measurements of ionospheric convection flows, we conducted both event-based and statistical studies of auroral substorms.  The following are major scientific outcomes of this project:\n\n1. The substorm current wedge is a coherent large-scale current system rather than an ensemble of meso-scale current systems named ?wedgelets?, which form as an earthward flow is decelerated in the near-Earth magnetosphere.\n\n2. During substorms, midlatitude ground magnetic field changes in correlation with the maximum intensity of the auroral electrojet not only on the night side but also on the day side.  This result also supports the idea that the substorm wedge current is a coherent large-scale current system.\n\n3. Occasionally more than one auroral substorm takes place simultaneously, which strongly suggests that the substorm initiation is a local process, and it does not have a global reference frame.\n\n4. Equatorward ionospheric flows, which are known to often take place prior to auroral breakups, turns both eastward and westward as they approach a pre-existing auroral arc.  In some events an auroral breakup occurs at the eastward-turning branch, but in other events it occurs at the westward-turning branch breakups.  Since the zonal divergence of ionospheric flow can be considered as an ionospheric manifestation of the braking of an earthward magnetospheric flow, this result indicates that the flow braking itself is not a direct cause of auroral breakups.\n\nThese results place important observational constraints on modeling the substorm initiation process and subsequent development.  The original studies were published in peer-reviewed journals as listed in the annual and final reports.\n\n \n\nIn addition to these scientific researches we made the following contributions to the geospace community;\n\n1. We created a list of substorm onsets and provided it to SuperMAG.  The list is now available through their website.  Selection of substorm onsets is usually a most time-consuming step for statistically examining substorms, and hopefully the list will make future such studies easier.\n\n2. The project members actively participated in GEM-related activities. The PI co-chaired a GEM focus group, and a Co-I served as a Research Area Coordinator as a member of the GEM steering committee.   \n\n3.
