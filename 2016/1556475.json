 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will study the beginning of anatomical knowledge when skeletons were objects of intensive study by scientists and artists, in order to document how modern ideas of anatomy and physiology emerged.  The project will trace how the skeleton's meaning has been defined by social, political, and religious attitudes toward the body in order to contribute to current debates about the exhibition and repatriation of human remains.\r\n\r\nThis project will examine the making, representing, marketing, displaying, and collecting of human bones and skeletons. This project will study evidence from scientific and popular written sources as well as archaeological evidence to contribute to discussions in the history of science and medicine, art history, archaeology, and historical anthropology. Findings of this project will be dissemination in a book, open - access databases on early modern anatomy and collecting, and a conference on human remains and their deposition. The work will broaden our understanding of the range of practices of early modern life sciences and their close connections to religion and popular culture. In addition, it will enrich the historiography of early modern science and expand its resource base with the inclusion of material artifacts.",

The focus of my work has been on making and collecting skeletons in the period 1500-1800, as well as on the interpretation of fossil skeletons in the same years.&nbsp; My research has included the examination of both manuscript and print materials in Great Britain, France, Germany, and the Netherlands, as well as anatomical and natural history collections in these countries.&nbsp; The main research materials are primary sources including rare books, manuscript materials such as correspondence, reports, and drawings, and ephemeral materials such as newspapers.&nbsp; Secondary sources are drawn from history, art history, history of science and medicine, archaeology, and forensic and historical anthropology.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus far I have published three articles and one translation from 18<sup>th</sup>-century French into English: an essay review on the &ldquo;material turn&rdquo; in the history of early modern life science, an essay on the early modern skeleton for a volume of <em>Oxford Philosophical Concepts</em>, and an essay on the anatomical collections of eighteenth-century physician William Hunter.&nbsp; I will shortly submit another article (on making skeletons) to a scholarly journal, and have another in preparation, as well as a proposal for a book on giant fossil bones and national identity in the period before 1800.&nbsp; Since 2016, I have delivered eleven lectures on aspects of this topic to scholarly and general audiences in the US, the UK, Canada, Australia, and Brazil.&nbsp; My work on skeletons has been featured in the popular online journal <em>Atlas Obscura</em>, which gets one million page views a week, as well as on my own blog and website. &nbsp;I have also recently started a Facebook page on &ldquo;The Skeleton Project.&rdquo;&nbsp; I have received two residential fellowships for the period from February to June of 2019, at the Camargo Foundation in Cassis, France and at the Descartes Center at the University of Utrecht in the Netherlands, where I will work on articles and the book manuscript.&nbsp; The research I accomplished with the assistance of the NSF grant allowed me to obtain this additional funding from European sources.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the help of a graduate student assistant funded by the NSF grant, I have compiled a bibliography of early modern anatomy texts, with an emphasis on osteology.&nbsp; This will soon be posted to the Oregon State University open access website, ScholarsArchive@OSU, for public use by scholars.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The accompanying images highlight aspects of my project: The broadsheet &ldquo;Richard Helain Skeleton&rdquo; from 1493 is the first printed scientific representation of the human skeleton. &nbsp;The illustration of the skeleton from <em>De humani corporis fabrica </em>(on the fabric of the human body, 1543) by the Flemish anatomist Andreas Vesalius (1514-1564) &nbsp;became the model for countless illustrations over the next two centuries and remains an iconic image today.&nbsp; Legends of giants in the distant past seemed to be confirmed when large fossil bones were found; William Camden (1551-1623) illustrated such a scene at Stonehenge in his best-selling <em>Britannia</em>, first published in Latin in 1586.&nbsp; The physician and naturalist Edward Tyson (1651-1708) dissected a chimpanzee in 1698 and compared its anatomy to that of other known primates, including humans. &nbsp;The pioneering French paleontologist Georges Cuvier (1769-1832) laid to rest the notion of 30-foot-tall humans in the past when he employed fossil bones previously thought to be human to reconstruct the skeletons of mastodons, mammoths and other prehistoric mammals.&nbsp; Mastodons and mammoths captured the imagination of the public.&nbsp; The Philadelphia artist and naturalist Charles Willson Peale (1741-1827) reconstructed a mastodon skeleton from bones found in Newburgh, New York, and displayed it in his museum.&nbsp;
