 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award from the Chemistry of Life Processes Program within the Chemistry Division is funding Dr. Bruce E. Bowler\u00a0from the University of Montana to investigate how changes in the three-dimensional structure of a protein known as cytochrome c changes its function from a protein that moves electron around to one that speeds up the reaction of membrane lipids (fats) with hydrogen peroxide. This latter, so-called, peroxidase activity provides an early signal in important biochemical pathways. This project will also provide training for undergraduate student and graduate students in a broad array of structural, biochemical and biophysical methods. As part of this project, Dr. Bowler and his students are developing hands-on curricular materials, effective in low resource environments, to enhance STEM education at tribal schools in collaboration with the spectrUM science center in Missoula. \r\n\r\nThe hypotheses for the research to be carried out derive from a novel X-ray diffraction structure of yeast iso-1-cytochrome c bound to the detergent CYMAL-6. In the presence of CYMAL-6, iso-1-cytochrome c crystallizes as a domain-swapped dimer with CYMAL-6 bound in a pocket placing its hydrocarbon chain next to the heme iron. Dr. Bowler's lab is testing the hypothesis that this dimeric structure is important for peroxidase activity by measuring the peroxidase activity of monomeric versus dimeric cytochrome c, determining the ability of cardiolipin nanodiscs to catalyze the formation of dimer, and also testing the ability of lipid analogs to stabilize the dimer. Crystallization and structural studies with different lipid analogs also is being attempted to more fully define the lipid binding pocket of the dimer. The work is being carried out with three evolutionally diverse forms of cytochrome c, those of yeast, spider monkey and human. The effects of mutations to two surface loops near the lipid binding pocket, on the accessibility of the binding pocket and the peroxidase activity of cytochrome c also is being investigated to determine how evolution from yeast to humans has optimized cytochrome c for peroxidase activity. Finally the dimeric structure of cytochrome c indicates that a broad group of lysine residues control the electrostatic binding of cytochrome c to cardiolipin. Binding studies on cytochrome c variants with these lysines eliminated is being conducted to determine the extent of the electrostatic docking site on the surface of cytochrome c.",

A primary function of cytochrome <em>c</em> is as an electron shuttle in the electron transport chain the primary biochemical pathway that produces and stores the energy needed for life. Cytochrome <em>c</em> also functions as a signaling agent in the intrinsic pathway of programmed cell death pathway (apoptosis), which controls growth and development of complex organisms.

Cytochrome <em>c</em> is an ancient protein that plays a central role in many aspects of life and death. To perform its multiplicity of functions, cytochrome <em>c</em> must be able to access alternate structures. The structure used for electron transport has a methionine amino acid at sequence position 80 (Met80) bound to the iron atom of the heme cofactor of cytochrome <em>c</em>. To act as a peroxidase so that it can oxygenate the mitochrondrial lipid, cardiolipin, in the early stages of apoptosis, the bond between Met80 and the heme iron atom of cytochrome <em>c</em> must be broken.

Furthermore, this project showed that while cytochrome <em>c</em> undergoes a two-step structural change when it binds to the outer convex surface of cardiolipin liposomes, the structural change occurs in a single step on the inner concave surface of cardiolipin liposomes (Image 2).

The results of this project also showed that the heme of dimeric cytochrome <em>c</em> can be blocked by a lysine amino acid near cellular pH, switching off peroxidase activity and also diminishing the binding of the dimer to cardiolipin containing membranes. Thus, changes in cellular pH within mitochondria could be used as a switch to control the onset of apoptosis if it is mediated by dimeric cytochrome <em>c</em>.</p>\n<p>This project also showed that specific amino acids in two surface loops that control access to the heme have evolved from yeast to mammals to decrease the intrinsic peroxidase activity of cytochrome <em>c</em> so that it can better act as a switch that turns on apoptosis.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Broader Impacts</em></strong><em>:</em> Five undergraduate and five graduate students received training in molecular biology, protein expression and purification, and the biophysical and structural biology methods necessary to characterize the structural and functional properties of alternate conformers of cytochrome <em>c</em>. These students developed the writing and presentation skills necessary to communicate their science to the scientific community. Three of these graduate students completed PhD degrees. All three are currently pursuing postdoctoral studies. Another graduate student completed a MS degree and is currently employed by a pharmaceutical company. One of the undergraduate students completed an MPH degree after graduation. Another is pursuing a PhD. The others are still working toward their degrees. Twelve articles have been published in the peer-reviewed literature by this cohort of students. Three of these publications included undergraduate co-authors. Thus, significant human resource development of scientific professionals has been supported by this grant. The grant has also supported an outreach project for the spectrUM Discovery Area science museum in Missoula, Montana that involved development of an interactive application loaded onto iPads that leads museum visitors through the relationship between protein structure and function and introduces the concept that proteins often undergo structural changes in the course of carrying out their functions.
