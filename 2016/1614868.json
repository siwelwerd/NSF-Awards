 "awd_abstract_narration": "The team will study the jets of material that have been observed to emerge from supermassive black holes toward the center of some galaxies.  They will observe these surprisingly narrow jets at millimeter wavelengths.  The team will use Earth-spanning telescopes to achieve exquisite angular resolution.  They will study the shapes of the jets and the plasma that surrounds the jets.  They will also make computer simulations of the jets to help interpret the observations.  Undergraduates will be involved in the research.  The team will train high school students recruited from the Arecibo Observatory Space Academy in Puerto Rico.  Visiting graduate students will obtain hands-on experience with instrumentation.\r\n\r\nThe team will use very long baseline interferometry at millimeter wavelengths to image distant jets with extremely-high angular resolution.  Their chief tool is the cutting-edge Event Horizon Telescope.  Their goals are to (1) study the acceleration and collimation zones of the jets, (2) study the plasmas within which the jets propagate, and (3) conduct magnetohydrodynamic simulations of jets as a framework for interpreting (1) and (2).",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nUnder this award, we developed new imaging software for radio astronomy and used it to study the powerful jets originating around supermassive black holes in the centers of galaxies.  Our work has applications ranging from Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) images to lower-frequency very long baseline interferometry and next-generation arrays.\n\nWe developed the Sparse Modeling Imaging Library for Interferometry (SMILI), which is freely available on github.  SMILI uses modern methods of mathematically favoring natural image reconstructions from limited interferometry data.  These methods allow the user to produce sharper images than standard imaging techniques.  SMILI was one of the methods used to produce the first images of a black hole, Messier 87 (M87), on horizon scales with the EHT.\n\nWe used SMILI to image the jets around other supermassive black holes.  Of particular interest are questions about the roles of magnetic fields and surrounding material in launching and collimating these jets.  Our techniques show that the jet in Centaurus A is much brighter at its edges, even down very close to the black hole.  The jet appears similar to that of M87 despite the fact that the Centaurus A black hole is much less massive than that of M87.\n\nWe observed jets from radio galaxies and more powerful quasars across the radio spectrum using multiple ground-based interferometric arrays and RadioAstron in space.  We find significant commonalities in jet morphology over a wide range of jet power.\n\nOur imaging technique can leverage the power of already powerful instruments to increase their resolving power even further. Application of SMILI to real ALMA observations of a protoplanetary disk demonstrates an improvement in angular resolution equivalent to increasing the size of the array by a factor of three, relative to conventional imaging methods.  Simulations of ngVLA observations of stellar disks point to similar improvements in resolution and image fidelity.\n\nTraining the next generation of scientists is an important element of any NSF award.  This award supported the participation of two postdoctoral scholars and a total of ten undergraduates who conducted summer research with us.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/15/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Vincent L Fish"
