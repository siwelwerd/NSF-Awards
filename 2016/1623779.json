 "awd_abstract_narration": "Through the project titled \"An Institutional Model for Increasing Student Engagement through Course-embedded Undergraduate Research Experiences,\" investigators at Georgia Gwinnett College will build upon a pilot project - Four Year Undergraduate Research and Creative Experience (4YrURCE) - to increase knowledge about the relationships between research and student outcomes such as improved learning and increased career interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines.  They will do this by supplementing traditional faculty-mentored research and classroom instruction with Course-embedded Undergraduate Research Experiences (CUREs).  Each Course-embedded Undergraduate Research Experience (CURE) will provide a scaffolding of research skills, creative abilities, and core content knowledge (STEM competencies). As students progress through multiple CUREs, they will build on these competencies and gain the ability, confidence, and skills to conduct independent research and to enter the STEM workforce. Key components of the project will include a Peer Tutoring Intervention Program (PTIP) in freshman gateway STEM courses as an integrated component of the 4YrURCE model; a Faculty Development Institute will provide an opportunity to engage participants in practicing evidence-based pedagogies, reflecting on the learning outcomes, considering how all students - especially under-prepared and underrepresented students - thrive in active learning environments and learn how to build student metacognitive skills, resilience, and grit; and a research study on the efficacy of the CUREs model using a systems approach framework.  To increase broader impacts, the project will provide stipends for faculty members at other institutions to engage in the faculty development activities and mini-grants to thirteen faculty members to pilot and test CUREs on their campuses.\r\n\r\nThe overarching goals of the project are to build upon the on-going 4YrURCE pilot project designed to improve STEM learning and engagement and to conduct a longitudinal study on the efficacy of the proposed CUREs model.  The specific objectives are to: (1) increase enrollment, persistence, and retention rates of underrepresented and under-prepared students in STEM disciplines; (2) provide research-based curricula founded on STEM competencies that provide multiple research and creative experiences for all students during all four years of matriculation; (3) provide leadership to a diverse group of students through peer mentoring and peer tutoring opportunities; and (4) provide diverse faculty that use evidence-based pedagogies to engage students, promote learning, develop students' metacognitive skills, and promote resilience among students.  Mixed methods will be used to evaluate the project both formatively and summatively.  Results are anticipated to show the extent to which the interventions (i.e. PTIP, CURE, etc.) impact student performance and student success including demonstrated increases in STEM competencies, engagement, retention, and completion and the extent to which the faculty development strategies improve adoption of effective pedagogical strategies.",

Georgia Gwinnett College's student population is ethnically diverse with 32% black/African American, 26% White, 26% Hispanic, 11% Asian, and 4% multi-ethnic. Additionally, greater than 50% are first-year generation students, and 12.5% are non-traditional degree-seeking students.&nbsp; This high level of diversity brings diverse educational backgrounds. For example, many entering freshmen arrive underprepared for the rigor of STEM courses, a large proportion of our students work and are often main caregivers.&nbsp; Inspired by our highly diverse student population and the need to train and prepare our students for STEM careers, we developed and applied a new institutional model of teaching STEM disciplines that centers around extensive research experiences to improve learning and increase student engagement.</p>\n<p>The institutional model at GGC includes several High Impact Practices (HIPs), teaching and learning methods that have been found to be particularly beneficial for college students. These HIPs include Course-embedded Undergraduate Research Experiences (CUREs), Peer Supplemental Instruction (PSI), and Faculty Learning Communities (FLCs).</p>\n<p>The centerpiece of our model focuses on the four-year undergraduate research and creative experiences, in which students participate in research and creative experiences throughout their four-year program. These research experiences (CUREs) are inclusive since all students have the opportunity to engage in research. During our project, over 2,000 students were engaged in research just in our introductory-level courses. CUREs also provide repeated opportunities for students to develop STEM skills since CUREs are part of several required courses for each STEM major. Students who participated in CUREs had a more positive view of their abilities to perform STEM skills and hence more confidence to perform well in their future careers. &nbsp;A competitive mini-grant program was used to incentivize faculty to redesign their courses to include CUREs.</p>\n<p>Along with CUREs, we also developed and implemented an early intervention Peer Supplemental Instruction (PSI) Program to help develop academic performance and metacognitive skills in under-prepared students. This program also provided leadership opportunities for students to become leaders and mentors for less-prepared students. Results after 5 semesters of data from nine introductory, gateway courses show that students who attended PSI frequently (10 sessions or more) improved their grades versus students who only attended 1-2 sessions. Overall, Black/African American and Hispanic students received the greatest benefits from the PSI Program. Students who were not well-prepared for college (low high school GPA) also benefited and were able to ?catch up? and boost their grades over the semester.</p>\n<p>Our model also supports faculty development since faculty play such an important role in how students learn. We provided numerous opportunities for faculty to learn and adopt pedagogies that have been found to be particularly effective in engaging students, developing their metacognitive skills, and fostering their resilience. Collaboration between faculty from different disciplines was encouraged through the formation of Faculty Learning Communities (FLCs) and CUREs. To encourage and incentivize such collaborations, we developed and implemented a competitive Mini-Grant Program that allowed faculty to be creative and forward-thinking. Mini-Grant proposals were submitted for both CUREs and FLCs.</p>\n<p>Some key trends that were observed over the project period include: (1) higher enrollment numbers in STEM majors in the School of Science and Technology (SST) compared to GGC?s general enrollment rate. (2) SST?s student population continues to remain very diverse with increasing numbers of Hispanics (currently SST student diversity is 33.1% Black or African-American, 24.9% White, 21.7% Hispanic, 14.8% Asian, and 4.4% multiracial). (3) SST?s Retention Rates <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">back to SST</span> show a 4.1% increase in rates from pre-grant to post-grant. During the same period, GGC?s other schools only experienced a 0.4% increase in retention rate from pre-grant to post-grant. This is a 10-fold difference in the percent increase in retention back to the same school, indicating that the percent increase in retention back to SST was 10 times higher than that of the other schools at GGC. (4) The total SST degrees awarded from 2013 to 2021 increased by 200% compared to GGC?s rate of 129%.&nbsp; Data indicate that SST is producing STEM graduates at a higher rate than GGC, especially since the start of the project award.</p>\n<p>Our outcomes indicate that our comprehensive, holistic, systemic approach model is working to meet our <em>project outcome of graduating diverse students with STEM Competencies that incorporate research/creative skills and content knowledge, who can make active contributions to the STEM workforce. </em>Our model has the potential to be replicable and transferable. We have collaborated with a variety of institutions throughout the southeast and have helped them develop and implement CUREs in biology, chemistry, and physics gateway courses.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 01/25/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Clay&nbsp;Runck</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1623779/1623779_10463806_1674527830074_InstitutionalModelSystemsApproach--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1623779/1623779_10463806_1674527830074_InstitutionalModelSystemsApproach--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Institutional Model-Systems Approach\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1623779/1623779_10463806_1674527830074_InstitutionalModelSystemsApproach--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Institutional Model-Systems Approach\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Architecture and linkages of the systems approach we used to develop and implement our institutional model for reforming STEM education.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Judy Awong-Taylor</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Judy&nbsp;Awong-Taylor</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Institutional Model-Systems Approach</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1623779/1623779_10463806_1674586985922_Studentattitudinalsurveydata--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1623779/1623779_10463806_1674586985922_Studentattitudinalsurveydata--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Student attitudinal survey data\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1623779/1623779_10463806_1674586985922_Studentattitudinalsurveydata--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Student attitudinal survey data\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Pre/Post student attitudinal surveys in gateway STEM courses (Spring 2017-Fall 2019) showed CUREs led to a significantly more positive belief in self-efficacy compared to controls.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Judy Awong-Taylor</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Clay&nbsp;Runck</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Student attitudinal survey data</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1623779/1623779_10463806_1674587122559_ExampleofaCURE--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1623779/1623779_10463806_1674587122559_ExampleofaCURE--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Example of a CURE\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1623779/1623779_10463806_1674587122559_ExampleofaCURE--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Example of a CURE\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Example of a CURE in an IT programming course.

Overall, Black/African American and Hispanic students received the greatest benefits from the PSI Program. Students who were not well-prepared for college (low high school GPA) also benefited and were able to ?catch up? and boost their grades over the semester.\n\nOur model also supports faculty development since faculty play such an important role in how students learn. We provided numerous opportunities for faculty to learn and adopt pedagogies that have been found to be particularly effective in engaging students, developing their metacognitive skills, and fostering their resilience. Collaboration between faculty from different disciplines was encouraged through the formation of Faculty Learning Communities (FLCs) and CUREs. To encourage and incentivize such collaborations, we developed and implemented a competitive Mini-Grant Program that allowed faculty to be creative and forward-thinking. Mini-Grant proposals were submitted for both CUREs and FLCs.\n\nSome key trends that were observed over the project period include: (1) higher enrollment numbers in STEM majors in the School of Science and Technology (SST) compared to GGC?s general enrollment rate. (2) SST?s student population continues to remain very diverse with increasing numbers of Hispanics (currently SST student diversity is 33.1% Black or African-American, 24.9% White, 21.7% Hispanic, 14.8% Asian, and 4.4% multiracial). (3) SST?s Retention Rates back to SST show a 4.1% increase in rates from pre-grant to post-grant. During the same period, GGC?s other schools only experienced a 0.4% increase in retention rate from pre-grant to post-grant. This is a 10-fold difference in the percent increase in retention back to the same school, indicating that the percent increase in retention back to SST was 10 times higher than that of the other schools at GGC. (4) The total SST degrees awarded from 2013 to 2021 increased by 200% compared to GGC?s rate of 129%.  Data indicate that SST is producing STEM graduates at a higher rate than GGC, especially since the start of the project award.\n\nOur outcomes indicate that our comprehensive, holistic, systemic approach model is working to meet our project outcome of graduating diverse students with STEM Competencies that incorporate research/creative skills and content knowledge, who can make active contributions to the STEM workforce. Our model has the potential to be replicable and transferable. We have collaborated with a variety of institutions throughout the southeast and have helped them develop and implement CUREs in biology, chemistry, and physics gateway courses.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/25/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Clay Runck"
