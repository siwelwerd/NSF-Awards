 "awd_abstract_narration": "Rechargeable batteries help to enable a sustainable energy future through the storage and demand-matched delivery of electricity generated from fluctuating renewable sources such as wind or sun.  Currently, lithium-ion batteries offer the best performance in terms of capacity, power delivery, and longevity.  However, lithium is a limited resource with respect to both its total supply in the Earth's crust and its geographic availability.  Rechargeable batteries which use sodium ions instead of lithium ions for storing charge address the possibility of lithium scarcity in the future, because sodium is a very abundant element.   However, sodium ions are much larger ion than lithium ions, and this large size creates a variety of operational problems within a rechargeable battery, particularly swelling of the battery electrode during charging and discharging.   Through nanotechnology-based approach, this project will develop new cathodes for sodium-ion batteries using hollow nanowires which confine the sodium ions within a tunnel structure.  The nanowires will be made of magnesium oxide with tunnel diameters of about 2 nanometers.  The key innovation is that by confining the sodium ions, within the tunnel, the swelling can be controlled and storage capacity can be increased simultaneously.  The scientific outcomes of this project can be used to help research with other future metal ion battery systems based on magnesium, aluminum and potassium, where similar issues might occur.  The educational activities associated with this project include outreach to school-age children from under-represented groups in engineering through the Richmond Area Program for Minorities in Engineering, the Philadelphia Science Festival, and the Annual Young Women's conference.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this research is to improve the mechanical stability and electrochemical energy storage capacity of sodium-ion batteries by tuning of the pore geometry and ionic content of microporous, sodium-ion intercalation electrodes.  The key hypothesis is that both swelling and storage capacity can be controlled by carrying out the sodium-ion intercalation process within tunnel-structured, sodium-stabilized manganese oxide nanowires. These nanowires contain one-dimensional microporous tunnels forming defined diffusion paths that facilitate reversible sodium ion intercalation.   The research plan has three objectives.  The first objective is to synthesize magnesium oxide nanowire cathodes that contain one-dimensional, microporous tunnels with defined sodium ion diffusion channel dimensions, and then evaluate their electrochemical performance and mechanical strength.  These measurements will be realized through bulk-scale electrochemical characterization and single nanowire-based nanoelectrochemical probing and mechanical degradation testing.  The second objective is to improve the specific capacity within the nanowire channels by increasing the sodium content within the microporous tunnels through chemical routes.   Through the first and second objectives, the top performing materials will be identified that maximize capacity, mechanical stability, and life cycle.  The third objective is to improve electrochemical storage capacity and mechanical stability during repeated charge/discharge cycles through dopant-induced crystal stabilization of the nanowire electrode materials.",

Discovery of polymorphism within a single tunnel manganese oxide nanowire consisting in a nonuniform tunnel size distribution. MnO<sub>2</sub> polymorphism originates from a multi-step layer-to-tunnel transition process and prevails as tunnel size increases. Mechanical properties of the tunnel manganese oxide nanowires depend on size and distribution of the structural tunnels. Brittle fracture of the nanowires under the load was observed in case of nanowires with the smaller size of the structural tunnels, while plastic recovery regime, untypical for ceramic oxide materials, has been observed in todorokite-like nanowires with larger-width tunnel grains. Controllable engineering of recoverable plasticity is a particularly beneficial attribute for advancing the mechanical stability of the ceramic tunnel manganese oxides, which is important for energy storage applications. Improved ordering of [MnO<sub>6</sub>] octahedra leading to improved uniformity of the tunnel size is achieved via control of the synthesis parameters, such as aging of the layered Na-birnessite precursor and pH of the solutions at different synthesis steps.</p>\n<p>2. Reversible intercalation of electrochemically cycled Na<sup>+</sup> ions is limited to a potential window above 1.5 V. Below 1.5 V, tunnel manganese oxides undergo phase decomposition leading to the rapid performance decay. The effect of tunnel size, defined by the stabilizing cation, on performance at both low and high current rates is revealed. At low current rates, tunnel manganese oxides with larger tunnels exhibit higher initial capacities, demonstrating the advantage of the materials with larger structural tunnels.&nbsp; However, at higher current rates, capacity retention in tunnel manganese oxides was found to be limited by the solid-state diffusion coefficient, which depends on the relationship between tunnel size, stabilizing ion, and charge-carrying ion. Well-defined low energy sites for electrochemically cyled ions can be created in the structural tunnels by chemically pre-intercalating the same ions (Na<sup>+</sup> ions in case of Na-ion batteries) during synthesis of materials, which leads to faster ion movement and overall improved electrode material performance.</p>\n<p>3. Development of the chemical modification method of tunnel manganese oxides with large structural tunnels via incorporation of the stabilizing Li<sub>2</sub>O species. Incorporation of lithia into structural tunnels is achieved via mixing tunnel manganese oxides with LiOH in methanol and requires ball-milling and extended annealing step at elevated temperature. Higher ball-milling time/speed and temperature are needed as structural order in tunnel manganese oxides increases. Li<sub>2</sub>O stabilization approach improves capacity, capacity retention and rate capability of tunnel manganese oxides in both Li-ion and Na-ion batteries, which is attributed to the structural stabilization, improved electronic conductivity, and decreased charge-transfer resistance.</p>\n<p>4. Unique combination of morphological and structural features of tunnel manganese oxides, namely the parallel orientation of structural tunnels and nanowire length, assisted in advancing microscopy characterization approaches of battery electrode materials. Specifically, the need to locally analyze tunnel size distribution led to advances in cross-sectional imaging. Excellent compatibility of tunnel manganese oxide nanowires with inside-microscope electrochemical ion intercalation led to improvements in is situ characterization approaches.</p>\n<p>5.
