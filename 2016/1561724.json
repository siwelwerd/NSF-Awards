 "awd_abstract_narration": "The unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii serves as a unique model system for studies of photosynthesis, metabolic pathways, flagellar biogenesis and function, signal transduction, and other aspects of cell biology.   Chlamydomonas allows researchers to apply the powerful genetic techniques available in a simple microbial system to an organism with chloroplasts and flagella.  The system also provides a platform for applied research in biofuels and in protein engineering.  Uniquely among algal systems, over 50 years of experimentation by hundreds of laboratories has generated a collection of more than 4000 mutants affecting many cell processes.   The Chlamydomonas Resource Center, in its 36th year of operation, serves as the central repository to receive, catalogue, preserve and distribute wild type and mutant cultures of C. reinhardtii.  It also maintains and disseminates molecular reagents such as plasmids and provides information on this organism to the international scientific community.   The Center prepares and distributes teaching kits, with simple reagents, strains and instructions to allow high school and college biology students and classes to perform sophisticated experiments, producing hydrogen, for example, without needing expensive laboratory facilities.   By maintaining and distributing mutant strains that can be used to illuminate the functioning of flagella and chloroplasts, and by encouraging the interest of a new generation of researchers, the Chlamydomonas Resource Center plays a critical role in ensuring that this valuable model system continues to provide unique insights into many areas of biology.\r\n\r\n\tThe aims of this project are to: 1) improve the security of the collection by cryopreservation of all living strains in liquid nitrogen, in duplicate; 2) make the mutants in the collection more useful to users by preparing and distributing custom collections of strains using a recently acquired replica-plating robot; and 3) enhance the educational use of the collection by recruiting undergraduate students to test and refine our current teaching kits, and to help the co-directors of the Center design new laboratory experiments to be distributed to teachers through the website.  These enhancements of Center activities will insure that users have access to the information and strains needed to make optimal use of this increasingly important model organism for research and teaching.  A frequently updated web site (chlamy.org) provides descriptions of all cultures and plasmids in the collection, historical information and reference material on genetic loci and mutant alleles, a library of useful laboratory protocols and laboratory exercises, as well as genetic and molecular maps, and links to other relevant information.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nIntellectual merit\n\nThe Chlamydomonas Resource Center (CRC) is the only comprehensive source for materials and information needed to use the eukaryotic green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii in biological research.  The CRC maintains and supplies more than 70,000 mutant and wild-type strains of Chlamydomonas, along with molecular clones of genomic DNA, kits for genetic mapping, cDNA and genomic DNA libraries, reagents for cell growth and kits for teaching in secondary and post-secondary classrooms.  The CRC also maintains a comprehensive website (chlamycollection.org) that provides a storefront to order items from the CRC collections, but also provides up-to-date information on commonly used techniques for Chlamydomonas research, along with genetic and molecular maps of the genome, and news items of interest to the international Chlamydomonas research community.   The CRC staff insures the availability of mutants generated by Chlamydomonas researchers by encouraging users to add their mutants to the collection upon publication, and by accepting strain collections from individual researchers.  The Chlamydomonas research community world-wide depends on this unique resource to continue and expand research on this valuable model system.   As a scientific resource and culture collection the merit of work carried out during this project is reflected by the scope of research that was facilitated by the CRC.  More than 11,000 mutant and wild-type strains of Chlamydomonas were distributed worldwide during the four years of this project, wth 55% of these going to researchers in the United States.  More than 1,700 molecular clones were distributed, along with more than 275 orders for various reagents and supplies needed for cell growth.  The more intangible role of the various kinds of scientific and technical information offered on the CRC website is illustrated by the fact that in the final year of the grant more than 158,000 page views were recorded from more than 26,000 users.  The provision of all of these resources to users led to 774 published manuscripts acknowledging the contributions of the Chlamydomonas Resource Center to the published work.\n\nBroader impacts\n\nThe Chlamydomonas Resource Center has an important impact on biology education at the secondary and post-secondary level by development and distribution of teaching kits for laboratory experiments.  Orders for 279 kits were filled during the period of this grant.  The kits include the cells, growth medium and instructions for classroom exercises teaching concepts of flagellar motility, uniparental inheritance, hydrogen production, mating, and more.  In addition the CRC website contains teaching exercise instructions for other experiments submitted by users, and provides cell strains and growth media for these experiments.  We have also worked with researchers at predominantly teaching colleges and HBCUs to develop curricula for using Chlamydomonas to teach biological principles.  A different kind of broader impact is to encourage and facilitate research of unusual practical importance.  Many of our users are exploring the possibility of using Chlamydomonas for production of renewable energy (biofuels and biohydrogen for example) and for production in culture of proteins of medical interest such as vaccines and antibodies.  Strains provided by the CRC have been critically important in the discovery of channelrhopsins, a powerful tool for neurobiology through which the firing of specific neurons can be triggered by exposing parts of the brain to specific wavelengths of light.  In addtion, the initial discovery of intraflagellar transport (IFT) in eukaryotic cilia and flagella was made possible by wild-type of mutant strains of Chlamydomonas from the CRC.  IFT has proven to be critically important to understanding the role of cilia assembly in the development of metazoans.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/19/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Paul A Lefebvre"
