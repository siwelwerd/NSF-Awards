 "awd_abstract_narration": "Carbon fiber reinforced plastics (CRFPs), commonly known as composites, are increasingly becoming integral to a variety of markets such as aerospace, alternative energies, marine, and automotive industries due to their high strength and low weight in comparison to other engineering materials such as steel. As a case in point, the amount of composite materials that are used in commercial aircraft is projected to be nearly 50% by 2020. Additionally, composites are used to increase efficiency of wind turbines by producing larger blade rotors. In spite of having favorable properties such as high strength to weight ratio and moisture resistance that makes them ideal for engineering structures, composites are expensive and energy intensive to produce due to the need for large pressurized ovens (autoclaves) in their manufacturing process. Moreover, composite structures are more challenging to repair, as the repair material is often needed to be glued to the damaged structure using a high performance adhesive rather than bolting repair patches per normal practices for metallic structures. The proposed project utilizes an innovative approach that will significantly reduce the cost, and improve the energy efficiency of manufacturing and repairing large/thick composite structures. The scrap rate in the composite industry is significantly higher than other manufacturers due to the challenging nature of repairing composites. The proposed technology will help reduce the scrap rate, thereby making composite repair more efficient at a lower cost by limiting the major pain points in the current composite bonding practices.\r\n\r\nThe University of Washington has filed an international patent for the methodology, which protects the primary functionality that makes this innovation possible. This I-Corps team will have exclusive access to this patent within the field of use once it is moved toward commercialization. A working prototype of a temperature controller box along with tested heaters is ready, and proof of concept has been completed. The results from the proof-of-concept have been published in peer-reviewed journal papers. The ultimate goal of this project is to gain a better understanding on the feasibility of commercializing the proposed technology based on the team?s in-depth customer discovery work. The expected activities and deliverables for this project at the end of the I-Corps program will be to: 1) Finalize the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that will provide this team the necessary mobility to introduce the product to potential customers; 2) Showcase the methodology for curved surfaces to potential customers; 3) Finish the Alpha test and ensure Beta readiness; and 4) Develop a robust business model and a go-to-market strategy.",
