Each conference will include presentations by junior and senior investigators in a format designed to promote scientific exchange in formal and informal settings. Results from the conferences will be disseminated via distribution of abstract books and via the CSHL Leading Strand video archive. \r\n\r\nEach conference will address a variety of up-to-date, cutting edge topics relevant to each field of research, with emphasis on fostering cross-disciplinary and forward-looking discussions and collaborations. \r\n\r\nCo-funded by the following programs in the Directorate of Biological Sciences: Genetic Mechanisms and Cellular Dynamics and Function in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Bioscience; Developmental Systems in the Division of Integrative Organismal Systems; and Advances in Biological Informatics in the Division of Biological Infrastructure.",
