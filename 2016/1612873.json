 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nonresponse exists in many statistical applications. In most survey problems, many sampled units fail to provide answers to some or all survey questions.  In medical or health studies, the percentages of incomplete data are often appreciable. Handling nonresponse is very challenging when nonresponse is related to the missing data. Since this research is motivated by problems in survey agencies such as the U.S. Census Bureau and Statistics Canada, or by data sets in medical and health studies, results obtained from this research will have significant impacts on the methodology of handling nonresponse for estimation and inference in practice. The results from this research will also shed light on further research in this area.\r\n \r\nWhen the nonresponse mechanism or propensity depends on observed data only, the nonresponse is called ignorable; otherwise, it is nonignorable. There is a rich literature on methodology of handling ignorable nonresponse. Handling nonignorable nonresponse is much more challenging, since assumptions have to be imposed to ensure the identifiability and estimability of unknown population characteristics and these assumptions are hard to check using data with nonignorable nonresponse. Applying methods developed for ignorable nonresponse to data with nonignorable nonresponse may create serious biases in statistical estimation and inference. This research focuses on estimation based on data with nonignorable nonresponse in the following two general topics. (1) Semiparametric estimation. If a fully parametric model is assumed on the nonresponse propensity and the population distribution of interest, then valid estimators of parameters of interest may be derived using the parametric likelihood under some identifiability assumption.  However, this parametric approach is sensitive to model misspecification, especially when nonresponse is nonignorable. On the other hand, unlike the situation with no nonresponse, a purely nonparametric approach cannot identify the population. This research studies semiparametric methods, assuming one component of the propensity or population distribution is parametric and the others are nonparametric. Efforts will be made to study robustness and efficiency of various methods under different assumptions, longitudinal or multivariate outcomes with nonignorable nonresponse, problems with both missing outcomes and covariates, and unmeasured confounders or systematic missing covariate data in meta analyses. (2) Model and variable selection. When nonresponse is nonignorable, a covariate called nonresponse instrument needs to be used, which is always observed and helps to identify population parameters. In addition, a parametric component of either the propensity or the population distribution has to be assumed. Thus, it is desired to perform model and/or variable selection to ensure that the assumed parametric component and the selected nonresponse instrument are appropriate. Because of nonignorable nonresponse, the existing model and variable selection techniques are not applicable. This research will develop new techniques for model selection and the selection of nonresponse instruments. Furthermore, in the big data era there exists an extremely large set of auxiliary variables that can be used as covariates and this research will study dimension reduction and variable selection for accurate estimation in the presence of nonignorable nonresponse.",
