 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study seeks to understand the structure and evolution of nocturnal (nighttime) thunderstorms using data collected from the Plains Elevated Convection at Night (PECAN) field campaign conducted in the summer of 2015.  The research results from this study have the potential to be very relevant to improving operational forecast models and informing operational weather forecasters.  Societal benefits include improved forecasting and increased lead-time to warn citizens of the impending dangers from these nighttime thunderstorms and the associated hazards of high wind, heavy rainfall and flooding.  \r\n\r\nThe PI plans to conduct very high-resolution (down to 1km grid spacing) simulations of nocturnal thunderstorms.  The underlying science of accurately forecasting warm season (summer) rainfall over the Great Plains of the United States remains elusive.  This research will focus on the role of the low-level jet (LLJ), boundary layer processes, and microphysical processes.  The PI proposes to use the WRF and NMMB numerical models to conduct the research, and to use special observations from the recent PECAN field experiment, along with routinely available observations, to evaluate the model output.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project focused on improved understanding of how thunderstorm systems evolve and grow larger at night.  It also explored methods to improve forecasting of these events.  It was found that when it comes to predicting the initiation of storms at night, the most difficult to predict are those that are not occurring within a strong low-level jet of wind that often forms at night.  It was also found that the grid spacing used in computer models used for forecasting weather makes a big difference in the prediction of some details about the thunderstorm systems.  For instance, finer grid spacing results in more lines of storms being simulated than when coarser grid spacings like those used in most forecasting models today are used.  However, even though the number of lines simulated matches better what is observed, the timing and location is often wrong.  It was also found that finer grid spacing results in the rainy region of the thunderstorm system having colder air in it, which helps to make the system move faster.  In one bow echo case, however, it was found that the speed of movement became too fast, disagreeing with observations for this type of system, which is well-known to produce strong damaging winds.  A different study focusing on nighttime bow echo events determined that several weather parameters work very well to predict how intense the winds will become in a bow echo.  The parameters that worked best were composite parameters that considered both the instability in the atmosphere and how strong the winds or wind shear was.  These same parameters often work well to predict rotating stormss that can produce tornadoes.  This result is important since a cold layer of air near the ground at night tries to stop the strong winds, and it was believed it might be difficult to find good ways to forecast wind intensity at night.  An additional study found that the errors in the amount of moisture being shown by the models prior to formation of storms could give clues on what kind of location error would be present in the model depictions of the storms.  When the air is too dry in the models, it has to be lifted higher to form storms, and the storm systems end up being shown too far north or northeast in the models.  Forecasters can use this information prior to storm formation to better predict where storms will happen.  Finally, a study found that the strength of the cold air in the rainy part of the storms when they first form determines how likely they are to grow larger and organize into a long-lived thunderstorm system.  Thus, it is the temperature and moisture in the lower atmosphere that seem more importrant in predicting this growth than the winds.  \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/17/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: William A Gallus"
