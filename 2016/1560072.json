 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site at the University of Connecticut entitled, Engineering Entrepreneurship Education (E3)-A Multidisciplinary, Entrepreneurial Research Experience for Undergraduates, will create novel research experiences for a talented and diverse group of undergraduate students from traditionally underrepresented populations, with limited access to STEM research opportunities. The National Academy of Engineering reports that entrepreneurship is one of the most critical skills to be taught to engineering undergraduates. The proposed REU addresses this need by giving students the opportunity to work on research projects with commercial potential while simultaneously introducing them to challenges associated with bringing new technologies to market. The program offers entrepreneurship, communication, idea generation, salesmanship, and creativity opportunities to encourage students to pursue their own creative and entrepreneurial endeavors in the future.  Students with this experience can serve as force multipliers, encouraging and engaging other students or individuals to also engage in creative and entrepreneurial enterprises developing the entrepreneurial mindset necessary to support a vibrant, technology-based economy. To extend the benefits of entrepreneurial engineering training to disadvantaged populations, the site has established a recruitment partnership with Connecticut State Colleges and Universities (CSCU) to meet ambitious goals for minority participation. Opening avenues to minority students to achieve entrepreneurial competence will translate to greater economic opportunities within their home institutions.\r\n\r\nOver a three year period, this REU Site program will engage undergraduate students in a 10-week intensive, summer research experience focused on projects identified as having a high potential for translation to commercial projects and which encourage cross-disciplinary discussions and stimulate creativity.  The research program will be complemented by a formal engineering entrepreneurship program that will focus on the creative process, idea generation, prototyping, and the realities of starting a business.  Students will develop communication skills through required presentations to the REU cohort, their faculty mentors, and entrepreneurs. This REU program translates the model used by a successful graduate course in entrepreneurship at the University of Connecticut to a context appropriate for undergraduates.",
