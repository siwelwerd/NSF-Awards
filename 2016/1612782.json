 "awd_abstract_narration": "Young people learn about science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) in a variety of ways and from many sources, including school, the media, personal experiences, and friends and family. Yet STEM participation and identification by youth are not equal across social, economic, and cultural communities. This project will study a long-term, out-of-school program for high school-age youth, who are from groups under-represented in STEM academics and careers: girls, youth from low-income households, and youth of color. Located in the urban context of the Science Museum of Minnesota, the Kitty Andersen Youth Science Center (KAYSC) engages youth in applying culturally rich STEM content to work toward social justice and community building. Specifically, this project will examine how the learning practices of the KAYSC model support youth in identifying with, engaging in, and participating in STEM. Through studying the KAYSC's STEM Justice model, which centers youth as learners, teachers, and leaders who address critical community issues through STEM, this project will develop resources that informal science educators in a variety of contexts and programs can use to promote positive social change, equity, inclusion, and applied STEM learning.\r\n\r\nThe Science Museum of Minnesota will use design-based implementation research to study this model. This research will draw on and further the emerging theoretical framework of science capital. Science capital attempts to capture multiple aspects of science learning and application, including science knowledge, social and cultural resources, and science-related behaviors and practices. Empirically developing the theory of science capital has the potential to build concrete understanding of how to address inequalities in science participation. Four teams will work independently and collaboratively to do so: an adult research team, a high school youth research team, a practitioner team, and a co-design team composed of representatives from the other three teams. Research teams will collect data in the form of observations, semi-structured interviews, practitioner activity reports, artifacts, and the experience sampling method. Initial cycles of design will occur at the Science Museum of Minnesota as researchers and practitioners document, analyze, and iteratively design learning practices within the STEM Justice model. In the second half of the grant, the team will work with an external out-of-school time youth leadership site to implement the redesigned model. Participatory research and design methods involving both youth and adults can advance understanding of what makes out-of-school time STEM learning meaningful, relevant, and successful for marginalized youth and their communities. Grounded in culturally and socially relevant, community-based resources and programming, this project will study how leveraging STEM out-of-school time learning connected to social justice can broaden access to STEM as well as develop workforce, and leadership, and STEM skills by under-represented youth. The project also builds staff capacity for promoting equity and access in informal learning settings. \r\n\r\nThis project is being funded by the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program, which seeks to advance new approaches to, and evidence-based understanding of, the design and development of STEM learning in informal environments.",

Participatory work faces challenges such as divides between theory and practice and differences in researcher and practitioner forms of communication and scheduling. To counter problems arising from research done on, rather than with, we built relationships and shared understandings of what participatory research is; established clear processes and roles for communication, logistics, and accountability; and addressed the affective dimensions of the work. We also embedded research generation methods into informal educators' existing practices, involving KAYSC practitioners in all aspects of research, modeling tools for programming, and reflecting on shared social justice commitments.</span></strong></p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-right: 30pt; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\" dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-right: 30pt; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\" dir=\"ltr\"><strong id=\"docs-internal-guid-cb162a0e-7fff-c34b-a0a8-856bf0de731c\" style=\"font-weight: normal;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Further, while research often studies young people, they are less frequently involved as researchers themselves.

With a redesign, newly hired staff became responsible not only for youth programming but also for developing STEM Justice curriculum and programming to support internal and external OST and education professionals in ongoing learning and reflection. At the end of the project, youth and adults confirmed that these shifts and programming responded to their lived experiences and knowledges. Young people's needs include positive relationships, adults who look like them, relevant learning and STEM experiences based on their interests, and opportunities to reshape oppressive narratives. Adult staff needs include resources, solidarity, and space and time to integrate theory and practice and engage in reflective practice.

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n \nThe Kitty Andersen Youth Science Center (KAYSC) at the Science Museum of Minnesota is a long-term, out-of-school-time (OST) program for youth under-represented in STEM (girls, BIPOC, and youth from low-income families) that pairs STEM and social justice. This research-to-practice project engaged high-school-aged youth and adult practitioners and researchers in participatory research documenting and analyzing the KAYSC's \"STEM Justice\" approach. STEM Justice is a movement to redefine STEM as a tool for dismantling systems of oppression and constructing collective liberation. \n\n\nThis project broadened methodologies used to study informal STEM programs through participatory work that embedded research methods into practice as well as youth as researchers. While also generating traditional forms of data (58 observations of programming; 57 interviews; 17 focus groups; 40 sets of fieldnotes; and surveys from professional development sessions), we co-designed processes and products for the duration of the project. Participatory work faces challenges such as divides between theory and practice and differences in researcher and practitioner forms of communication and scheduling. To counter problems arising from research done on, rather than with, we built relationships and shared understandings of what participatory research is; established clear processes and roles for communication, logistics, and accountability; and addressed the affective dimensions of the work. We also embedded research generation methods into informal educators' existing practices, involving KAYSC practitioners in all aspects of research, modeling tools for programming, and reflecting on shared social justice commitments.\n \nFurther, while research often studies young people, they are less frequently involved as researchers themselves. This project integrated youth of color as researchers and experts on their own lives and STEM learning through a study they designed on the injustices of colorism and the ways that STEM has furthered it. They developed research and workforce skills such as public speaking through presenting at conferences, networking with local organizations, and teamwork. Some of their work is displayed in the RACE: Are We So Different? exhibition on the museum floor. \n \nOur participatory process provided impetus for a KAYSC program redesign to meet youth and practitioner needs, particularly for ongoing professional learning to build capacity.  Our initial joint work identified that key to this program were young people and adults feeling at home in a welcoming, diverse, and inclusive space; activities focused on connecting and relationships; a holistically supportive space attending to family and personal needs; shared norms; and science content grounded in young people's lives, experiences, and communities. With a redesign, newly hired staff became responsible not only for youth programming but also for developing STEM Justice curriculum and programming to support internal and external OST and education professionals in ongoing learning and reflection. At the end of the project, youth and adults confirmed that these shifts and programming responded to their lived experiences and knowledges. Young people's needs include positive relationships, adults who look like them, relevant learning and STEM experiences based on their interests, and opportunities to reshape oppressive narratives. Adult staff needs include resources, solidarity, and space and time to integrate theory and practice and engage in reflective practice. Both young people and adults need collaboration, agency, and work centered in social justice.\n \n\nThe STEM Justice research project iteratively developed and disseminated a toolkit and trainings (professional development) at the intersection of STEM, learning, and social justice. These resources for equity-focused learning environments articulate the what, why, and how of STEM Justice, including topics such as redefining STEM, STEM as a tool, and STEM and social justice. They were the basis for 18 trainings conducted during the life of the grant as well as a coaching model developed for OST and learning professionals. These materials are being used internally to further the museum's commitment to equity-based STEM in onboarding and in a new strategic plan. The STEM Justice model, combining knowledge, theory, and pedagogy and grounded in research, thus has leveraged its resources and expertise to provide theoretical and pedagogical resources that OST programs can adapt and adopt. Importantly, this work has helped OST professionals articulate their programming as STEM work.\n\nLastly, this partnership of informal science learning practitioners and researchers modeled theory-to-practice through a deep exploration that resulted in renaming the academic theory of science capital; this renaming, \"STEM capitxl,\" meets programmatic needs and underpinnings. STEM capitxl signals the theory's roots in equity, invites questioning, and documents opposition to systematic oppression. It reflects asset- and community-based approaches, reclaims the STEM knowledges and practices of multiple communities, and reflects KAYSC's pedagogical practices. \"STEM capitxl\" is a practical and pedagogical tool to help practitioners name the STEM in what they are doing and in young people's lives and to reflect upon how programming embeds STEM dispositions, practices, and knowledges in the service of social justice. This renaming is a concrete way of applying research to practice and making theory relevant to practitioners.   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/24/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Shannon Mcmanimon"
