This workshop will be co-located with the ACM MobiCom 2016 conference, to be held in New York City, NY, October 2016.  The workshop will be a full-day event.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this proposal resides in the contributions that the student participants will make to (1) the N^2Women Workshop, (2) the MobiCom 2016 event (the premier conference in the mobile networking communications field) and (3) the future scientific progress of the student's research. Participant support funds will allow these graduate students to attend high-caliber technical presentations, be exposed to state-of-the-art research, and interact with leading researchers and fellow graduate students.",
