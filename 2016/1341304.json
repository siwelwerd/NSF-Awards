 "awd_abstract_narration": "Around 252 million years ago, a major mass extinction wiped out upwards of 90% of species on Earth.  Coincident with this extinction, the Antarctic portion of the supercontinent of Pangea transitioned to a warmer climatic regime and became devoid of glaciers.  Little is known about the survivors of the extinction in Antarctica, although it has been hypothesized that the continent's high latitude location shielded it from the worst of the extinction's effects.  The Shackleton Glacier region is the best place to study this extinction in Antarctica because it exposes an abundance of correct age rocks and relevant fossils were found there in the 1960s and 1980s.  For this research, paleontologists will study fossil vertebrates that span from about 260 to 240 million years ago to understand how life evolved at high latitudes in the face of massive climate change.  In addition, geologists will use fossil soils and fossil plant matter to more precisely reconstruct the climate of Antarctica across this extinction boundary.  These data will allow for a more complete understanding of ancient climates and how Antarctic life compared to that at lower latitudes.  Undergraduate and graduate students will be actively involved in this research.  Public engagement in Antarctic science will be accomplished at several natural history museums.\r\n\r\nThis three-year project will examine the evolution of Permo-Triassic paleoenvironments and their vertebrate communities by conducting fieldwork in the Shackleton Glacier region of Antarctica.  The team will characterize the Permo-Triassic boundary within Shackleton area strata and correlate it to other stratigraphic successions in the region (e.g. via stable carbon isotope stratigraphy of fossilized plant organic matter).  The researchers will use multiple types of data to assess the paleoenvironment, including: 1) paleosol morphology; 2) paleosol geochemistry; 3) pedogenic organic matter; and 4) fossil wood chronology and stable isotopes.  The Fremouw Formation of Antarctica preserves the highest paleolatitude (~70\u00b0 S) tetrapod fauna of the entire Triassic and thus has the potential to shed important light on the evolution of polar life during the early Mesozoic.  The biology of Triassic vertebrates from Antarctica will be compared to conspecifics from lower paleolatitudes through analysis of growth in bone and tusk histology.  An interdisciplinary approach will be used to address relationships between environmental change, faunal composition, and biogeographic patterns in the context of the high-latitude strata preserved in the Buckley and Fremouw formations in the Shackleton Glacier region.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis grant supported field- and laboratory-based research about the Permo-Triassic mass extinction and how it shaped the composition of subsequent terrestrial ecosystems during the early Mesozoic, including the rise of dinosaurs.  Most previous research on this extinction has been conducted in the Karoo Basin of South Africa, leading to a geographically-restricted understanding of its effects.  Our research targeted Early Triassic-aged rocks exposed in the central Transantarctic Mountains of Antarctica, which preserve the first ~5 million years after the extinction. Our multidisciplinary team included paleontologists, stratigraphers, and geochemists working together to address relationships between environmental change, faunal composition, biogeographic patterns, and ecological community structure.\n\nFieldwork was conducted in the Shackleton Glacier region from December 2017?January 2018 and was extraordinarily successful, with about 270 vertebrate fossils collected in total.  In addition to revisiting historical localities, we collected fossils from two new areas (McIntyre Promontory, McIntosh Ridge) as well as making the first substantial collection from the middle member of the Fremouw Formation.  Based on its fossil content, we believe that the middle Fremouw Formation correlates to the upper portions of the Katberg Formation in South Africa, and thus is likely Early Triassic in age.  Several fossils collected in 2017-18 have already been published, including the first recognition of the amphibian Micropholis stowi, as well as a new, endemic species of therocephalian, Notictoides absens.  One University of Washington graduate student was part of the field team, and three graduate students and four undergraduates were supported by this grant, including as coauthors on peer-reviewed publications.  In addition, one graduate student was trained in museum collections management as the Antarctic fossils were curated at the University of Washington Burke Museum.  In total, there have been 11 publications stemming from fossils collected in 2017/18 thus far, as well as parts of three PhD dissertations, and 13 conference abstracts. One graduate student-led publication, on the recognition of torpor in Antarctic specimens of Lystrosaurus, gained significant media attention, including in the New York Times.  The research undertaken as part of this project will have a lasting influence on our understanding of vertebrate evolution and the collections made will be invaluable additions to the natural heritage of Antarctica.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/24/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Christian A Sidor"
