 "awd_abstract_narration": "Quantum information science has yielded deep theoretical insights into the nature of information and communication, while raising the hope of dramatically more capable computers and communication networks.  But the achievement of these practical goals is hindered by the inherent fragility of quantum information. Traditional approaches for obtaining reliability through simple redundancy do not work; instead, fault tolerance must, and can, in principle, be obtained through subtler techniques that contrive to measure and correct errors without learning anything about the encoded data.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately present methods for fault-tolerant quantum computation require significant overhead, and present understanding of quantum channel capacities remain very limited.  For example, no quantum code is known on which arbitrary fault-tolerant quantum computation can be performed without leaving the code space.  And only very recently was it discovered that classical information can be sent at rates exceeding the long-conjectured Holevo bound.\r\n\r\nThis project will attempt to develop new methods for reliable quantum communication and computation in the presence of noise.  First, the research will push the capabilities and boundaries of quantum error-correction techniques, both by extending and delineating the types of correctable errors, and by determining the scenarios under which such error correction is or is not possible.  The second goal is to develop the deep but heretofore largely unexplored connections between quantum codes, entanglement, and many-body physics, complexity theory, cryptography and high-dimensional geometry.  The objective is to advance our understanding both of quantum codes as well as the related areas of mathematics, physics and computer science.  Finally the team will seek to elucidate the subtle differences between quantum communication and its closest classical analog---private communication.\r\n\r\nThis research endeavors to contribute definitively to realistic embodiments of large-scale quantum computers, which would dramatically improve mankind's ability to process and communicate information.  And the research program itself is deeply interdisciplinary, bringing together physicists, computer scientists and mathematicians from industry and academia, and training students and postdocs.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nQuantum computers are a qualitatively new form of information processing device that will manipulate quantum information stored in \"qubits\", unlike today's computers which store classical information in bits.  One of the central differences between quantum and classical information is the quantum phenomenon of \"entanglement\" which is a form of correlation that is richer than is possible classically.  Entanglement is responsible for the power of quantum computing but it is physically fragile and understanding it poses new mathematical challenges.  Quantum error-correcting codes (QECCs) are methods of harnessing entanglement to protect quantum information but face constraints that do not appear with their classical counterparts.\n\nIntellectual merit: \n\nTwo of the main results emerging from this project were new robust forms of quantum error correction.  Both are new quantum codes which can be verified by examining only a few qubits at a time.  The first code sets a new record for the \"energy barrier\" in a 3-D geometry.  The energy barrier of a code is analogous to the activation energy of a chemical reaction, where it refers to the amount of energy that must be invested to go from one stable state to another.  In coding, we can associate errors with energy, and so the energy barrier represents how many errors must be introduced to corrupt the encoded data.  Energy barriers are a key component of the \"passive\" error correction that protects classical storage media, such as hard drives, whose natural physical dynamics automatically protect their encoded information against thermal noise.  We hope that this work will help in designing a quantum memory whose natural dynamics automatically protect its encoded information, or for which active quantum error correction works more efficiently.\n\nOur second code satisfies a different notion of robustness, inspired by the study of topological phases of matter from physics and computational complexity theory from theoretical computer science.  Both of these disciplines have adopted the notion of a \"trivial\" phase as one that possesses only short-range entanglement, by contrast with topological phases which have long-range many-body entanglement.  It was known that the encoded states of most quantum error-correcting codes are non-trivial in this sense, i.e. they use long-range entanglement to protect their information.  However, in all previous examples this property was not robust in the sense that removing a vanishingly small fraction of the qubits would leave behind a trivial state.  We developed a new code whose code states remain non-trivial even if a constant fraction of qubits are removed.\n\nThese are some of the highlights, but the funding also supported diverse other contributions to the theory of entanglement, quantum error-correction and quantum information.\n\n\nBroader Impacts:\n\nThis project was a collaboration between researchers at MIT, IBM and U of Washington, and during the course of the project, one of the PIs moved from UW to MIT.  This grant funded the PhDs of several grad students at UW (in both Physics and Computer Science &amp; Engineering) and MIT.  It also helped train postdoctoral researchers at MIT and IBM.  Both big tech companies and startups are ramping up their investments in quantum information, and the training provided by this grant helped meet the specialized human-resources needs of this growing sector.  The grant itself helped develop partnerships between MIT, IBM and UW.  Collaborations between MIT and IBM have continued with the 2017 opening of the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab in Cambridge, MA, where the \"Physics of AI\" research pillar includes the topic of quantum information.\nThe work funded by this project also included significant service to the discipline, with funded researchers giving outreach lectures, organizing conferences and contributing to online platforms for scientific discussions such as scirate.com.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/25/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Aram W Harrow"
