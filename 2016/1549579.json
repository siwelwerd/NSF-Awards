 "awd_abstract_narration": "This work addresses basic physical mechanisms that determine mean climate, climate variability and the atmospheric circulation response to greenhouse gas-induced global warming.  Much of the research focuses on the interaction of cloud radiative effects and atmospheric circulation.  One issue to be addressed is the close association over the western equatorial Pacific between atmospheric heating due to the radiative effects of clouds and associated water vapor and energy export from the region.  The PI hypothesizes that the radiative heating of the atmosphere by clouds and vapor anomalies plays a deciding role in horizontal energy export, in part because cloud radiative heating in the upper troposphere increases the requirement for export.  The research further considers the possible effect of upper-tropospheric cloud radiative heating in confining the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) to a narrow strip near the equator.  A role for cloud radiative effects in confining the ITCZ would be of interest given the persistent double-ITCZ bias in climate models, in which models incorrectly produce an ITCZ on either side of the equator.  Further research considers the role of cloud radiative effects in determining key features of the atmospheric circulation response to global warming, including the expansion of the Hadley cell (accompanied by an expansion of the dry regions in the subtropics) and the poleward shift of the midlatitude jet streams commonly found in model simulations.  A related issue to be addressed is the dipole in shortwave cloud radiative feedback over the Southern Ocean, where the feedback is negative in lower latitudes (where it thus serves to counteract greenhouse warming) but positive in higher latitudes.  Previous work by the PI and his collaborators suggests that the positive feedback at higher latitudes is due to cloud brightening as  warmer temperatures favor liquid droplets over ice particles in clouds.  Two other topics to be addressed are the mechanisms which produce El Nino-like conditions in the equatorial Pacific sector, and the contribution of natural variability to the increasing sea ice cover trend around Antarctica and the decline of sea ice in the Arctic.  The work is conducted through analysis of observations and a variety of numerical model simulations, for example the experiments conducted in the Clouds On Off Climate Intercomparison Experiment are examined to understand the role of cloud radiative effects in energy export and ITCZ confinement.  \r\n\r\nThe project has societal broader impacts due to the value of improved understanding of the climate system for anticipating and responding to the likely consequences of climate variability and change.  In addition, the project supports three graduate students, thus promoting the development of the next generation of climate science researchers.  The PI also engages in outreach to the public and stakeholders through a variety of venues.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe main goals of this project are to study the effect of tropical convective clouds on the surface temperature of Earth, the distribution of SST in the tropics and their potential changes in a warmed Earth. The main outcomes of the work are described below.\n\nThe effect of tropical convective clouds on Earth\u2019s energy balance depends on the lifecycle of tropical convection from deep convective cores with intense rainfall, to thick spreading anvil clouds of ice to thin cirrus that persist long after the rainfall has ceased.  The rainy cores and nearby thick anvil clouds tend to have a negative effect on the Earth\u2019s energy balance, because they reflect more solar radiation than they trap escaping terrestrial radiation.  Thin, high clouds on the other hand, emit little terrestrial radiation to space, while not reflecting very much solar radiation, and thus tend to increase the net energy coming into Earth.   For reasons that are not completely understood, the clouds that cool and the clouds that warm approximately cancel each other out in the present climate.  Through a combination of data analysis and modeling, we were able to show that the interaction of spreading anvil clouds with radiation causes a peak in the frequency of occurrence of clouds that have a near neutral effect on the Earth\u2019s energy balance.  In analysis of high-resolution modeling experiments we were able to show that this cancellation between solar and terrestrial effects of clouds on Earth\u2019s energy balance will likely continue to be true in a warmed Earth.\n\nThe distribution of sea surface temperature in the tropics is important for the global weather. When greenhouse gases are increased, many climate models produce more warming over the eastern equatorial Pacific than over the wester equatorial Pacific &ndash; an El Ni&ntilde;o-like response, while some models do the opposite.  We investigated a mechanism that would cause a La Ni&ntilde;a-like initial response to greenhouse gas warming of Earth, in which the eastern Pacific warms much more slowly than the tropical western Pacific.  This response is more similar to what has actually been observed over the past 40 years, and we suggest that the trends of tropical sea surface temperature over the past 40 years are at least partly forced by greenhouse gases, are not natural variability, and thus will continue.  The shape of warming in the tropical Pacific has important implications for the weather in North America and many other parts of the world.\n\nThis work was conducted by the principal investigator in collaboration with three graduate students and two postdoctoral researchers who were supported at least partly by this project.  The project supported three master of science degrees and one PhD degree, plus the training of two early-career postdoctoral researchers.  The project resulted in the publication of 15 peer-reviewed articles in high-impact scientific journals.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/03/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Dennis L Hartmann"
