 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to reduce the carbon footprint of industrial activity through more energy efficient air and gas compression.   The global market for air and gas compressors is estimated to exceed $30 billion.  It is estimated that approximately $50 billion in energy costs is spent globally on air and gas compression each year.  Isothermal compression has been thought to be unachievable due to the requirement of rapidly capturing the heat of compression.  By creating a fundamentally new method for compression, this technology has the potential to dramatically reduce both operating costs for compression and greenhouse gas emissions associated with energy usage for compression. The proposed technology also has the potential to change the way thermodynamics and compression methods are taught in mechanical engineering classes.  Engineering students will now be taught that rapid isothermal compression is possible, and will be challenged to find ways to apply the concepts to a broad range of applications.  Further study and exploitation of isothermal compression may lead to an ever evolving field of application, potentially creating additional areas of research and learning.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will validate the energy efficiencies of a novel method for compressing air and gas in an isothermal compression process.   Heat generated during air and gas compression leads to high energy consumption.  The technology proposed utilizes a liquid/gas emulsion to compress gas in a spinning disc.  The compression method has been proven with bench-top prototypes.  This Phase 1 project will validate total system efficiencies through the design, manufacturing, and testing of a commercial scale system capable of generating test data for comparison against current commercial air compressors.  It is anticipated that the first commercial test unit will generate energy efficiencies on par or above current commercial products.  The test unit will provide comprehensive data on total system efficiencies and system component efficiencies, which will provide a basis for addressing system design issues necessary to enhance overall efficiencies for commercialization.",
