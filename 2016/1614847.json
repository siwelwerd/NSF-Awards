 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will advance efforts of the Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program to better understand and promote practices that increase students' motivations and capacities to pursue careers in fields of science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) by employing mobile technology to help up to 530 teachers and more than 9,000 students use proven retrieval experiences to improve STEM learning. The project will design and implement pedagogical and technological retrieval experiences as well as test the hypothesis that these experiences will encourage students to learn, retain, and apply newly acquired scientific knowledge in novel settings. The project will accomplish this goal through the development and use of simple to complex mobile Apps ranging from basic retrieval strategies to interactive problem solving approaches involving interleaved and generative practices. Through an interdisciplinary approach this project will combine STEM content with technology and pedagogy to support more meaningful and in-depth learning. Culturally-oriented, low-threshold technologies along with cognitively effective retrieval practices will be used to increase students' computational thinking as well as their scientific processing and critical thinking skills associated with careers in the future STEM workforce. \r\n\r\nDeductive and inductive reasoning will underpin a mixed-methods research design involving pre-post surveys, rubric-scored annual competitions, classroom observations, reflective journal entries, video recall and face-to-face interviews, activity logs, and classroom artifacts. These measures will capture changes in student and teacher attitudes, beliefs, and classroom instructions brought on by the use of mobile technologies.  Data analysis of information from these sources will provide a robust characterization of the validity of research findings inclusive of inter-rater reliability, internal consistency, and testing and retesting of the stability of the study design. Project outcomes will include computational models and patterns common to multiple STEM fields developed through mobile Apps in physics, chemistry, biology, Earth science, and mathematics at different educational levels. A database will be created to maintain and disseminate newly developed mobile Apps. Developed resources and research findings will be shared with Finger Lakes Learning Network of 80 regional school districts as well as STEM practitioners and policymakers elsewhere through conferences and the project?s website.",

Memory retrieval practice is an innovative learning strategy that often goes against how we teach. It focuses on getting information out, as opposed to getting information into the minds of students. Teachers often lecture, show videos, encourage note taking, and provide reviews. And students often study by reading their textbooks or lecture notes, watch related videos, and review their notes repeatedly before an exam. The belief is that if we just re-read, and study the notes before an exam, we will get a high grade. This strategy tends to work well for a test, but the problem is that it only leads to short-term learning. It does not guarantee that students will retain knowledge and remember it much later.</p>\n<p>Recent research suggests that new concepts are retained in memory far longer if the retrieval process is effortful, spaced-out, interleaved, and generative in nature. When learning is based in challenges, it is more strongly held in the brain, and it lasts longer. The irony is that to support self-constructive recalls, some forgetting needs to happen and because of this forgetting every time such recall is practiced it reassembles sought-after concepts through different and more learning pathways or links to one's knowledge that is already known and easily retrievable. Accordingly, cognitive psychologists suggest spacing out teaching and learning of a topic as opposed to cram it all into a certain time block (called blocked practice). There are simple tools now to help  spread the use of interleaving and generative memory retrieval practices  in the classrooms.</p>\n<p>The project trained 275 teachers and impacted learning for 30,000 students from 42 local school districts. Project's beneficiaries included underrepresented groups from urban and rural school districts (SDs). Teacher professional development involved summer training and year-long mentoring on the use of mobile apps and various memory retrieval strategies, which ranged from use of simple electronic flashcards for basic memory retrieval strategies to low-stakes quizzes for spaced-out and interleaved retrieval practices as well as computer simulations for generative (problem-solving) practices. A summer camp was also offered to students at the science museum.Teachers appreciated the summer opportunities to collaborate with teachers from other districts in designing mobile Apps and retrieval practices for the upcoming school year. They reported a high degree of satisfaction and felt that they gained a greater understanding of the science behind the concept of interleaving, a greater understanding of how it can be implemented in the classroom, and a higher level of confidence in the effectiveness of interleaving on knowledge retention than they had prior to the training. A large number of target and control studies show that students who learned math and science topics through interleaved retrieval practices consistently scored 10-30% better than those who learned it in the more traditional blocked practice. Similar results were reported by teachers who used computer simulations for the generative retrieval practice versus other control groups that only used text and illustrations.</p>\n<p>According to surveys and interviews by external evaluators, the structure and format of the training was valued by teachers as both empowering and effectively scaffolded to meet their evolving needs. Teachers felt reinvigorated by their professional engagement in designing and testing evidence-based strategies and conducting action research to investigate the efficacy of these interventions within their classroom. The collaboration with other teachers from within the same district, and across different school districts, provided a strong sense of camaraderie and professional stimulation for the participating teachers.

Students who previously had been less likely to complete homework assignments and perform at a high level in class were more motivated and engaged using simulations and the use of interleaving practices. Students who historically performed at a high level in traditional, didactic STEM leaning environments were effectively challenged to learn outside their comfort zone as a result of the strategies teachers employed through the project.
