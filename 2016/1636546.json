Plant carbon isotopes will be measured from leaf waxes preserved in a suite of samples that capture known periods of high CO2 concentration in the Eocene and Oligocene to reconcile conflicts in our understanding of the factors that influence plant carbon isotopes over geologic time. \r\n\r\nThe carbon isotopic composition of plants is used to understand past changes in environment, vegetation, and climate. This project will use the geologic record to examine changes in plant carbon isotopes during times of high atmospheric CO2. The project will benefit society by improving an important proxy for understanding Earth's past climate. In addition to training of an undergraduate and graduate student, this project will foster a broader public understanding of scientific research by expanding on current exhibits in collaboration with the Cincinnati Museum Center, a large urban cultural institution.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe carbon isotopic composition of plants, and more importantly, the carbon isotopic fractionation that is measured between plant leaves and atmospheric CO2 is commonly used to investigate plant behavior today and in the past. Leaf carbon isotope fractionation (&Delta;leaf) is sensitive to environmental conditions and can provide insights into plant responses to climate and environment factors. Leaf carbon isotope fractionation (&Delta;leaf) in C3 plants depends partly on how stomata regulate leaf gas-exchange, which helps explain the sensitivity of &Delta;leaf to a number of environmental and biological factors including water availability and physiological traits. However, the relationship between atmospheric CO2 concentration (pCO2) and &Delta;leaf remains unclear and may be complicated by the drastically differing timescales (weeks to millions of years) on which &Delta;leaf is studied. Stomata regulate leaf gas-exchange in plants to adapt to changing environments on short (weeks) and long (decades to millennia) timescales to maximize carbon (C) gain during photosynthesis and minimize water loss from transpiration Thus, shifts in &Delta;leaf in response to short and long-term changes in pCO2 can provide insights into the plasticity and evolution of leaf gas-exchange, which is a key goal of plant physiologists. The relationship between &Delta;leaf and pCO2 is also crucial for geologists because plant-derived carbon isotopes are used to infer past changes in the carbon cycle and to constrain paleoclimate and paleovegetation.\n\nThe focus of this project was to investigate how &Delta;leaf has responded to shifts in pCO2 and precipitation on long geologic timescales. We collected sediment (rock) samples from fossil leaf sites that represent a range of pCO2 values from ~200 to 900 ppmV, over 40 degrees of latitude from New Mexico to the High Arctic, and 40 million years spanning the Late Cretaceous to the Oligocene. For each site, the carbon isotope composition of atmospheric CO2 (&delta;13Catm), pCO2, mean annual precipitation, and mean annual temperature were constrained from independent proxies. From sediment samples, we extracted long-chain n-alkanes (biomarkers derived from plant wax). We then measured the carbon isotope ratios of sediment-derived n-C29 and n-C31 alkanes to calculate &Delta;leaf. Our results show a negative correlation between &Delta;leaf and pCO2, even after controlling for mean annual precipitation. The &Delta;leaf response to pCO2 is small (-0.3 +/- 0.09 permil / 100 ppmV), suggesting plants are adjusting internal leaf CO2 concentrations to atmospheric pCO2 concentrations, likely by optimizing leaf gas-exchange properties.
