 "awd_abstract_narration": "Soil liquefaction is a pervasive problem during earthquakes that has caused significant and costly damage to civil infrastructure in the US and other parts of the world.  Practicing engineers and academics have been using computational models and numerical simulation tools in the design and analysis of geosystems involving liquefiable soils.  These tools are highly sophisticated and refined, but they often have been revised following many major past earthquakes to incorporate the lessons learned from post-event observations and investigations.  Thus, the validity of these tools is yet to be fully established.  The Liquefaction Experiments and Analysis Projects (LEAP) is an international collaboratory to produce a set of high quality experimental data using centrifuge testing, and then to use these data to establish the validity and range of applicability of existing computational models and simulation procedures for soil liquefaction analysis.  The collaboratory includes centrifuge facilities at the University of California at Davis, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Cambridge University (UK), Kyoto University (Japan), NCU (Taiwan), Zhejiang University (China), IFSTTAR (France), KAIST and KWater (Korea), and HKUST (Hong Kong).  The project leverages the experimental resources at these facilities to complement the testing capabilities in the participating US institutions for investigating a number of challenging problems in which soil liquefaction plays a prominent role.\r\n\r\nThree consecutive projects (LEAP-2017, -2018, and -2019) are planned which will be used to address three important issues: reproducibility and uncertainty; effects of soil fabric; and effects of biaxial ground motion on soil liquefaction.  LEAP-2017 will use improved quality control measures to minimize uncertainties, and an extensive testing program will be designed and conducted to characterize the sensitivity and uncertainty for relatively simple lateral spreading centrifuge tests.   LEAP-2018 will produce high quality centrifuge data to enable the assessment of the applicability of computational tools for predicting the influence of fabric and layering.  LEAP-2019 will assess the performance of numerical tools against a series of biaxial shaking centrifuge experiments using synthetic and real earthquake motions.  Following each LEAP, a workshop will be held to discuss the results of experiments and numerical simulations.  The data resulting from this project will be organized, archived and publically released using a new database publication mechanism.  The organized data will be useful for (1) future validation efforts, (2) other ongoing liquefaction research, and (3) in geotechnical modeling education. A number of graduate students are involved in the project and will receive unique training opportunities beyond the capabilities of any one institution alone.  A Validation Driver Framework (VDF) will be developed to allow modelers as well as practitioners to efficiently validate their codes.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nNearly all of our civil infrastructure (buildings, roads, bridges, dams and ports for example) are supported on the ground.  When the ground consists of water-saturated sandy soils of low to intermediate density, it is susceptible to liquefaction due to earthquake shaking. Vibration of the ground by earthquakes causes a tendency for the soil particles to settle, but it takes time for the water to drain out.  During this time the water pressures in the soil pore spaces increases. At some point the water pressures are so large that the friction between the soil grains disappears and the soil is said to liquefy.  Many people have experience jiggling their feet on a wet sandy beach.  If you do this, you may see evidence of liquefaction: water flows upward out of the sand due to the increased water pressure and your feet gradually sink into the liquefied sand.  \n\nStronger than your jiggling feet, an earthquake shakes the ground on a very large scale.  Extensive deposits of saturated sands under a dam in a river channel could liquefy causing the earth dam to settle, slide and crack possibly leading to overtopping of the dam.  Or, perhaps a building could slowly sink into the ground and tilt due to loss of support.  Cracks and sand boils form and can cause extensive damage to all forms of civil infrastructure. \n\nEngineers need to assess the susceptibility, likelihood, and potential consequences of liquefaction should it occur near existing and proposed infrastructure. To do this, geotechnical earthquake engineers have developed computer models to simulate the soil behavior, heterogeneous soil profiles, water pressure generation to shaking, pore pressure dissipation by drainage, and stress-strain (constitutive relations) describing the strength, stiffness, and other liquefaction phenomena.  Geotechnical engineers typically use these models to assess the amount of deformation that will occur due to shaking and liquefaction and answer questions such as: how far a slope move? or how much will a building settle?  \n\nTo check the accuracy of the complex computer models it is necessary to compare their predictions to data from high quality experiments.  Nowadays, geotechnical centrifuges (up to 9m in radius) are used to perform advanced experiments on physical models of geotechnical liquefaction problems.  The centrifuge provides an artificial hyper gravity (e.g., 40 times earths gravity, for example), which increases the stresses by a factor of 40 in the scale models so that the models feel the same stress as prototype that is 40 times larger that is only subject to gravity (1 g).\n\nFor this research project we constructed many actual physical scaled models of saturated sand deposits, spun them up on different centrifuges, and while they were spinning at about 40 g, we subjected them to vibration using different earthquake simulation shaking table mounted on the end of a centrifuge.  We intentionally varied the soil density and shaking intensity to determine how the displacement varied as a function of density and shaking intensity.  Since LEAP involved collaboration with many universities around the world, we were able to do enough model tests (about 50) to define an empirical response surface for liquefaction deformations of sloping ground (a function relating the deformation of a slope to its density and shaking intensity).  Furthermore, the large number of comparable centrifuge experiments produced by the project enabled us to confirm the reproducibility of the data and to quantify the variability of the experimental results for a liquefaction problem; this is something that has not been accomplished before. \n\nWe developed a process for computer modelers to attempt to reproduce the response surface using their simulation tools.  The accuracy of their computer models could now be quantitatively assessed by comparing the numerical response surfaces to the experimental response surfaces. This approach allows individuals an intuitive way to quantitatively understand and compare the accuracy of computer models being used over the domain of validation. \n\nIn the course of this research we have also shown, for the first time, that experimental data of liquefaction phenomena obtained at different centrifuge facilities produce consistent results and a reproducible response function. Furthermore, through intense collaborations, we have improved the standard of practice for centrifuge model tests of liquefaction problems around the world. \n\nIn the process of international collaboration for LEAP a large number of students at each institution were able to meet and work with leading academics from around the world.  This experience was extremely valuable. At UC Davis, four different graduate student and one undergraduate was supported by this grant.\n\nThe concepts developed for validation of liquefaction models may be applicable to validation of models in other disciplines. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/29/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Bruce L Kutter"
