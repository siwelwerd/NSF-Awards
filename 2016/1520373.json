 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is that it removes the limitations of the previous methods used to join ceramics and metals and allows for new ceramic and metal bonded parts to infiltrate novel markets.  Many new ceramic and metal bonded parts will be fabricated for the automotive, aerospace, chemical, defense, excavation and nuclear industries where they are in high demand due to the favorable properties of both materials being joined.  One immediate opportunity for this type of bond is the impact chisel market.  Long term opportunities from this project will result in superior products being created for the cutting tool market, armor, wear plates, thermal insulation, electrical components, and many others. This new capability will change many manufacturing processes and allow engineers more design possibilities.  In addition to aiding the educational experience of university students involved in part testing, this project will ultimately result in the creation of U.S. manufacturing jobs for the mass production of ceramic and metal bonded parts.\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this project is to utilize and greatly expand upon the findings of impact bonding dissimilar metals from previous bodies of work to advance the scientific understanding of how ceramics impact bond to metals and how these bonded joints survive or potentially degrade when undergoing intense impact fatigue cycle testing. Although fatigue cycle testing on metal/ceramic interfaces has been documented when the joint is formed through other methods, the PI and team seek to perform fatigue cycle testing when metal/ceramic interfaces are optimized for strength and durability by the use of near net-shaped impact bonding. Previous methods of attaching ceramics to metals have been limited to brazing and adhesives, each of which is limited by temperature and strength. Other mechanical methods of joining ceramics and metals will simply not hold up during impact fatigue cycling due to the different compression properties of the joined materials. This project aims to produce pioneering publications on impact bonding ceramics and metals and will also further enhance the knowledge of high velocity impact bonding systems. Of particular interest is the impact bonding of ceramics/composites such as tungsten carbide to hardened steel because of immediate industrial applications.",

Advanced Hydrogen Technologies Corporation (AHTC) has developed a cartridge based system that can produce enormous hydrogen power instantly via aluminum-water reaction. The AHTC Cartridge for the Generation of Hydrogen was used as the source of energy to impact tungsten carbide flyers into steel billets at a sufficient velocity to remove the oxide coating on the metals being bonded and create an intermetallic bond. <strong>Figure 1</strong> shows the experimental setup which consists of a bonding chamber, barrel, cartridge, 9-volt battery, and ceramic and steel samples. A 9-volt battery was used to a chemical reaction within the cartridge thereby rapidly raising the temperature and pressure to initiate rapid disassociation of the water molecules. Upon initiation, the aluminum powder and water reacted to release large amounts of high pressure hydrogen gas in small fractions of a second. The hydrogen gas was the source of the acceleration that caused the flyer to reach velocities comparable to those of flyer plates used in explosive welding.&nbsp; As a result, an impact bond was achieved that showed wave morphology at the joint. The bonded samples and cartridge are then removed and replaced for the next cycle. The near-net-shape bonding of tungsten carbide and steel with a copper interlayer, shown in <strong>Figure 2</strong>, was carried out by AHTC. Additionally, the near-net-shape bonding of tungsten carbide and steel directly, shown in <strong>Figure 3</strong>, was carried out by AHTC, while the analyses of the bonded parts were carried out by professors and students at Washington State University.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The integrity of an impact bonded joint can be assessed by the morphological structure of the bond. Bonded samples were sectioned to study the bond morphology.&nbsp; As seen in the figures the bond exhibits wave morphological patterns, which indicate a good and strong bond. However, in harder materials such as carbide, distinct wave morphology may not exist. This does not indicate a lack of bond strength. Shear tests were then conducted that confirmed the relation of bond strength to the exhibited wave morphology. The shear tests indicated that the joint strength was greater than the shear strength of the materials. The samples were subjected to impact fatigue cycle tests whereby they were hammered into sub-straights such as granite at high impact interval rates to see if delamination would occur at the bonded joints. The copper interlayer squeezed out and caused separation; however the directly bonded carbide to steel did not delaminate or separate at the bonded joint.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A novel technique for bonding dissimilar metals and ceramics using hydrogen energy has been developed. Impact bonding experiments were successfully carried out for tungsten carbide and steel cylindrical billets. One of the advantages of this technique over the explosive welding method is that bonding via hydrogen energy does not involve explosive substances. The conclusions drawn from this study are: (a) There is a potential to develop a machine for bonding of near-net-shape of discrete parts based on energy produced by reacting aluminum powder and water, (b) The wave morphological structure, which is one of the indicators of a successful bond by correlating with shear strength tests, was observed on all specimens bonded, and they varied in size as a function of location and flyer angle. Another advantage of this technique is that near net to net shapes can be achieved. This advantage drastically reduces or eliminates material waste and machine time. Tests were successfully conducted to restrain the material from distorting in the direction perpendicular to the impact. The planned future work for this investigation includes; carry out impact bonding experiments using different materials; study the influence of billet size and constraining factors on bond morphology and investigate the relationship between billet size and hydrogen energy expended.
