 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Delia Milliron of the University of Texas at Austin is developing doped metal oxide nanocrystals that can exchange energy with nearby molecules. These new nanoscale building blocks can be widely applied by chemists, materials scientists, and engineers to create functional materials and devices. Professor Milliron is mentoring graduate student, postdoctoral, and undergraduate researchers who are receiving a unique interdisciplinary educational experience, gaining expertise in topics including nanocrystal synthesis, spectroscopy, and simulation of light-matter interactions. Furthermore, Professor Milliron is developing a new educational module for use in pre-college outreach programs that introduce students to plasmonic phenomena and nanochemistry in general.\r\n\r\nNanocrystals under development in this project have resonant frequencies in the infrared spectral regime, different from the visible light resonance of classical metal nanoparticles such as gold or silver. Synthetic methods to tune dopant chemistry and dopant distribution are being developed to maximize the potential for near field coupling. Characterization of plasmon-vibrational coupling by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy complements the synthetic developments underway and lays the foundation for directing energy flow to tune catalytic pathways and to develop advanced sensors and spectroscopic probes.",

The concentration of electromagnetic energy strengthens the electric field at the NC surface, powering nearby processes. However, this \"near-field enhancement\" (NFE) only occurs around the LSPR frequency, so the nearby process must have a resonant frequency near that of the LSPR to encounter the enhanced field.

Our goals are (1) to develop plasmonic metal oxide NCs with high NFE and (2) to demonstrate these NCs can efficiently couple to molecular vibrations. To achieve these goals we first leveraged colloidal synthetic techniques to make NCs of various composition, size, and shape.
