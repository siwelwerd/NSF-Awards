 "awd_abstract_narration": "Sponges are bottom-dwelling animals that dominate Caribbean reefs now that reef-building corals have been declining for decades. Sponges feed by filtering huge volumes of seawater, providing a mechanism for recycling organic material back to the reef. A new theory has been proposed called the \"sponge-loop hypothesis\" that is potentially the most important new concept in marine ecology in many years, because it seeks to explain Darwin's Paradox: how do highly productive and diverse coral reefs grow in desert-like tropical seas? The sponge loop hypothesis proposes that sponges on coral reefs absorb the large quantities of dissolved organic carbon (molecules such as carbohydrates) that are released by seaweeds and corals and return it to the reef as particles in the form of living and dead cells, or other cellular debris. This project will use a rigorous set of techniques to test the sponge-loop hypothesis in the field on ten of the largest and most common sponges on Caribbean reefs. For each species, the contributions of particles and dissolved organic carbon to sponge nutrition will be measured, as well as the production of cellular particles in the seawater flowing out of the sponge. For selected sponge species, the concentration of dissolved organic carbon entering the sponge will be experimentally enhanced to determine the capacity of the sponge to absorb this potential food source, and to gauge its effect on the production of cellular particles. This project will provide STEM education and training for postdoctoral, graduate and undergraduate students and public outreach in the form of easily accessible educational videos. Further, this project is important for understanding the carbon cycle on coral reefs where the effects of climate change and ocean acidification may be tipping the competitive balance toward non-reef-building organisms, such as sponges. \r\n\r\nThe cycling of carbon from the water-column to the benthos is central to marine ecosystem function; for coral reefs, this process begins with photosynthesis by seaweeds and coral symbionts, which then exude a substantial portion of fixed carbon as dissolved organic carbon (DOC) that may be lost to currents and tides. But if sponges, with their enormous water filtering capacity, can return DOC from the water column to the reef, it would represent a major unrecognized source of carbon cycling. The \"sponge-loop hypothesis\" has the potential to transform our understanding of carbon cycling on coral reefs. Building on preliminary data from studies of the giant barrel sponge, this project will investigate each of the three components of the sponge-loop hypothesis for ten common barrel, vase and tube-forming species that span a range of associations with microbial symbionts, from high microbial abundance (HMA) to low microbial abundance (LMA) in the sponge tissue. Specifically, the experimental approach will include InEx techniques (comparative sampling of seawater immediately before and after passage through the sponge), velocimetry, and flow cytometry to determine whether each species consumes DOC and produces particulate organic carbon (POC) in the form of cellular detritus. Then, for species that consume DOC, the same techniques will be used in manipulative experiments that augment the amount of DOC from three categories (labile, semi-labile and refractory) to determine the types of DOC consumed by sponges. In addition to testing the sponge-loop hypothesis, this project will use molecular techniques to investigate the differences among HMA and LMA sponge species, targeting the microbial symbionts that may be responsible for DOC uptake.",

A new theory called the sponge-loop hypothesis proposes that sponges absorb dissolved organic carbon (DOC, including dissolved sugars) released by seaweeds and returns this material to the reef as particles in the form of shed sponge cells. We tested the sponge-loop hypothesis for 9 species of sponges off the Florida Keys and Belize, and for one species in the Red Sea, by analyzing the dissolved and particulate components in seawater samples that were collected before and after passing through the sponge body. We discovered that sponge species that had a high abundance of microbial symbionts consumed DOC as more than 50% (and as much as 90%) of their diet, but those without microbial symbionts consumed mostly particulate food. Strangely, genetic analyses of the microbial symbiont community across sponge species did not help to explain differences in the uptake of DOC. An important outcome of this project was that none of the sponge species were net producers of particles; therefore, this aspect of the sponge-loop-hypothesis was not validated for the sponge species that were studied. The giant barrel sponge, which is now the most abundant animal on Caribbean reefs, was determined to consume the greatest amount of DOC, returning that carbon to the reef as sponge tissue. Because sponges also produce dissolved nitrogenous waste, the results of this project supported another theory, called the vicious circle hypothesis, that sponges produce fertilizer that enhances the growth of seaweeds which produce DOC that enhances the growth of sponges, both to the detriment of reef-building corals. Taken together, the intellectual merit of the outcomes of this project are a better understanding of what may be driving the dramatic changes to Caribbean reef ecosystems.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Broader impacts of this project included support for the education and training of 7 undergraduate, 8 MS, 3 PhD, and one postdoctoral students.
