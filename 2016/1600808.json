 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Conference on Statistical Properties of Nonequilibrium Dynamical Systems will be held from August 1 through August 5, 2016, at the Academy of Mathematics and Systems Science (AMSS) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, in Beijing China. The conference will be an integrated, collaborative research program aimed to significantly increase our understanding of the statistical properties of dynamical systems of physical origin. The conference topics are central to equilibrium and non-equilibrium physical systems, with applications to the theory of gases, mixing of fluids, diffusion and transport phenomena. They involve novel classes of systems and methods of analysis which have the potential to produce significant progress in our understanding of certain general types of stochastic and deterministic dynamical systems. \r\n\r\nThe goal of the conference is to bring together an excellent group of researchers from around the world to discuss new research results, explore new ideas and powerful new mathematical tools to deepen our theoretical understanding of the dynamical underpinnings of non-equilibrium systems and classical statistical physics. Progress in this area would significantly improve both our conceptual understanding of physical systems and our ability to predict their behavior. While successful collaborations have taken place among subsets of the participants, the conference will provide a valuable opportunity for these international researchers to gather and have face to face discussions.  The organizers will take the opportunity to encourage more young researchers and junior faculties to work on dynamical systems and related research topics.\r\n \r\nThe conference webpage is: http://people.math.umass.edu/~hongkun/conference2016.html",
