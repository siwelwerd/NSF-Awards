 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project funded by the Chemical Theory, Models and Computational Methods program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Jeffrey A. Cina of the University of Oregon is developing theoretical methods for simulating and interpreting time-dependent laser-based measurements of low-temperature materials that absorb light.  The molecular-based approach, that approximates the quantum mechanical behavior, makes it possible to carry out efficient calculations despite the complexity of these systems. This method also allows the interpretation of these processes in terms of motion, easily visualized, of the participating molecules and atoms.\r\n\r\nThe theoretical framework under development is termed a fixed vibrational basis/Gaussian bath description.  For the purpose of simulating spectroscopy signals, it is being developed in perturbative form with respect to the electric field strengths of several external laser pulses.  The theory describes the microscopic dynamics of many-body chemical systems in terms of a physically motivated set of time-dependent parameters that are small in number compared with the collection of linear coefficients that are required in a direct basis-set expansion.  Initial applications are being made to resonantly driven small-molecule targets embedded in rare-gas host crystals.  Systems of this kind display many generic features of condensed-phase chemical dynamics, while being both challenging, due to the prominence of quantum mechanical effects at cryogenic temperatures, and amenable to a mixed quantum/semi-classical treatment.  The quality of the calculated signals is being assessed by comparison with extensive experimental data and more computationally intensive theoretical results, including multi-configuration time-dependent Hartree calculations.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nDuring the granting period, my student, Philip Kovac and I carried out theoretical studies on a series of model complexes (I2Krn with n = 6, 18, 72, and 182) in order to gain insight on the spectroscopy and dynamics of a molecular system, iodine, in a condensed-phase environment.  We developed and tested a mixed quantum/semi-classical method called the Fixed Vibrational Basis/Gaussian Bath (FVB/GB) theory and used it calculate the absorption spectrum of I2Kr6, the smallest cluster in the series.  In collaboration with David Picconi and Irene Burghardt, Goethe University, Frankfurt, I went on to participate in computational studies of the absorption spectrum and coherent Raman spectroscopy signals from the next larger dihalogen/rare-gas cluster, I2Kr18, with the existing multi-configurational time-dependent Hartree method.\n\n Another student, Alexis Kiessling, and I contributed a chapter to Minhaeng Cho\u2019s 2019 book, Coherent Multidimensional Spectroscopy.  This chapter, entitled \"Nuclear wave-packet dynamics in two-dimensional interferograms of excitation-transfer systems,\" serves in part as an extended preview of the culminating chapter of the graduate-level textbook discussed further below.\n\n Kiessling and I put forward a strategy for using wave-packet interferometry experiments to detect and monitor intersite and interexcitonic electronic coherence in spatially oriented electronic excitation-transfer dimers.  This work promises to place the experimental investigation of electronic coherence in energy-transfer complexes on a concrete foundation that will enable the field to go beyond searches for indirect evidence for its existence and lifetime and instead to measure and characterize it systematically.\n\n In work that formed a highlight of her PhD dissertation, Alexis and I published a paper, \"Exploring a spectral-filtering approach to electronic structure calculations.\"  The central insight of our approach is the fact that an arbitrary properly anti-symmetrized Slater-determinant state can be regarded as a superposition of many true, fully correlated electronic eigenstates.  Numerical propagation of such an initial state, combined with spectral filtering, yields the rigorous wave functions as the Fourier coefficients, arising at frequencies proportional to the molecular eigenenergies.  We demonstrated this procedure on several model systems.  Further progress will hinge on the development of efficient strategies for time-evolving approximate electronic states described by compact semi-classical-type parametrization.\n\n The key broader impact of this grant has been the completion of my graduate-level textbook, Getting Started in Time-Resolved Molecular Spectroscopy, which will appear in early 2022 as part of Oxford University Press\u2019s series Oxford Graduate Texts. Each of this book\u2019s seven chapters represents a wholly original formulation of its topic, and the emphasis throughout is on gaining insight into the dynamics underlying signal formation by expressing nonlinear optical spectra in terms of the quantum mechanical overlaps between multi-pulse nuclear wave packets evolving on different electronic potential energy surfaces.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/09/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jeffrey A Cina"
