The fellowship supports a research and training plan for the Fellow to increase the participation of groups underrepresented in biology.  The title of the research plan for this fellowship to Holly Lutz is \"The Bat Microbiome Project.\" The host institutions for this fellowship are the University of Chicago (primary), Argonne National Laboratory, and the Field Museum of Natural History, and the sponsoring scientists are Jack Gilbert and Bruce Patterson.  \r\n\r\nThe goal of this research is to study the 'microbiome' of bats, i.e., microbes that live in and on bats. The Fellow is focusing on microbial symbionts (bacteria and viruses) of African bats, establishing baseline data for this important and vulnerable group. The Fellow is combining these microbial data with information about the evolutionary history and ecology of each bat species to assess what factors drive patterns of bat-microbe associations. The Fellow is also using information about the cutaneous microbiome of particular bat species to examine whether microbes indirectly influence rates of malarial parasite transmission by affecting the behavior of ectoparasitic vectors (e.g. bat flies). By working closely with natural history museums, both in the US and abroad, the Fellow's research is both relying on, and producing, data in the form of vouchered specimens and cryogenically preserved materials derived from bats.\r\n\r\nThe Fellow is receiving training in the latest metagenomic sequencing and bioinformatic methods. The project is also fundamentally international and collaborative in nature. One of the sponsoring institutions, the Field Museum of Natural History (FMNH) in Chicago, has a long history of supporting scientific capacity building in Africa, and the Fellow's Bat Microbiome Project involves the participation and training of many undergraduate and graduate students from African universities. Some of these students will receive advanced training in the US at the FMNH, and will interact with high school and undergraduate volunteers and interns at the museum. In summers, the Fellow is also mentoring high school students from underrepresented groups who will work on some aspect of the Bat Microbiome Project at the FMNH, thereby helping them prepare for academic pursuits in STEM fields. Students are learning about the fundamentals of host-microbe interactions through the lens of the Bat Microbiome Project, as they develop and execute independent projects related to this research.",

Throughout the course of the project, over 700 individual bats representing 10 taxonomic families, 21 genera, and 32 species were sampled for study. Museum vouchered specimens (accessioned at the Field Museum of Natural History, Chicago, IL, USA) include hosts, microbial samples from the gut, skin, and oral cavity, ectoparasites, blood, and other tissues that have been cryogenically preserved for future study. Key findings from this work include an apparent absence of phylosymbiosis between bats and their bacterial symbiosis across all three anatomical sites studied, i.e. lack of congruent pattern between host phylogeny and bacterial community composition (Fig. 1). The absence of this pattern, which we have also found to be shared with birds, suggests the possibility that the evolution of flight has led to a decreased dependence on microbial symbionts for key functions (e.g. digestion and nutrient acquisition). This hypothesis is supported by results from compositional analyses of the bat microbiome across the many taxonomic groups included in this project, which have identified Proteobacteria as the dominant bacterial phylum in bats (Fig. 2). Despite these findings, several bacterial groups were found to be significantly associated with bats from different dietary guilds (e.g. frugivores and insectivores), including representatives from the order Lactobacillales - many of which are fermenting bacteria -&nbsp;found in fruit bats. To examine whether these statistically identified relationships have biological significance for bat hosts, the Bat Microbiome Project is now utilizing the aforementioned cryogenically preserved specimens to explore spatial relationships between bacterial symbionts and host cells via fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) (Fig. 3). Although this work is still in progress, preliminary results suggest that bacteria in the gut are transient rather than resident. In addition to examining interactions between bacteria and the bat gut, correlations between the bat skin microbiome and rates of ectoparasitism have been assessed using data collected for the Bat Microbiome Project. Preliminary results suggest significant links between bacterial community complexity (e.g. network complexity and stability) and the presence or absence of nycteribid bat flies (dipteran vectors of malaria). These findings have important implications for similar systems, such as the human-mosquito-malaria system. Future work includes continued use of FISH to investigate the spatial organization of bacteria in the bat gut, and the application of additional molecular and sequencing methods to quantify bacteria and assess microbiome function via metagenomic analyses. Throughout the course of this project, a number of undergraduate and graduate students have been trained in field, laboratory, and bioinformatic methods. In particular, students in Kenya and Uganda, where sampling took place, have been extensively trained in specimen collection and preparation for museum quality data, as well as provided with guidance in grant writing and formation of hypothesis-driven research. Students elsewhere have been trained in laboratory methods, and been introduced to bioinformatics methods and pipelines for analysis of microbiome data. Results of the Bat Microbiome Project have been disseminated via professional meetings and public outreach forums, and are currently under consideration for publication in peer-reviewed scientific journals.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 07/05/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Holly&nbsp;L&nbsp;Lutz</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1611948/1611948_10439331_1562337434607_rousettus--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1611948/1611948_10439331_1562337434607_rousettus--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Egyptian fruit bat (Rousettus aegyptiacus)\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1611948/1611948_10439331_1562337434607_rousettus--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Egyptian fruit bat (Rousettus aegyptiacus)\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Egyptian fruit bat (Rousettus aegyptiacus)</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Holly L Lutz</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Holly&nbsp;L&nbsp;Lutz</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Egyptian fruit bat (Rousettus aegyptiacus)</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1611948/1611948_10439331_1562335833048_Mantel_tests_v2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1611948/1611948_10439331_1562335833048_Mantel_tests_v2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1.
