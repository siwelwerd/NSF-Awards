 "awd_abstract_narration": "Understanding phosphorus (P) behavior in the environment is critical to society, as P often plays a central role in promoting productive agriculture as a fertilizer. Yet phosphorus is also a contaminant in aquatic environments, where human-derived enrichment of P in water and sediment can promote harmful algal blooms.  Worldwide reserves of P are limited, especially in the U.S., and sustaining agricultural production will require the recovery and recycling of P.  The protection of water resources is also an increasingly critical area of concern to promote sustainable clean drinking water, healthy fisheries, and economically vital recreational resources. These issues require improved understanding of how P is, and can be, mobilized in different geological and engineered settings. P interaction with other elements, especially iron, manganese, and carbon, often controls P mobility, and understanding this interaction is therefore key to developing strategies for more sustainable agriculture and water quality. This research program's goal is to develop a conceptual framework of the environmental conditions that maximize phosphorus mobility in sediment-water systems.  The project will integrate with NSF-EPSCoR program investigating lake water quality. Research on these topics will be integrated with outreach opportunities to teach local schoolchildren and stakeholders about responsible nutrient management and how to better protect water resources.\r\n\r\nPhosphorus is generally partitioned in sediment-water systems between mineral, dissolved, and organic pools. Determining the response times for different pools of P species to changing redox conditions is a major hurdle in understanding the drivers of phosphorus mobility and bioavailability in sediment-water systems. Static models describing P partitioning and mobility between these pools are voluminous but do not capture key factors.  The redox conditions near the sediment-water interface (SWI) are a critical control on the reactivity of P and associated redox-active elements (Fe, Mn, S, N especially) in shallow freshwater and marine systems, and can fluctuate on diel, seasonal, and more chaotic event-based timescales. The central hypothesis of this project is that the mobility of specific P pools is maximized by changes in redox conditions at the SWI over short (minutes to hours) time spans, and that the duration and severity of these redox oscillations drives the partitioning and behavior of P (and Fe) species over time near the SWI.  To test this requires a comprehensive investigation of P speciation and mobility that couples field and laboratory approaches designed to elucidate the drivers and dynamics of this complex system.  Analysis of the specific P pools and related elements will utilize advanced techniques to examine the partitioning of different P forms in different pools under changing redox conditions.  Specifically, high-resolution in-situ monitoring of natural and manipulated SWI redox dynamics using environmental voltammetric techniques, combined with a suite of targeted analyses to describe the redox-driven evolution of sediment-water P pools including: 1) sediment P mineralogical composition and extractability, 2)  P and Fe speciation, and 3) enzyme digestion and NMR techniques to determine organic P speciation will provide the data needed to develop a molecular-based and temporally constrained model of P speciation and mobility in sediment-water systems.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis work was done to gain better understanding about processes impacting the quality of our fresh water sources, used for drinking water and recreation at thousands of lakes big and small nationwide.  Nutrients, principally Phosphorus and Nitrogen, are often important in controlling the overal water quality of our fresh water sources.  These nutireients can come from the landscape directly as a result of washing into lakes and reservoirs (external loading) or as a result of nutrients already present in sediments at the bottom of these same lakes and reservoirs.  We investigated how changing chemical conditions (focused on redox species such as Oxygen and Iron) impact minerals that control how P is and is not mobilized to go from the sediment into the water column (and vice versa).  We did field measurements to understand how a particular bay in Lake Champlain (Mississquoi Bay) behaves, as a model for shallow freshwater lakes and reservoirs, combined with a series of lab experiments using sedient ans water from that same bay.  The lab experiments manipulated the supply of oxygen over time (mimicking for example how wind and temperature where observed to afect this redox chemistry), and meaured the redox chemicals (Oxygen, Iron, and Manganese) together with Phosphorus, in the water and sediment.  We found that wind events are a major factor in controlling the redox chemistry of sediments and water - but the timing of these is critical. Long periods of relatively quiet conditions will make for a more reducing (less Oxygen) condition, this in turn stimulates sediment microorganisms to basically breathe iron minerals, dissolving those minerals and releasing the Phosphorus they had stuck to them to the water above.  This took several weeks to become reducing enough to get the P moving upwards.  That is important because that Phosphorus can feed Harmful Algal Blooms in the water column.  What was somewhat suprising is the amount of time it took to change to a more oxic condition and reverse this process, driving P from the water column into the sediment.  That was found to occur over times as short as 30 minutes, indicating a single storrg storm could 'shut off' this pumping of P into the water from the sediment and even reverse if.   BUT, when that wind dies down and it becomes quieter again, the same process of getting the iron in the sediments to reduce, dissolve, and re-release the Phosphorus become much shorter - days to get the P pump from the sediment to water column going again.
