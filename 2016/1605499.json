A model for the process is proposed to be developed in collaboration with researchers at Princeton University.\r\n\r\nThe proposed work focuses on the experimental study and modeling of evaporation-driven capillary flow (ECF) through paper-based microfluidic devices (microPADs) in order to use this type of fluid transport for the development of paper-based diagnostic devices capable of performing automated multi-step assays. The proposed work will result in an investigation of ECF in microPADs with infinite and finite fluid reservoirs; an investigation of the effects of the design of the microPAD on ECF; the development of mathematical models to describe ECF in microPADs, and the application of these models toward the design and development of prototype microPADs for conducting automated multi-step diagnostic assays, including an enzyme inhibition assay and an immuno-chromatographic assay with signal amplification. All the experimental work will be conducted by undergraduate student using relatively simple materials and fabrication methods. The proposed work will also serve to advance the general understanding of ECF, with implications for other systems such as plants and plasticbased microfluidic devices. The work with prototype diagnostic devices will elucidate mechanisms for developing more sophisticated point-of-care diagnostic assays that are still very simple to use. Finally, the project will enable the development of new assays that require at least two, timed, sequential steps, and that were previously not possible due to limitations with the current capabilities of microPADs.",

MicroPADs are made by patterning hydrophobic polymers onto paper, or other porous membranes, in order to define hydrophilic channels and test zones. A key characteristic of microPADs is that the channels wick fluids by capillary action so the devices can transport fluids without relying on computer-controlled pumps or other supporting equipment. While traditional capillary wicking is the most common mode of fluid transport in microPADs and has consequently been explored in detail, this project focused on studying, characterizing, and harnessing evaporation-driven capillary flow (ECF) in paper-based microfluidic devices to expand their capabilities.</p>\n<p>ECF occurs when fluid evaporates from one end of a closed channel and pumps fluid across the channel from a fluid reservoir at the other end of the channel. We characterized ECF in paper-based channels and studied the effects of varying the dimensions of the channel, the size and shape of the evaporation zone, the volume of fluid in the fluid reservoir, and the temperature and humidity of the environment on the rate of ECF (Figure 1). We found that ECF has a distinct behavior from traditional capillary flow (Figure 2). The rate of ECF in paper-based channels was directly proportional to the square root of the surface area of the evaporation zone and inversely proportional to the width and height of the channel, and the porosity of the paper (Figure 3). The length of the channel and shape of the evaporation zone were found to have no effect on the rate of ECF. Since ECF depends on the evaporation of fluid, environmental conditions were found to have a significant impact on the rates of ECF. The rate of ECF decreased linearly with increasing relative humidity up to 100% relative humidity, where ECF stops. A non-linear correlation between the rate of ECF and temperature was observed. Based on our experimental results, we developed a mathematical model to predict the rate of ECF in paper-based channels.</p>\n<p>After characterizing ECF in paper-based channels, we applied this mode of fluid transport toward the development of microPADs capable of performing two, timed steps. &nbsp;The basic working principle of these microPADs is that they can move two different reagents across a given channel or into a given test zone. The first reagent is delivered by traditional capillary wicking into a dry device, and the second reagent is delivered by ECF into the already wet device. By changing the design of the device and the volume of sample added, it is possible to control the timing between the two steps. We demonstrated an application of these functions by developing a distance-based assay for heavy metal ions in water (Figure 4). When the sample of water is added to the device, it is delivered to a test channel via traditional capillary flow where it incubates with an enzyme. The substrate for the enzyme is then delivered to the channel twenty minutes later by ECF. If the sample contains high concentrations of heavy metal ions, the activity of the enzyme will be inhibited and no color change will be observed in the channel, but if the sample contains low concentrations of heavy metal ions, then a color change will be observed with the distance of the color change correlating with the concentration of heavy metal ion. In its current form, the assay is capable of detecting part-per-billion concentrations of heavy metal ions in water. ECF could be harnessed for automating other assays in paper-based microfluidic devices that require multiple, timed steps.</p>\n<p>To date, this project has produced five peer-reviewed publications, one patent, and 12 presentations. It has provided training opportunities for 26 undergraduate students and two high school students, including 18 women, and 10 students from traditionally underrepresented backgrounds.
