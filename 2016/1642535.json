 "awd_abstract_narration": "The inaugural Youth Bioinformatics Symposium willbe held in the greater Washington, D.C. in June 2016. This novel workshop run by the International Society for Computational Biology (ISCB), is focused on introducing secondary school (8-11th grade) students to computational biology and bioinformatics. Questionnaire will be distributed to gauge the level of interest in bioinformatics and database searches before and after the symposium, and the experiences of the organizers will be summarized in an SOP that will be provided to the future organizers and volunteers.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe symposium will be opened by keynote speaker, former president of ISCB. There will be three workshops: on biomedical data mining, on protein 3-D modeling, and a mini-science fair activity. Sequence database searches using the BLAST suite of programs are now part of AP Biology curriculum, and students will get a hands-on introduction into the field.",

The day concluded with a Science Challenge which focused on emerging threats, with the winning entry being a mosquito catcher to reduce the change of Zika virus.\n\nTen professors from four universities assisted in the instruction for the program.  Students were asked to take a survey at the conclusion of the event.  The responses indicated that the event was well received and students were able to take what they learned and apply it to classroom instruction.  It was also encouraged to continue a similar high school training in the future.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/04/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Kamaljeet Sanghera"
