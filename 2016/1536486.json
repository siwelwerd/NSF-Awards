 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will obtain a Laser Diffractometer Particle Size Analyzer (LDPSA) to study the physical dynamics of explosive volcanic eruptions.  The instrument will be used to analyze volcanic ash as a product of magmatic fragmentation and as a hazard to aircraft, electrical infrastructure, and human health.  The instrument will also serve multiple faculty researchers in geoscience and physics.   The LDPSA will provide hands-on training for several graduate and undergraduate courses in the Department of Geological Sciences. The instrument will also permit public outreach efforts to local high schools by providing opportunities for visiting students to use the instrument.  \r\n\r\nA Laser Diffractometer Particle Size Analyzer (LDPSA) allows researchers at University of Alabama Tuscaloosa to explore grain size analyses as a complementary tool for answering research questions seeking information about watershed systematics and the regulation of bacterial communities.  Preliminary data demonstrate that sediment surface area, calculated using particle size, is an important factor regulating the total bacterial biomass. The LDPSA will provide information to evaluate: 1) whether this relationship holds across seasons and hydrological regimes; 2) whether sediment surface area and size distribution also play an important part in determining microbial community structure. The LDPSA will provide hands-on training of research methodologies for a variety of both graduate and undergraduate courses in the Department of Geological Sciences. The availability of an LDPSA will broaden the effectiveness of these lessons and allow students to directly perform analyses and examine the resultant data in an interactive setting. \r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Malvern Mastersizer 3000 laser diffraction particle size analyzer (LDPSA) was installed at the University of Alabama (UA) in July of 2016.  It is currently being used by PI Genareau to analyze volcanic ash samples for two NSF-funded projects, one of which (AGS 1444384) examines the physical characteristics of volcanic ash that influence its electrical conductivity.  Two sets of samples were prepared: Samples of ash fall deposits from explosive eruptions in Alaska and a set of homogenized (with respect to grain size and shape) ash samples prepared by mechanically milling a range of volcanic deposits.   The Alaskan ash samples were analyzed and show a variety of grain size distributions and electrical conductivities that range over roughly five orders of magnitude.  Samples with smaller average particle diameters had greater average electrical conductivities.  Conversely, The LDPSA confirmed that the homogenized samples all had similar grain size distributions with electrical conductivities that ranged over roughly three orders of magnitude.  Results suggest that the electrical conductivity of volcanic ash is largely controlled by the grain size distribution, as higher proportions of smaller grains increase electrical conductivity.  This finding poses important implications for understanding the electrical hazard of volcanic ash and the influence of sample characteristics on the generation of volcanic lightning.  Explosive eruptions that produce fine-grained ash fall deposits will create more of a hazard to electrical infrastructure than those that produce coarse-grained deposits. Data acquired with the LDPSA is part of two M.S. theses currently in preparation and will be incorporated into three publications for peer-reviewed scientific journals. An undergraduate student in the Department of Geological Sciences gained experience in research by utilizing the LDPSA to examine pseudo-ash samples that will be used in an ongoing NSF CAREER award (EAR  1553878).  This continuing grant will use the LDPSA throughout the course of the project to analyze pseudo-ash and volcanic ash samples prior to and following simulated and triggered lightning experiments to determine variations in grain shape and size resulting from high current and high voltage impulses.  Data acquired with the LDPSA has been presented at several professional conferences, including the American Geophysical Union?s fall meeting in 2016 and the American Meteorological Society?s annual meeting in 2017.  Several colleagues of PI Genareau in the Department of Geological Sciences at UA are planning to utilize the LDPSA for future projects and have included grain size analyses conducted with the instrument in grant proposals planned for submission.  The LDPSA will also be utilized by PI Genareau in her undergraduate/graduate course in volcanology to teach students how ash samples are analyzed and what their grain size distributions reveal concerning the dynamics of explosive eruptions.  The instrument is available to UA researchers and visiting scholars.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/12/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Kimberly D Genareau"
