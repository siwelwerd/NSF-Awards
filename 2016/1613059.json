 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the fourteenth annual Graduate Student Topology and Geometry Conference to be held April 2-3, 2016, at Indiana University, Bloomington. With its focus on graduate students, this conference will provide a venue for productive interaction among young mathematicians who are at various stages of mathematical preparation and come from several different geographic regions.  Presentations will cover a broad range of topics from topology and geometry, with deep connections to many other areas of research, such as dynamical systems, physics, computer science, and mathematical biology.  In a research intensive and highly collaborative environment, graduate students and early career mathematicians will refine their communication skills through lectures and seminars, learn about new projects, and develop crucial contacts. \r\n\r\nThe conference talks will be in the areas of in algebraic topology, low-dimensional topology, symplectic geometry, geometric group theory, and algebraic geometry, and other branches of topology and geometry.  Approximately 200 graduate students will come from all over the country to participate. Presentations will include 28 graduate student talks, at 30 minutes each, on expository and research topics; three lectures by plenary speakers who are prominent in their respective fields and excellent expositors: Robert Lipshitz (Columbia University/University of Oregon), Paul Goerss (Northwestern University), and Nathan Dunfield (University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign); six lectures by invited young faculty speakers: Jeffrey Meier (Indiana University), Ina Petkova (Columbia University), Eric Peterson (Harvard University), Kirsten Wickelgren (Georgia Tech), Maxime Fortier Bourque (University of Toronto), and Tengren Zhang (Caltech).
