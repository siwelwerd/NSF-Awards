 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support to enable US. students and lecturers to attend the fourth \"Biennial African School on Fundamental Physics and its Applications\" in Kigali, Rwanda 1-19 August 2016. The schools are based on a close interplay between theoretical, experimental, and applied physics, and Grid computing. They cover a wide range of topics: particle physics, particle detectors, astro-particle physics and cosmology, computing, accelerator technologies, medical physics, condensed matter, light sources and their applications. The participating students are selected from all over Africa and beyond. Scientists from Africa, Europe and the USA are invited to prepare and deliver lectures taking into account the diverse levels of the students. The duration of the school allows for networking -- interactions among students and between students and lecturers. \r\n\r\nThis effort will expand the scope of existing collaborations; bringing more African, American and European researchers and students together. An explicit goal of this School is to promote collaboration with Africa. US students and faculty will be involved.\r\nThis proposal significantly leverages the support of domestic and international organizations including: the NSF (MPS/PHY division and OISE), ICTP, IN2P3, INFN, CERN, DESY, Brookhaven and other National Laboratories and the American Physical Society.",
