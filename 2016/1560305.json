 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site at Louisiana State University (LSU)engages undergraduate students traditionally underrepresented in STEM fields in energy related research with a focus on entrepreneurship and the mechanisms whereby advances in basic science are transitioned to practice. The research focus of the REU program will be structured around a common energy theme with sub-topics including energy storage, catalysis, and biofuels. A unique aspect of this REU Site is that the students will be challenged to consider strategies to advance and transform their research past the laboratory phase to real world implementation via the program's focus on industry and entrepreneurship. LSU is located in the heart of petrochemical country and has developed relationships with many of the top petroleum and chemical companies in the world. PhD engineers from several of these companies will mentor the REU students on the importance of high quality research in industry and the types of careers available.   \r\n \r\nThis REU Site offers opportunities for undergraduate students to engage in energy related research during a 10-week summer program, on a range of projects, including: cycling new battery materials and characterizing electrolytes; quantifying and enhancing lipid production from algae; and characterizing new catalysis used to generate alcohols from syngas.  In addition to active energy research projects mentored by faculty from the Colleges of  Engineering and Science, students will participate in research seminars, ethics training, writing and communications training, field trips to world class research facilities, entrepreneurial activities, and career development activities. Recruitment of REU Site participants will target Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and undergraduate institutions without significant graduate STEM programs.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nDuring the summers of 2016, 2017, and 2018 the Cain Department of Chemical Engineering at Louisiana State University hosted 31 aspiring undergraduate researchers from across the United States as part of their National Science Foundation funded Research Experience for Undergraduate (REU) program.  Over the ten-week program, these students worked on an independent research project and were able to present their work to and be mentored by professional engineers and scientists.  The projects were structured around a common energy theme with sub-topics including energy storage, catalysis, and biofuels.  Students were trained on novel lab techniques, ethical research practices, lab/process safety, research dissemination, and many other topics.  A unique aspect of the program was that in addition to the research training, students learned about entrepreneurship and marketing their ideas.  Students were able to interact with PhD researchers from industry (many of whom are also entrepreneurs) to learn about the variety of jobs available to those with advanced degrees in engineering.  The program had many wonderful accomplishments from the three cohorts.  Successes include: 61% of the participants were from groups traditionally underrepresented in engineering, and 80% of the participants that have graduated from their undergraduate institution as of May 2018 are enrolled in an engineering PhD program, including one NSF GRFP scholar.  Also, four students present their work at the American Institute of Chemical Engineers Annual Student Conference poster session with three of the students being awarded either first or second place in their categories.  Several students came from smaller, regional schools without active research programs so the REU was their first chance to experience research.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/30/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Michael G Benton"
