Geophysical flows occur over a range of length scales, time scales, and concentrations that pose problems for present computational schemes based on the Navier-Stokes equations. At the present time, two-phase continuum formulations are the best hope for describing such flows, but they require correct physical models for terms that describe the interactions between the fluid and the particles. The development of such models will be the focus of this workshop.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding the natural flows upon which the workshop is focused would benefit modeling and prediction of phenomena quite important for human life and for the economy, such as sand storms, torrents of rock and snow-melt down mountainsides, avalanches of powder and granular snow, transport of sediment by waves at coastlines, in rivers and streams, and down continental shelves. Even plumes and surges of volcanic gas and ash that can cause disruption in air transportation and agriculture fall into this category.",
