 "awd_abstract_narration": "Sleep is an essential and restorative process that is often neglected in modern society. In humans, chronic sleep loss (insomnia, shift work, sleep apnea) has negative consequences on normal physiological and mental function and is a risk factor for many chronic conditions, such as metabolic and cardiovascular diseases. In the Arctic, migratory songbirds are active for 20 hours/day to take advantage of constant summer light, and seemingly do not suffer from the well-known detrimental effects of sleep loss, such as physiological and cognitive dysfunction. This research aims to investigate sleep patterns and assess the costs and benefits of sleep loss in arctic-breeding songbirds in Barrow, Alaska (71\u00b0N). Broader impacts of the proposal include training the next generation of science teachers to provide instruction to K-12 students of rural Alaska, engaging students (high school, undergraduate, and graduate) and postdoctoral trainees from traditionally underrepresented backgrounds in collaborative research, and disseminating research findings to scientists and the general public.\r\n\r\nSleep is essential for most organisms, although its precise function is enigmatic. Chronic sleep loss is well known to have detrimental effects on human health and performance. However, other species display a diversity of sleep patterns that challenge the assumption that reduced sleep is costly for all vertebrates. This proposal takes advantage of state-of-the-art miniaturized transmitters to assess sleep architecture in free-ranging songbirds. Arctic-breeding passerines exhibit extended wakefulness during migration and are active 20 hours/day on their breeding grounds where continuous daylight prevails. The project aims to investigate the sleep/wake cycles of two species of songbirds with different life-history strategies that breed in the high Arctic (Barrow, Alaska, 71\u00b0 N).  It is hypothesized that both natural and sexual selection play a role in determining their sleep patterns. Next, daily sleep will be experimentally increased or decreased to assess life-history tradeoffs with fecundity and/or survivorship.  Lastly, the hypothesis will be tested whether arctic-breeding songbirds are more resilient to metabolic, cognitive, hormonal, and immunological costs of sleep loss compared with temperate-breeding birds in captivity. Broader impacts include a Future Teachers of Science program that fosters training of science teachers to develop teaching modules for K-12 students of rural Alaska and a cross-cultural research program for high school students of Alaska and Kentucky to assist with field research. Results from the research will contribute to our understanding of how arctic-dwelling species, including humans, cope with continuous periods of arctic light.",

Our studies indicate that two closely-related species, Lapland longspurs (<em>Calcarius lapponicus) </em>and snow buntings (<em>Plectrophenax nivalis</em>), exhibit sleep/quiescence for only 4-5 h/day while breeding in Utqiagvik, Alaska (71 degrees N). Lapland longspurs nest in the tundra and have higher levels of nest predation than snow buntings (cavity nesters). Free-living male birds were captured on their breeding territories and implanted with modafinil (a stimulant) or melatonin (a chronobiotic) to decrease and increase sleep, respectively. Male longspurs responded to modafinil treatment by decreasing parental feeding rate, which delayed time to fledging in nestlings (fitness cost); male longspurs were insensitive to melatonin treatment. In contrast, there was no effect of modafinil treatment on parental effort or nestling success of snow buntings, whereas melatonin decreased parental feeding rates and led to a trend for brood reduction. These contrasting responses highlight the role of predation risk in mediating behavioral responses to altered activity rhythms among arctic-breeding songbirds. In captive studies, Lapland longspurs were behaviorally, but not physiologically, insensitive to experimental sleep loss compared with temperate-breeding birds, suggesting behavioral adaptations to reduced sleep during polar summer. This research has important implications for humans that inhabit polar regions and their sleep habits. In addition, many individuals exposed to constant light or darkness can develop seasonal affective disorder (SAD). By studying the biological rhythms and sleep cycles of birds that also live in these environments, results (such as using melatonin and modafinil treatments) can be potentially applicable for the treatment of SAD and other disorders that are affected by extreme light/dark cycles.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Broader Impacts:</span> A Future Teachers of Science internship was developed that involved a unique partnership with the Biology Department at WKU, the School of Teacher Education and SKYTeach at WKU, Barrow High School (BHS) on the North Slope of Alaska and the Green River Regional Educational Cooperative (GRREC) of southcentral Kentucky.&nbsp; Six undergraduate students majoring in secondary science education or biology (with a teaching focus) participated. These undergraduate students enrolled in a spring course to develop a 3-lesson module and learn about arctic research.
