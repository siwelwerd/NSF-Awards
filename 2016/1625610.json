 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main goal of this cognitive neuroscience project is to develop, implement, and disseminate best practices in cognitive electrophysiology education for undergraduates with the aim of increasing the quality and number of education and training opportunities for undergraduates, and increasing research outcomes that involve undergraduate co-authors. The three specific goals are: (1) Develop open-access curricula for cognitive electrophysiology that employ evidence-based practices. (2) Create an open-access database of results from 6 classic event-related potential (ERP) experiments that have been optimized in terms of best practices in experimental design and produce highly reliable results. These data will form the basis of class activities, lab training, and independent research and will include a variety of individual difference measures that can also be used for student-generated hypothesis testing. (3) Engage in ongoing improvement of the learning materials through active engagement with a 9-member faculty learning community of users and students active in this field. This nascent community will be expanded by hosting a series of yearly meetings at a major conference that will be open to all interested faculty and students and by including undergraduate research assistants in the curriculum design and research activities.\r\n\r\nThis project would address the need for curricular materials in a burgeoning field of research that combines a number of STEM disciplines (biology, chemistry, physics, psychology, and electrical engineering) in a focus on cognitive neuroscience. One cognitive neuroscience measurement technique that is particularly conducive to undergraduate learning is cognitive electrophysiology (electroencephalography/ event-related potentials; EEG/ERP). EEG/ERP studies examine changes in scalp-recorded brain electrical activity corresponding to cognitive processing in real time. EEG refers to the dynamic, ongoing electrical activity recorded during cognitive processing. ERP refers to the most commonly used method of electrophysiological research, relying on signal averaging to extract the activity reliably linked with specific sensory stimuli and/or motor responses (the electrical potentials that are related to specific events). Cognitive electrophysiology is well suited for undergraduate research because the equipment and supplies are relatively inexpensive and the opportunities for learning are high.",

Cognitive electrophysiology (electroencephalography/event-related potentials; EEG/ERP) is a direct measure of brain activity with millisecond precision, allowing researchers to link brain and behavior. This cognitive neuroscience technique is conducive to undergraduate learning because equipment is relatively inexpensive, opportunities for learning and integration across STEM fields are immense, and associated lab skills are transferable to other areas of research and practical applications. Despite its potential for undergraduate STEM training, very few colleges and universities offer courses in cognitive electrophysiology. The lack of courses incorporating this technique is likely due to limited access to pedagogical professional development and the time commitment required to create curriculum, which involves adapting existing graduate-level materials for an undergraduate audience. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>The three PURSUE Principal Investigators (PIs) worked collaboratively with participating faculty from six additional institutions to develop, test and revise innovative open educational materials to help students integrate technical skills with deep conceptual learning. The materials are constructed to be easily adapted for use in different contexts and courses. Indeed, implementation feedback suggested that materials were easy to use and that content was easy to adapt to meet instructor learning goals and students? needs.&nbsp; These materials are publicly available via the PURSUE website (http://pursueerp.com; see Figure 1). The PIs widely promoted the website and teaching materials via seminars, ERP boot camps, list servs, newsletters, etc.</p>\n<p>PURSUE educational products include several sets of modular Introductory materials, including a short methods class version, a 2-day/ hybrid version, and a 3-day course module. In addition to PowerPoint slides, the materials include a variety of animations, technical videos, simulations, instructor guides, and recommended readings (see Figures 2 and 3).&nbsp; The PIs also developed materials for a full-semester course that will be tested, revised and disseminated during Phase II of the project.</p>\n<p>In addition, PURSUE PIs created a large database of classic ERP experiment data that includes seven major ERP components with additional experimental conditions and individual difference measures; it is the first of its kind. This database was used to create instructional data sets that contain data from 20 participants specifically selected to illustrate different types of correlations and statistical outcomes. Creation of the public/free database of ERP experiment data allows STEM educators to provide students with hands-on learning experiences (to interact with real data, which are usually not as clean as textbook examples) and the ability to generate and test their own hypotheses. These experiences provide students with a much-needed foundation for cognitive neuroscience, in addition to skills that are transferable to STEM-related jobs and graduate programs.</p>\n<p>PURSUE PIs also created a cognitive electrophysiology teaching/research community for faculty. Our faculty learning community (FLC) not only contributed to the creation of our educational materials, but also provided professional support to its members, including writing letters of&nbsp;recommendation for tenure and promotion, and providing advice related to publishing, preparing grant proposals, expanding research programs, and mentoring students.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Throughout the duration of the grant, the PURSUE project has engaged 65 undergraduate research assistants (URAs) across PI institutions to develop and refine Introductory materials, collect and process data for the database, and train incoming URAs. PIs provided URAs with professional development opportunities and mentorship. URAs were able to design and implement their own EEG/ERP studies as independent research projects and honors theses, which they presented at professional conferences. Data indicate that URAs improved their communication, troubleshooting, and computer technical skills as well as their understanding of the content area through participating in the research experience. As URAs practiced research skills with increasing independence, they developed a sense of self-efficacy.</p>\n<p>The PURSUE project is already making an impact on the experiences of faculty teaching and training undergraduates in cognitive electrophysiology and on undergraduates who are learning electrophysiology with level-appropriate educational materials.&nbsp; To date, there has been a large increase in requests for these materials from over 220 faculty from geographically diverse regions (32 countries; 55% of users from USA) with the intention of training 4211 undergraduates and 1551 graduate students using these materials for the first time in Fall, 2020.</p>\n<p>Additional NSF funding has been secured for a Level II PURSUE project that enables continuation and expansion of grant activities, including refining and assessing full-semester course materials, supporting adoption and implementation via workshops for new faculty users, broadening the EEG/ERP teaching and research community, and increasing accessibility and dissemination. Overall, the PURSUE Level I project was meritorious, demonstrating positive outcomes for faculty participants that will be sustained beyond the duration of the grant.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/28/2020<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Jane&nbsp;W&nbsp;Couperus</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1625610/1625610_10462415_1607955671410_Figure1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1625610/1625610_10462415_1607955671410_Figure1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1625610/1625610_10462415_1607955671410_Figure1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Figure 1.
