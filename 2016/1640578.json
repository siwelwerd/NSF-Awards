 "awd_abstract_narration": "This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translating tunable microwave interferometer technology to fill the need for online monitoring of yeast cells and early detection of microbial contamination in fermentation processes.  The proposed microwave flow cytometer (\u00b5FC) is important because it provides essential information to optimize the fermentation process, improve production yield, monitor microbial contamination, and control product quality in various industries, including the bioethanol fuel, brewing and distilling industries.  American companies in these industries support millions of jobs and produce several hundred billion dollars' worth of economic outputs annually.  Improving productivity and reducing financial loss caused by microbial contaminations are critical for their continued prosperity and growth.  \r\n\r\nThe microwave flow cytometer has the following unique features: reagent free cell detection and identification, robust operation, and user friendly instrumentation.  These features provide the following advantages: low cost operation, online counting of viable and nonviable yeast cells, and early detection of microbial contamination when compared to the leading competing technologies in the market space, such as optical density (OD) detection, radio-frequency biomass sensing, microscopy based cell counting, staining based viability evaluation, and chemical reaction based yeast activity monitoring.\r\n\r\nThis project will result in a proof-of-concept demonstration of microwave flow cytometer technology for accurately counting yeast cells (cells/mL) at high speed, determining yeast physiological state (viability and vitality), and identifying typical wild yeasts and bacteria in typical fermentation processes.  A preliminary database of the microwave properties and signatures of these microorganisms will be obtained.  This project will address the following knowledge and technology gaps: the microwave properties and signatures of typical fermentation yeasts and bacteria, the appropriate \u00b5FC frequencies for individual yeast cell and bacteria detection and differentiation, and the techniques for the design, fabrication and operation of microwave flow cytometers.  \r\n\r\nIn addition, personnel involved in this project, including undergraduate and graduate students, will receive innovation experience through characterizing the microwave properties of yeast cells and identifying their signatures.  The students will receive technology translation experience through developing user friendly microwave flow cytometer instruments.  They will also receive entrepreneurship experience through close interactions with the industrial partners of the project.\r\n\r\nThis project engages Ferm Solutions and Wilderness Trail Distillery in Danville, KY to provide test environment and commercialization guidance in this technology translation effort from research discovery toward commercial reality.",

The basic information of yeast cells, such as their density (cells/mL), cell viability and vitality (e.g. budding), is important for process optimization, quality control, and yield improvement.  Microbial contaminations, such as wild yeasts, create considerable financial losses since they compete directly with yeast cells for nutrients and produce unwanted flavors or molecular impurities.  Therefore, various technologies and instruments, including microscopy-based cell counting, staining-based viability evaluation, chemical-reaction-based yeast activity monitoring, flow cytometers, optical density (OD) detectors and radio-frequency biomass sensors, are developed to address the market needs.  This project deals with a new method, microwave flow cytometry, for online yeast cell monitoring.  A few key techniques are developed and evaluated for potential commercialization.\n\nA few types of microwave sensing electrodes, including microstrips, coplanar waveguides and multi-frequency microwave resonators, are built with different fabrication techniques developed and fine-tuned in this project.  Microfluidic channel networks are developed and integrated with the electrodes for sample solution handling.  A flow cytometer platform is established to incorporate with the electrodes.  Polystyrene particles with diameters from 1 to 8 &micro;m in DI water suspensions are used to test the flow cytometer performance at frequencies from approximately 0.2 to 8 GHz. Viable and non-viable Pastorianus Yeast and Cervisiae Yeast cells are characterized in the same frequency range, one cell at a time.  The permittivity values of each cell are obtained from measured scattering parameters with an algorithm developed in this project.  The permittivity parameters describe the intrinsic molecular polarizations and relaxation processes inside a cell.  It is shown that the developed flow cytometers can detect and characterize cells at a throughput of 1 cell/second.  Higher throughput, up to 10 cells/second, can be achieved with higher sample flow rate.  Viable and non-viable yeast cells show clear signal differences.  Furthermore, yeast cells of different strains yield clearly different signals at certain frequencies.  Thus, microwave flow cytometry has the potential to accurately count cells, differentiate cell viability and strains without using chemical or biological reagents.  These characteristics bode well for technology commercialization and transfer.  Nevertheless, more work is needed to improve cell counting accuracy when cell clumps are present in the sample.  Further evaluation with complex samples is necessary to define system performance.\n\nThis project provided partial support to four graduate students for their thesis work and research experience for two undergraduate students.  Two of the students are female.  The project also supported two graduate students with internship experience in a commercial yeast producer facility and one student with entrepreneurship development experience. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/18/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Pingshan Wang"
