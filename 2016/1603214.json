 "awd_abstract_narration": "Arctic ecosystems are warming at some of the fastest rates observed on earth.  In particular, Arctic lakes are experiencing more frequent years of warmer and deeper surface water.  However, the ability to detect and quantify ecosystem effects and specific biological responses to these climatic changes has been primarily limited to non-mechanistic modeled scenarios and observational studies in uncontrolled environments.  These lakes provide subsistence harvest for native communities in the Arctic and it is important to understand how the level of sustainable harvests might change under scenarios of continued warming.  This project will manipulate the temperature regime of selected Arctic lakes, observe the consequent changes of the lake ecosystem, and model these.  \r\n\r\nThis project will contribute to STEM workforce development through provision of support for the training of graduate students at two institutions.  It will also entrain undergraduate students into the research.  Through a collaboration with the US Fish and Wildlife Service, the principal investigators will provide outreach to I\u00f1upiat high school students via the Kaktovik Science Camp and to I\u00f1upiat K-12 students via the Arctic Village Science Camp Goonzhii.  They will contribute to the management of natural resources by presentations through established collaborations with the US Fish and Wildlife Service and the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, as well as through an interactive seminar series with local communities, e.g. the North Slope Borough of Alaska.\r\n\r\nThis project will complete a multi-year, whole-lake warming manipulation, to quantify the effects of future climate change on lake ecosystems in the Arctic. In addition, regional climate and lake models will be coupled with biotic responses to better understand the sensitivity of lakes to changing atmospheric conditions. The project is designed to answer: How will warmer lake temperatures and extended growing season alter (1) lake ice coverage and annual thermal regime; (2) abundance, activity, and diversity of primary and secondary producers; (3) fish vital rates, production, and dynamics; and (4) degree of carry-over across growing seasons and cumulative effects. Experimental results will be combined with long-term, archived data to inform a linked modeling system (coupled lake-climate model and integrated physical, climate, biological, and bioenergetic modeling) to answer: How will warmer lake temperatures and an extended growing season alter: (1) lake thermal regimes at regional scales, and (2) fish populations across lake types of the Arctic. This research will quantify lake thermal processes and lake-atmosphere feedbacks, provide more precise projections of lake horizontal and vertical temperature structures, and document and project lake biota and ecosystem responses to changes in lake thermal condition over large spatial scales and under different climate scenarios.\r\n",

We successfully warmed one lake during 2019.  However, due to covid restrictions it was not possible to experimentally warm the lakes during the following years.  The decision was made to end the warming and concentrate on monitoring the control and the recovery of the experimentally warmed lake for modeling activities.  In addition, we monitored a nearby set of lakes where a thermokarst (land failure due to permafrost thaw) had occurred as a proxy for some of the possible impacts of warming. \n\nData from the warmed lake and the control lakes in Alaska, as well as a high latitude lake on the Tibetan Plateau was used to evaluate an improved lake model where a vertical mixing scheme, K profile parameterization (KPP), was incorporated in the Community Land Model (CLM).   Results demonstrated that CLM-KPP reproduced the observed lake mixing and significantly improved lake temperature simulations when compared to the original CLM. The newly improved model better represents the transition between stratification and turnover. This improved lake model has great potential for reliable physical lake process predictions and better ecosystem services.\n\nOne possible impact of lake warming is an increase in thermokarst activity.  Late in 2018 we observed a thermokarst on one of the lakes in a series of inlet lakes (I series lakes).   Fortunately, we had been collecting data on I series lakes for many years.  The most obvious immediate impact of the thermokarst on the impacted lake in 2018 was a dramatic decrease in lake transparency. Because we had data from the other lakes we are quite certain this was an impact of the thermokarst, not a regional change or weather related events.   Nutrient concentrations were also impacted, with both ammonium and phosphate showing increases in 2019 and 2020 before returning to pre-thermokarst values in 2021.  Nitrate, which has always been higher in the lake which experienced the thermokarst, did not seem to be as impacted.   Chlorophyll values were somewhat elevated in the water column in 2021.  This data helps quantify the magnitude and duration of future thermokarst events on lake ecosystems.\n\nThis project has supported opportunities for training and professional development over the last  several years.   We had a research assistant for 3 summers working on this project.
