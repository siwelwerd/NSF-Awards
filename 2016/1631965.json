This meeting is one of the more important focused workshop conference meeting within the discipline of radio science. The award would provide travel support and participant expenses for 10 students (4 US and 6 from developing countries). The Beacon Satellite Symposium provides a unique opportunity for US scientists and students to meet scientists from all over the world to share knowledge on the ionospheric effects on radio propagation and space weather. Beacon Symposia have historically focused on ionospheric electron content and scintillation. With more recent developments in ionospheric imaging, remote sensing, tomography, occultation techniques, assimilation models, distributed arrays of ionospheric measurements, monitoring natural hazards from space, national and international space weather activities, and satellite based navigation and communication systems; these studies have gained new momentum and perspectives. \r\n\r\nThis symposium is a unique opportunity for US scientists and students to gain a worldwide perspective on the state of the art of these research topics. This award has significant broader impacts by creating opportunities for international research collaborations and enhancing research in the United States. International research collaborations yield opportunities to share and deploy ionospheric sensing equipment to far away lands where ionospheric behavior and effects are not well studied or understood.",
