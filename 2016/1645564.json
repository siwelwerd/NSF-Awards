 "awd_abstract_narration": "Technical art history is a new sub-discipline within art historical and conservation research that applies science and technology to the understanding and preservation of art objects. Only in the last decade has this community accorded image processing and computational science the status of a principal partner among the other scientific and technological disciplines, such as chemistry, materials science, physics, imaging technology, and dendrochronology, blended together in the growing specialization of technical art history. \r\n\r\nFrom July 29 to August 5, 2016, a technical art history workshop funded by the Kress Foundation, a Gordon Research Seminar with the theme \"Cross Disciplinary Connections in Conservation Science and Technical Art History\", and the 3rd Gordon Research Conference on Scientific Methods in Cultural Heritage Research will take place sequentially. Funding from the Kress Foundation will support more than a dozen undergraduates, graduate students, and fresh post-docs to participate in the curriculum-building workshop. This proposal requests registration and travel support for eight of these continuing students and fresh post-docs - with backgrounds in engineering and science that include applicable expertise in imaging science and technology, digital signal/image processing, or computer science - to attend the Gordon Research Seminar and Conference.",
