 "awd_abstract_narration": "Earthquakes and ocean waves generate seismic waves that travel along the surface of the earth, but with vibrations that penetrate tens to hundreds of kilometers into the solid interior.  The velocities of these waves are one of our primary means of measuring the structure of the tectonic plates (lithosphere) and the underlying convecting mantle (asthenosphere).  One of the best ways to measure the velocity is with arrays of seismic stations, either on land or on the sea floor, but the measurements are made more difficult due to multiple propagation paths from the earthquakes to the stations and by uneven distribution of ocean wave sources.  In this project, we will develop new techniques to overcome these difficulties to improve our measurements of seismic surface wave velocity and therefore our knowledge of the structure of the lithosphere and asthenosphere.  One primary goal of the new measurements is to test whether deformation of the oceanic lithosphere is fundamentally different than the asthenosphere, a controversial hypothesis that a number of recent studies have supported.\r\n\r\nThe analysis of Love and Rayleigh wave dispersion within ocean-bottom-seismometer arrays in the Pacific will test the hypothesis that radial anisotropy within the oceanic lithosphere is distinctly different than within the asthenosphere.  Several groups of investigators have reported from global tomographic studies that radial anisotropy in the upper lithosphere is either small or characterized by SV>SH in contrast to the strong anisotropy in the asthenosphere with SH>SV.  This contrast has been interpreted as indicating either the depth extent of the lithosphere or the depth extent of a depleted layer, but is in disagreement with earlier studies that showed SH>SV decreasing gradually with increasing depth. To improve the depth resolution and resolve the ambiguity about the extent of lithospheric radial anisotropy and strength of asthenospheric anisotropy, we will:  (1) extend the measurement of fundamental mode Love wave dispersion to shorter periods, (2) add measurements of higher mode phase velocity for Love and Rayleigh waves, and (3) extend higher mode analysis to short periods using ambient noise correlation to fill in the gap in sensitivity to SV in the shallow lithosphere.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOne of the best ways to detect the pattern of convective flow in the interior of the Earth is to study the propagation of seismic waves in the upper mantle.  In this project we focussed on a type of seismic surface wave called Rayleigh waves as recorded on arrays of ocean-bottom seismographs.  These horizontally propagating waves are coupled to the surface of the Earth, but penetrate into the mantle to different depths depending on the wavelength or frequency of the wave.  By measuring wave propagation properties as a function of frequency, we can infer properties of shear velocity as a function of depth within the upper mantle. \n\n \n\nIn a study in the Juan de Fuca plate area using data gathered over a 4-year period off the northwest coast of North America, we concentrated on the azimuthal dependence of the phase velocity of the waves, i.e., azimuthal anisotropy.  We showed that the azimuthal anisotropy of Rayleigh waves is consistent with the regional variations in anisotropy detected by splitting of SKS waves that travel nearly vertically through the upper mantle. Anisotropy of the Juan de Fuca plate interior is strongest (~2.4%) in the low velocity zone between ~40-90 km depth, with ENE direction of fastest propagation controlled by alignment of olivine crystals driven by relative shear between plate motion and mantle return flow toward the spreading center from the Cascadia subduction zone.   \n\n \n\nIn a second study, we concentrated on another property of wave propagation; attenuation.  In this project, we measured the attenuation of Rayleigh waves within an ocean-bottom seismograph array located on ~ 70 million-year-old seafloor in the central Pacific.  We showed that Q of shear waves is about 1400 in the lithospheric mantle shallower than 70 km, i.e., little attenuation (1/Q), and about 110 in the asthenospheric mantle deeper than 110 km.  Assuming that an attenuation or absorption peak is caused by elastically accommodated grain-boundary sliding, the increase in attenuation in the asthenosphere requires a decrease in grain-boundary viscosity of 3 to 4 orders of magnitude.  This change in viscosity is probably associated with an increase in water content of the mantle below a dehydrated lithosphere.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/27/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Donald W Forsyth"
