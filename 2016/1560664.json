Specific research that would immediately benefit from the proposed SIRMS includes study of paleo-redox conditions in ancient oceans, marine food web dynamics, and linkages between sulfate-reducing microbes with production of methyl-mercury.  \r\n\r\nThe instrument would be housed in the NSF-supported FSU National High Magnetic Field Laboratory (NHMFL) that benefits students, faculty members, and researchers across FSU as well as numerous visiting scientists from other universities and the surrounding community.  In addition to student training in methods of stable isotopic analysis as applied to paleorecords research the investigators plan local K-12 outreach utilizing the instrument.  This support is congruent with NSFs mission of promoting the progress of science and advancing the national welfare given the importance of student training in analytical techniques in geochemistry and chemistry to support future scientific workforce needs. \r\n\r\n***",
