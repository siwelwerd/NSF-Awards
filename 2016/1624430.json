 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) and Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Programs, Professor Anne McCoy from the University of Washington and colleagues Thomas Dunning, Xiaosong Li, W. James Pfaendtner and Marshall Reschke have acquired a computer cluster with multicore microprocessors. The acquisition enables computational scientists and engineers to develop effective programming techniques for distributing the computational workload over multiple cores (processor units) both within a microprocessor and across microprocessors. The installed computer cluster advances the use of computational technology to study a broad range of chemistry research questions with users from across the campus from the physical sciences (chemistry, biochemistry and physics) and engineering (chemical, electrical and bioengineering). These researchers share research interests that focus on molecular and nanoscale materials, systems and processes. This computational resource is used in research and in course instruction in chemistry, applied mathematics and astronomy to train undergraduate and graduate students in up-to-date computational methods. The computer clsuter is also used in an outreach program with students at Bellevue College. \r\n\r\nThe award is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels, especially in research projects at the University of Washington such as (a) multi-dimensional molecular spectroscopy applications, (b) understanding and predicting properties of defect-containing nanomaterials, (c) understanding structure and dynamics at the bio/nano interface, (d) rationalizing the design of materials and (e) advancing a number of other projects in chemistry, physics, materials science and engineering.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis grant supported the purchase and deployment of a cluster, named ILAHIE (short for Tenas-Tyee Ilahie Chuck, which is a rough translation of Knights Landing in Chinook Jargon), that is part of the HYAK, the University of Washington\u2019s shared cluster supercomputer.  The ILAHIE partition consists of 51 Xeon Phi based nodes, all but one of which  has 28 cores, and five Knights Landing blades with 64 cores each.  The fifty Xeon nodes were deployed in spring 2017, and the Knights Landing blades were deployed the following spring.  The goals of this project were to provide users in the University of Washington community access to computational resources to advance research in  molecular and nanoscale science and engineering, and to provide researchers and their students with access  to next-generation computational resources along with opportunities to obtain skills needed to fully exploit these technologies in their current and future research.  ILAHIE partition has been used by thirty users, the majority of whom are graduate students and postdoctoral researchers to advance their research.  These students are distributed among ten research groups, who are engaged in research in chemical and material sciences, with projects in areas ranging from astrochemistry to biophysics, and models of systems ranging from the spectroscopy of H5+ to multiscale modeling of materials.   This work resulted in more than sixty scientific papers and contributed to the PhD thesis work of the students involved in the project.  Work also explored the promise of the Knights Landing Chipset for work in computational science and engineering.  This work was cut short by the discontinuation of this chip architecture shortly after the deployment of the cluster.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/21/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Anne B Mccoy"
