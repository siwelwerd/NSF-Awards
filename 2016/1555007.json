 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-Technical Abstract\r\nDiamond nanocrystals are being considered for a range of applications including optical bioimaging, quantum-information-processing, photocatalysis, the optical detection of electric and magnetic fields, spatially localized magnetic resonance imaging, and also for seeding the growth of diamond thin films.  In nature diamond nanocrystals are formed through non-equilibrium events including stellar supernovae or the impact of meteors on Earth.  More recently, diamond nanocrystals have been synthesized directly within laboratories through the detonation of high explosives (i.e., TNT), pulsed laser irradiation of carbon nanoparticles, or through direct growth within non-equilibrium atmospheric-pressure plasma reactors.  Size is a crucial parameter for diamond nanocrystals in that it impacts how quickly these materials are cleared from the body through filtration in the kidneys.  Furthermore, composition is critically important for diamond nanocrystals in that it determines the optical and electronic properties.  Currently there are no synthetic protocols that enable control over both the 1) size and 2) defect composition of diamond nanocrystals. This research will generate valuable fundamental knowledge for controlling both of these crucial parameters.  Additionally, there currently is no known shallow n-type donor in diamond materials.  This research will also pursue the experimental demonstration of n-type conductivity within diamond nanocrystals that would be valuable to society at large by enabling beneficial high-frequency, high-power optoelectronic devices for information processing, UV water-purification, and extreme environment coatings. The educational outreach efforts proposed here will build a learning pathway for senior undergraduate students to develop skills with advanced numerical methods through the development of a numerical computing module integrated within the existing engineering curriculum at the University of Washington. These skills will prepare students for careers within the optoelectronic materials industry, or for continuing their education in graduate school. Outreach efforts to Native Alaskan elementary students, undergraduates in the Alaska Native Science & Engineering Program at the University of Alaska, and Indigenous Alliance outreach at UW will help inspire & retain the next generation of underrepresented materials scientists.\r\n\r\nTechnical Abstract\r\nCurrently there are no options in the scientific literature for rationally synthesizing nanodiamonds with precise 1) sizes and 2) compositions. The intellectual merit of this proposal rests on generating new knowledge for how to use high-pressure/high-temperature diffusion-doping to generate precise 1) sizes and 2) optoelectronic point-defects in nanodiamond. With support from the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program, four primary research milestones will be pursued over 5 years: 1) Test the hypothesis that reducing the grain-size of amorphous-carbon nanoparticles will reduce the thermodynamic conditions necessary to produce nanoscale diamond grains through high-pressure/high-temperature techniques. The chemical-potential for carbon atoms at the surface of amorphous-carbon is size-dependent (stemming from the Gibbs-Thomson effect) which may lower the minimum temperature and pressure of the amorphous-carbon / diamond phase-transition. 2) A predictive numerical model will be employed for photothermal heating of highly-absorbing amorphous-carbon materials in the laser-heated diamond anvil cell based on an analytical eigenfunction expansion solution for the energy partial differential equation using spherical coordinates. 3) Molecular doping strategies will be used to control the concentration of model point-defects using either silicon- or nickel- heteroatoms within the diamond lattice. 4) Prior results for synthesizing doped diamond nanocrystals from amorphous-carbon will inform high-risk / high-reward experimental efforts to observe a theoretically-proposed, polyatomic n-type defect center in diamond. The experimental & theoretical approaches will provide an integrated understanding of how the size and composition of amorphous-carbon grains determine final nanodiamond properties",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThis award enabled the development of new high-pressure, high-temperature (HPHT) synthetic methods using specific molecules to synthesize nanodiamond materials with controlled amounts of atomic impurities (dopants). Historically nanodiamond materials have been made through detonating high explosives similar to TNT. During explosions it is difficult to control the pressure and the temperature during the production of nanodiamonds because of the rapid speed of shock-waves produced during these detonations. Controlling the composition of nanodiamonds that are made during detonations also is challenging because the chemistry of high explosives frequently prevents including other elements in high-explosive molecules. Results from this CAREER award demonstrated that nanodiamond materials can be synthesized under controlled HPHT conditions where both the pressure and temperature are controlled in a laser-heated diamond anvil cell (LHDAC). The pressure inside a LHDAC apparatus is controlled through the use of a pressure transmitting medium based on chemically-inert noble gases like neon or argon. The temperature in the LHDAC is controlled through adjusting the power of a laser that is focused on a porous, black carbon-aerogel target material. The black carbon-aerogel absorbs the majority of the laser energy, but does not conduct heat away from the laser spot due to the high, sponge-like porosity of the black carbon material. The high optical absorption and low thermal conductivity of carbon aerogel lead to temperatures close to 2,000 K, which is one-third the temperature at the surface of the sun. This award also demonstrated that the composition of synthesized diamonds can also be tailored through using chemical reactions with molecules that contain elements different from carbon during the synthesis of the carbon aerogel. Well-defined amounts of impurity dopant atoms can be added within the diamond crystal lattice through controlling the concentration of specific molecular precursors that contain these different elements, including, but not limited to, silicon and nickel. Adding silicon atoms to the diamond crystal leads to the formation of a new color center defect that emits light in the near-infrared spectral region. The color of light emitted by this defect changes with pressure, and could be used in the future as a sensor of extremely high (gigapascal) pressures. One gigapascal is equal to roughly 10,000 atmospheres of pressure. This project has also led to several broader impacts. For example, the silicon color center defect has been proposed to be useful in future applications related to secure optical quantum communication. Before this research project it was widely hypothesized that the chemically-inert noble gases used as a high pressure transmitting media (neon & argon) do not participate in the chemical formation of diamond material. This award reported the first observation of the incorporation of the noble gas argon in diamond materials made at HPHT conditions. Published results from this research have led to one issued US Patent that could be used in the future production of nanodiamond based quantum materials. This award has also led to several educational broader impacts. Two graduate students who have been supported on this project have earned PhDs that have helped them transition into careers in both entrepreneurship and also within academia. Collaborative outreach efforts from this award have also led to the translation of an elementary school science presentation from the English language into the local Alaska Native Cupig dialect spoken in Southwest Alaska.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/21/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: PeterPauzauskie\n"
