Billerman\r\n\r\nProposal number 1612277\r\n\r\nThis action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2016, Research Using Biological Collections. The fellowship supports a research and training plan for the Fellow to take transformative approaches to grand challenges in biology that employ biological collections in highly innovative ways. The title of the research plan for this fellowship to Shawn M. Billerman is \"Specimen-based comparisons of hybridization: the effect of genetic and environmental forces on hybrid zones in a suture zone.\" The host institution for this fellowship is Cornell University and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Irby Lovette. \r\n\r\nThe goal of this research is to explore how genetic and environmental mechanisms influence speciation in suture zones. Hybrid zones are places where the ranges of two previously isolated populations of two different species overlap, where the two species interbreed. These areas of active hybridization are often regarded as natural laboratories in which to study speciation. While studies of single hybrid zones have improved our understanding of evolutionary processes, we can better test for the general factors that contribute to the creation of biodiversity by investigating and comparing multiple hybrid zones. Suture zones, where multiple hybrid zones cluster in geographic space, represent particularly powerful opportunities to identify the shared environmental and genetic mechanisms that contribute to speciation. The Fellow is comparing patterns of hybridization across five different pairs of bird species that meet and hybridize in the Great Plains of North America. Using historical bird specimens in the Cornell University Museum of Vertebrates, the Fellow is investigating how different conditions affect speciation through time. This comparative approach combines studying movement of genes across hybrid zones, how plumage traits are distributed across the landscape relative to the genetic background of each species pair, and how past changes in climate have affected changes in the distributions of each hybrid zone over time. The Fellow is leveraging a unique series of hybrid zone specimens collected in the 1950s and 60s that allow for comparison and identification of the mechanisms regulating suture zone dynamics at an unprecedented scale and level of detail.\r\n\r\nThe Fellow is receiving training in the extraction of genetic material from museum specimens, and learning new analytical skills for using extremely large, genome-wide datasets. In particular, the Fellow is learning how to assemble whole-genome sequence data and develop tools to identify genomic regions of particular importance for speciation and biodiversity. He is also developing outreach material for the public by leveraging the resources of project eBird, an NSF funded citizen science program run by the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, to educate the public about how studying hybridization can help reveal the impact of climate change on biodiversity. The Fellow is also developing educational modules for the Cornell Lab of Ornithology that emphasize the value of studying hybrid zones and hybridization. Finally, the Fellow is mentoring undergraduate researchers.",

While studies of hybrid zones at a single point in time are important and informative, comparisons across multiple time points, and across multiple different hybrid zones, help us to understand how mechanisms that contribute to reproductive isolation change over time, and how they may influence speciation on a broader geographic scale. The Great Plains of North America is a particularly well-known and well-studied region where 5 pairs of avian taxa hybridize extensively. Part of what makes the Great Plains hybrid zones particularly powerful to study are the data we have: all of these hybrid zones are represented by incredible series of specimens from the 1950s and 1960s that provide important benchmarks for understanding how hybrid zones have changed over time.

I used a unique series of museum specimens housed at the Cornell University Museum of Vertebrates (CUMV), which includes historical specimens from the Eastern Towhee (<em>Pipilo erythrophthalmus</em>) and Spotted Towhee (<em>P. maculatus</em>) hybrid zone, and historical specimens from the Baltimore Oriole (<em>Icterus galbulus</em>) and Bullock&rsquo;s Oriole (<em>I. bullockii</em>) hybrid zone. To sample genetic data from historical specimens, I used a new approach called hyRAD, hybrid capture using RAD probes, which is particularly well suited for sequencing degraded DNA from museum specimens. Analysis of the towhee hybrid zone suggests that there is extensive hybridization across a relatively wide area of the Great Plains, with most individuals from the hybrid zone showing evidence of mixed ancestry. Contrary to the towhees, preliminary analysis of the historical oriole hybrid zone suggests relatively little hybridization, with hybrid individuals restricted to a fairly narrow region in the Great Plains. By characterizing the genetic structure of each of these hybrid zones in detail, and by assessing the concordance of different genetic patterns within each hybrid zone, we can better understand the relative contribution of intrinsic, lineage-specific selection pressures to hybrid zone maintenance.</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>In addition to studying patterns of genetic introgression, I also studied the role that climate plays in patterns of past and current hybridization.

Further, I also found that over time not all hybrid zones tracked changes in climate in the same way, suggesting that climate may not be the main factor influencing hybrid zone position and maintenance over time in the Great Plains.
