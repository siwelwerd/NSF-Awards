Stem cellbased regenerative therapies are among the most promising treatment techniques. However, cells derived from stem cells are not uniform; only some percentage of the initial cell culture develops into the cell type of interest. Undifferentiated cells that remain within the cell population could lead to tumor.\r\nFurthermore, immature cells or cells with over-sensitivity would hinder the synchronous beating of the heart muscle cells, which can cause heart failure. Current methods to examine the purity of stem-cell based heart cells depend on cell surface markers, which is not a precise way to determine cellular functionality. This proposal offers a high-throughput screening technique to directly measure the\r\nfunctionality of differentiated heart muscle cells through their specific membrane potential changes during contraction. The proposed molecular-nanoplasmonic label-free voltage sensors will allow screening of single cell membrane potentials within confluent cell cultures and provide an accurate method for selecting and purifying functional cells from a mixed group. Development of such a precise technique would present a remarkable technological leap in stem cell-based research and strategies for cardiac regeneration. In addition to scientific and technological advancements, this research program will provide educational opportunities to underrepresented groups and minorities, and enhance involvement of undergraduate and graduate students in nanoscience and technology.\r\n\r\nTechnical Abstract: The objective of this research proposal is to introduce ultrasensitive molecularplasmonic voltage probes for non-invasive, real-time and subcellular precision mapping of cardiac cell membrane potentials. These electrophysiological nanoprobes could have significant impact in differentiation of stem cell derived cardiac cells through massively parallel and precise mapping of single\r\ncell membrane potentials. Given the lack of experimental electrophysiological techniques with high spatial and temporal precision capabilities, this research program could significantly contribute to cardiac cell studies and regenerative therapies. The specific objectives of this research program are:\r\n(1) to develop molecular-plasmonic voltage sensors by using electromagnetic simulations, high throughput fabrication and chemical synthesis techniques, and optical/electrical characterization.\r\n(2) to realize real time and label free detection of tiny potential variations at diffraction limited spot sizes with microsecond temporal resolutions and high signal-to-noise ratios.\r\n(3) to achieve non-destructive imaging of single cells in large cell populations and distinguish individual cell characteristics in -cultured/multiple cell state.\r\n\r\nThe proposed research program involves theoretical understanding and numerical design of molecularplasmonic devices. Devices merging nano/micro-meter components will be fabricated using state of lithography and synthesis techniques. Fabricated devices will be tested using excitable cell populations with varying densities and cell compositions. Furthermore, changes in the membrane potentials of\r\ncardiomyocytes that are being differentiated from hiPSC will be measured in real-time.",

In this sense, development of techniques optically mapping the electrogenic signals has created substantial interest within the scientific community. Photons are remarkably efficient reporters; light offers exceptional spatiotemporal resolution, unparalleled multiplexing, and high-bandwidth operation capabilities well beyond limits of electronic technologies. Harvesting photons for electrophysiological studies, on the other hand, largely depends on our ability to recruit efficient reporters converting local electrogenic activity to high photon count far-field signals. Yet, progress toward that goal remains elusive due to lack of electro-optic translators that can efficiently convert electrical activity to high photon count optical signals. To date, there were very few attempts to use plasmonic nanoantenna to measure local field dynamics. In principle, plasmonic nanoresonators with exceptionally large cross sections offer orders of magnitude enhanced photon-flux measurements from diffraction-limited volumes. However, electro-optic (non-Faradaic charging/discharging) effects in plasmonic devices are extremely weak due to the extremely high electron densities of metals. As a result, optical field measurements using plasmonic nanostructures are readily dominated by shot noise.</p>\n<p>This project focuses on development of electro-active plasmonic nanoantenna, extremely bright label-free optical field probes overcoming the photon count and field sensitivity limitations of state-of-the-art optical electric field reporters. Our electro-plasmonic field sensors consist of precisely designed and fabricated plasmonic nanoantenna structures that are loaded with electrochromic polymer loads. To achieve, ultrasensitive and high signal-to-noise ratio measurements, we incorporated active lumped nanocircuit elements that are analogous to tunable radio frequency (RF) antennas. We used biocompatible electrochromic polymer poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) as an electric field?controlled antenna load enabling active and reversible tuning of the plasmonic resonances, in a similar fashion to tunable radio antennas. In reverse operation mode, this electrochromically loaded plasmonic (electro-plasmonic) nanoantenna functions as a reporter of the local electric-field dynamics and electrophysiological activity to the far field.
