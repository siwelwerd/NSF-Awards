 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation Program (MRI) and support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program (CRIF), Professor Paul Bonvallet from College of Wooster and colleagues Judith Amburgey-Peters, Mark Snider, Sarah Sobeck and Spring Knapp have acquired a 400 MHz NMR spectrometer equipped with a broadband probe. This spectrometer allows research in a variety of fields such as those that accelerate chemical reactions of significant economic importance, as well as the study of biologically relevant species. In general, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the study of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution or in the solid state.  The results from these NMR studies have an impact in synthetic organic/inorganic chemistry, materials chemistry, forensics and biochemistry. This instrument is an integral part of teaching as well as research performed by undergraduate students via independent student research and traditional academic coursework.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe award is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels, especially in: (a) synthesizing small-molecule analogues of the phospholipid phosphatidylserine; (b) designing supramolecular chemistry of light-activated molecular containers, (c) studying dehydrogenative coupling reactions to improve atom economy in organic synthesis, (d) studying diastereoselective syntheses using multi-component reactions, (e) elucidating enzymatic mechanisms in nicotinate biodegradation by aerobic bacteria, and (f) probing the influence of the molecular environment on the photochemistry of ultraviolet absorbers.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nNuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometry is an essential tool for determining the composition and structure of matter.  Using the same technology as magnetic resonance imagining (MRI), NMR provides information about the fundamental arrangement and bonding of atoms.  This instrumental method is used in basic research and applied fields including biochemistry, synthetic chemistry, environmental science, and nanotechnology.\n\nThe replacement of the old NMR spectrometer at the College of Wooster (purchased in 1999) has led to transformative advances in our research and teaching.  In a little over two years, more than 400 undergraduate students and researchers have conducted 6,000 experiments to support scientific inquiry in the classroom, instructional laboratory, and research laboratory.  NMR has been the primary method of analysis for dozens of undergraduate research projects that include:\n\nPreparation and mechanical function of hollow photo-active molecules that can open and close in response to light.  This system may be used for the update, storage, and release of drugs or environmental contaminants.\nDesign of catalysts that can make polymers from renewable plant-based sources rather than petrochemical sources.\nDetermining the pathway by which carminic acid degrades under UV light.  Carminic acid is a red pigment used in classical paintings that have faded over time.  This project intersects with anthropology and the preservation of cultural heritage.\nSynthesis and detection of organic compounds that play a role in aerosols.  These experiments provide insight about air pollution and atmospheric chemistry.\nInvestigating the mechanism by which Bacillus niacini bacteria break down nicotine and nicotinic acid \"fuels\" as part of their metabolic cycle.\nIdentifying, preparing, and screening candidate compounds to combat antibiotic-resistant bacteria.\n\n\nThe automated sample changer on the new NMR speeds up throughput by collecting data automatically from a series of samples.  Its user-friendly interface has substantially lowered the barrier to training new and younger students to use the instrument.  We can also conduct variable-temperature experiments, where for example an enzyme can be maintained at an optimum temperature or bond rotations can be examined according to their behavior at high and low temperatures.\n\nThe College of Wooster is an all-undergraduate college with a longstanding commitment to excellence in undergraduate research.  This commitment is embodied by Senior Independent Study, a program in which every senior pursues a yearlong self-designed research project in collaboration with a faculty mentor.  Consequently, our classes and laboratories throughout the curriculum emphasize open-ended inquiry, peer collaboration, and intellectual independence.  NMR is the cornerstone instrumental method in Organic Chemistry and related courses.  In addition to the routine characterization of reactants and products, the new instrument has enhanced our ability to use research as a form of teaching.  Housed under a new $40 million integrated life science facility that connects with the chemistry building, the students in our instructional laboratories have undertaken new experiments like identifying the products of enzyme reactions and creating novel multi-step organic chemistry reactions. \n\nBecause every Wooster student participates in research, we have established an inclusive atmosphere that promotes contributions from students from historically underrepresented groups.  NMR is often the first encounter with modern high-end research instrumentation experienced by Wooster\u2019s ever-increasing diverse student population (22% domestic students of color, 16% international students representing 61 countries).  The College of Wooster is among the top in the nation for graduates who eventually earn a Ph.D.; these statistics are even higher for the Departments of Chemistry specifically and especially high for its female graduates.  Thus the acquisition of a new NMR spectrometer has contributed tremendously to the preparation and training of the next generation of young scientists and professionals.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/19/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Paul A Bonvallet"
