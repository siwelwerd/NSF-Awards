 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will integrate biological and planetary change across geological timescales by developing a more accurate and precise time-calibrated Tree of Life (ToL), i.e., a Chronogram of Life (CoL) based on novel methods for dating microbial evolution. The geological record has long been our sole source of information about planetary history. In contrast, the deep time record preserved within genomes has only been recently discovered, and remains poorly characterized. When unlocked through phylogenetic analysis, molecular clocks, and robust calibration, this genomic record will provide unique insights into geochemical, atmospheric, and climate processes across Earth's history. The timing of many events linking the co-evolution of life and the planet remain uncertain. This is especially true for very early events in Earth's history, where the fossil and geochemical record is often sparse, ambiguous, or entirely absent.  In fact, across much of the Archaean (and possibly Hadean) Eons, the only remaining record may be the one preserved within genomes. To reveal this record, the research has three major aims: (1) identifying ancient time calibrations in genome evolution across the ToL by using HGT (Horizontal Gene Transfer) events via genome stratigraphy; (2) linking the fossil record to microbial history via sequencing co-evolving microbiomes of ancient animal lineages; and (3) developing new bioinformatics approaches to integrate these constraints, generating an accurate and reliable chronology of early life evolution and planetary history, directly testing several hypotheses related to the deep biogeochemical history of the Earth.\r\n\r\nThe deep, intertwined relationship between the evolution of life and the planet is of fundamental importance. While many previous investigations have proposed scenarios linking events in early microbial evolution to the preserved biogeochemical record, in order to actually test these different co-evolutionary hypotheses, independent methods are required to time-calibrate microbial evolution itself. To this end, the key intellectual contribution of this work is using horizontal gene transfer (HGT) as a powerful new tool for determining the timing of events on the early Earth. Flows of genes across the ToL constrain the relative divergence times of distantly related lineages. This interpretation of HGT permits genomic stratigraphy, wherein time calibrations available for some groups within the ToL (i.e., via biomarker and/or fossil records) can be propagated to other groups. This approach is analogous to biostratigraphy, which uses the presence or absence of different fossils to date strata of sedimentary rocks. Similarly, dates from fossil calibrations can be propagated across the ToL through co-speciation events, as are often observed between microbial symbionts and their animal hosts. Expanding this technique to previously unsampled microbiomes of the most ancient arthropod lineages will greatly extend the temporal reach of this method. Together, these novel stratigraphic uses for genomic information will translate the ToL into an accurate CoL. This work will permit direct evaluation of major questions in the evolution of Earth's early biosphere, geosphere and atmosphere, including the emergence of oxygenic and anoxygenic photosynthesis, methane production via methanogenesis, and the establishment of microbial nitrogen, carbon, sulfur,\r\nand oxygen cycles",

This has been accomplished by the development of new methods for using horizontal gene transfers (HGTs) for improving divergence time estimates of molecular clock analyses. In this way, this work has leveraged the genomic record better trace the history of living systems and the planetary events and processes that life has endured and actively shaped.&nbsp; These research outcomes include tracing the oxygen-dependent biosynthesis of eukaryotic sterol molecules back to the first appearance of atmospheric oxygen during the &ldquo;Great Oxygenation Event&rdquo; (GOE), long before any existing paleontological or geochemical evidence of eukaryotes (Gold et al., 2016); constraining methanogenesis to evolving over 3.5 billion years ago, potentially providing a &ldquo;methane greenhouse&rdquo; solution to the Faint Young Sun Paradox, permitting liquid surface water on the early Earth (Wolfe &amp; Fournier, 2018); constraining the relative ages of major groups of photosynthetic bacteria and the history of their photosystems (Magnabosco et al., 2018); and tracing HGTs of monooxygenase genes as a proxy for periods of increased carbon burial rates leading to atmospheric oxygenation during the Proterozoic (Shang et al., in revision).</p>\n<p>We also developed an automated computational pipeline for comprehensively detecting time-constraining HGTs from large phylogenomic databases, and two novel approaches to apply these index HGTs to improve molecular clocks, by empirically testing different evolutionary models for their consistency with this independent source of relative dating information, and by constraining the sampling of molecular clock age distributions to only include estimates consistent with index HGT relative age constraints (e.g., Figure 1).</p>\n<p>Using this new approach, we obtained revised age estimates for the origin of cyanobacteria and oxygenic photosynthesis. We showed that oxygenic photosynthesis evolved over half a billion years before the GOE, between 3.4 and 2.9 billion years ago (Figure 2) independently supporting arguments for an extensive geochemical record of trace oxygen during the Archean (Fournier et al., 2021). This work also showed the first genomic evidence of a microbial mass extinction/recovery event occurring in Earth&rsquo;s history, with today&rsquo;s most abundant group of marine cyanobacteria tracing their history to shortly after the Cryogenian &ldquo;Snowball Earth&rdquo; likely eradicated more ancient planktonic diversity. Finally, this investigation also improved age estimates for the last common ancestor of all Bacteria, showing that this radiation of major bacterial groups likely occurred between 3.75 and 3.55 billion years ago.&nbsp; This provides a valuable temporal constraint on the presence of a planetary biosphere, independent of geochemical evidence or other hypotheses, such as impact frustration during a hypothesized &ldquo;Late Heavy Bombardment&rdquo; (Fournier et al., 2021).</p>\n<p>We also showed that genomes contain additional untapped information for dating microbial groups, as some metabolic features of microbial genomes can be used as &ldquo;standard candles&rdquo;.&nbsp; We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in (Gruen et al. 2019) tracing the evolution of bacterial chitin-degrading enzymes, showing that major groups of soil bacteria independently inherited chitinases around 420 to 350 million years ago, coincident with the diversification of terrestrial arthropods.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The project outcomes fulfill the goals of the proposed intellectual merit of this work.&nbsp; Specifically, we effectively demonstrate that including HGT events as relative timing constraints significantly informs divergence time estimates.&nbsp; This additional source of dating information is not only consistent with dates estimated using fossil calibrations, but generally doubles overall precision (Fournier et al., 2021).&nbsp; Additionally, we show that evolutionary models are a major source of age uncertainty, and that the relative dating information within HGTs can independently validate evolutionary rate models, effectively reducing this uncertainty.&nbsp; &nbsp;We also demonstrate that the divergence time estimates obtained for microbial lineages and individual gene family histories significantly inform biogeochemical hypotheses, specifically, for the Archean production and presence of oxygen (Fournier et al. 2021) and methane (Wolfe &amp; Fournier 2018), and the Paleoproterozoic production of sterols (Gold et al., 2016).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The broader impacts of our work were also successfully accomplished, including two collaborative &ldquo;Dating in Deep Time&rdquo; workshops bringing together evolutionary biologists, geologists, and planetary scientists.&nbsp; These workshops were well attended by scientists at all career levels, including undergraduate and graduate students, postdocs and faculty.&nbsp; Additionally, our outreach efforts partnering with Boston Public Schools and Zoo New England were effective.&nbsp; We partnered with two classes of Middle school students from the Haley Pilot School in Boston, serving racially diverse and historically disadvantaged communities based on principles of inclusion and equity.
