 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nontechnical description: The emerging field of spintronics, in analogy to electronics, envisions devices that utilize the magnetic properties of electrons instead of their electrical charges. Spintronics are anticipated to propel the next generation of ultra-miniature computational and information-storage technologies, lead to device operation speeds significantly higher than that for current electronics, while significantly decreasing energy consumption. The project highlights fundamental new materials research of organic compounds that facilitate spintronic operation at ambient temperature, providing new insights into how molecular structure governs spintronic capabilities.  The impact of this project also derives from the interdisciplinary training of a next generation of scientists, new curriculum development, as well as from recruiting, retaining, and mentoring of under-represented minorities in science and engineering. Project participants learn new science and develop important new technologies, build networks of collaborators and contacts, and acquire skills important for working in interdisciplinary environments, and are thus better equipped for future careers and leadership roles in science and technology.\r\n\r\n\r\nTechnical description: Because electron spins can be efficiently polarized by helically chiral molecular structures at room temperature, new opportunities exist to generate and manipulate polarized spin current in soft materials.  This project focuses on fundamental investigations of electron spin polarization, interactions, and transport in designed highly conjugated helically chiral superstructures. This effort begins with exploring superstructures designed to possess exceptional polarized spin transport properties, and their attachment chemistry to metallic electrodes. Model devices for testing spin-transport and related non-magnetic organic/inorganic room-temperature spin injector devices are attained through assembly and fabrication of electrode-molecule-electrode junctions using the nanotransfer printing technique. The project aims to delineate fundamental structure-property relationships in engineered helically chiral assemblies that provide new insights into the chirality-induced spin selectivity effect, while quantifying spin-dependent electronic transport through prototypical two-electrode devices, as functions of electrode material, molecular structure, and anchoring groups.",
