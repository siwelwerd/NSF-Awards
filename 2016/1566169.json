The system must integrate the heterogeneous, structured and unstructured data into an inter-operable and explorable system, one that can be re-purposed by researchers and other stakeholders in order to transfer knowledge between industry, land-use managers, government officials and the general public. This workshop brings together data developers, data managers, and data consumers from government, university, NGO, industry and other public/private sector stakeholders in order to improve the overall quality, comprehensiveness and accessibility of data. Discussions will also focus on identifying areas where improved data access for stakeholders can lead to positive outcomes and benefits for the stakeholder community as a whole. \r\n\r\nThe goals of this workshop are to identify strategies and propose next steps to improve data discoverability, preservation, accessibility, integration, and utilization for a wide range of end uses, science, policy, regulation, resource and environmental advances in the oil and gas industry. The workshop will serve to inform across and between each stakeholder group about data management needs, status of current system, and future work and directions of the community. Topics include: 1)The current state of oil and gas datasets and related data resource systems, including but not limited to challenges for the database providers and users; 2)Discussions towards a national integrated oil and gas clearing house or networked data system, including improving access, assisting compliance, and expanding the types and formats of data currently collected.",
