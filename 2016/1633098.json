 "awd_abstract_narration": "The complex interconnectivity of society's food, energy and water resources, as well as their inextricable link to socioeconomic factors, present both grand challenges and opportunities that demand new paradigms in problem solving and cooperation across non-traditional disciplines. Nowhere will this challenge be greater than in resource-constrained communities, not only in the developing world but also in the often-overlooked populations of rural America and poor urban centers, where solutions to food/energy/water challenges will need to be tailored to specific communities. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award to the University of Iowa will produce a new generation of water sustainability professionals specifically trained to promote sustainable development of food, energy and water resources in these underserved communities, not only as researchers and professors, but also as entrepreneurs, consultants, and civic, professional and global engineers. This project anticipates training fifty (50) MS and PhD students via new graduate degree and certificate programs in Sustainable Water Development, including twenty (20) funded trainees, by leveraging university expertise in all facets of water sustainability including engineering, economics, policy, law, public health, geography, ecology and informatics.\r\n\r\nThis research aims to re-envision STEM graduate education in fields related to water sustainability at the nexus of food and energy resources. We propose a new training paradigm in which educational and research activities at all degree levels (MS and PhD) are focused on experiences that connect trainees directly to the most vulnerable communities in need, thereby satisfying students' stated desires to engage in work that addresses social injustices arising from disparities in resource security. Courses, research projects, community service, and professional training experiences will all be tailored to the trainees' desired career paths. To launch this model, we will create a new graduate degree program at the University of Iowa focused on the development of sustainable water resources in resource-limited communities (e.g., rural and poor communities). The Sustainable Water Development degree will be housed in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, while building upon strengths across the campus in the area of water sustainability and emphasizing the critical roles of both water quality and quantity as well as food and energy production. Major research efforts will address high priority research needs for such communities, including: forecasting, mitigating and adapting to climate variability; innovative solutions for minimizing waste streams and promoting resource recovery; new water treatment infrastructure suitable in scale and associated energy demand for small communities; and management of biogeochemical cycles and agro-ecosystem structure to promote environmental quality. In addition, we will develop a graduate certificate program in Sustainable Water Development available to the entire graduate STEM population at the university, thereby adding valuable specialization to existing degree programs in water-relevant STEM fields (e.g., chemistry, biology, physics and mathematics).\r\n\r\nThe NSF Research Traineeship (NRT) Program is designed to encourage the development and implementation of bold, new potentially transformative models for STEM graduate education training. The Traineeship Track is dedicated to effective training of STEM graduate students in high priority interdisciplinary research areas, through the comprehensive traineeship model that is innovative, evidence-based, and aligned with changing workforce and research needs.",
