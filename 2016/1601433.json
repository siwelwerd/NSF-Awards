 "awd_abstract_narration": "How the distinction between species is recognized is becoming increasingly objective and cross-disciplinary. Despite the computational challenges of large datasets, new methods allow genetic and non-genetic data to be analyzed together. These methods offer great potential for genome-wide sampling of variation at different evolutionary scales and an opportunity to understand taxonomic groups with complex evolutionary histories. The 16 currently recognized species of hake, a commercially valuable group of fishes, are often difficult to identify because they are very similar morphologically and there is a high level of within-species variation. This confusion has increased in recent years because there has been continuous splitting and lumping of species based on limited sampling, and limited data on morphological and genetic variability. Some hake species are of conservation concern, with at least one population of the North Pacific Hake being listed under the Endangered Species Act. The poor understanding of the taxonomy of these fishes has led to inaccuracies in fisheries data, making management and conservation difficult. This research seeks to shed new light on the taxonomy of hakes by applying the new approaches of using both genetic and anatomical information together. \r\n\r\nThe possibility of genome-wide biases, such as rate heterogeneity, underscores the need for corroboration from independent data such as morphology. In contrast, morphological data contains a mixture of informative and misleading traits that are able to delimit some taxa but unable to retrieve others. This study will empirically test the applicability of new integrative methods that combine genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) and morphological data in a Bayesian framework for delimiting hake species. A two-step approach to species delimitation will be used: a species 'discovery' step (without a priori species hypotheses) to assign individuals to putative groups, followed by a 'validation' step, which tests the robustness of the groups. This study will result in a better understanding of the evolution and taxonomy of a group of commercially valuable fishes, and these results can be directly applied to fisheries management.",

Hakes, which are commercially exploited species of fishes,  can be difficult to identify due to their conservative external  morphology and high level of intraspecific variation; which leads to  mixed species landings, making management and conservation difficult.  This study focused on the evolution of hakes, their evolutionary  relationships, as well as aspects of the species-level taxonomy of the  family. This was done using genomic data from 13,771 genetic loci and 74  species (including hakes and other relatives). This study resolved the  controversy surrounding the taxonomic extent of Merlucciidae and the  phylogenetic placement of the genera historically included within the  family, based on complete taxonomic sampling at the family and subfamily  levels among gadiforms (e.g. cods, hakes, and grenadiers).  Additionally, this analysis confirmed an early separation of two  lineages of hakes, the Old World and the New World clades (Figs. 1-2).  The Old World clade includes five well defined species and the New World  clade includes three species and two complexes of species. These  results suggest the presence of only one species in the eastern Pacific  and one species in the Southern Ocean (Patagonia ? New Zealand).
