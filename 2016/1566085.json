 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms A program in the Division of Chemistry, Professors Zlatko Bacic and Mark Tuckerman of New York University are performing theoretical calculations on molecules confined in cages formed by other molecules, or within a single C60 \"Buckyball\" molecule.  They are interested in understanding how molecules such as water (H2O), hydrogen (H2) and other small molecules move when they are in restricted spaces. This theoretical study will improve the interpretation of experimental measurements, for example the results of a technique called inelastic neutron scattering (INS).  It will also have implications for the control of material properties at the molecular level (for advanced \"nanoelectronics\" applications), and possibly for the design of efficient and economical hydrogen storage media for energy technologies.  Two graduate students are directly involved as researchers in this project.  The conceptual advances and new results from this research will be integrated into educational materials for undergraduates. Finally, methodology developments achieved in this project will be incorporated into the Principal Investigators' user-friendly software tools that will be made freely available to the general community.\r\n\r\nAn array of sophisticated theoretical and computational approaches, some developed in the realization of this project, ranging from multidimensional bound-state and scattering methods to path-integral molecular dynamics (PIMD) simulations, is implemented in these investigations. The INS spectra of H2O confined in C60 are calculated with high accuracy utilizing the newly developed methodology for quantum simulation of the INS spectra of nanoconfined polyatomic molecules. The PIMD simulations of the crystalline H2O in C60, an extraordinary 3D cubic lattice of highly quantum H2O dipoles, each confined inside C60, shed light on its dielectric properties and free energetics, including the ferroelectric phase transition, arising from the many-body dipolar correlations. Path-integral simulations also probe the temperature and pressure dependence of the free energetics and approximate diffusion rates of H2 and D2 molecules in the sII clathrate hydrates, simple and binary, accounting for quantum effects and framework flexibility. These studies address the fundamental problem of the diffusion of molecular hydrogen in the quantum regime, inside a chemically and structurally complex environment. Quantum treatment of the condensed-phase effects, including the proton disorder of the framework water molecules, on the \"rattling\" dynamics and the INS spectra of H2 in the sII clathrate hydrate addresses the general question of how the dynamical and spectroscopic properties of guest molecules inside a host environment evolve and approach their bulk limits.",
