 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal was submitted in response to EHR Core Research (ECR) program announcement NSF 15-509. The ECR program of fundamental research in STEM education provides funding in critical research areas that are essential, broad and enduring. EHR seeks proposals that will help synthesize, build and/or expand research foundations in the following focal areas: STEM learning, STEM learning environments, STEM workforce development, and broadening participation in STEM. The ECR program is distinguished by its emphasis on the accumulation of robust evidence to inform efforts to (a) understand, (b) build theory to explain, and (c) suggest interventions (and innovations) to address persistent challenges in STEM interest, education, learning, and participation.\r\n\r\nThe study will investigate the processes that connect gestures and mathematics learning. Gestures are an important yet under-investigated aspect of mathematics teaching. They can influence students' memory and understanding of mathematical representations. The series of studies will examine students' learning of the concept of mathematical equivalence by testing instruction that incorporates commonly used verbal explanations and gestures. Mathematical equivalence includes understanding the meaning of the equal sign and determining if two expressions are equal. Second and third grade children will be participants.  Of particular interest in the studies is the influence of gestures on preexisting knowledge of procedures, how gestures support learning beyond emphasizing information and direct learners' attention, and the creation of procedural knowledge. \r\n\r\nThe series of experimental studies will examine the mechanisms that connect gestures and procedural understanding of mathematical equivalence. The studies begin in the first phase with examining how gesture is connected to procedural knowledge of mathematical equivalence. Subsequent studies investigate how gesture functions as a mechanism for learning beyond emphasizing or directing attention to relevant information. Data collected will students' responses to equivalence problems and eye tracking data to follow whether students are looking from one side of the equal sign to the other. In the second phase of the work, the studies will examine how gesture has beneficial effects on learning more generally in mathematics. Working memory will be assessed in order to examine the role of gesture across different individuals. Fraction tasks will be used to examine the generalization of the previous results regarding gestures to other mathematics concepts.",

Research has shown that hand gestures can benefit both speech comprehension, memory, and various types of learning. In the present project, we focused on the role of gesture in learning mathematical equivalence (i.e. 6 + 3 + 5 = __ + 5). Mathematical equivalence knowledge is foundational for higher forms of math learning. That is, in order to understand advanced mathematical concepts, such as algebra, children must be able to solve mathematical equivalence. Our prior work showed that when instructors use hand gestures while teaching mathematical equivalence, children learn more, retain the information better, and are better able to transfer their knowledge to different types of related problems. In the present project, we sought to better understand why gesture improves learning, how it does so, and whether the benefit of gesture is similar across individuals. Our project revealed several novel and important findings. Importantly, we found that not all individuals benefited equally from gesture during instruction. In children, prior knowledge of how to solve complex arithmetic affected the benefit from gesture. Gesture does not benefit all children equally but seems to benefit children with specific prior knowledge. Similarly, we found that in adults, gesture was more beneficial to adults who were better able to hold spatial information in memory whereas the ability to hold verbal information in memory did not affect the benefit derived from gesture. To better understand the impact of gesture on learning, we instructed children with gesture on multiple occasions. All prior work has used gesture during instruction on only a single occasion. In this work, we found that the benefit of gesture does not increase with repeated exposure. Learning improves when gesture is present during instruction but the benefits of gesture seem to be limited to this first exposure. In addition, to better understand how gesture improves learning, we tracked children?s eye gaze during learning and during subsequent problem-solving. Tracking eye gaze allows us to better understand where attention is allocated during learning and whether gesture changed attention allocation after learning was complete. Here, we found that children who observe gesture during instruction attend to problems differently when solving problems on their own, after instruction, compared with children who do not observe gesture during instruction. This is critical because it means that gesture changes how children subsequently solve problems, even when gesture is no longer present, suggesting a lasting impact of gesture. To summarize, this project provides insight into the factors that determine the benefit derived from gesture and the impact of gesture during instruction. It also gives new understanding of how gesture helps to change the way that learners attend to and think about problems. This work has important implications for harnessing gesture in support of mathematical learning in both children and adults.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 02/28/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Kimberly&nbsp;M&nbsp;Fenn</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImage\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation onePhoto\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1561122/1561122_10456519_1677628872630_NSF-outcomes-1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1561122/1561122_10456519_1677628872630_NSF-outcomes-1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Training Videos\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1561122/1561122_10456519_1677628872630_NSF-outcomes-1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Training Videos\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Image captures from matched Gesture (left) and Speech Alone (right) training videos.
