 "awd_abstract_narration": "1604984\r\nXin, Hongliang\r\n\r\nThe proposed work is a computational study aimed at identifying novel multimetallic nanomaterials for the efficient electrochemical conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2) to value-added chemicals and fuels. This has the dual benefit of reducing the emissions of the greenhouse gas CO2 and moving closer to a sustainable energy future based on a closed loop carbon cycle fueled by a combination of solar energy and electrochemical conversion processes. \r\n\r\nPrior research has demonstrated that copper (Cu) nanocubes exhibit remarkable selectivity towards carbon-carbon bond formation, but with electrical efficiency too low to be commercially viable. The study is based on the hypothesis that multimetallic nanocubes consisting of precisely mixed, low-cost metals can convert CO2 to useful chemicals and fuels at higher efficiency and selectivity than the Cu nanocubes alone. The researchers bring together expertise in density functional theory calculations and ab initio molecular dynamics - aided by advanced machine-learning algorithms - to predict materials combinations that lower the over-potential for electrochemical reduction of CO2 to ethylene and ethanol. The research is based on a three-step approach that first unravels the active site and reaction mechanism of CO2 reduction on Cu nanocubes, then creates predictive models linking nanoparticle composition and structure to the surface reactivity by machine-learning models, and lastly, develops an integrated framework for accelerating catalyst discovery. The broader impact of the work will be enhanced through educational outreach activities and open-source access to the tools developed during the course of the project.",

Design of optimal active sites with targeted descriptor values aided by quantum-chemical methods is appealing while remaining as a daunting task due to the high computational cost of accurately solving the many-electron Schrodinger equation and a theoretically infinite number of candidate materials. This project funded by NSF CBET catalysis program addresses this challenge by uniquely integrating electronic structure methods with advanced machine learning (ML) algorithms in a user-friendly computational framework. By learning correlated interactions of atoms, ions, and molecules in proximity of catalytic sites from ab initio data, for example using neural networks, it is possible to screen materials with desired properties orders of magnitude faster than current practices. In contrast to the traditional computing which employs the hand-coded instructions provided by experts, the AI platform teaches itself by seeing more and more examples using algorithms. Simply speaking, the approach offers the possibility of training computers with the known catalytic properties of materials from first principles and predicts champion catalysts for a reaction of interest. Using artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning to speed up the process has received significant attention in catalysis community and could dramatically shrink the timeline for materials discovery. With the ML-augmented design approach, the project has identified a few promising copper (Cu) multimetallics with a higher energy conversion efficiency in CO2 reduction to ethylene, an extremely useful chemical in industry. Harnessing CO2 through electrocatalysis is an appealing approach because of its potential to utilize the abundant greenhouse gas in the Earth's atmosphere and the electricity from intermittent renewable sources, to yield fuels and chemicals that are traditionally derived from petroleum. The project supports PI Xin's dedications to data science education in the chemical sciences, which consist of efforts to involve undergraduates and underrepresented minorities in AI research, K-12 outreach activities, data science tools development, and inclusion of data science into undergraduate curriculum. In the last 5 years, Xin has mentored 7 undergraduate students on this project, 4 of whom are female. Three of the undergraduates have co-authored 4 publications in high-impact journals. Those research opportunities provide undergraduates with valuable hands-on modeling experience, prepare them for the workforce or higher education, and inspire their curiosity and interest in STEM. In addition, 3 out of 9 current and recently graduated PhD students in Xin's research group are female. PI Xin had leveraged this award to develop an elective course, entitled ?Data Science for Chemical Engineers?. The course was open to both undergraduate and graduate students. Students from engineering and science disciplines were engaged in practicing machine learning algorithms, data science tools, and Python programming. To gain a broader impact and resonate with the college of engineering strategic planning, this course will make its transition into a permanent course for the chemical sciences at VT via involvement of cross-college teaching collaborations and trans-disciplinary problems.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 09/29/2020<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Hongliang&nbsp;Xin</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImage\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation onePhoto\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1604984/1604984_10433792_1601387904927_ProjectScheme--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1604984/1604984_10433792_1601387904927_ProjectScheme--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Project Overview\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1604984/1604984_10433792_1601387904927_ProjectScheme--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Project Overview\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Overview of the machine learning approach to accelerating catalytic materials discovery.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Hongliang Xin</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Hongliang&nbsp;Xin</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Project Overview</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
