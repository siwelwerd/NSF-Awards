 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award from The Major Research Instrumentation and Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Programs, Professor Malcolm D. Forbes from Bowling Green University Main Campus and colleagues H. Peter Lu, Alexander Tarnovsky, Ksenija Glusac and Alexis Ostrowski have acquired an ultrafast laser amplification system. Ultrafast lasers are powerful tools in the investigation of photochemistry and photophysical processes such as the conversion of sunlight into energy as in solar cells or the production of carbohydrates in plants by photosynthesis. The time scale of such processes is often very fast, even femtoseconds (ten to minus fifteen seconds). The instrumentation is used in research and training by undergraduate and graduate students as well as high schools students preparing them for technical careers and advanced education.  \r\n\r\nThe award is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels, especially in areas investigated at Bowling Green State University such as studying (a) fundamental research in solar energy conversion, (b) photocatalysis, (c) ultrafast molecular reactions, (d) proton-coupled electron transfer reactions, (e) water splitting reactions for the development of inexpensive alternative energy resources, (f) single molecule imaging of biomolecules and (g) the development of photo-tunable materials.",
