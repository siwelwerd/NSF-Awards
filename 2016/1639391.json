For the 40% of food that never reaches human consumption, the significant energy and water resources that went into its production are lost, and new environmental challenges emerge, such as greenhouse gases emissions from landfilling food waste, the conventional management practice in the US. While sustainable alternatives exist for converting food waste into clean energy resources or value-added products and can lead to economic growth and environmental benefits, widespread adoption of these practices is limited by a lack of knowledge about food waste composition and location, inefficient technologies for converting mixed waste streams, and inconsistent food waste policies. To address these challenges, the PIs will make fundamental advances in understanding and improving the technical feasibility, economic costs, and environmental benefits associated with new technologies, policies, and waste infrastructure designs for sustainable food waste-to-energy systems. The planned scientific advances in food waste minimization and management are expected to catalyze new industries and jobs in the US, by translating research findings for stakeholders in the industrial and policy sectors, and to enhance the next generation workforce, through educational partnerships with the Rochester City School District and the National Technical Institute for the Deaf. \r\n\r\nThis project will combine insight from sustainability, engineering, policy, geospatial informatics, and ecology with a goal to create and evaluate novel, integrated solutions for minimizing food waste and improving resource efficiency across the food supply chain.  Fundamental empirical and analytical research will be carried out through interconnected lines of inquiry, wherein new empirical data will be generated to characterize food waste stream heterogeneity in terms of geospatial variability and chemical composition. These data will be used to parameterize novel geospatial optimization models to identify preferred waste management system design (e.g., large-scale, centralized systems vs. drop-in, decentralized technologies) and to evaluate alternate policy strategies for waste minimization (e.g., food waste landfill ban or incentives program for food donation). Finally, three innovative food waste valorization technologies will be evaluated: food waste pre-treatment via vacuum cycle nucleation, combined anaerobic digestion-pyrolysis systems, and biogas conversion via high-temperature proton exchange membrane. Combined, these efforts will result in the first comprehensive evaluation of how physical and chemical properties of regional food waste streams vary over time and space, and in the development of fundamental relationships between waste heterogeneity and optimal policy, systems, and technology solutions.  In addition, all proposed solutions will be evaluated using \"nexus thinking,\" which will quantify holistic tradeoffs, such as waste minimization, net energy consumption, life cycle greenhouse gas emissions, impact to freshwater ecosystems, policy compliance, and economic costs.",

Immense water, energy, and natural resources are used to grow crops, feed livestock, and process food for consumption, but up to 40% of food produced is never eaten. An estimated 80 million tons of food are wasted in the U.S. annually, most of which is landfilled, leading to methane emissions and climate change impacts. Wasted food can be converted into clean energy resources or value-added bio-products, but widespread adoption of such alternatives is limited by inefficient and expensive technologies, inconsistent food waste policies, and scarce data about where, how much, and what kinds of food are wasted.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This project addressed these challenges by integrating knowledge from sustainability, engineering, policy, geospatial science, and ecology to create and evaluate novel solutions to minimize and manage food waste. The project generated new data about how wasted food quantities and composition vary by location, over time, and from different parts of the food supply chain. These data were used to create a geospatial model to determine optimal locations for siting food waste treatment systems that minimizes the distance that wastes and treatment byproducts must be hauled.&nbsp; These data also informed development and testing of technologies to effectively convert variable food waste streams into bio-energy and bio-based products.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>One of the main technologies studied was anaerobic digestion (AD), which converts food waste into biogas that may replace natural gas as a fuel for transportation or electricity.&nbsp; However, research found that a major barrier to AD adoption is the ancillary production of a liquid \"digestate.\" Research in partnership with New York State farmers determined that this digestate byproduct contains valuable nutrients and can partially replace synthetic fertilizer, but is difficult and expensive to transport and apply to farm fields. Ecological research also discovered that when digestate is over-applied to fields, the nitrogen it contains may be lost as greenhouse gas emissions or runoff that threatens local ecosystems.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>To overcome these challenges, research assessed the thermochemical conversion technology of pyrolysis, which converts solids in digestate to biochar, a carbon-rich material that can be used for enhancing soils and adsorbing pollutants. Findings demonstrated that biochar can effectively adsorb phosphate from liquid digestate, resulting in both cleaner effluent and a nutrient-enriched biochar useful for improving crop growth. Environmental life cycle assessment showed that this technology creates net benefits by reducing risks of nutrient pollution to local ecosystems, but may create tradeoffs by requiring added energy and processing steps. Ongoing research aims to optimize biochar performance and phosphate recovery efficiency to reduce such unintended tradeoffs.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Research also evaluated how policy can catalyze food waste solutions. Techno-economic analysis of AD technology showed that costs of constructing these systems may be greater than potential revenues from sale of digestate fertilizer or biogas-based electricity alone. Instead, firms may rely on charging tipping fees to businesses that send food waste for treatment. Policy can create incentives by requiring businesses that generate high quantities of food waste to choose landfill alternatives or by providing capital cost grants to defray upfront costs of AD systems. However, research also found that such efforts must be developed cohesively. The \"patchwork\" policy landscape surrounding wasted food results from states taking highly varied approaches to laws on food date labeling, food donation, and business requirements to divert food from landfills. Greater standardization in policy and collaboration with food system stakeholders are required to maximize adoption of these solutions.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This project studied how consumer and business stakeholders decide to separate and handle wasted food. Survey research found that most individuals see environmental value in recycling household food waste and feel personal and social motivations to do so. However, individuals face practical barriers, including lack of knowledge, time, and space to separate and/or compost food waste and the belief that it will lead to unpleasant outcomes, like odor, messiness, or discord in their homes. Many individuals are willing to participate in services that would pick up and compost their food waste for them. Qualitative research on the firms that offer residential food-waste pick up shows significant potential for this emerging business model to divert wasted food from landfill and increase consumer awareness and engagement. However, these businesses are limited by lack of sufficient downstream infrastructure to treat collected food wastes, underscoring the importance of new technologies and supportive policies to facilitate solutions.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>To raise awareness of wasted food solutions, the project implemented multiple outreach activities, including engaging K-12 students across Rochester in hands-on research, translating technical findings to industrial and business stakeholders, and developing new American Sign Language terms with the National Technical Institute for the Deaf to better convey sustainability and wasted food concepts. The project resulted in numerous peer-reviewed journal articles, theses and dissertations, unique data sets shared on public repositories, and over 30 presentations to academic, public, and government audiences.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/26/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Callie&nbsp;W&nbsp;Babbitt</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1639391/1639391_10452396_1672107167010_Figure1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1639391/1639391_10452396_1672107167010_Figure1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Sustainable Food, Energy, Water Systems Course\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1639391/1639391_10452396_1672107167010_Figure1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Sustainable Food, Energy, Water Systems Course\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">RIT students visit a regional food bank to learn about surplus food rescue and redistribution.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Callie Babbitt</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Callie&nbsp;W&nbsp;Babbitt</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Sustainable Food, Energy, Water Systems Course</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1639391/1639391_10452396_1672107382651_Figure2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1639391/1639391_10452396_1672107382651_Figure2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Food waste treatment facility siting model\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1639391/1639391_10452396_1672107382651_Figure2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Food waste treatment facility siting model\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Geospatial optimization model created to identify suitable locations where food waste treatment technologies could be located to minimize transport distance, cost, and ecological impacts.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">William Armington</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Callie&nbsp;W&nbsp;Babbitt</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Food waste treatment facility siting model</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1639391/1639391_10452396_1672108447878_Figure3--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1639391/1639391_10452396_1672108447878_Figure3--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Food waste audit\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1639391/1639391_10452396_1672108447878_Figure3--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Food waste audit\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">RIT students assess campus food waste streams to determine quantities of wasted food and opportunities for waste minimization in food service locations.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Callie Babbitt</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Callie&nbsp;W&nbsp;Babbitt</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Food waste audit</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1639391/1639391_10452396_1672108639016_Figure4--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1639391/1639391_10452396_1672108639016_Figure4--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Sustainable Signs project\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1639391/1639391_10452396_1672108639016_Figure4--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Sustainable Signs project\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Creation and recording of American Sign Language terms to communicate concepts on wasted food and sustainability.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Callie Babbitt</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Callie&nbsp;W&nbsp;Babbitt</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Sustainable Signs project</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
