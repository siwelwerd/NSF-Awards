 "awd_abstract_narration": "This important project supports participants to attend a Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on relativity and gravitation at the intersection of both research and education. The conference topic is timely as it will take advantage of the tremendous enthusiasm that currently exists due to the announcement in February 2016 of the first ever detection of gravitational waves. It also occurs at a time when physicists are placing a concentrated effort on increasing the number of contemporary concepts that is taught to all undergraduates.\r\n\r\nThe scope of this conference is uniquely ambitious due to the connections among the education focus, cutting edge physics research, and a commitment to make contemporary physics topics accessible to a broad spectrum of undergraduate students at diverse institutions. It will have over 20 speakers who are leaders in gravitation, relativity, the teaching of these topics, and/or physics education research. New avenues of cutting edge research will evolve as a result of bringing together leading researchers who work at the intersection of gravitation and education. The GRC provides an opportunity for others exploring issues relating to education in gravitation and relativity to contribute to the dialogue through evening poster sessions and informal. The plenary talks and the poster sessions ensure that a diverse set of perspectives are represented at the conference and that the entire community has a voice in the future teaching of relativity and gravitation. There is great potential for increased awareness of these issues, for new curriculum development efforts, and for new techniques for learning abstract concepts and assessment of learning.",

The contributions received from the National Science Foundation have been critical to the success of the conferences and are having a measurable impact in advancing the frontiers of science worldwide.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/20/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Dean A Zollman"
