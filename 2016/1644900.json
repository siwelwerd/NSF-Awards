The New Security Paradigms Workshop (NSPW) provides a stimulating, safe, and highly interactive forum for innovative approaches to computer security. NSPW encourages graduate students and junior faculty to examine long-held ideas within computer security. It also strongly encourages non-computer security experts from economics, sociology, psychology, and other disciplines to bring their expertise to bear on computer security paradigms. The support from NSF will be used to sponsor travel expenses for graduate students and junior faculty to attend the workshop. Supporting junior researchers' travel to attend professional conferences and workshops is a very important mission of the NSF. Broader impacts include training the next generation of researchers in this important research area.",
