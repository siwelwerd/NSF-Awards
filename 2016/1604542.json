The longevity of these membranes is strongly related to their resistance to fouling. In this work, the PIs will develop two new multifunctional membranes which have the potential to minimize fouling and, therefore, extend the lifetime of the membranes.\r\n\r\nThe proposed photothermally-active nanostructure-enabled reverse osmosis membranes are highly innovative, potentially transformative, and, quite promising for water treatment. For the first time, gold (Au) nanostars- and chemically exfoliated-MoS2-enabled photothermally-active membranes will be tested for their bactericidal efficacy as well as their inorganic and organic fouling resistance. In particular, this work investigates the unexplored potential of inexpensive and earth-abundant MoS2 as a replacement for expensive materials to achieve water sustainability. Because chemically exfoliated-MoS2 is a highly promising 2D optical and electronic material, new information about water chemically exfoliated-MoS2 interfacial reactions will also help design safer and more sustainable nanomaterials. Furthermore, the proposed research will elucidate scientific principles underlying the in situ nucleation and growth of gold (Au) nanostars and their photothermal effects on membranes. It will define the substrates and nanostructures surface chemistry (i.e., their chemical nature, surface charge, hydrophilicity, and morphology) in highly saline solutions. These lessons can also advance our understanding of the complex fouling behavior of other membrane systems. In addition, the wide array of nanoscale characterization techniques for nanostructures in solution and on substrate surfaces can lead to novel synthetic routes for size- and shape-controlled nanomaterials. Creating unique nanostructures that can be light-activated to maximize bactericidal functionality is an innovative and transformative approach towards addressing a major global challenge. The proposed teaching and outreach plan will provide educational and research opportunities for middle school, undergraduate, and graduate students.",

The longevity of these membranes is strongly related to their foulant resistance. In this work, the project team developed new photothermally-enabled multifunctional membranes that incorporate photothermally-active nanoscale materials to effectively absorb light and convert it into heat. The generated heat can be used for water distillation and microbial disinfection. In Year 1, the team investigated AuNS-enabled photothermally-active membranes for their bactericidal efficacy as well as their inorganic and organic fouling resistance. Then, based on this improved understanding, in Years 2 and 3, the team investigated the unexplored potential of inexpensive 2D nanostructures as a replacement for expensive Au materials. In Year 3, the team focused on environmentally-benign and biocompatible and biodegradable photothermal materials and their incorporation into the photothermal membrane materials. In Year 4, with a no cost extension, the team examined the thermal engineering of the membranes.&nbsp; For example, a thermally dissimilar bilayer membrane can significantly lower the conductive heat transfer across the membrane, significantly enhancing thermal efficiency.&nbsp; Moreover, a better understanding of the substrates' and nanostructures' surface chemistry -- their chemical nature, surface charge, hydrophilicity, and morphology -- in highly saline solutions was achieved. These lessons can advance our understanding of the complex fouling behavior of other membrane systems.

In addition to the technological broader impacts, the project's teaching and outreach activities provided educational and research opportunities for middle school, undergraduate, and graduate students. As an early step in promoting STEM careers, the project team helped develop a teaching curriculum for the local middle school. The team consulted with outreach educators at Washington University's Institute for School Partnership (ISP) on the development of educational modules on water treatment. The PIs hosted high school student interns in their labs during summers, and students worked in the PIs' labs to improve their knowledge of nanoscience, nanotechnology, and environmental engineering, as well as their understanding of water treatment processes. The PIs particularly recruited students from underrepresented groups to work together on the engineering design of membranes for water treatment processes. Educational activities were evaluated periodically and improved.
