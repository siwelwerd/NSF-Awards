Quantitative analysis by EPMA is fundamental to earth and materials sciences. Analytical skills obtained by students are valuable and form a foundation for quantitative techniques that are related to x-ray spectrometry. \r\n\r\nThe planned topical conference will be the first conference or workshop explicitly focused on electron microprobe analysis in many years, providing an opportunity for experienced scientists to interact with students and researchers new to the technique. The EPMA user community is much broader than members of any one organization or professional society, and one aim is to attract all users of electron probes and provide them with four days of valuable experiences to take back to their laboratories.  In addition, the conference is designed to facilitate interaction between materials scientists and geologists who have much to learn from each other but may rarely have venues to interact.",

The topic was electron probe microanalysis (EPMA), which is a technique to analyze the chemical composition of very small features, utilized mainly by geologists and material scientists. EPMA is used to study both natural materials (e.g., volcanic ash, rocks with valuable mineral resources, meteorites, etc) as well as manmade materials (e.g., new metal alloys, new solar cells, new batteries, etc) to better understand them and any implications for society as well as understanding our world. The conference was attended by 142 people, with 37 \"Early Career Scholars\" (students, postdoctoral researchers and new professionals within 5 years of getting their degrees), 81 professionals and 23 individuals from other sponsoring organizations. The first day provided opportunities for participants to meet and discuss instrumentation and software topics with several of the key electron probe and EDS (energy dispsersive spectrometery) providers. Day two focused on tutorials for new (and old) users of the technique. On days 3 and 4, 37 talks were given on a range of applications (12 by Early Career Scholars), as well as a poster session where other Early Career Scholars were able to present their research and get feedback from the participants. NSF funds were used to provide support for U.S. Early Career Scholars.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 05/20/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: John&nbsp;H&nbsp;Fournelle</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1632366/1632366_10418868_1495291589800_EPMA-2016-ecs--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1632366/1632366_10418868_1495291589800_EPMA-2016-ecs--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"EPMA-2016-ecs.tiff\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1632366/1632366_10418868_1495291589800_EPMA-2016-ecs--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"EPMA-2016-ecs.tiff\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Early Career Scholars at the EPMA-2016 Topical Conference, University of Wisconsin-Madison, May 16-19, 2016</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Neal Lord</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">John&nbsp;H&nbsp;Fournelle</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">EPMA-2016-ecs.tiff</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1632366/1632366_10418868_1495291715701_EPMA-2016-all--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1632366/1632366_10418868_1495291715701_EPMA-2016-all--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"EPMA-2016-all.tiff\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1632366/1632366_10418868_1495291715701_EPMA-2016-all--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"EPMA-2016-all.tiff\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Participants at the EPMA-2016 Topical Conference at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, May 16-19, 2016</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Neal Lord</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">John&nbsp;H&nbsp;Fournelle</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">EPMA-2016-all.tiff</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1632366/1632366_10418868_1495291810725_EPMA-2016-auditorium--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1632366/1632366_10418868_1495291810725_EPMA-2016-auditorium--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"EPMA-2016-auditorium.tiff\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1632366/1632366_10418868_1495291810725_EPMA-2016-auditorium--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"EPMA-2016-auditorium.tiff\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Participants at the EPMA-2016 Topical Conference at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, May 16-19, 2016</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Neal Lord</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">John&nbsp;H&nbsp;Fournelle</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">EPMA-2016-auditorium.tiff</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
