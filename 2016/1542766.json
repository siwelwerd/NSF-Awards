 "awd_abstract_narration": "Numerical experiments are  to be used to test probabilistic predictions as to the optimal and sub-optimal siting of surface Automated Weather Station (AWS) observations in Antarctica. Sensor placement is a generic problem across the goesciences, and this project may have far-reaching impact as to fidelity and cost of observational networks. In particular, problems where measurements are difficult to obtain and/or expensive may be prioritized objectively with the approach tested here. If successful, this research provides the basis for an objectively optimized augmentation or re-configuration of the AWS network to meet climate monitoring (such as locating new or paleoclimate proxy records) and weather forecasting goals. \r\n\r\nGridded data from (archived) Antarctic Mesoscale Prediction Systems (AMPS) will be used by University of Washington and NCAR researchers to optimize the spatial correlation length scales for the existing AWS network via ensemble sensitivity theory.  These predictions of optimal station placement will in turn be subject to observing systems experiments, using both data denial and reconfiguration approaches.\r\nA related line of enquiry is to be an evaluation of the current locations of the active Antarctic radiosonde network, as judged by the network?s ability to account for tropospheric variance in archived AMPS forecast temperature data. Sonde measurements also may collocate with validation observations from infrared soundings from satellites, or GPS radio occultation.",
