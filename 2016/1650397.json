 "awd_abstract_narration": "General Summary\r\n\r\nThe study examines the individuals' emotional and cognitive responses to the back and forth between candidates during debates. The PIs examine (1) people's emotional responses to candidates, (2) people's learning during the information provided by the debate and (3) people's evaluations of the candidates after the debate. In the experiment, people are randomly assigned to either the experimental condition (watching the debate in real time) or the control condition (watching a non-political video). Before watching the debate (or video), people complete a pretest questionnaire. As subjects watch the debate (or video) on a tablet, people's facial responses will be recorded via the camera on the tablet. After the debate(and video) has concluded, subjects complete a posttest questionnaire. Coupling traditional survey methodology with state of the art facial recognition software will enable us to sort out the cognitive and affective responses to this political contest. The 2016 U.S. Presidential election provides the candidates of interest for this experimental study of individual level response to political debate. \r\n\r\nTechnical Summary\r\n\r\nThe study examines the individuals' emotional and cognitive responses to the back and forth between candidates during debates.

The PIs use software (Affectiva's Affdex) to measure people's facial expressions signifying (1) valence (positive or negative reaction to stimuli) (2) attentiveness to stimuli (3) emotional response. The facial recognition software records data and displays real-time readouts of specific emotions.

The first presidential debate of 2016 was historic along a number of dimensions, including the first woman general election candidate and the first general election candidate in history with no political or military experience. Given the presence of the first woman nominee of a major party, along with dramatic gender differences in support for the candidates, we focus on the role of gender in shaping people&rsquo;s emotional responses to candidate messaging during the debate of 2016.&nbsp; Through the use of a controlled experiment, we are able to measure changes in attitudes and responses to the candidates after exposure to the debate. To capture real-time emotional reaction to the candidates, &nbsp;we employed facial expression software (purchased through an National Science Foundation grant). Leveraging data generated during the debate by the facial expression software and as well as responses to traditional pretest and post-test questionnaires, we find that men and women respond differently to candidates&rsquo; messaging during the debate and these emotional responses influence post-debate evaluations.&nbsp; We find men are more likely to express externalizing emotions, like anger and disgust, while women exhibit more internalizing emotions, like sadness. We also find that women&rsquo;s emotional reactions to the debate more powerfully influence views of Trump and Clinton, compared to men. We presented these findings at the American Political Science Association&rsquo;s annual meeting in 2016. We are continuing to analyze the data we collected using this facial expression software and plan to publish papers on the role of emotion in helping voters learn during debates and the utility of this software for measuring emotion during debates (compared with more conventional measures typically employed in our discipline).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/08/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Kim&nbsp;L&nbsp;Fridkin</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"></div>\n</div>",
