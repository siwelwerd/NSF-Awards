 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Undergraduate Scholarships for Education Excellence in Environmental Engineering and Water Resources Management (USE4WRM) project will provide scholarships to the academically talented and low-income Water Resources Management (WRM) and Environmental Engineering (ENE) undergraduate students at Central State University (CSU).  The USE4WRM project will utilize targeted enrollment of academically prepared students to improve retention and graduation rates. The project aims to address the wide gap in enrollment of high school graduates into college in the STEM fields between low-income and underrepresented communities and the general population.  Traditionally CSU has attracted large numbers of underrepresented minorities and the program will lead to the matriculation of a more diversified set of graduates in environmental sciences.\r\n\r\nThe USE4WRM program will recruit 14 high school students into the ENE and WRM programs in two cohorts. Scholars will receive scholarships, mentoring, advising, tutoring and personal development services for four years.  Under the guidance of faculty, each cohort will form a learning community in which curricular and experimental learning experiences through internships are shared. Academic performance indicators of the cohorts and the scholar surveys will be used in program assessment. An external evaluator team will evaluate the success of the program and will utilize data mining techniques to analyze academic performance indicators of the cohorts and responses from the surveys by students and faculty mentors.  The research team will use this data to answer the research questions, \"Are the support systems planned, fully effective for the average profile of the student in the program?\" and \"Are there differences in the use of support systems based on the gender of the student?\"  Results from this research will generate evidence regarding the efficacy of existing recruitment and retention techniques.  Knowledge gained within the ENE and WRM programs will be extended and applicable to other STEM fields.",

In these six years, 36 students, 23 from ENE and 13 from WRM, were supported. Among these USE4WRM scholars, 14 are female, and 22 are male students. This group had 31 African Americans, two whites, one Hispanic, and two multiracial students. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In this period, ten USE4WRM Scholars, four ENE, and six WRM students graduated, three went to graduate schools, and six joined the workforce related to their undergraduate programs. Out of 24 scholars who stayed in the program, 21 got the opportunity to do paid internships in industry, federal agencies, and local governments, and research assistantships at CSU or in graduate institutions around the nation. These internships and research assistantships helped them to apply their knowledge and expand their experiences in their fields. They also helped them to expand their network and polish their communication skills. These students submitted the reports in the mandatory internship classes and presented their experiences at conferences and other venues. When five scholars graduated, they were offered jobs at the workplaces where they did their internships.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>While five of the 12 USE4WRM scholars left their majors for other universities or other programs in the same university, four left for personal reasons. The impact of COVID-19 on USE4WRM is mixed; While COVID-19 left four scholars to leave the institution, financial support from USE4WRM and related internship and undergraduate research opportunities helped the other scholars to stay in their majors during the peak of the COVID-19 period. At the end of the grant period, there are 13 scholars in the ENE and WRM programs from the sophomore to senior levels.</p>\n<p>USE4WRM scholarships reduced the financial worry of the scholars and helped them focus more on their education. It also helped them qualify for scholarships such as LSAMP, USDA 1890 scholarships, internships, and school accommodation preferences.</p>\n<p>One scholar was selected as a Goldwater Scholar, and another participated in the Thurgood Marshall College Funds Leadership Institute Conference. The third scholar was part of an ENE-WRM student team that won a place in the Environmental Engineering and Science Foundation competition.</p>\n<p>During the grant period, the environmental engineering program achieved ABET accreditation in 2017 and was re-accredited in 2021. USE4WRM was identified as the program's strength. The American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE) has recently acknowledged CSU engineering programs for being tied as number one among the 422 institutions by the percentage of bachelor's degrees awarded to underrepresented minorities. In its 2021 Engineering Program Profiles, ASEE data also showed that Central State University's undergraduate Environmental Engineering Program graduated more minority students (male or female) in 2020 than any other undergraduate environmental engineering program in North America. This 13% of all minority environmental engineering graduates in 2020 can be seen as an indirect impact of USE4WRM.</p>\n<p>As dissemination of the knowledge, the PIs presented and published the experiences gathered in five ASEE national and regional conferences that could help similar programs around the nation to utilize for their benefit.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 08/29/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Ramanitharan&nbsp;Kandiah</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1565049/1565049_10424187_1661749629072_23275417_2049354778413461_1316786434870663876_o--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1565049/1565049_10424187_1661749629072_23275417_2049354778413461_1316786434870663876_o--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"USE4WRM Scholars on their Field Trip\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1565049/1565049_10424187_1661749629072_23275417_2049354778413461_1316786434870663876_o--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"USE4WRM Scholars on their Field Trip\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">CSU Environmental Engineering students Field Trip to Tappan, Alwood and Leesville Lakes, Eastern Ohio</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Ramanitharan Kandiah</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (restricted use - cannot be shared)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Ramanitharan&nbsp;Kandiah</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">USE4WRM Scholars on their Field Trip</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1565049/1565049_10424187_1661749860205_USE4WRMOutcome_Image4--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1565049/1565049_10424187_1661749860205_USE4WRMOutcome_Image4--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"USE4WRM Scholar at ARD Conference\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1565049/1565049_10424187_1661749860205_USE4WRMOutcome_Image4--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"USE4WRM Scholar at ARD Conference\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">USE4WRM Scholar at ARD Conference at Jacksonville, Florida</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Ramanitharan Kandiah</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (restricted use - cannot be shared)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Ramanitharan&nbsp;Kandiah</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">USE4WRM Scholar at ARD Conference</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1565049/1565049_10424187_1661750456111_USE4WRMOutcoem_Image3--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1565049/1565049_10424187_1661750456111_USE4WRMOutcoem_Image3--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"USE4WRM Scholars at Massey Creek\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1565049/1565049_10424187_1661750456111_USE4WRMOutcoem_Image3--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"USE4WRM Scholars at Massey Creek\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">USE4WRM Scholars at Massey Creek, Wilberforce, OH</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">KrishnaKumar Nedunuri</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (restricted use - cannot be shared)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Ramanitharan&nbsp;Kandiah</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">USE4WRM Scholars at Massey Creek</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
