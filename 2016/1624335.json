 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support to U.S. researchers participating in a project competitively selected by a six-country initiative on global change research through the Belmont Forum. The Belmont Forum is a group of the world?s major and emerging funders of global environmental change research. It aims to accelerate delivery of the international environmental research most urgently needed to remove critical barriers to sustainability by aligning and mobilizing international resources. Each partner organization provides funding for researchers from their country to alleviate the need for funds to cross international borders.  This approach facilitates effective leveraging of national resources to support excellent research on topics of global relevance best tackled through a multinational approach, recognizing that global challenges need global solutions.  This project is also supported by the NSF Office of International Science and Engineering Global Venture Fund.  \r\n\r\nWorking together in a Collaborative Research Action, the six partner organizations have provided support for research projects that utilize a strong inter- and trans-disciplinary approach to examine environmental and related societal change in mountain regions. This award provides support for the U.S. researchers to cooperate in a consortium of partners from at least three of the participating countries and that brings together natural scientists, social scientists and research users (e.g., policy makers, regulators, NGOs, communities and industry).  \r\n\r\nThis research will identify options to address emerging food-energy-water pressures in the rapidly changing Ethiopian Blue Nile Mountains. This project will engage stakeholders at local, regional, and national level to define system components and dynamics, identify favored adaptation strategies, and develop scenarios of probable and of possible futures under externally forced and locally driven change.",

Rapid hydropower development in these mountains is quickly transforming them into the \"power plant of Africa\" as well. For local people, however, they are first and foremost a land of small farms, engaged primarily in subsistence agriculture. Under changing climate, rapid national economic growth, and steadily increasing population and land pressures, these mountains and their inhabitants have become the focal point of a multi-scale food-energy-water nexus with significant implications across East Africa. This goal of this project was to develop research tools that capture cross-scale resource dynamics to enable better policies, using the Blue Nile Highlands of Ethiopia (Figure 1) as a case study. To do this, we engaged with stakeholders at local, regional, and national level to understand coupled food-energy-water systems from multiple perspectives. These perspectives, captured in interviews, surveys, and interactive workshops, were then combined with quantitative analysis of climate trends, crop yields, hydropower operations, land cover, and soil degradation to produce an integrated systems model that captures cascading resource dynamics that link household well-being in different communities to large scale infrastructure projects, and vice versa.</p>\n<p>While the systems model was the most integrated output of the project, our studies revealed a number of interesting patterns and dynamics along the way.

It also included a study of crop drought sensitivity that showed that sorghum?generally considered to be a highly drought tolerant crop?has sensitivities to early season rainfall that make it unreliable during certain types of drought. These types of drought also happen to be increasing under climate change, such that sorghum-based resilience strategies need to be considered very carefully. Surveys and stakeholder workshops, meanwhile, revealed that households in villages affected by dam construction and reservoir filling fared very differently depending on their specific location relative to the dam, the purpose of the dam (hydropower, irrigation, flood control), and government policies to redress local impacts of these large-scale development projects.</p>\n<p>When integrated to a system simulation model (Figure 3), these findings allowed us to explore cross-scale impacts of dam building and extension of irrigation, electricity, and municipal water services under different scenarios of climate, development, and demographic change. These simulations highlight the importance of considering distributional effects when designing infrastructure: plans that include consideration of local needs can promote more equitable development at relatively low additional cost. The simulations also show that infrastructure designed to meet needs under today?s climate conditions can face a high risk of failure under evolving climate conditions. Accounting for climate trends in the design and implementation of long-lasting infrastructure projects, then, is an essential element in sustainable development of food-energy-water resources.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 08/30/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Benjamin&nbsp;Zaitchik</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1624335/1624335_10446163_1630370900078_BNHmap--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1624335/1624335_10446163_1630370900078_BNHmap--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1: Map of the Blue Nile Highlands\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1624335/1624335_10446163_1630370900078_BNHmap--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1: Map of the Blue Nile Highlands\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Figure 1: Map of the Blue Nile Highlands study region, with dams studied in this project indicated with stars.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Ben Zaitchik</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Benjamin&nbsp;Zaitchik</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 1: Map of the Blue Nile Highlands</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1624335/1624335_10446163_1630371036679_Eucalyptusexpansion--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1624335/1624335_10446163_1630371036679_Eucalyptusexpansion--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Expansion of eucalyptus plantations\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1624335/1624335_10446163_1630371036679_Eucalyptusexpansion--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Expansion of eucalyptus plantations\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Figure 2: Satellite images of an area in an area in the Blue Nile Highlands from (left) January 2004 and (right) January 2021.
