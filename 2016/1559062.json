 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dinoflagellates are abundant and ecologically important species in marine ecosystems, and they play diverse roles in marine food webs. They may be best known to the general public as the organisms associated with periodic harmful algal blooms, or situations when toxins produced by fast-growing populations affect fish, shellfish, and marine mammals, as well as human use of coastal resources. These single-celled organisms have evolved a range of behaviors for obtaining nutrients from the environment, capturing prey, and evading predators. In this project, the investigators will use a newly developed high-speed microscale imaging system (HSMIS) in the lab and field to characterize dinoflagellate behaviors in unprecedented detail in space and time to understand ecologically important species-species interactions. The goal is to understand the relationships among behavior, morphology, and ecological function for dinoflagellates. More broadly, results will help explain processes that regulate the biomass of, distribution of, and chemical cycling by marine plankton. In addition, the investigators will develop and use a novel technology, provide research training for undergraduate students, and give demonstrations and lectures to the public.\r\n\r\nDinoflagellates are one of the most abundant and ecologically important groups in marine ecosystems, playing diverse roles in marine food webs. These single-celled organisms have evolved an impressive repertoire of sensory, allelochemical, and behavioral capabilities for obtaining nutrients, capturing prey, evading predators, and competing against other organisms. This repertoire remains largely unexplored, however, in part because traditional microscopy limits observations at the relevant scales for the natural behavior of dinoflagellates.  The investigators will conduct a laboratory and field project to use a high-speed microscale imaging system (HSMIS) to characterize dinoflagellate behavior in unprecedented spatial and temporal detail across a range of ecologically important species-species interactions. HSMIS overcomes several limitations inherent to traditional microscopy, such as wall effects due to small sample volumes, confinement to a horizontal field-of-view, and strong convection caused by using strong light. The goal is to achieve a mechanistic understanding of interspecies detection, avoidance, and capture. Observations will span a range of size scales and trophic levels and will include examples of different flagellar propulsive systems. Differences in swimming and flow will be used to understand trade-offs in body form and kinematics for nutrient uptake, resource competition, selective feeding, and predator/parasite avoidance.",

We used a high-speed microscale imaging system (HSMIS) to demonstrate these fundamental processes by investigating the predator-prey interaction between the mixotrophic, harmful algal bloom dinoflagellate Dinophysis acuminata and its ciliate prey Mesodinium rubrum.  D. acuminata was shown to detect its M. rubrum prey via chemoreception while M. rubrum was alerted to D. acuminata via mechanoreception at much shorter distances (89+-39 &mu;m versus 41+-32 &mu;m). On detection, D. acuminata approached M. rubrum with reduced speed.

The mixotrophic ciliate Mesodinium rubrum is an ambush feeder relying on cryptophyte prey motility for prey encounter and perception; therefore, cryptophyte species-specific swimming behaviors affect M. rubrum's prey preference. We used the HSMIS to quantify the swimming behaviors of three cryptophyte species (Teleaulax amphioxeia, Storeatula major, and Guillardia theta) and to conduct quantitative microvideography of M. rubrum-T. amphioxeia predator-prey interaction. T. amphioxeia, a preferred prey of M. rubrum, swam at path-averaged speeds of 155+-73 &mu;m s-1 along rather straight paths. In contrast, S. major regularly tumbled slowly downward or upward at 64+-16 &mu;m s-1, while G. theta moved slowly in looped/curved trajectories at 57+-15 &mu;m s-1; neither supports M. rubrum growth. Only while motionlessly sinking passively did M. rubrum detect and initiate an attack on swimming T. amphioxeia at reaction distances of 8.2+-8.2 &mu;m. It seemed that M. rubrum needed to use oral tentacles to initially poke T. amphioxeia's ventral posterior part and subsequently poke the prey multiple times in a short duration to compromise the prey's escape ability, presumably by discharging extrusomes into the prey. T. amphioxeia also responded to nearby predators by switching to tumbling similar to S. major in normal swimming, suggesting an effective anti-predator defense behavior that prevents M. rubrum from accurately poking the prey's ventral posterior part. T. amphioxeia swimming at significantly higher speeds leads to sufficiently high prey encounters and hydrodynamic signals for M. rubrum, thereby partially explaining M. rubrum's ability to select T. amphioxeia prey.\n\nOutcomes 1 and 2 form the basis to build a comprehensive behavioral repertoire for the marine protistan food chain: cryptophyte&rarr;Mesodinium&rarr;Dinophysis.
