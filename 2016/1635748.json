 "awd_abstract_narration": "Coccolithophores are single-cell algae that are covered with limestone (calcite) plates called coccoliths. They may make up most of the phytoplankton biomass in the oceans.  Coccolithophores are generally considered to be autotrophs, meaning that they use photosynthesis to fix carbon into both soft plant tissue and hard minerogenic calcite, using sunlight as an energy source (\"autotrophic\"). However, there is an increasing body of evidence that coccolithophores are \"mixotrophic\", meaning that they can fix carbon from photosynthesis as well as grow in darkness by engulfing small organic particles plus taking up other simple carbon molecules from seawater.  The extent to which Coccolithophores engage in mixotrophic can influence the transfer of carbon into the deep sea.  This work is fundamentally directed at quantifying coccolithophore mixotrophy -- the ability to use dissolved and reduce carbon compounds for energy -- using lab and field experiments plus clarifying its relevance to ocean biology and chemistry.  This work will generate broader impacts in three areas: 1) Undergraduate training: Two REU undergraduates will be trained during the project. The student in the second year will participate in the research cruise. 2) Caf\u00e9 Scientifique program: This work will be presented in Bigelow Laboratory?s Caf\u00e9 Scientifique program. These are free public gatherings where the public is invited to join in a conversation about the latest ideas and issues in ocean science and technology. 3) Digital E-Book: We propose to make a digital E-book to specifically highlight and explain mixotrophy within coccolithophores. Images of mixotrophic coccolithophores would be the primary visual elements of the book. The E-book will be publically available and distributed to our educational affiliate, Colby College. The goal of the book is to further communicate the intricacies of the microbial world, food web dynamics, plus their relationship to the global carbon cycle, to inspire interest, education, and curiosity about these amazing life forms.\r\n\r\nCoccolithophores can significantly affect the draw-down of atmospheric CO2 and they can transfer CO2 from the surface ocean and sequester it in the deep sea via two carbon pump mechanisms: (1) The \"alkalinity pump\" (also known as the calcium carbonate pump), where coccolithophores in the surface ocean take up dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC; primarily a form called bicarbonate, a major constituent of ocean alkalinity). They convert half to CO2, which is either fixed as plant biomass or released as the gas, and half is synthesized into their mineral coccoliths.  Thus, coccolithophore calcification can actually increase surface CO2 on short time scales (i.e. weeks).  However, over months to years, coccoliths sink below thousands of meters, where they dissolve and release bicarbonate back into deep water. Thus, sinking coccoliths essentially \"pump\" bicarbonate alkalinity from surface to deep waters, where that carbon remains isolated in the abyssal depths for thousands of years. (2) The \"biological pump\", where the ballasting effect of the dense limestone coccoliths speeds the sinking of organic, soft-tissue debris (particulate organic carbon or POC), essentially \"pumping\" this soft carbon tissue to depth.  The biological pump ultimately decreases surface CO2. The soft-tissue and alkalinity pumps reinforce each other in maintaining a vertical gradient in DIC (more down deep than at the surface) but they oppose each other in terms of the air-sea exchange of CO2. Thus, the net effect of coccolithophores on atmospheric CO2 depends on the balance of their CO2-raising effect associated with the alkalinity pump and their CO2-lowering effect associated with the soft-tissue biological pump. It is virtually always assumed that coccolith particulate organic carbon (PIC) originates exclusively from dissolved organic carbon (DIC, as bicarbonate), not dissolved organic carbon (DOC). The goal of this proposal is to describe a) the potential uptake and assimilation of an array of DOC compounds by coccolithophores, b) the rates of uptake, and potential incorporation of DOC by coccolithophores into PIC coccoliths, which, if true, would represent a major shift in the alkalinity pump paradigm.  This work is fundamentally directed at quantifying coccolithophore mixotrophy using lab and field experiments plus clarifying its relevance to ocean biology and chemistry.  There have been a number of technological advances to address this issue, all of which will be applied in this work. The investigators will: (a) screen coccolithophore cultures for the uptake and assimilation of a large array of DOC molecules, (b) perform tracer experiments with specific DOC molecules in order to examine uptake at environmentally-realistic concentrations, (c) measure fixation of DOC into organic tissue, separate from that fixed into PIC coccoliths, (d) separate coccolithophores from other phytoplankton and bacteria using flow cytometry and e) distinguish the modes of nutrition in these sorted coccolithophore cells. This work will fundamentally advance the state of knowledge of coccolithophore mixotrophy in the sea and address the balance of carbon that coccolithophores derived from autotrophic versus heterotrophic sources.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nCoccolithophore Mixotrophy- Project Outcomes Report\n\nINTELLECTUAL MERIT OF THIS WORK: Mixotrophy is the process for organisms to use a combination of different sources of energy and carbon, instead  of having a single trophic mode.  It occurs on the continuum from complete  heterotrophy on one extreme to autotrophy at the other extreme.  In the case of marine phytoplankton, it describes the ability of cells to take up carbon via photosynthesis, phagocytosis (cellular engulfing of particles) or uptake of dissolved organic carbon (DOC, a.k.a. osmotrophy).  The purpose of this project was to understand how coccolithophores (calcifying, unicellular algae) survive in complete darkness. This question was posed given the survival of the plant class following the major asteroid impact some 225 million years ago at the Cretacious/Tertiary boundary which was alledged to have darkened Earth for several months yet they have no resting stage like other phytoplankton classes.  Moreover, there are observations of some coccolithophore species surviving in almost complete darkness in the ocean water column, far too deep for photosynthesis.   There was some previous tantalizing unpublished  evidence from 60 years ago, too, that this algal group could take up DOC in the dark and use it to grow on but those results were only part of a Ph.D. dissertation and were never published in the open literature. \n\nWe therefore performed laboratory experiments in which we confirmed that coccolithophores could take up and assimiilate a wide variety of organic material.  Then we focused in on a few of these compounds, first performing 30d growth experiments in darkness plus we  used specific radio-labelled compounds to examine how their uptake rates varied as a function of concentration and, finally, how this nutritional mode compared to autotrophy (photosynthesis). Finally, we took these techniques to sea on the R/V Endeavor to perform the first such experiments on natural coccolithophore populations.  As luck would have it, the time of the cruise happened to be during the largest coccolithophore bloom observed on the New England contintinental shelf in 30 years.  We performed similar experiments using the radio-labelled organic compounds and then we concentrated the cells using a filtration device called a \"cell trap\", which then allowed us to use an instrument called a \"flow cytometer\" to sort out the coccolithophores, away from all other phytoplankton.  This allowed us to have sufficient signal to see whether natural assemblages of coccolithophores could take up dissolved organic matter. \n\nThe surprise in the results was that we discovered that no only did the coccolithophores take up DOC, but that within 24 hours, they fixed half of it into particulate organic carbon (POC) and half of it was fixed into coccolithophore calcite (a.k.a. particulate inorganic carbon or PIC). \n\nBROADER IMPACTS OF THIS WORK:\n\nThis work is important because PIC is one of the four forms of carbon compounds on Earth, along with POC, DOC and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC; forms such as CO2).  Moreover, there are entire paradigms in oceanography such as the biological carbon pump (BCP) paradigm which now warrent re-examination given our results.  The BCP explains how organic carbon is fixed into phytoplankton whiich is ballasted to sink to the sea floor by coccolith PIC (thought to originate from CO2, DIC) and is subsequently sequestered away from the atmosphere.  Instead, here, we have discovered that the PIC coccoliths are synthesized from DOC, too, which is the largest carbon pool in the sea.  Another paradigm is the Ocean Alkalinity Pump, in which organisms like coccolithophores fix calcium ions and bicarbonate (DIC) from the surface ocean and fix it into CaCO3, where it sinks, carrying that alkalinity to depth. whereupon the coccoliths then dissolve, releasing the alkalinity back into the water at depth (hence, \"pumping\" alkalinity to depth).  Our results from this work demonstrate that PIC coccoliths are not necessarily transporting only surface alkalinity (as DIC) but could be effectively transporting DOC, as well.  The bottom line is that our work illustrates a previously unknown (and rapid) pathway for transformation of one major carbon pool into another for deposition at depth.\n\nAs part of this grant, we trained three undergraduate students, one doctoral student from Old Dominion University, and a post-doc in the Balch Lab at Bigelow Laboratory.  We gave seminars to the public about our research.  We also published an E-book with scanning electron microscope images of coccolithophores for public dissemination.  The book not only describes the natural history of coccolithophores but also delves into their nutritional strategies, the subject of this proposal.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/22/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: William M Balch"
