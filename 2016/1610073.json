The transformative Gunn triodes proposed here will leverage many years of experience with III-nitride HEMT technologies, and focus on high-quality materials growth, fabrication, design, modeling and high-power high-speed III-nitride device physics research.    Through the proposed research tasks, an entirely new architecture for room temperature solid state millimeter-wave and terahertz sources will be demonstrated for a host of diverse applications including wireless communications, automotive radar, remote sensing, medical imaging, concealed object detection, spectroscopy and inter-satellite transmissions.  In education outreach activities, the program will enable a close collaboration between the PIs' groups and Georgia Tech's Center for Education Integrating Science, Mathematics and Computing to actively engage in K-12 education.  The program will create online resources for the Georgia STEM Incubator initiatives for K-12 science course modules and help design online professional development curriculum units for teachers on green energy technologies and energy conservation related topics. Students from underrepresented groups will be involved in the research through Summer Undergraduate Research in Engineering/Science programs at Goergia Tech.  The program will also host Georgia Intern Fellowship for high school S&T teachers for both continuing education and cultivation of the next-generation of the Science of Engineering education workforce.\r\n\r\nTechnical Description:\r\nThe successful completion of the proposed work shall result in the very first demonstration of a wurtzite III-nitride based Gunn-effect device.  The basis of the proposed approach is the use of advanced metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) growth systems to produce GaN-based HEMT-like triode structures with atomically smooth polar interfaces on high-quality GaN substrates.  Novel heterostructure Gunn triode designs and fabrication processing technologies will be explored and studied to facilitate successful demonstration of the proposed devices.  A comprehensive understanding of the non-stationary and highly non-equilibrium carrier transport mechanisms under high electric-field conditions in these structures will be achieved through the application of state-of-the-art numerical simulation software based on full-band ensemble electro-thermal Monte Carlo solutions of the Boltzmann transport equation. Such calculations have recently provided valuable insight into the reasons why previous attempts to realize GaN-based Gunn effect devices have failed, and have facilitated the identification of a prototypical HEMT-like heterostructure in a triode configuration which addresses each of these shortcomings.  The successful demonstration of the proposed III-N Gunn triodes will represent both a significant technological breakthrough in the field of III-N power electronic device research, providing a solid-state solution for the efficient generation of high-power millimeter-wave and terahertz signals at room temperature, as well as an advancement of fundamental science through the very first expression of the Gunn effect in the wurtzite III-nitride material system.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n \n\nGunn diodes based on gallium arsenide and indium phosphide technology have long enjoyed broad application as sources of microwave and millimeter wave signals.  These two materials share a peculiar property whereby electrons move slower when subjected to large electric fields than they do when lower electric fields are applied.  This phenomenon is referred to as \"negative differential drift velocity\", and is the property of these materials which enables the production of periodic signals at high frequencies.   Efficiency, maximum oscillation frequency and output power of these devices is limited, however by other material properties such as a low thermal conductivity, low breakdown fields, and low saturated (high-field) drift velocity. \n\nWurtzite III-nitride materials such as gallium nitride exhibit significantly higher thermal conductivity, breakdown field strength, peak and saturated drift velocities than do either gallium arsenide or indium phosphide, and hold great potential for enabling the production of Gunn diodes of considerably higher power, higher frequency and efficiency.  In spite of considerable effort, not a single wurtzite III-nitride based Gunn diode had ever been demonstrated.  \n\nBecause the negative differential drift velocity in wurtzite III-nitride materials occurs over a far larger range of electric fields than in more conventional materials, we proposed an entirely different device structure than had ever before been used.   Instead of the conventional diode structure, we proposed a planar triode structure with three electrodes.  The origin of the macroscopic negative differential drift velocity is at the microscopic level referred to as a charge domain instability.  During the course of this grant, we developed an original theory for the growth and propagation of arbitrary charge domain instabilities, and were able to predict oscillation frequency and power generation as a function of contact bias and device geometry, validated by an advanced semiconductor device simulation technique known as full band ensemble Monte Carlo simulation.  We realized, however, that device operation was very sensitive to design parameters, and we needed to develop a careful understanding of charge domain nucleation to enable a robust design.  To this end, we developed the very first theoretical model for the nucleation of arbitrary charge domain instabilities.  It revealed the criteria which must be satisfied for successful nucleation, and why these criteria are far more easily satisfied in gallium arsenide and indium phosphide than in gallium nitride.  It also revealed the role of hot electron diffusion in spoiling successful nucleation.  Once we fully understood the process of nucleation, we were able to develop a robust design, for which a process flow was developed and epitaxial layer structures were grown.  An external resonant circuit relevant for our Gunn diodes was also developed by a physics teacher from a local charter high school, who we hosted for a full summer as part of this grant. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/10/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Douglas Yoder"
