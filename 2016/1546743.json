 "awd_abstract_narration": "When tropical cyclones move poleward, they can produce adverse societal impacts, especially when they make landfall. While many tropical cyclones weaken as they move out of the tropics, a subset of these systems actually intensifies, and may increase in size. A recent example is Hurricane Sandy, which affected the Mid-Atlantic and Northeastern US in the fall of 2012. In recent years, there has been intensive study of how climate change would affect the frequency and intensity of tropical cyclones. However, only limited research has examined how climate change affects the important category of tropical cyclones that move out of the tropics. One expected result of climate change is warming air at upper levels in the tropics; prior research demonstrates that this upper warming limits the strengthening of tropical cyclones that would otherwise occur. However, tropical cyclones that move out of the tropics may escape this mitigating influence. \r\n\r\nTherefore, one goal of this study is to test the hypothesis that tropical cyclones exiting the tropics will show a greater intensity increase with warming than would storms that remain in the tropics. Another goal is to determine if and how warming changes the fraction of tropical cyclones that undergo the re-intensification process mentioned above. Finally, this project will also analyze changes in the locations and seasons in which tropical cyclones form. All of these goals will be accomplished using methods that are similar to what has been done in studying how tropical cyclones that remain in the tropics respond to climate change, but with a study area that extends well outside of the tropics. Highly sophisticated computer models, of the type used in weather prediction, will be used in combination with larger-scale changes obtained from climate models. Then, comparing \"present day\" to \"future\" simulations, with all else equal, allows determination of changes in the strength and frequency of tropical cyclones moving poleward into mid-latitude locations.\r\n\r\nThis project addresses gaps in understanding of how climate change would influence the intensity and frequency of the subset of tropical cyclones that move out of the tropics, affecting higher-latitude locations. This category of tropical cyclones is extremely important, because it is precisely these systems, as they exit the tropics, which exert the strongest influence on the major population centers in mid-latitude locations such as the US. Given their importance, it is perhaps surprising that the response of these systems to climate change has not received more research attention to date. The project will also determine if geographical and/or seasonal changes in tropical cyclone activity will change with the climate. Owing to the highly technical nature of this project, the graduate students who work on it will gain valuable skills in scientific computing, data analysis and visualization, and in science communication. Graduate research assistants working on this project will be invited to assist in supervising undergraduate researchers, thereby gaining experience in leadership and mentoring.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nWhen tropical cyclones exit the tropics, they sometimes transition into extratropical weather systems, a process known as extratropical transition, or ET.  This process is often the result of a tropical system interacting with disturbances embedded in the midlatitude jet stream.  These systems can be impactful, capable of delivering high-impact tropical weather conditions to regions that are unaccustomed to such hazards.  While many studies have considered how tropical cyclones will respond to climate change, little work had been done on how ET would change in a warming climate.  Here, we used two distinct experimental strategies to examine this question.\n\nIn order to represent tropcal cyclones (TCs) in a numerical model, high resolution is required.  For both components of our study, we used state-of-the-art weather models at high resolution. In one approach, we conducted a set of detailed simulations of Hurricane Irene (2011) and its transition, and then applied end-of-century warming conditions to the same basic weather pattern in order to simulate a future Irene. This study, published in the Journal of Climate (Jung and Lackmann 2019), detailed increased future impacts of the storm, including both heavier precipitation and stronger wind speeds.  The future Irene maintained tropical characteristics farther poleward than the present-day storm. \n\nIn order to generalize results, rather than running many case studies, we conducted a novel semi-idealized modeling strategy that used composites of past observed events to initialize the model.  We then applied warming to the model conditions, as we did for the Irene case study, only this time we had a generic but highly representative semi-idealized event (image 2).  We found several of the same results as for the Irene case, including increased storm hazards.  One new finding was that in the future storm, there was a greater downstream transfer of energy when the transitioning system interacted with the jet stream.  This holds important implications for regions downstream of the locations of ET events, including the western US and Western Europe.  There, energetic downstream systems, extratropical in nature, could undergo extra intensification due to the added downstream energy transfer.  Another surprising finding was that the future storm underwent less reintensification after ET, consistent with strong Arctic warming and reduced temperature constrast.  These results were reported in a second paper in Journal of Climate (Jung and Lackmann 2021).\n\nThere are limitations to the methods described above, because they don't allow us to consider changes in the frequency or location of ET with warming.  Thus, a second strategy was to use high-resolution global models, run for years, to simulate segments of time at high resolution in the present-day and future, warmer climate.  Such high-resolution simulations are too expensive for a full climate run.  We ran 10 years of present-day  and 10 years with end-of-century conditions, examining TCs and ET in the simulations.  This allowed us to test our prediction that a higher percentage of future TCs would complete ET, owing to stronger systems in a warmer climate.  The novel model experimental design is published in Geoscientific Model Development (Michaelis et al. 2019).\n\nThe results of these simulations demonstrate that ET changes are most pronounced in the North Atlantic Basin (image 1).  We found a poleward shift in TC activity there, and an accompanying increase in ET frequency.  The poleward shift let tropical systems reach closer to the jet stream, allowing increased interactions between the TCs and the jet.  This is consistent with results from the experiments discussed above.  With this method, we again found strengthened storm impacts, including heavier precipitation and stronger near-surface wind speeds.  As hypothesized, the percentage of TCs that underwent ET increased in the future.  The results of this work were published in two Journal of Climate papers (Michaelis and Lackmann, 2019, 2021).\n\nBy using two very different experimental designs, we were able to address questions related to changes in frequency and location, as well as storm-scale and downstream impacts.  All results point towards increasing direct and indirect impacts from ET events in a warming climate, especially for regions near the North Atlantic basin.\n\nWe were fortunate to have two very talented PhD students working on the project.  Dr. Allison Michaelis worked at Scripps/CW3E as a postdoc after graduation and is now a faculty member at Northern Illinois University.  Dr. Chunyong Jung worked as a postdoc at the University of Illinois Urbana Champaign following graduation, and is now working at Argonne National Laboratory near Chicago.\n\nAn additional outcome was the production of an excellent set of high-resolution datasets with which to study a variety of extreme weather phenomena in a changing climate.  Lackmann et al. (2021, Journal of Climate) used the global time-slice simulations to examine how blocking patterns, which can lead to prolonged weather extremes such as heatwaves, changed between the present-day and future simulations.  Other studies using these data are underway.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/22/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Gary M Lackmann"
