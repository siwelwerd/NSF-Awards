 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project conducts a natural experiment to ask how inequality arises out of an unstratified economy, and which traits preadapt certain individuals and groups to differentially succeed under economic diversification. Rapid social and economic change offer many new opportunities that are of possible benefit to individuals. However, adopting new modes of social organization and ways of making a living are also risky because traditional knowledge may be inadequate when evaluating the costs and benefits of pursuing unfamiliar behaviors. This situation is widespread in many societies encountering new markets. This process, which is currently poorly understood, is of particular importance because social and wealth inequality emerge as a result of market access. Thus, here we seek to learn, when novel opportunities are introduced, why are some individuals and families better able to take advantage of the situation, while others try and fail or continue to rely on traditional and conservative lifeways?  The negative impact of income inequality is of growing concern both in both the popular press and academic literature because of its associations with quality of life indicators, including patterns of health, education and aging. \r\n\r\nTo answer the question of how inequality emerges within a group of people, and to address broader concerns regarding its negative impacts, University of Utah researchers Drs. Karen L. Kramer and Ryan Schacht will work with a group of rural Maya. This study population provides an ideal opportunity to explore the emergence and consequences of inequality for two key reasons: 1) the Maya have only recently had regular access to wage labor and economic markets and are just beginning to show signs of inequality in wealth, health, and education; 2) working with the Maya helps the researchers to account for many of the confounding factors that confuse a clear interpretation of associations between inequality and negative outcomes in the West. The researchers will test the hypothesis that risk orientation is a key determinant for the emergence of inequality. The central prediction is that preexisting variation in kin and non-kin network size affects risk orientation and subsequently facilitates the differential accumulation of wealth (land, consumer goods, cash, education, health) by some more than others. The project integrates a network and risk sensitivity approach to study decision-making under diversifying socioeconomic conditions. Their research findings will offer insight not only to the consequences looming for many small-scale societies currently undergoing economic and wealth transitions, but also to industrialized populations experiencing ever increasing levels of wealth inequality.",
