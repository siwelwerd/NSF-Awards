The Southern California Number Theory Day at UCI is a series of annual one-day conferences in number theory that brings together mathematicians from Southern California and beyond.  The conferences will encourage interactions and collaborations among number theorists, giving the participants the opportunity to interact with scholars from other institutions, and giving graduate students and postdocs the opportunity to interact with senior mathematicians from other institutions in academia, government, or industry.  A special effort will be made to include speakers from under-represented groups and to encourage participants from under-represented groups. Information about these meetings may be found at: http://www.math.uci.edu/~krubin/ntg/number_theory.html\r\n\r\nThe lectures are research talks at the cutting edge of the field, given by international experts. The collaborations that are formed should lead to new ideas and useful research results in important areas of mathematics. The conferences bring together a critical mass of number theorists, in a way that each Southern California institution individually cannot do with its own seminars. The conferences also serve as a way to disseminate the latest research.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nFunds from this grant supported several number theory conferences held at University of California, Irvine.  These include one-day \u2018Southern California Number Theory Day\u2019 meetings in October 2016, October 2017, and October 2019.  Each of these conferences had four invited speakers.  The 2017 meeting also included a poster session with six graduate students presenting their research.  The Fall 2018 Southern California Number Theory Day was part of a special week-long conference, \"Conference on Open Questions in Cryptography and Number Theory\".  This conference had 20 invited speakers who came from around the United States, and also from Universiteit Leiden and University of Auckland.  There were two Open Problems sessions and working groups consisting of mathematicians at different levels (including students) studying open problems related to conference lectures.  At least one of these working group projects resulted in a published research paper.  Funds from this grant supported graduate student participants at the ANTeater \u201922 (Analytic Number Theory @UCI \u201922) conference.  This four-day summer school brought together senior and junior mathematicians including students.  There were a series of mini-courses consisting of four lectures each, supplemented by research talks.  The ANTeater \u201922 conference also contained a profession development panel focused on the academic job market, and working groups where mathematicians at different career stages worked together on open problems.\nThese conferences brought together a critical mass of number theorists, in a way that each southern California institution individually cannot do with its own seminars.  Conference lectures were at the cutting edge of the field, given by international experts.  The conferences served as a way to disseminate the latest research.  Conferences supported by this grant encouraged interactions and collaborations among number theorists, leading to new ideas and interesting and useful research results.  Participants had the opportunity to interact with scholars from other institutions.  Graduate students and other early-career mathematicians were given the opportunity to interact with senior mathematicians from other institutions in academia, government, and industry.  Whenever possible, slides from conference talks and digital copies of conference posters have been made available online.  A large number of conference speakers and participants came from groups traditionally underrepresented in mathematics.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/03/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Nathan C Kaplan"
