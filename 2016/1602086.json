It involves an international collaboration that enables U.S. scientists to work at CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research in Switzerland, at the CLOUD (COsmics Leaving Outdoor Droplets) chamber there. The results of this research are expected to have implications that go beyond the atmospheric sciences, to numerous industrial and other natural processes.\r\n\r\nThe objectives of this research are to: (1) advance measurement methods to make it possible to measure the size distribution of freshly nucleated clusters/particles as a function of time as they exist in the atmosphere in which they are formed in order to map their passage through the Kelvin regime, i.e., from near critical, or even sub-critical cluster sizes through to stable particles; (2) measure and model the multicomponent activation kinetics as low volatility organic compounds and extremely low volatility organic compounds condense on inert and sulfuric acid clusters in the Kelvin size regime, varying the temperature and composition of the atmosphere to probe the underlying mechanisms; (3) measure and model new particle formation, secondary activation, and growth in carefully controlled chamber experiments in order to constrain and parameterize new particle formation under a wide range of atmospheric conditions and for key aerosol precursors.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nParticles in the atmosphere (aerosols) include primary aerosols that are emitted directly to the air by both human (anthropogenic) and natural sources, and secondary aerosols that are formed from vapors in the atmosphere, either by condensing on primary particles or by nucleating new particles from products of chemical reactions of reactive vapors.  Atmospheric aerosols are important because they affect air quality, human health, and climate.  Greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane, remain suspended in the atmosphere long enough to be distributed around the globe and, therefore, produce global-scale warming.  In contrast, aerosols, and the clouds that form by water condensation on those that are large enough to act as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN), only survive from days to weeks.  Hence, the cooling that results when sunlight is scattered back to space by hazes and clouds, varies widely over the earth, causing the greatest uncertainty in our present understanding of the radiative energy balance for the planet, among many other facets of climate change.   \n\n \n\nThe focus of this research has been on the formation and growth of secondary aerosols, with particular emphasis on new particles formed by nucleation from vapor precursors.  To advance the quantitative understanding of atmospheric nucleation, we have developed instruments that enable rapid measurements of the size distribution of particles down to 1 nanometer in particle size, and have used these instruments to measure particle formation in a unique experimental system located at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland. That Cosmics Leading to Outdoor Droplets (CLOUD) experiment is based on arguably the cleanest atmospheric simulation facility ever developed.  By tracking the evolving size distributions of freshly nucleated particles, our measurements form a bridge between the molecular clusters detected by high resolution mass spectrometry and conventional aerosol instruments that measure larger particles. \n\n \n\nIn the CLOUD experiments we have probed nucleation and new particle growth under conditions that simulate environmental conditions throughout Earth's troposphere, from the remote ocean and arctic marine atmosphere, to the atmosphere over a boreal forest site where ambient measurements have probed nucleation for decades, to dense urban smog.  Data from these laboratory experiments have led to fundamental models to new particle formation that have been integrated into atmospheric simulations to examine their impact in the global atmosphere.  In previous experiments and analyses, sulfuric acid produced by atmospheric oxidation of sulfur dioxide, which is primarily emitted from fossil fuel combustion, has been shown to be the primary nucleating agent in Earth's troposphere, but the inferred rates of particle nucleation were too slow to explain atmospheric nucleation rates.  In a reanalysis of CLOUD data taking into account the reactions of that sulfuric acid with basic species (e. g., ammonia and amines) and intermolecular forces that had not been incorporated into earlier models, the new rates agreed well with atmospheric observations.  When integrated into a global atmospheric model, the enhanced growth rate was found to increase the predicted particle number concentrations in the upper free troposphere by up to 50%.\n\n \n\nPrevious observations of the formation of new particles in dense urban smog are puzzling since the high particle concentrations will rapidly scavenge the highly diffusive clusters before they can grow large enough to survive.  Nitric acid and ammonia are abundant in such environments, but they, and their reaction product, ammonium nitrate, are generally too volatile to condense on such small particles.  Based upon experiments performed at 5oC at CLOUD, we have discovered that these species can condense onto freshly nucleated particles as small as a few nanometers in diameter, causing them to grow exceptionally rapidly, thereby revealing a mechanism for the unexpected nucleation events.   Furthermore, we have shown that below -15oC, ammonia and nitric acid can undergo homogeneous nucleation.  Atmospheric simulations based upon this result suggest that this mechanism may dominate new particle formation in the Asian monsoon region of the upper troposphere. \n\n \n\nResults from this study thus provide critical inputs into atmospheric modeling of the impacts of atmospheric reactions and new particle formation in the study of climate change.  The instruments and data analysis methods that we have introduced through this research represent important advances for atmospheric science, and for aerosol science in general.  We have further identified an error in the extraction of fine particle size distributions from the scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS), which is the most commonly used instrument for such measurements worldwide. We developed a rigorous model to clearly show the source of that error, and provided a practical method that can correct the data analysis for the many different SMPS systems and their operating parameters used in atmospheric measurements around the world.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/31/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Richard C Flagan"
