 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in the ability of the haloacetic acids (HAAs) analyzer proposed here to change how superintendents of drinking water utilities go about understanding their drinking water treatment plants. The HAAs analyzer will allow superintendents to continuously map, monitor and then optimize their drinking water treatment practices using detailed and high quality measurements on the federally-regulated HAAs, which are carcinogens. Optimizing of the water treatment practices using the HAAs analyzer will reduce chemical usage (save money) while simultaneously providing the highest quality drinking water for their customers by minimizing HAAs. The commercial U.S. market for Drinking Water chemicals, contract operations, consulting/engineering, instrument and testing is $19.3 billion. The entire U.S. Water industry market is $86.4 billion. The major target of this proposal is the 28,643 traditional community water systems serving 90 % of the U.S. population. Some water systems struggled to meet Stage 1 Disinfection By-Product (DBP) regulations. Stage 2 of these regulations is stricter. The DBP regulations address long-term (decades' timescale) exposure to HAAs. Superintendents can use the proposed HAAs analyzer to understand hourly, short-term variations in their treatment plants to enhance long-term minimization of HAAs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis project will commercialize the first state-of-the-art instrument for fully automated, on-site process monitoring of the drinking water disinfection by-products known as haloacetic acids (HAAs). The HAAs analyzer proposed here has the potential to significantly reduce the cost of water treatment through reduction of treatment chemical usage at the water treatment plant while simultaneously improving and stabilizing water quality with respect to the carcinogenic and federally regulated HAAs. Currently, most drinking water treatment plants use contract laboratories to determine HAAs concentrations in the distribution system. This approaches can take 2 - 3 weeks to return the results at a significant expense for the equivalent hourly data provided by the proposed HAAs analyzer. The research objectives for this Phase II SBIR proposal are to develop components for the HAAs analyzer to enable long-term, maintenance free operation with minimal operator intervention. Simultaneously, costs will be reduced for both construction and operation of the HAAs analyzer to establish commercial feasibility. The anticipated results will be a HAAs analyzer that will provide water treatment personnel individual and Total HAAs concentrations once per hour, on-site and automatically.",

Rapid Response (HAA-RR) system. The HAA-RR is designed to report concentrations of Haloacetic Acids from 1 ? 100 part-per-billion at a drinking water treatment plant on-site, on-line and in real-time. The haloacetic acids are carcinogenic by-products or drinking water chlorination and regulated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency at 0.060 mg/L (or 60 parts-per-billion). Drinking water superintendents that purchase the HAA-RR will be able to use the HAA-RR system to optimize their treatment processes with respect to haloacetic acids, reduce haloacetic acids concentrations, and thus reduce cancer risks for the customers served by their distribution system. In other words, the HAA-RR system will allow drinking water superintendents to lower cancer risks for whole cities and counties at a time.</p>\n<p>In addition to the HAA-RR system, Foundation Instruments was also able to commercialize three other spin-out products: the EZ-AutoPipet, the EZ-AutoTitrator, the RR-AutoCal, and the EZ-Gradient.<strong><br /></strong></p>\n<p><em>EZ-AutoPipet</em></p>\n<p>The EZ-AutoPipet is a device capable of semi-automating the preparation of calibration standards used with our HAA-RR system. This process requires a high degree of expertise without the EZ-AutoPipet. Using the EZ-AutoPipet, a relatively unskilled analyst can rapidly and reproducibility prepare calibration standards with ease. For any instrumental analysis, calibration is a critical part of accurate and reproducible results. The EZ-AutoPipet is useful for the HAA-RR system that was the main thrust of this project. However, it also has broader use with our existing THM ? Rapid Response system as well as practically any analytical chemistry laboratory that prepares analytical standards.</p>\n<p><em>EZ-AutoTitrator</em></p>\n<p>The EZ-AutoTitrator is a device capable of delivering precise amounts of titrants to a sample solution in order to carry out a chemical titration. The EZ-AutoTitrator was configured to carry out three common chemical analyses in a typical drinking water laboratory: (1) a typical pH meter; (2) a potentiometric titrator; and (3) a colorimetric titrator. As a pH meter, it is used to measure the pH of drinking water, a routine parameter measured often in the drinking water laboratory. As a potentiometric titrator, the EZ-AutoTitrator is used for semi-automated measurement of Alkalinity (and to a lesser extent, Acidity). Alkalinity is one of the most commonly measured parameters in a typical drinking water treatment laboratory. Acidity is also sometimes monitored, but less common. Finally, as a colorimetric titrator, the EZ-AutoTitrator can sense color changes as the indicator in a titration undergoes a color change. This has has direct application in the semi-automated measurement of Water Hardness which is a parameter measured in a typical drinking water treatment plant each shift. The advantage of the EZ-AutoTitrator is that color change (endpoint) detection no longer depends on the shade of color detected by different operators (subject to error.) This means that user variability from person to person and from shift to shift is eliminated.</p>\n<p class=\"vert-spacing\"><em>RR-AutoCal</em></p>\n<p class=\"vert-spacing\">The RR-AutoCal<strong> </strong>was developed in response to two problems: (1) automatically calibrating the HAA-RR system that was the research and development thrust of this project; and (2) our customers indicated to us a desire to be able to run a series of grab samples from their distribution systems in addition to the planned, on-line operation of the HAA-RR system. The RR-AutoCal solves these two issues. The RR-AutoCal functions as both an auto-calibration system as well as an auto-sampler. Our unique design has only one moving part; thus, there is no robotic arm that can be misaligned or malfunction in some way during the standards and sample delivery process. As a result, the incidence of failure is greatly reduced. While the RR-AutoCal was designed for use with the HAA-RR system in this project, it can also be interfaced with our existing flagship product, the THM-RR, as well as other liquid sampling-based instruments.</p>\n<p><em>EZ-Gradient</em></p>\n<p>Finally, the<strong> </strong>EZ-Gradient is a module that is a programmable, low-pressure, quaternary gradient mixer for cost-effectively upgrading common isocratic high-pressure liquid chromatograph (HPLC) pumps to gradient HPLC pumps</p>\n<p><strong>Boader Impacts</strong></p>\n<p>The impact of this project is broad. 95% of the population is served by 52,000 traditional community water systems that are the major targets of our HAA-RR product.

The money saved will be able to be used to improve other aspects of the treatment plant. Simultaneously, the drinking water superintendents will be able to reduce cancer risks for their customers in the cities and counties that they serve.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 09/17/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Paul&nbsp;S&nbsp;Simone</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1556127/1556127_10416685_1568763271951_HAA-RapidResponse--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1556127/1556127_10416685_1568763271951_HAA-RapidResponse--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"HAA-Rapid Response with RR-AutoCal and EZ-AutoPipet\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1556127/1556127_10416685_1568763271951_HAA-RapidResponse--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"HAA-Rapid Response with RR-AutoCal and EZ-AutoPipet\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">This is an image of the HAA-Rapid Response.
