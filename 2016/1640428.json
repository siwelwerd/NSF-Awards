 "awd_abstract_narration": "While recent approaches to Natural Language Processing (NLP) based on\r\nmachine learning from large quantities of data have delivered valuable\r\ntechnology, this success has obscured earlier, more visionary goals of\r\ngetting computers to understand stories, to engage in natural,\r\ncooperative dialogues with people, and to translate text and speech\r\nfluently and accurately from one human language to another.  As such,\r\nthis workshop highlights the value of bringing these early visionary\r\ngoals back into view. \r\n\r\nThe workshop features established researchers who carried\r\nout early work in a major sub-field of speech and language processing\r\nengaging in a moderated public dialogue with younger researchers\r\ninvolved with significant new ideas and/or methods. The workshop is\r\norganized into four sessions, each with a moderator and invited\r\nspeakers, on the topics of Dialogue and Speech, Natural Language\r\nGeneration, Text Understanding, and Grounded Language. Dialogue in\r\neach session is enriched through questions solicited beforehand from\r\nprospective attendees, as well as impromptu questions from the\r\naudience. The workshop includes graduate student scribes who\r\ncollaborate to deliver a summary of each session, and a poster session\r\nhighlights the students' research.  In addition to the workshop\r\nproceedings, the workshop's outcome is a public report based on notes\r\ncontributed by the speakers and the session summaries produced by the\r\nteam of student scribes.",
