 "awd_abstract_narration": "Security of information, software, and hardware has emerged as a paramount concern. Existing undergraduate curricula often do not provide students with adequate insight into the full spectrum of security threats and respective protection approaches. To fill this gap in the curriculum, this project is developing an interdisciplinary undergraduate course incorporating hands-on learning of computer security. The course provides a comprehensive system-level view of computer security to students, so they can become more aware of diverse security issues and countermeasures as future developers and users of computer systems. A distinctive aspect of the project is the inclusion of a set of well-crafted experiments that would allow students to hack into software and hardware in many creative ways. These experiments can be highly effective in demonstrating the complex nature of system security and creating an understanding of the defense mechanisms. The exposure to security issues early in their career can provide undergraduate students with a competitive edge in the market place and stimulate their interests in security research. The course modules can also benefit graduate students pursuing research in the area of computer security, as well as the K-12 students attending summer camps each year. The project provides a unique opportunity for exposing minority and female students in Cleveland State University to the critical issues of security and attracting them to higher education and research. The project uses the trust-hub web portal for disseminating the course modules to other academic institutions in a timely manner.",

In the University of Florida, the course has been introduced in Fall 2016 after PI Bhunia moved here in Fall 2015.
