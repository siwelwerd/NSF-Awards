 "awd_abstract_narration": "This National Science Foundation (NSF) Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (S-STEM) project is a collaborative effort between California State University San Bernardino (CSUSB) and four community colleges: Barstow College, College of the Desert, Imperial Valley College, and San Bernardino Valley College. Through a transfer collaborative these five Hispanic Serving Institutions/Minority Serving Institutions will work together to provide financial, curricular, and co-curricular support for some of Inland Southern California's lowest-income STEM majors. The program will provide scholarships to community college and transfer students who are pursuing degrees in biology, chemistry, biochemistry, computer science, engineering, geology, mathematics or physics. In addition to scholarships, the program will provide academic and other support to increase the persistence of these academically talented, low-income students.  The co-curricular support on each campus builds on existing programs and is informed by an understanding of factors that contribute most to student success. Support activities include mentoring prior to transfer, learning cohorts, and research activities at CSUSB. Scholarships and support for low-income and academically talented students, who may not otherwise be able to obtain engineering or computer science degrees, will help to produce a well-trained workforce that will contribute to the economic well being of the nation.\r\n\r\nIn addition to promoting success of talented low-income students, the project will advance understanding about the factors and activities associated with improvements in retention, transfer, and degree attainment. The student support mechanisms proposed on each participating campus, and the coordination between institutions provide a unique model for helping students from a highly disadvantaged population to earn degrees in STEM.  The current understanding of factors contributing to transfer student success is limited, particularly for programs serving larger numbers of Hispanic students. Similarly, more information is needed about ways to ensure student success between transfer and graduation. The project will study successful trends in transfer and graduation rates, and uncover what aspects of the program are most successful in this Hispanic Serving Institution environment. Results from this project can contribute to the body of knowledge about what factors most influence success for these talented low-income students. The findings from the program will be disseminated widely to help other institutions to maximize the success of transfer students in STEM fields.",

We also investigated and documented how to best support underrepresented/low-income student success from pre-transfer through the bachelors degree attainment. The four CC's: Barstow College, Imperial Valley College, College of the Desert, and San Bernardino Valley College, serve populations of students of lower income on average, and greater diversity than CSUSB, itself a minority-serving institution with 80% of the students first in their families to earn a college degree. A total of 218 student scholars received scholarships for one or more years: 67 supported at CSUSB post-transfer only; 128 at CCs pre-transfer only; and 23 supported at both their CC and CSUSB. The 88 transfer scholars have received bachelor's degrees at CSUSB to or are on track to receive a degree in 2024 (98% retention and graduation rates, including two who left the program but went on to graduate).</p>\n<p><strong>Intellectual merit:</strong> The program was supported by an external evaluator, and an educational researcher. Combining these evaluations, we learned a number of lessons on factors for these students' success: (1) an ecosystem of support (including purposeful mentoring, peer support, financial support, workshops/programming, research/internship opportunities, and collaborative spaces to gather) aids in successful pre-transfer support at CCs; (2) this ecosystem helps build science identities, particularly for students whose race/ethnicity/gender/first generation status intersects with financial need; (3) for post-transfer students, assigned faculty mentors, cohort coursework, and research/internship opportunities in addition to financial assistance speeds time to graduation with, 100% of retained scholars finishing their post-transfer studies in three years or less; (4) interaction between CC partners and CSUSB personnel enriched experiences for students on all campuses, and has led to additional collaborations beyond the project; (5) many community colleges struggle with staff turnover and limited infrastructure for managing awards; (6) the shift to online pandemic-era learning increased challenges in recruiting and support, particularly at community colleges; however, communications hubs such as MS Teams provided improved collaboration and sense of belonging during and after the pandemic; (7) the two CCs with&nbsp; MESA programs (Mathematics, Engineering Science Achievement Program) on campus leveraged MESA resources to more efficiently and effectively implement their programs; this includes the \"Steminars\" initiated first at COD as a way to enhance science identities for scholars and other MESA students. These lessons were shared regularly with the project team and used throughout the program to improve outcomes as we progressed, and much has been shared externally via publications and presentations.</p>\n<p><strong>Broader impact: </strong>Our colleges serve the people of Riverside and San Bernardino counties of inland southern California, which has a lower educational attainment, lower median income, and higher minority (especially LatinX) population that the state. The geographic area served is larger than each of the 10 smallest states, and our service area population is about 4.5 million residents. For both affordability and location, many very talented, often low-income students begin their studies at CCs and transfer to regional institutions like CSUSB. This project has helped 88 bachelors degree scholars at CSUSB in biology, chemistry, computer science &amp; engineering, geology, mathematics, and physics graduate. More than half of these students participated in research or internships, some at multiple sites. Of our 88 graduates, nearly half have entered STEM graduate programs, or applied programs such as science teaching credential/education masters programs or clinical laboratory sciences certification. At least eight of our former scholars are teaching in either community colleges (two) or grades 6-12 science (six), enhancing the STEM educational pipeline in the region for years to come. In addition, of the 128 students who were supported at CCs but did not transfer to CSUSB, more than 90% of the scholars tracked earned an AA or AS degree or transferred to another 4-year institution (or both). The scholarships and co-curricular support provided by this program and implemented at five institutions empowered these talented, low-income STEM students to succeed academically, enabling them to contribute to the regional economy for years to come.
