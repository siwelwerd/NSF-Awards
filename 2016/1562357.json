 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project addresses the need for enhanced modeling and simulation of flexible multibody dynamics (FMD) that can accurately capture friction-induced behavior, including stick-slip motion and Schallamach detachment waves. Such system-level frictionally excited vibrations can greatly degrade efficiency and lifetime, and may be especially significant where compliant materials are in frictional contact with relatively rigid bodies, as in soft robots, engineered biological systems, and other emerging engineering areas. In addition to modeling and simulation, this research will apply the enhanced FMD formulations -- together with complementary experiments -- to study biomimetic surface patterning for influencing and controlling undesired frictionally induced behavior. The FMD simulation tools arising from this project will reduce the need for expensive and time-consuming design prototypes in important US industries, including automotive, manufacturing equipment, and robotics. The project includes outreach activities to increase participation of underrepresented groups in engineering through K-12 internship and training opportunities in the investigators' labs.\r\n\r\nThe primary research objective is to explore the applicability and enhancement of flexible multi-body dynamics simulation tools for analyzing Schallamach waves, and related stick-slip contact dynamics. Resolving such frictional behavior will be accomplished using new and efficient contact formulations, together with efficient implementations and solution procedures. Detailed experiments will test the multi-body dynamics predictions and suggest directions for further refinements. In later stages of the research, both computation and experiments will be exercised to demonstrate new capabilities for exploring design changes, such as various micro- and macro-scale patterns, that can regularize sliding and limit detrimental stick-slip and vibration behavior. Successful completion of the research effort will greatly increase our ability to design and tailor multi-body systems incorporating soft elements while significantly extending the reach of flexible multi-body dynamics simulation to new and important research areas.",

When a compliant material comes into frictional contact with a much harder material with a non-zero relative tangential velocity between the two surfaces, surface instabilities may occur at the leading or trailing edge of the compliant surface resulting in propagation of surface waves in the compliant material. Those stick-slip waves can cause abrasion of the compliant material, noise, and unwanted vibrations which can negatively affect the reliability and durability of the overall mechanical system. Adolf Schallamach was the first to document and investigate those surface friction driven instabilities. He observed that when the resistance to the relative motion, caused by friction and/or adhesion between the two bodies is relatively high, the relative motion between the two materials takes the form of waves in the form of a buckling bend in the rubber surface which moves relative to the hard surface in an inch-worm fashion from the front to the rear of the contact area. Those waves were termed \"Schallamach waves.\" The main objective of this project is to explore the applicability and enhancement of multibody dynamics/finite element simulation tools for predicting stick-slip dynamic contact dynamics such as Schallamach waves, in systems where relatively soft bodies are in frictional contact with relatively rigid bodies. Specifically, the project has the following three goals: (1) Study downstream effects of Schallamach wave stick-slip motion on the dynamic response of the multibody system; (2) Study the effects of material and multibody system's parameters on the Schallamach wave behavior; and (3) Study techniques to influence, control, and tailor the presence of Schallamach waves and stick-slip behavior. This was done through the use of a high-fidelity computational finite element/multibody dynamics computational model and experimental exploration using a one-pulley belt drive test device. Some of the main conclusions of the project are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Stick-slip instabilities occur when the coefficient of friction between the two surfaces is above a certain critical value (around 2 in the systems studied), and when a relatively large torque, also above a certain critical value, is transmitted.</li>\n<li>Two types of stick-slip instabilities occur over pulleys in belt-drives depending on whether the pulley is a driver or driven pulley: Schallamach waves over driver pulleys and expansion waves over driven pulleys. The stick-slip mechanism on the driven pulley where the belt slips at belt's outlet region by expansion waves which travel into the belt span can be considered the reverse of the Schallamach wave mechanism on the driver pulley where the belt slips by buckling/compression waves which start at the belt's outlet side and travel into the belt contact arc.</li>\n<li>Normal adhesion stress between the belt and pulleys is not the driving mechanism for stick-slip instabilities, but it affects the magnitude, diffusion, and frequency of the surface stick-slip waves.
