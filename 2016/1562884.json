 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chirality describes the structural handedness of objects which are distinct from their own mirror images. Chirality is ubiquitous in nature and best known in looking at our own left and right hands. It is also found in many sugar molecules, amino acids and in larger proteins, nucleic acids and viruses, where chirality has a profound effect on function; for example chiral molecules behave differently in chemical reactions and in their interaction with polarized light. Inspired by natural chiral molecules, artificial chiral plasmonic nanostructures are explored to exploit their strong light interaction and realize 'giant' optical responses for applications including biosensing, light emission, and light manipulation. The realization of chiral plasmonic nanostructures requires plasmonic materials to be shaped into complex, subwavelength, three-dimensional architectures. However, it is not trivial to fabricate high densities of these nanostructures over the large areas required. This award will unite top-down fabrication and bottom-up assembly to realize chiral plasmonic nanostructures that have strong, polarization-dependent optical properties. By exploiting the disparate physical properties of bulk and nanocrystalline materials, chiral materials that are responsive to optical and magnetic stimuli will be created.  The team will utilize the simplicity of these fabrication technologies to design a new optical device fabrication lab to make the field accessible to K-12 and undergraduate students participating in science festivals, camps, and formal curricula. The team will also share career experiences to encourage women to pursue careers in science and engineering. \r\n \r\nOptical metamaterials enable unprecedented control of light by engineering the size, shape, and physical properties of matter, artificially structured from plasmonic and non-plasmonic building-blocks with nanometer scale precision. Among them, chiral plasmonic metamaterials combine strong light-matter interactions with the unique polarization selectivity created by their structural handedness. This award aims to advance the nanoscale manufacturing of large-area, multi-functional, three-dimensional, chiral plasmonic nanostructures by exploiting size- and shape-engineered templates defined by nanoimprint lithography and the different deposition processes and properties of bulk and nanocrystal thin films. By combining angle-selective, shadow evaporation of bulk metal thin films with the isotropic deposition of colloidal nanocrystal thin films, hierarchal, chiral nanostructures will be created. Taking advantage of the distinct chemical and structural properties of bulk and nanocrystal thin films, stress will be exploited to drive buckling of bulk metal/nanocrystal nanostructures and thereby turn planar two-dimensional into three-dimensional, chiral nanostructures. By integrating different bulk and nanocrystal materials, strong polarization-dependent and optically and magnetically responsive chiral materials will be realized.",

Bulk materials are deposited to form thin films by physical vapor deposition, whereas colloidal nanocrystals are hybrid systems composed of approximately 2-20 nm diameter inorganic cores and organic/inorganic ligand shells, and are deposited by solution-based techniques. Using these building blocks and deposition processes, we have created complex nanoscale materials and devices. For example:</p>\n<p>(1) We devised a large-area (~1 cm<sup>2</sup>) fabrication method combining nanoimprint lithography to pattern resist and glancing angle deposition to selectively deposit bulk thin films in order to prepare arrays of multilayer nanostructures. To show the generality of this approach, several architectures were successfully fabricated, including L-shaped, twisted arc, and trilayer-twisted Au nanorod structures. We demonstrated the utility of this approach, using L-shaped nanostructures composed of two layers of orthogonally-oriented Au nanorods separated by a Ge dielectric layer, to realize metastructures with giant optical chirality in the infrared region, <em>i.e.</em>, that interact differently with left- versus right circularly polarized light. This large-area fabrication technique to produce chiral substrates is practically important for biosensing and light manipulation.</p>\n<p>(2) We fabricated Au nanorod arrays, by either electron-beam lithography and Au thermal evaporation or nanoimprint lithography and spin-coating of colloidal Au nanocrystal assemblies, on the surface of or embedded in water-responsive polymers known as hydrogels. We demonstrated that Au nanorod ? hydrogel metastructures are excellent platforms for colorimetric moisture sensors. The change in the refractive index of the hydrogel upon exposure to moisture is transduced into spectral shifts of the resonances of the Au nanorod array, changing its color. As a proof of concept, we placed the sensor on uneven soil surfaces and demonstrated consistent sensor resonance shifts that only depends on the soil wetness. Robust, eco-friendly optical moisture sensors provide a promising sensing platform for smart soil moisture monitoring important to tackling the challenge of water scarcity in agriculture.</p>\n<p>(3) We designed and fabricated microstructures to locally amplify the strain created on elastomeric substrates by an external mechanical stimulus. To demonstrate the utility of strain amplification, we integrated a plasmonic lattice array in the gap between a pair of symmetric microrods to realize structurally reconfigurable, optical metasurfaces (<em>i.e.</em>, the color changes as the substrate is stretched). For the highest strain amplification of a factor of 15.9, the mechano-sensitivity of the optical responses of the plasmonic lattice array was a factor of 10 greater than that of state-of-the-art stretchable plasmonic resonator arrays. Microstructured elastomeric substrates provide a platform for designing ultrasensitive stretchable optical devices (<em>e.g.</em>, resonators, filters, waveplates, metalenses, holograms, color pixels, and nanolasers) and stretchable electronics (e.g., human motion sensors and skin-mountable devices).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>(4) By exploiting the different chemical and mechanical properties of solution-deposited colloidal nanocrystal assemblies and physically-deposited bulk thin films, we transformed two-dimensional lithographically patterned nanocrystal/bulk bilayer heterostructures into three-dimensional (3D), folded, cell-sized structures. Nanocrystals are capped by long ligands introduced in their synthesis, and therefore their surfaces are chemically addressable, and their assemblies are mechanically ?soft,? in contrast to bulk thin films. Chemical modification of the nanocrystal surface, exchanging the long ligands for more compact chemistries, triggers a large volume shrinkage in the nanocrystal layer and drives bending of the nanocrystal/bulk heterostructures. Taking advantage of the differential chemo-mechanical properties of nanocrystal and bulk materials, we demonstrated the scalable fabrication of 3D, cell-sized nanocrystal/bulk superstructures, such as curled-L, claw, and helical structures, which possess unique optical, magnetic, chemical, and mechanical functions derived from nanocrystal building blocks.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>(5) We introduced a ligand hybridization strategy using two surface ligands with different molecular lengths to tune interparticle interactions and program the optical properties of Au nanocrystal assemblies.&nbsp; The optical transmittance, reflectance, and permittivity and the electrical resistivity of the assemblies were continuously tuned from that characteristic of a dielectric material to that of a metal. The programmable physical properties of the assemblies <em>via</em> the ligand hybridization strategy allowed us to create strong, ultrathin film optical absorbers with large extinction at infrared wavelengths, a factor of 6 greater than that of bulk Au films. The large increase in extinction in the assemblies is consistent with resonantly enhanced absorption and electron relaxation. We further demonstrated the enhanced extinction by a significant temperature increase of 19.3 ?C in the assemblies upon 808 nm illumination, in contrast to a negligible one in bulk Au (0.3 ?C). These strong, ultrathin nanocrystal-based optical absorbers transduced light to heat, and when layered with thermo-responsive polymers changed color.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This grant trained a postdoctoral fellow and doctoral, masters, and undergraduate students.
