This effort supports continued atmospheric observations of carbon dioxide and methane concentrations, and water and energy fluxes at 2 sites in the freshwater marsh regions of Everglades National Park. The collection of data from 2 additional sites will allow the science investigators to scale up to a regional level and to better develop predictive models to estimate future ecosystem greenhouse carbon balance in the Everglades.\r\n\r\nThe four study sites are co-located with Florida Coastal Everglades Long Term Ecological Research (FCE-LTER) sites and represent the strong gradients found in marsh and mangrove ecosystems of the Park. This work will also contribute to research being conducted through the NSF-supported National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) Program, the National Park Service, the South Florida Water Management District (SFWMD), and the United States Geological Survey (USGS).",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project asked: how much methane (CH4), is currently released from Everglades wetlands, what factors control methane production, and what is the balance of the two greenhouse gases, carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane coming from the Everglades?\n\nMethane (natural gas, swamp gas) is a stronger greenhouse gas per molecule than carbon dioxide, although methane concentrations are far lower than those of CO2, which persists in the atmosphere much longer than CH4.

Historically, the Everglades were a sink for CO2 indicated by the presence of deep peat soils.  The Everglades are currently highly modified with water inputs controlled by water management and rainfall.  The current Everglades restoration plan aims to increase water flow into Everglades National Park (ENP). \n\n We measured the exchange of CO2 and CH4 with the atmosphere at three sites in the Everglades, combining short-term spot measurements of different vegetation types with whole ecosystem measurements for annual estimates for larger areas.

Increased water levels there are causing expansion of wetland species tolerant of flooding at the expense of species active during the dry season.  In both field data and a lab experiment we found that the combined effects of water depth and flooding duration on plant health are not simply additive.\n\nTo estimate aquatic productivity (photosynthesis underwater), we deployed dissolved oxygen sensors within the water column.  While emergent plants (plants with leaves above water) dominate total system productivity, aquatic productivity sometimes can account for a large part of total ecosystem photosynthesis. \n\nBoth freshwater marshes showed net release of methane on average, though Shark River releases more than the intermittently dry Taylor Slough site.
