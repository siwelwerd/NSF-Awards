 "awd_abstract_narration": "A modernization of the mathematical and statistical tools used to uncover the evolutionary history of life on earth is required to keep pace with the rapid expansion in the availability of genetic data. Moreover, different segments of genetic information can tell conflicting evolutionary histories about a collection of organisms.  This project develops mathematical tools for reconstructing the evolutionary history of large collections of organisms, and for constructing a single tree that encapsulates the conflicting stories told by different pieces of the genome.  Ten undergraduate students, many recruited from groups underrepresented in STEM fields at this primarily undergraduate institution, will be trained in techniques at the intersection of mathematics, statistics, and biology that are required for the algorithmic developments. \r\n\r\nMost methods of super-tree or species tree reconstruction rely on accurately reconstructed gene trees.  In practice, however, most inferred gene trees used in these reconstructions do contain errors. By identifying and explicitly accounting for gene tree estimation error, this project will improve algorithms for super-tree and species tree reconstruction. Alternative approaches for which species trees are reconstructed without dependence on the prior estimation of gene trees will also be developed.",

Participants learned to code in multiple languages, read technical articles in mathematics and biology, and prepare professional presentations and publications.  Participants have enrolled in graduate degrees in computer science, biostatistics, and mathematic.  Additional graduates directly entered the STEM workforce in areas of high economic and national security need, ranging from financial technology and social media to defense contracting work on electronic warfare. In addition to the broader impact these participants have by taking these skills to the workforce; the program is helping shift the demographic landscape in STEM.  Seventy percent of participants belonged to populations historically marginalized in STEM fields.  The 100% graduation rate in STEM fields means that these students will be bringing diverse perspectives to the STEM community.\n\nIntellectually, the scholars worked in collaboration with the PI and with scientists from the University of Hawaii, the College of Wooster, The University of Kentucky, Oklahoma State University, and Ohio State University on projects in mathematical biology.  These projects focused on creating and developing mathematical models of evolution and building computational tools to address problems in the area of phylogenomic.  Findings include a statistical tool for filtering data for biological analysis, a tool for detecting the presence of multiple species among a collection of individual DNA samples.  In addition, ongoing work is being developed to combine machine learning with the classical study of algebraic geometry to make improved estimates of species hybridization.\n\nWhile the primary intellectual aim of this grant was to improve quartet-based algorithms of species tree reconstruction, the impact was in the training of a diverse collection of undergraduates in the mathematical and computational skills that they can transfer across disciplines.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/20/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Joseph P Rusinko"
