 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project supports research into the structural engineering of a modular foundation for large wind energy towers. Structural connections using assembled components have never been contemplated in cases where the forces involved are of the magnitude currently experienced in today's wind turbines.  About 3,000 turbines (and foundations) are constructed each year in the U.S. and about 10,000 internationally, representing a $1 billion domestic market. This market is served well today by cast-in-place concrete technology.  Nevertheless a lighter, stronger, and quicker-to-install foundation system would introduce tremendous value to the entire wind energy industry.  First, it would improve project economics and reduce the price of clean wind electricity. Second, the innovation would eliminate financing and project timing issues inherent with current concrete works.  Third, the innovation would allow farmland to be fully recovered at the end of the project lifecycle, as the proposed structural elements are designed to be lifted back out of the earth, re-tested for strength, and then reused. Fourth, the new approach will eliminate 5,000 tons of carbon dioxide emissions for each 100 megawatt wind farm, based on a reduction in the required cement for the incumbent cast-in-place technology.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this project consists in advanced materials research, advanced structural engineering research, advanced construction methods research, and combining the three into a structural element that can meet the massive overturning forces required of a wind turbine foundation. The research will include finite element modeling of structural design discoveries, plus new research into post-tensioning concrete systems, and new analytical methods in foundation study. The results of the research program are intended to yield a commercially viable structural element that can connect the tower to the girder elements safely, efficiently, and cost-effectively, based on the scale and requirements of the wind industry.",

Adrian Corella, PE, RUTE's Lead Engineer made the success possible along with a stellar group of geotechnical engineering, segmental bridge and wind foundation design experts. RUTE is supremely thankful to the American taxpayers for entrusting us. RUTE will pay that grant forward with new cleantech manufacturing jobs in the near future, and in kind support and donations to Gorge Training Facility, our demonstration project that will benefit energy and engineering education programs in Eastern Oregon.\n\n In 2015 RUTE developed a lighter wind turbine foundation by adapting and applying techniques and materials used in bridge and mining engineering (post-tensioned segmental concrete and high duty anchors).  The 2015 design met the wind industry?s technical requirements for stiffness, strength, fatigue and life cycle.  However, the center hub, where the beam forces and the tower forces are resolved, was designed as cast-in-place concrete and this presented several commercial weaknesses.  RUTE applied for and was awarded an SBIR Phase I grant in order to conduct design research of a modular central hub, ensuring a foundation comprised of only pre-cast parts that could be used at a majority of the wind projects in the US market.\n\nWith the SBIR award, RUTE was able to hire an additional specialized and experienced structural engineering researcher that could design a pre-cast modular hub component, and resolve the complex load path calculations. It was necessary to find an engineer that had cross-function expertise in geotechnical, structural, foundation and segmental concrete (bridge) engineering. \n\nWe are excited to state that RUTE has completed it?s NSF scope of work and successfully designed and validated a fully pre-cast modular wind turbine foundation with broad applicability to the US wind industry, and we have confirmed the commercial value of such a product.\n\nThe next step is the experimental full scale validation of the design.  Since this is a new product being introduced to a conservative market, there is a commercial necessity to full scale testing.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/14/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Douglas Krause"
