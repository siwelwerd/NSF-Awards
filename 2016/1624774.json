 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation Program (MRI) and support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program (CRIF), Professor Jillian Smith-Carpenter from Fairfield University and colleagues Matthew Kubasik, John Miecznikowski, Aaron Van Dyke and Catherine Andersen have acquired a matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometer (MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer). In general, mass spectrometry (MS) is one of the key analytical methods used to identify and characterize small quantities of chemical species embedded in complex matrices. A laser impinging on the inert matrix embedded with the sample, vaporizes and ionizes the sample. The ions pass into the mass spectrometer where the masses of the parent ion and its fragment ions are measured. In a time-of-flight instrument the ions are accelerated by an electric field to allow further characterization. MALDI TOF combines gentle ionization (ideal for producing intact ions of peptides, proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, synthetic polymers, and other similarly sized species) with a detection mode that offers an excellent balance between sensitivity and accuracy across a wide mass range. The collision-induced dissociation facilitates fragmentation of molecular ions in the gas phase. This highly sensitive technique allows identification and determination of the structure of molecules in a complex mixture. The acquisition strengthens the research infrastructure at the University and regional area. The instrument broadens participation by involving diverse students in research and research training with this modern analytical technique and is shared with students at the University of Bridgeport and numerous laboratories in Southwestern Connecticut. \r\n\r\nThe award is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels, especially in areas such as (a) obtaining the polymeric distribution of disulfide cross-linked peptide oligomers and aggregates; (b) exploring small molecule strategies for protein labeling; (c) understanding the role of high-density lipoproteins in the regulation of immune activity; (d) developing solid-phase peptide synthesis of alpha,alpha-dialkylated amino acids and (e) developing aqueous transition metal catalysts.",
