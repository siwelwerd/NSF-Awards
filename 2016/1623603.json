 "awd_abstract_narration": "The mechanisms that help societies coalesce into functioning units, can also unravel during times of stress. Such mechanisms take a variety of forms, but are always grounded in social interactions. Forms of integration can be largely economic, political, ritual, or combine aspects of each of these social realms. Places and infrastructure created to increase or house social interactions, such as plazas, roadways, or markets can be highly informative about the choices people make to develop, maintain, or dissolve a sense of community. In urban contexts in particular, these sorts of features are key components of integrating a rural population into the urban setting. Commonalities in household goods and arrangements are another excellent measure of social integration, as households evolve in response to broader social adjustments. Within this context the current project will investigate the apparent fragility of Classic Maya sociopolitical phenomenon and the weaknesses of their ancient states. By examining the structure, degree, and kind of social interactions among members of several very different communities that appear to have participated in the same Late Classic state, this research will analyze how households articulated with the social, political, religious, and ideological strategies utilized by the elite. These ancient communities are located along the longest ancient Maya road, a major piece of infrastructure that connected two urban centers and their rural territories. Although past Mayan society constitutes the focus of this research the underlying principles which it proposes to illuminate are relevant in many developing regions of the world today. Failed states which constitute significant international problems today result from the lack of sufficiently strong integrating mechanisms. Archaeology permits researchers to examine such issues through a long term perspective. Local stakeholders who live and farm along this road today will benefit from learning the details of not only how the road and other ancient infrastructure was built, but through a series of workshops, lectures, and collaborative research projects, these communities will have their first exposure to the methods of scientific investigation. \r\n\r\nSocial interactions that form bonds between people who live in separate cities or regions are a particularly important tool to understand why humans choose to willingly participate in systems of hierarchy with its corollary, oppression. Urban centers are in constant need of new members and draw rural populations into urban settlements forcibly, but also through providing infrastructure and the means for new social interactions. The creation of a massive roadway in the northern Maya lowlands integrated the communities at either end of the road and the rural populations along its length during the Late Classic, but how did daily life change? Were different materials available to local household groups after the completion of the road? Were residential habits altered? Is there evidence for the movement of populations? These questions will be addressed by excavation of households at both cities connected by the road, and at one rural settlement along its length, from periods prior to the construction of the road, and after. By identifying changes in domestic artifacts, trade goods, and burial patterns, the degree of integration achieved by the road project can be measured.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis proposal funded five years of research on archaeological materials from the Classic Maya northern lowlands in Mexico.  By utilizing the latest mapping technology, specifically light detection and ranging (lidar) which allows swift and detailed coverage of areas previously inaccessible due to thick jungle growth, we identified many new details of settlement at two major cities and the ancient road that connects them.  These details include how households were organized spatially, how the boundaries of the cities were established and maintained with wall features, and how settlement spread rapidly along the ancient road from one city to another. Excavation into two households at each of the main cities connected by the ancient road provided valuable new information about how the occupants of each city were impacted by the construction of the road, especially in terms of their economic activities.  This in turn will help us better understand how Maya city-states expanded during times of prosperity and political ambition.  Epigraphic decipherments allow us to see how certain Maya royals of the Classic period were more single-minded than others in terms of territorial expansion, but we lack data on how those elite ambitions were operationalized by the occupants of cities.  Our project provides fine grained data on how the domestic economy of both Yaxuna and Coba changed with the construction of the road that connects them, and thus how one important aspect of daily life was impacted due to a major infrastructure project tied to the expansion of the Coba polity.\n\nLidar mapping of the cities of Yaxuna, Coba, and the 100 km road that connects them allowed us to make new and much more accurate population estimates of both cities, which is turn helps us understand the political and economic dynamics in play during the Late Classic expansion of the Coba polity.  We estimate that during the Late Classic period 600-900 CE and the height of Coba\u2019s power, Yaxuna had a population of only 5-10,000 people, while Coba held 60-90,000 people and was thirty times as large in aerial extent.  Despite these vast differences in scale, Yaxuna was still a desirable candidate for the western terminus of the road, because of its long history of occupation and strategic location in the center of the northern Maya lowlands.  Mapping data also illuminates that as the leaders of Coba built this massive road, they encouraged settlement to spread from Coba westward along the road, and they incorporated, through deviations in the alignment of the road, other small cities that occupied the 100 km of hinterland between them.  We also have evidence that new cities were constructed with, or very shortly after, the creation of the road. Taken together this evidence expands our understanding of how a road is much more than a single feature&mdash;it is a series of decisions about where to direct resources, who will be integrated and who will be left out, and how the state communicates its power outside the urban center.\n\nDomestic excavations provided rich new data on what life was like at both Yaxuna and Coba during the height of Coba\u2019s power in the Late Classic period.  At both cities we chose to excavate domestic groups located in the heart of the urban center, and very near the sacbe in order to attempt to find comparable family groups.  These were neither the poorest farmers nor the royal leaders of the city, they were modest but well provisioned households engaged in multi-production of many crafts as well as food, domestic animals, and other household necessities. Ceramics appear to have been exchanged between the two cities, likely transported along the road, although each city remained self-sustaining in the production of pottery.  While most of the pottery used at both cities, and indeed the whole northern lowlands, is quite similar, even with the construction of the road there were unique ceramic types present at each city.   Distinctive long distance procurement networks also were maintained through the period of the road construction and use&mdash;we found that obsidian was plentiful at both cities but varied in its source, with Coba favoring southern lowland sources and Yaxuna having a higher percentage of obsidian from central Mexico.  This likely is the result of longer term historical connections that Yaxuna had with Gulf coast traders.  Overall, the role of market economies in the Maya economic systems of the Classic period are just beginning to be documented, and data from this project suggests that the strong market orientation of Coba may have only supplemented but certainly did not supplant, longer term strategies of domestic production and distribution at formerly independent cities brought into its political and territorial sway.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/09/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Travis W Stanton"
