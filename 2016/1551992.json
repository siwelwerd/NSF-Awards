 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project investigates early human relatives (hominins) and the environment they lived in 3.5 to 3.3 million years ago, through continued paleontological fieldwork at the site of Lomekwi, Kenya. Recent fossil discoveries, including from Lomekwi, have revealed more hominin diversity than was previously known for that time period. Furthermore, stone tools were recently discovered at Lomekwi, predating the origin of our genus Homo by over one half million years. This fieldwork will help uncover who the first toolmakers were and if there was something special about the environment of the region that spawned species diversity or the advance in technological behavior. The project will strengthen international collaborative ties between the United States and Kenya, and educate students from both countries working together in paleontology and public outreach. The project will bring journalism students, education specialists and scientists together to collaborate in developing middle school and high school teaching materials on human prehistory and science designed to meet Next Generation educational standards for national distribution.\r\n\r\nPaleontological research at Lomekwi is aimed at recovering more hominin fossils (3.5-3.3 Ma) and characterizing their paleoecological context. Until recently, the only known middle Pliocene hominin was Australopithecus afarensis, and hominin diversity appeared to have blossomed only later. With additional fossil data, it now appears that more than one hominin, and perhaps several, coexisted in the mid-Pliocene, most notably Kenyanthropus platyops from Lomekwi. Also, the recent announcement of 3.3 Ma stone tools from Lomekwi suggests that at least some pre-Homo hominins had more advanced material culture earlier than previously imagined. The appearance of stone tools and hominin diversity raises fundamental questions about local and regional environmental and/or biogeographic factors that may have influenced hominins in West Turkana in the mid-Pliocene.  Finding more fossils at Lomekwi stands to reveal how many hominins were present at that time, whether K. platyops is indeed a valid taxon, who the Lomekwian tool makers may have been, and what paleoenvironmental factors may have influenced their diversity and behavior. This project will support an international collaborative team, undergraduate and graduate student training, local community science education and outreach, and science curriculum development. Joint funding for this project is provided by the National Science Foundation's Office of International Science and Engineering (OISE).",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual Merit:  This project conducted renewed fieldwork at 3.5-3.3 million old hominin site of Lomekwi, Kenya, by the West Turkana Paleontology Project (WTPP).  Our aim was to recover more information about possible hominin diversity in the middle Pliocene of eastern Africa, and the context in which this diversity existed.  Specifically, we asked two questions:  (1) What hominins lived at Lomekwi?  Work in the 1990s recovered fossils that were assigned to a new species of hominin, Kenyanthropus platyops.  However, the fossils used to make this determination were in poor condition, so debate has continued about whether K. platyops is indeed a species distinct from its contemporaries elsewhere.  Further, whoever the Lomekwi hominins were, they appear to have been the earliest stone tool makers (the Lomekwian industry), so knowing whether a distinct species was making these tools is of considerable importance.  (2) Was there something special about the environment the Lomekwi hominins were living in?  Specifically, was there an environmental context that may have inspired the development of these earlier stone tools?  Or a different environment that may have led to species diversity in hominins (if K. platyops is supported as a distinct species)?  To this end, we conducted 5 field seasons that were each about 6 weeks long.  Despite considerable disruptions caused by the COVID pandemic and other factors outside of our control, we were successful in our goals.  Related to question 1, we recovered 19 new hominin fossils including a nearly complete mandible of a juvenile, two associated dentitions, and numerous other teeth.  These and these fossils provide a compelling suite of new characters supporting the distinctiveness of K. platyops compared to any other hominin species.  These data underscore the relatively new realization that even before the origin of our genus, Homo, an adaptive radiation of hominins occupied at least eastern Africa, and perhaps further, as early as 3.5 million years ago.  We also know who made the first stone tools.  For question 2, we are still analyzing the robust sample of 1800+ vertebrate fossils our team collected (delayed by pandemic-related events). To maximize the information and impact of these fossils, we are collaborating with the two other teams that have worked at Lomekwi to combine our fossils with the few hundred recovered previously to provide a comprehensive analysis of the species represented at the site.  We have conducted systematic collection surveys to document what fossils are present on the ground in different areas, such as those deposited along lakes, by fast-moving rivers, etc.  We are also sampling more fossils for evidence of isotopes in the tooth enamel that can reveal more about diet and plants that would have been in the area.  This extensive fossil sample will provide important data on the environments occupied by these early stone tool-makers.\n\nBroader Impacts:  Our project had considerable impact outside of the scientific community.  Research approaches and results have been shared by thousands of members of the public through local public science outreach fairs in Columbia, Missouri.  Several educational videos about the process of finding fossils have been created and are used to share with the public.  We trained 6 PhD students (1 Kenyan) and 4 undergraduates (1 Kenyan) in field and lab science.  We supported the Prehistory Club of Kenya which provides extensive outreach to hundreds of schoolkids and teachers alike in and around the Nairobi, Kenya, area.  We worked with the local community in the Lomekwi area to fund more than 40 students over the years of the project to attend secondary school (all students must pay fees to attend school in Kenya).  We also constructed a primary school for local students, as before this no school was available to them in the area. This school now educates 30-40 youth annually.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/27/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Carol V Ward"
