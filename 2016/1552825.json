 "awd_abstract_narration": "Accumulation of man-made trash in the oceans has received much public attention. Human trash includes plastic, fishing debris, and metal, which have negative effects on marine resources. For example, some trash can be ingested by organisms including birds and turtles, and plastic can break down into small particles that have unique toxic properties. The study of the origins, movement, and consumption of trash in the ocean has provided information about ocean currents and food webs. Research by this investigator has shown that trash in rivers can reach similar densities as in the oceans. However, the sources, movements, and influences on biological systems of human trash in rivers are unknown, and are needed to develop efficient prevention strategies and policies. Also, studying the ecology of trash in rivers may reveal previously unexplored controls on ecosystem structure and function. This study will be conducted in Chicago- and Baltimore-area rivers, and include students from high school, undergraduate, and graduate levels. Trash removal will be used by student teachers to develop lessons for teaching the scientific method across grade levels.\r\n\r\nThis research will examine the ecosystem role of anthropogenic litter (AL) in 3 size classes by adapting fundamental tools used to measure communities of organisms and movement of organic matter. First, the role of large AL will be measured. Urban rivers typically have reduced channel complexity due to straightening and flood management. Large AL may act as an ?artificial reef,? providing habitat complexity and organic matter retention that is otherwise lacking, and thereby enhance biodiversity. Researchers will measure stream organism abundance at naturally occurring debris dams (i.e., wood) and at those generated by large AL. Next, this research will quantify interactions between AL and microbes. Bacteria, fungi, and algae carry out important biological activities in rivers, removing excess nutrients and providing food for insects and fish. Initial studies showed AL has unique microbial communities compared to natural surfaces. Experiments will test how microbes are affected by the structural and chemical properties of AL surfaces. Last, movement of intermediate-sized (e.g., shopping bags), and small AL (e.g., microplastic) will be examined. Initial research showed that AL in rivers is abundant and mobile, with some portion always moving downstream. Because AL attracts common toxic chemicals, its movement may be an overlooked pathway for delivery of toxins downstream and into food webs. This work will quantify inputs, outputs, and re-distribution of toxins on litter surfaces in urban streams.",

AL includes materials like plastic, fishing debris, metal, and glass, with negative effects on human and ecosystem health. AL can be ingested by animals, breaks into small particles (e.g., microplastics; fragments &lt;5 mm) which can travel long distances, and is long lasting in the environment. The study of AL in oceans has revealed new insights into currents, food webs, and human stressors. AL and microplastics in rivers can reach similar densities as oceans, but prior to the start of this research, the sources, movement, and biological interactions of AL in rivers was not well understood. This group of studies examined AL dynamics by adapting fundamental tools used to study naturally-occurring particles in streams.</p>\n<p>First, we quantified the spatial distribution of large AL and microplastics. Our research found that AL and microplastics accumulate in at high densities in debris dams of urban streams. Similarly, we found AL accumulates with organic matter on urban beaches in Lake Michigan. We measured a positive relationship between watershed land-use characteristics (i.e., amount of urban development) and AL abundance. Thus, strategies to remove AL and microplastics will be most efficient if focusing on more urbanized watersheds, debris dams, and other places where organic matter accumulates. The data suggest wildlife in debris dams of highly urbanized streams, including invertebrates and fish, are at high risk for encountering AL and microplastics.</p>\n<p>Next, this grant support research that quantified interactions that occur with AL and microbes, as well as fish. Stream biofilms, or mixtures of bacteria, fungi, and algae, are key sites for transformation of carbon and nutrients. AL and microplastics offer novel and ecologically meaningful surfaces to study how substrate type drives biofilm dynamics. Across several studies, we showed biofilms on AL and microplastics are distinct in composition and activity from those on naturally-occurring organic matter. In addition, the differences persisted when the plastic and organic matter are incubated separately or mixed together. When we compared biofilms on AL and microplastics to naturally-occurring inorganic surfaces (e.g., rocks) we found fewer and less consistent differences. Studies on microplastics in fish showed higher concentrations in predators. We used museum specimens to show that microplastic ingestion began in the mid-1900s, and has been increasing through 2018 along with plastic production rates. Overall, AL and microplastics are active sites of biofilm growth and activity. Freshwater fish commonly ingest microplastics and have been doing so since plastic was industrialized. Plastic litter is well-integrated into fundamental ecosystem processes occurring in streams, including carbon and nutrient cycling, as well as food web interactions.</p>\n<p>Our third group of studies quantified the movement of AL, including microplastics, within urban streams. AL resists decomposition, so can be tracked over long-time scales to reveal controls on particle flux from urban streams towards the ocean. Also, plastic litter can adsorb persistent organic pollutants (POPs), so its movement may be a vector for downstream POP transport. We quantified microplastic movement in an outdoor, artificial stream array. Microplastics were retained within streams, and followed the predictions for transport dynamics previously developed for natural particles. We also quantified that AL and microplastic accumulation in debris dams of urban streams commonly occurred above the water line, showing that storm-mediated transport of litter was a key feature of its transport. Finally, we documented triclosan (a widely used antimicrobial compound) accumulation on plastic litter in urbans streams, and noted its transformation to methyl-triclosan by plastic biofilms. This shows plastic litter concentrates and transforms common organic pollutants. This body of work has contributed to models which quantify how plastic moves downstream, and interactions with co-occurring chemical contaminants.</p>\n<p>The final objective of this grant was to incorporate the study of AL into lesson plans for students across different age ranges. Working with an education professor, student teachers, and current science teachers, we developed curriculum materials for students to collect and quantify trash as part of learning the scientific method and general environmental stewardship. Curricular materials were aligned with common core standards and state of Illinois guidelines to facilitate their use in schools.&nbsp; All are published in freely available education journals. This topic was also used to engage students in Loyola's class Solutions to Environmental Problems, where students focused on solutions for microplastics from washing machines on campus. In addition to the impact on younger students, this body of work supported 54 undergraduate students, 6 graduate students, and 2 post-docs. Collectively, work support by this grant made a critical impact on formal and informal education, which is a key component of solving the long-term problem of trash accumulation in our freshwaters.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 09/22/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Timothy&nbsp;Hoellein</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1552825/1552825_10430007_1695396715959_Museumspecimensusedtomeasuremicroplastichistoryinfish--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1552825/1552825_10430007_1695396715959_Museumspecimensusedtomeasuremicroplastichistoryinfish--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Fish museum specimens for measuring microplastic\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1552825/1552825_10430007_1695396715959_Museumspecimensusedtomeasuremicroplastichistoryinfish--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Fish museum specimens for measuring microplastic\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">We measured microplastics in fish collected from the Chicago area and stored at the Field Museum of Natural History.
