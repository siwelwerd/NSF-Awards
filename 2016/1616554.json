Such mapping provides important clues to the evolution of gas and galaxies in the early universe. Broader impacts include training of undergraduate students and postdocs, and development of inexpensive radio telescopes at Fermilab and UW-Madison using new software-defined-radio techniques for use by high-school and college students, through the NSF/DOE QuarkNet program.\r\n\r\nThe experiment will measure the three dimensional large scale structure of the universe via hydrogen emission from distant galaxies. The primary goal is to develop ways to handle the large foreground signal, which has been previously quantified in a path-finder 21cm program conducted on NSF's Green Bank Telescope.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual Merit:  This project tested a new technique in radio astronomy for measuring the large-scale structure of the Universe. The technique, called hydrogen intensity mapping, promises to produce inexpensive, tomographic maps of the cosmos.  These three-dimensional maps may ultimately span from the local Universe to the epoch before the first stars and galaxies formed and allow precise measurements of the expansion and evolution of the Universe.  By observing the evolution of large-scale cosmic structure as a function of distance from us, we will be able to constrain models for some of the most mysterious phenomena in cosmology:  dark energy, dark matter, and inflation.  The amount of cosmic information in such a large three-dimensional map is orders of magnitude greater than in current three-dimensional surveys and in two-dimensional maps of the cosmic microwave background radiation, relic radiation from the Big Bang that is currently our single most informative cosmological tool. \n\n\nHydrogen intensity mapping uses arrays of radio telescopes to survey large swaths of the sky while tuning into the unique radio spectral line of neutral hydrogen gas.  Because these telescopes can simultaneously observe across a wide band of frequencies, they observe the hydrogen signal coming from a range of redshifts (distances) from us in a single measurement.    Neutral hydrogen is ubiquitous in the Universe and, in principle, can be detected even at very high redshifts, before luminous objects appeared.  One of the key challenges in making intensity mapping work is separating the cosmic hydrogen signal from other, much stronger astronomical radio sources that are in the foreground.\n\nWe made progress toward this ambitious goal in several areas.  First, along with collaborators, we helped design a radio telescope in China, called Tianlai, that is dedicated to testing the intensity mapping idea.  It uses two different antenna designs to evaluate optimal designs for future instruments of this type.  Next, we helped develop a data analysis pipeline that takes the raw data from the telescopes and processes it to make radio maps of the sky.  Finally, with these tools, we tested a variety of methods to calibrate the response of the telescopes and tested foreground removal algorithms.   We also evaluated systematic effects in the radio telescopes that tend to obscure the hydrogen signal.  For example, we learned that radio signals that are reflected or transmitted from one antenna to another in a radio telescope array introduce spurious effects that are orders of magnitude larger than the anticipated hydrogen signal.   We estimate that they can be reduced in future arrays to negligible levels by increasing the shielding between the antennas.  Another effect is reflections of radio signals within the individual antennas that can mimic the signature of cosmic hydrogen.\n\nAs another step towards testing this technique, we laid the groundwork for comparing the hydrogen signal from the Tianlai array with that expected from known galaxies in an overlapping region of the sky. To do this, we performed a traditional, three-dimensional galaxy survey.  By comparing the galaxy maps with the hydrogen maps we can learn how effective hydrogen intensity mapping is at detecting known cosmic structures.\n\nBroader Impacts:  In the course of this study, we trained five undergraduate students, three graduate students, and one postdoc.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/04/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Peter T Timbie"
