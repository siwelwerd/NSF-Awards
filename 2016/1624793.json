 "awd_abstract_narration": "Digital forensics is a critical area of forensic science research. New electronic devices and systems are constantly being developed, and these are at risk of being compromised by cybercriminals. The University of South Alabama will bring together academic researchers and industry/agency partners to identify specific projects in Digital Forensics Information Intelligence and work towards establishing a research site that would be part of a larger, multi-site Center for Advanced Research in Forensic Science. The researchers will focus on basic and fundamental research topics in digital forensics that will support industry innovation, economic growth, and national security by making new technologies safer and more secure. The University of South Alabama also has multiple, established channels for dissemination of research findings, K-12 science outreach, undergraduate and graduate student training, and support of diversity and the inclusion of underrepresented groups in the STEM sciences.\r\n\r\nThe University of South Alabama will hold a planning meeting with the goal of establishing a research site in an Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) for Advanced Research in Forensic Science (CARFS). The mission of the proposed Center is to provide a multidisciplinary forum for advancing research, innovation, and training in the forensic sciences. The University of South Alabama research site will focus on Digital Forensics Information Intelligence (DFII), which is the development, testing and implementation of novel approaches to detect and understand compromises to electronic devices, information systems, and software. The research site will undertake industry-collaborative, long-term research addressing such topics as malicious software analysis, detection and exploitation; and technology evaluation. Application areas include mobile devices, additive manufacturing, medical devices, and transportation systems. This is a critical area of research, given the constant development of new electronic devices and systems and their risk of compromise by cybercriminals. \r\n\r\nThis planning grant is jointly supported by NSF and the National Institute of Justice.",
