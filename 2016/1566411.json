The new method is applicable to various representations of\r\nprogram execution with different granularities, using a novel execution trace\r\nmodel. Based on probabilistic inference, it accurately pinpoints at the most\r\nlikely fault locations in a program, rather than reporting every location that\r\nmight contribute to a failure, or reporting a code fragment that is highly\r\ncorrelated with failures.
