 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-year project, a collaboration between The Iowa Children's Museum, the University of Iowa and the University of Washington, will develop and conduct research on a 3,000 square foot exhibit for a children's museum audience that will provide hands-on experiences both about the science of motion (forces, acceleration, friction, balance, etc.) and about how the science relates to designing skateboard parks. Several integrated, physical and digital components will comprise the exhibit, including a digital table-top module where users can experiment virtually with different skateboard park design features.  The project's innovation centers on the team's exploring how to effectively integrate the physical and digital experiences in ways that foster children's engagement with science and with design.  The interactive digital display will also be available as a mobile version that can be used outside of the museum setting. The project's primary goal is to increase children's interest in, engagement in, and understanding of STEM through collaborative, playful tinkering and modeling. The project partnership will build regional and national communities of practice to advance and support early informal STEM education. It will include: 1) a partnership with the Iowa STEM Regional Network Hubs to reach over 275 informal learning practitioners that deliver STEM education to Iowa's underserved rural and Latino communities; 2) sharing resources and expertise that result from this project with the informal STEM learning community and a network of small to mid-sized museums, zoos, libraries, and science centers; 3) a downloadable app-based \"sandbox play space\" that enables youth to collaborate with their peers, teachers, mentors, or family to prepare for or extend their exhibit experience outside the walls of museum, and 4)  outreach programs to serve traditionally underserved youth from rural areas.\r\n \r\nThe initiative will integrate development, research, and evaluation processes using a design-based research approach.  The research will study collaborative learning linkages between child-child and adult-child interactions as well as the dynamics of mixed physical-digital collaborative play in informal STEM learning environments. The exhibit design process will draw on research in the learning sciences and game design, science inquiry and exhibit design, and child development scholarship on engagement and interaction in adult-child dyads.  \r\n\r\nThis work is funded by the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program, which seeks to advance new approaches to, and evidence-based understanding of, the design and development of STEM learning in informal environments.",

Second, we engaged in a range of community outreach and engagement activities for children traditionally underserved in Museums. We developed and disseminated resources for children to learn about the physics of the skatepark exhibit without visiting the Museum physically. For example, balance board activities were made portable, the skatepark video game was produced in app and web access formats, and ramps were created from block sets brought to off-site locations. Third, we conducted a range of research to better understand adult-child interactions in the skatepark exhibit in the Children's Museum and to explore learning of physics concepts during physical and digital play. Our research findings collectively provide a new model for Children's Museum exhibit developers and the informal STEM education community to intentionally design, evaluate, and revise exhibit set-up, materials, and outcomes using a tool called \"Dimensions of Success (DOS) for Children's Museum Exhibits.\" Research also produced a tool for monitoring the movement of children and families in Museum exhibit space, including time on task with exhibits, group constellation, transition time, and time in gallery.
