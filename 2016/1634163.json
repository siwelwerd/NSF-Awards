 "awd_abstract_narration": "This doctoral dissertation research project will examine how tree regeneration in subalpine forests is being influenced by changes in climate and wildfire activity.  By collecting and analyzing extensive field data on factors affecting tree seedling establishment and survival, the doctoral student will identify threats to subalpine forest resilience.  The project will identify altered regeneration patterns in forests, thereby improving capabilities for forecasting broad-scale changes in subalpine forest sustainability and for understanding impacts on carbon storage and cycling, hydrologic processes, and ecosystem services.  Because the study will be conducted in the kinds of forests that are widely distributed across the western United States, research results will have wide-ranging utility.  By elucidating how the relatively fast pace of recent warming affects subalpine tree regeneration, this project will address societal needs for understanding and adapting to changes in forests and the ecosystem services they provide.  Project findings will help land managers to develop appropriate plans for climate adaptation and to evaluate ecosystem vulnerability to climate changes.  To communicate these research findings to land managers and other stakeholders, the investigators will host workshops that address how subalpine forests respond to changing temperatures regimes and increased disturbance by wildfire and bark beetles.  The workshops also will facilitate discussions about adaptation strategies for likely forest changes expected under changing climatic and environmental conditions.  The student and his advisor will develop curriculum materials and will lead field trips for K-12 education at underserved schools, and they will mentor undergraduate students as research assistants through established teaching and advising programs.  As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award will provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent research career.\r\n\r\nGlobal distributions of tree species are closely related to climate conditions.  As temperatures continue to increase, the suitable habitat for tree species is projected to shift upslope.  To compensate for lost habitat at the lower elevation limit, subalpine tree species are expected to migrate upslope to maintain existing populations.  To migrate upslope, trees must first produce sufficient seed, and seeds must arrive in suitable habitats for germination and survival.  As part of this project, the doctoral student will measure these reproductive processes and link them to climatic and other environmental factors to build models assessing the feasibility of upslope migration of tree populations and the sustainability of existing subalpine forests.  The project will address the following questions:  (1) Will increasing fire frequency prevent tree populations from reaching the size and ages required for adequate seed production to maintain future forest cover?  (2) As temperatures rise and moisture availability declines, is upslope migration of tree populations and the resilience of existing subalpine forests limited by seed production and lack of suitable habitats for seedling germination and survival?  (3) How has the establishment of tree seedlings (over the last 80 years) been influenced by variability in climate?  The student will use extensive field data collected from past disturbances and the natural topoclimatic variation across the ranges of subalpine tree species to mimic change in climatic conditions.  He will quantify the long-term response of key regeneration processes like reproductive maturity, seed availability, and microsite limitations in response to climate variability and to changes in disturbance regimes.  He then will link fine-scale field results to broad-scale spatial datasets to parameterize and implement a cross-scalar spatial model that will evaluate key limitations to seedling recruitment over a range of environmental change projections.",

Compromised forest recovery mechanisms and loss of forest cover would have widespread effects on many ecosystem services, like carbon stocks and wildlife habitat. The goal of this research was to examine long-term patterns in forest dynamics and potential limitations for tree regeneration under a warming climate for two tree species that are widely distributed across western North America, Engelmann spruce (<em>Picea engelmannii)</em> and subalpine fir (<em>Abies lasiocarpa</em>). Forest ecologists examining age and size structure data from spruce and fir forests have hypothesized that differences in species life history traits (as expressed through vital rates) may explain the persistent dominance of fir in the understory and codominance of spruce and fir in the forest canopy in old-growth forests. However, until now, data from long-term monitoring of permanent plots were not available to accurately quantify vital rates to address this hypothesis. We quantified five vital rates (seedling height growth, in-growth of small stems into larger size classes, mortality, net population change, and persistence) from destructively sampled seedlings and permanent forest plots monitored from 1982-2017 in old-growth spruce-fir forest at Niwot Ridge, Colorado. Differences in vital rates between spruce and fir in the seedling bank and main canopy, such as lower mortality rates of spruce than fir, was evidence in support of the hypothesis that species differences in vital rates play a key role in structuring old-growth spruce-fir stand dynamics and coexistence of these species.</p>\n<p>Forest cover may shift under climate warming if spruce and fir regeneration is limited by seed availability, unsuitable climate, or severe disturbances. Using multiple years of field observations of Engelmann spruce and subalpine fir cone abundance (indicator of seed availability), we found that cone abundance is affected primarily by tree characteristics (tree size) and stand structure (stand basal area), rather than crowding from neighboring trees. Using models of the factors predicting cone abundance, our findings revealed mechanisms by which previous disturbances can affect seed production through long-lasting (centuries) influences on tree sizes and stand structural properties. The increasing loss of large, dominant cone producing trees from increasing rates of tree mortality will significantly reduce seed production to support future tree regeneration and maintain forest cover. However, seed availability may be less limiting than expected for species (i.e., spruce) that have the capacity to produce more cones in open canopy forests, such as recently disturbed stands. To help forecast how warming climate conditions will impact seedling establishment (germination and survival), we examined the climate conditions suitable for spruce and fir establishment 1940-2010. We reconstructed germination dates for fir and spruce seedlings by counting tree rings on &gt; 1000 seedlings and relating the calendar year of germination to climate conditions during that year and years before and after. High abundances of spruce and fir established during years with high moisture availability from above-average snowpack and/or cool and wet summers. Spatial overlap of multiple bark beetle outbreaks may compromise the capacity of a forest to return to a forest (i.e. reduced resilience). Using extensive field sampling from spruce-fir forests affected by three biotic disturbances, we demonstrate that most of the affected forest will recover from coincident mortality of spruce and fir from outbreaks of two bark beetle species followed by ungulate herbivory on juvenile trees. The composition of the future forest canopy is, however, uncertain, because the most abundant tree species in the understory are also the most frequently browsed.
