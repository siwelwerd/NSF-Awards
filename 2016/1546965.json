 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Research Infrastructure for Science and Engineering (HBCU-RISE) activity within the Centers of Research Excellence in Science and Technology (CREST) program supports the development of research capability at HBCUs that offer doctoral degrees in science and engineering disciplines. HBCU-RISE projects have a direct connection to the long-term plans of the host department(s) and the institutional mission, and plans for expanding institutional research capacity as well as increasing the production of doctoral students in science and engineering. With support from the National Science Foundation, Alabama A&M University aims to address the energy crisis by developing energy efficient devices and power generators. Alabama A&M University will train at least four graduate and two undergraduate students, and a total six K-12 teachers and twelve secondary school students. This project will increase the number of Ph.D. students at Alabama A&M University by 30%. This project has the potential to contribute significantly to the pool of minority students trained in energy harvesting and nanoscience that is vital to the nation's energy infrastructure.\r\n\r\nThe proposed research involves the design of nanostructures and the fabrication of energy efficient devices for white light sources, thermoelectric power generators, and energy harvesters from ambient sources. The research objectives include: 1) improving infrastructure in Optics and Materials Science research; 2) designing nanostructured glasses with enhanced luminescence properties and demonstrating bright white light emission under low power diode laser excitation; 3) developing nano-structured multilayer and/or single layer Thermoelectric (TE) devices and TE waveguides for high temperatures applications; 4) fabricating and characterizing nanocomposite films; and 5) designing piezoelectric/pyroelectric generator system and fabricating cantilever and stack harvesters to demonstrate proof of concept. This research will enable Alabama A&M University to: (1) design efficient diode pumped white light sources and laser materials, which are free from pollution; (2) design more efficient thermoelectric power generators; and (3) develop clean energy sources. This project will expand the scientific literacy of all citizens on issues related to NSF's mission, scientific achievement, and technological advancements.",
