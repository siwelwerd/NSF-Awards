 "awd_abstract_narration": "Robinson\r\n1312419\r\n\r\n     The investigator and his colleagues use asymptotic methods from stochastic analysis to provide a comprehensive study of large investors in derivatives markets.  The specific goals are first to identify characteristics of both the investor and the market that endogenously lead to large holdings, and second to determine the effects of large positions on pricing, price impact, portfolio optimization, and risk management.  Because large positions induce extreme sensitivity to rare unexpected events, the theory of Large Deviations is well suited for this analysis.  In particular, using Large Deviations in conjunction with utility-based theory on optimal position sizes, the investigator studies when, if ever, a risk-averse agent acting in an incomplete market should take a large position in a non-traded risky asset.  Regarding the issue of pricing and hedging, it is well known that in incomplete markets investor preferences affect the price at which one is willing to buy a claim.  Typically, closed-form expressions for utility based prices are unavailable and some approximation is necessary.  Existing approximations are only valid for small position sizes and thus large holdings approximations provide a natural counterpart.  In addition to determining asymptotic prices, the investigator identifies the key components of the investor's utility that drive such prices.  Lastly, examples show that large positions arise in conjunction with asymptotically complete markets: the investigator thus seeks to extend this notion beyond the current one, which focuses on weak convergence of asset price laws, to a more natural notion in terms of the asymptotic ability to hedge.  Once extended, questions regarding continuity with respect to market completeness are considered.\r\n\r\n     From a rigorous mathematical perspective, the investigator seeks to understand the rapid growth in over-the-counter derivatives markets during the previous two decades.  Given the complexity of many of these products, it is not clear why a bank, or some other financial institution, would wish to take on a large position in a claim, especially given the lack of perfect hedging strategies or liquid markets.  The investigator thus studies when, if ever, a financial institution should own a significant notional amount of a derivative contract.  Additionally, given such a position, the investigator aims to determine the impacts in terms of pricing, hedging, and over-all risk that a financial institution faces.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe goal of the project was to understand large investors in derivatives markets. Specifically, the PI sought to understand why financial institutions take large positions in derivative securities, and what the impacts are in terms of valuation, hedging, and risk.  Mathematically, the PI sought to use asymptotic methods from probability theory, in particular the theory of Large Deviations, to address the above questions.\n\nThe first project identified how investors? attitudes towards risk affect the valuation of derivative contracts, or contingent claims, in the limit of large position sizes. Analysis was performed in the \"incomplete\" setting, where the risk associated to owning the claim cannot be fully removed by hedging in an underlying market. The conclusion was that an investor?s attitude towards large losses is the primary driver of prices.  As such, if two investors have the same aversion towards large losses, then independently of how they feel about large gains, they will assign the same value to the derivative contract, provided their position size is large.  This result shows the investor need only identify her risk aversion to large losses, and then price assuming this risk aversion.\n\nMotivated by the first result, the second project explicitly identified the limiting price for a contingent claim as the position became large for an investor with constant risk aversion.  Here, a correction term, due solely to position size, arises in the joint limit of large positions and vanishing hedging errors associated to the claim.  The correction term shows that even as hedging errors vanish, if positions sizes are large it is not appropriate to price according the unique fair price in the limiting complete market.  Mathematically, the correction term is computed in semi-complete markets, commonly used in the insurance industry, when the hedging errors vanish according to a Large Deviations principle.  Here, Varadhan?s Integral Lemma provides a variational representation for the correction, and in many cases, an explicit formula.\n\nThe first two projects concerned the pricing of claims for large position sizes. However, they did not address the more basic question of why an investor would take a large position, given that she cannot hedge away all the risk.  In the third project, the PI showed that it is possible for risk averse investors, acting optimally, to take large positions in derivative contracts, even when the risk associated to owning the contract cannot be fully hedged.  Qualitatively, an investor would take a large position when hedging errors are small, and when the investor is getting a good deal on the purchase price.  Quantitatively, this corresponds to when markets are asymptotically complete and when the purchase price is not the unique arbitrage free price in the limiting market.  The PI showed this result holds not only in the semi-complete setting mentioned above, but also in the more general semi-martingale setting which encompasses nearly all models used throughout the industry.\n\nIn fact, in the general semi-martingale setting, the PI proved an optimal investment counterpart to the celebrated Gartner-Ellis theorem from Large Deviations theory.  Here, it was shown that existence of a limiting price for the claim, when position sizes become large at a certain rate, is sufficient to show that an investor should take large positions at this same rate, provided she is able to purchase claims for a sufficiently advantageous price.  Furthermore, it is possible for the buyer to find a single seller who is willing to transact at such a price, if the seller already owns a large position in the claim.  This result confirms the empirically observed facts first, that large players in derivative markets tend to become so discretely, in that large positions are taken suddenly, rather than built up over time; and second that prices for large transactions tend to vary significantly from their small-transaction counterparts. Remarkably, these results carry over to markets with frictions such as proportional transactions costs, and appear to be a general feature of asymptotically complete markets.\n\nIn terms of broader impacts, the PI sought to connect large investors with the markets in which they interact.  The goal was to see why investors take large positions, and if there is some size-related effect on valuation which is otherwise not apparent.  This question is of great importance given the size of the derivatives market and its impact on the larger economy.  Furthermore, the PI was able to use the proposal to develop coursework, organize and attend conferences, and advise two graduate students, who completed their PhDs during the proposal period.\n\n \n\n  \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/25/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Scott Robertson"
