 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, developed by Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT), collaborating with the University of Texas at Austin, will explore existing strategies for effective access and inclusion in their courses with mixed groups of hearing and deaf and hard of hearing (DHH) students, and develop new strategies of effective, accessible and inclusive instruction. A significant aspect of this project is the development of an Accessibility ToolKit, a set of inclusive instructional materials, strategies, and discussions. Such tools and strategies will be beneficial to diverse groups of learners, not only for DHH students. This project will serve the national interest of effective and inclusive education of DHH students in STEM fields, leading to successful degree attainment, and an increase in the diversity of STEM graduates.\r\n\r\nThe project goals are: (1) to increase access, engagement and academic success of DHH students taking postsecondary courses at RIT via the creation, implementation, and evaluation of an Accessibility ToolKit for evidence-based educational approaches in STEM disciplines; (2) to create training environments where faculty experiment with and innovate new resources and strategies for accessible and inclusive pedagogy, through collaborative professional development and assessment of evidence-based strategies; and (3) to document and disseminate the ToolKit and processes so that they may be applied to other populations of postsecondary students with disabilities. Results will examine best practices that promote faculty adoption of these instructional strategies to maximize learning for students with other diverse learning needs, and the impact of such adaptations on inclusive teaching and student engagement. This project will broaden the scope and use of accessible and inclusive strategies to increase DHH student engagement and to address communication and learning needs in STEM classrooms.",

The project focused on faculty development of inclusive pedagogy, specifically with co-enrollment of deaf, hard of hearing (DHH) and hearing students at a large university. Via semester-long faculty learning communities (FLCs), the aim was to partner DHH students with faculty and work to identify, develop, and implement a specific strategy to increase inclusion, engagement, and interaction in a post-secondary classroom.</p>\n<p>This faculty development model is built upon establishing relationships between students in faculty-mentors role and faculty learning community participants (Cook-Sather, 2014). These DHH students were not enrolled in the faculty?s courses: They were trained to give observational and formative, but not evaluative feedback about their perceptions of interaction, collaboration, and DHH/hearing inclusion. An observation tool was designed to collect information about any barriers to access or interaction with course information and activities (Cawthon, Schley &amp; Davidson, 2019; Jassal, Cawthon, &amp; Schley, 2020).</p>\n<p>Like any student with a disability enrolled in post-secondary education, DHH students use a disability services office to qualify for classroom accommodations needs (e.g., ASL-English interpreting, speech-to-text captioning, notetaking services). We argue that these accommodations and access services are necessary but not sufficient to provide a fully inclusive classroom experience.</p>\n<p>Each of the five FLCs in our project ran for 15 weeks and met every other week for 2 hours at a time (7 sessions total).&nbsp;There were 21 faculty participants, and 8 DHH student mentor participants (student mentors often served over more than one FLC session). The design of these FLCs scaffolded the processes of <em>exploration</em>, <em>design</em>, and <em>implementation</em> to guide faculty in their conceptual change and development of pedagogical flexibility (see Figure 1 in Schley et al., 2021). The end of the semester included a reporting phase, where participants provided summaries and reflections of their work over the semester. Detailed information including readings, specific learning objectives, assignments, and discussion guides is included in an online supplemental curriculum document available <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tw1BHbU4lbx5c6ttauXH1n8R8--mKC2u/view?usp=sharing\">here</a></span><a href=\"#_ftn1\">[1]</a> (from Schley, Duckles &amp; Blili-Hamelin, 2020).</p>\n<p>Through the course of the semester, faculty and DHH student partners developed strategies across three broad categories of approaches to improving access, collaboration, and interaction: responding to challenges with the physical set up and layout of the classroom, adapting assignment expectations and requirements, and adding a tool or piece of technology to facilitate interaction and collaboration (Marchetti et al. 2019; Schley &amp; Marchetti, 2020; Schley &amp; Marchetti 2021; Atkins et al., 2021).</p>\n<p>Dolmage (2017) offers a metaphor of 'steep steps' that distinguishes ADA accommodations from actual faculty efforts to design and encourage inclusive classroom experiences. Higher education is often viewed as something to attain, and that involves a 'climb' to gain expertise. ADA accommodations guarantee access for those who cannot climb the proverbial steps (physically or metaphorically). Inclusion on the other hand builds the learning space without barriers in the first place and responds with solutions to subvert barriers that appear. This project partnered DHH students with faculty to identify, design and implement strategies to increase classroom inclusion. Importantly, creating inclusive classroom spaces it is not a ?one time? effort, but an ongoing process both before and during educational experiences.</p>\n<p>The process model may be adaptable for other scenarios of diversity. Identify a classroom interaction challenge (with the help of a student observer), brainstorm possible solutions with others who are also experimenting in the same pedagogical playground, and then implement and test the solution. Consider non-native English-speaking students. While the source of the challenge (e.g., conversation flow with a sign language interpreter) may not be the same for students who are second-language learners of English, the strategies to help facilitate conversational interaction (e.g., talking stick; 1:1 questioning during a poster session rather than an all-group presentation) may well facilitate their learning needs. Tobin &amp; Behling (2018) recommend a 'plus one' strategy for faculty looking to add universal design strategies in their college classrooms: Start by making one change to improve inclusion. These FLCs gave faculty a process and support to identify, design, and implement a single strategy in their courses. Going forward, these faculty now have a set of tools in their pedagogical wheelhouse.</p>\n<p>References included in attached image.&nbsp;</p>\n<div>\n<hr size=\"1\" />\n<div>\n<p><a href=\"#_ftnref1\">[1]</a> Hyperlink leads to https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tw1BHbU4lbx5c6ttauXH1n8R8--mKC2u/view?usp=sharing.</p>\n</div>\n</div><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 03/07/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Sara&nbsp;Schley</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1625581/1625581_10456288_1646671781649_Figure1Schleyetal2021--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1625581/1625581_10456288_1646671781649_Figure1Schleyetal2021--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1.
