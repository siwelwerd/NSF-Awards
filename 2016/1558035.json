 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many environmental factors critical for plant growth and reproduction vary in abundance from season to season. A fundamental means by which plant species cope with this challenge is through monitoring day length, the environmental signal that most reliably predicts calendar date. Based on that information, individuals then either continue vegetative growth or initiate flowering. The most favorable time of year for flowering differs by location. For instance, winter arrives earlier at higher latitudes and elevations. Therefore, understanding how and why photoperiodic flowering responses have been adjusted to permit species to thrive across broad geographic ranges is important knowledge that can inform efforts to preserve biodiversity and successfully manage crops in the face of a changing environment. The proposed work will address this goal by studying how populations of the common monkeyflower, Mimulus guttatus, vary along elevation gradients in the critical day length necessary to induce flowering. The molecular changes and ecological impacts of this variation will be investigated with complementary studies in the lab and field. These combined datasets will then permit development of predictive models to test whether populations will be resilient to future climates. The investigators - working with undergraduates at three University of California institutions, the USA National Phenology Network, and volunteers - will also develop a new citizen science initiative to monitor the flowering of important wildflower species in remote alpine locations along the Pacific Crest Trail.\r\n\r\nAlthough much is known about the molecular mechanisms by which photoperiod regulates flowering in controlled conditions, far less is understood about how these pathways function in natural seasonal conditions or what adjustments to these pathways may prove beneficial in future climates. Preliminary work in M. guttatus has shown that replicate altitudinal shifts in critical photoperiod evolved through changes at distinct sets of loci. The proposed research will characterize the genetic basis and physiological consequences of these diverse mechanisms by utilizing the extensive genomic toolkit available in this emerging model plant system. Specifically, the molecular basis of range-wide variation in critical photoperiod will be established. Through transcriptional analyses under controlled conditions and through field trials, the investigators will also test whether the distinct sets of loci that achieve similar shifts in critical photoperiod do so via equivalent modifications of downstream expression within the flowering gene regulatory network or have unique effects that are adaptive within each local environment. The former finding would suggest a broad capacity for physiological systems to adjust to novel conditions, and the latter would suggest genetic variation may prove a significant constraint on the pace of adaptation. Finally, through investigating forms of diversity abundant in annual M. guttatus but not well explored in other model plants, the proposed research will extend ecophysiological models of flowering time and foster more accurate forecasts of the impact of environmental variation on plant growth and population distribution.",

Day length, or photoperiod, often informs these plant developmental responses due to its highly predictable annual cycles. As climate change progresses, the best date to initiate flowering will change because the relative timing of annual cycles in temperature and precipitation shift. Consequently, populations will need to rapidly evolve and adjust their photoperiod responses or face high risk of local extinction. Local elevation gradients approximate this expected dynamic across space. While the photoperiod cycles experienced across sites are the same, growing seasons start earlier in the year as elevation decreases. Our project characterized the genetics of how flowering time and its regulation by photoperiod evolves along elevation gradients in annual populations of the common monkeyflower (<em>Mimulus guttatus)</em>. We investigated how the responsible genetic pathways function in natural seasonal conditions and what types of molecular adjustments may prove beneficial in future climates. While developing datasets and methods to address our focal questions, we described additional traits and genes that confer adaptation to specific pressures imposed by local environments, and also determined how spotted pigment patterns develop on monkeyflower petals.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Project Outcomes</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>By performing genetic mapping of flowering time and its photoperiod response in multiple crosses between high and low elevation individuals, we reached two key findings. First, the set of genes responsible for differences among populations in the day length requirement for flowering is completely different from the set responsible for how long a plant takes to flower when positively cued to flower by photoperiod. This genetic partitioning holds ecological meaning, as it enhances the species? dexterity for adapting to a wide array of environments. Second, the genomic regions important for this variation were nearly all unique to individual crosses. This finding contrasts with many previous studies in other systems that flowering time evolution often proceeds through reuse of the same genes. In following up on a subset of these genomic regions, we find that the evolved changes in photoperiod response are likely caused by changes in the expression of one or many copies of transcription factors that inhibit flowering in other systems.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>We identified additional traits and regions of the monkeyflower genome that vary with environmental gradients. For instance, analysis of whole genome resequencing data from a population transect in Oregon highlights many climate-associated patterns, including in several genes that function in flowering time regulation in other species.

We confirmed that altering this gene?s function causes the phenotype by RNA interference and by CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing.&nbsp; Further work by us and our collaborators determined that this gene and one other act together to yield the spotted pigmentation pattern by a mechanism conforming to one first proposed by Alan Turing.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Broader Impacts</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>By identifying adaptive genetic variation and relating that variation to environmental pressures, our work has highlighted genes likely relevant to conservation efforts.
