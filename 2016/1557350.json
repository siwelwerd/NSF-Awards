 "awd_abstract_narration": "With funding from the National Science Foundation's Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship program, Utah Valley University (UVU), in partnership with two-year institution Snow College, will implement a Phase 2 project to assist high-need school districts in Utah schools with addressing a critical shortage in mathematics and science teachers. During the 5-year period, UVU will award 65 scholarships of $10,000 to approximately 45 talented juniors and seniors majoring in mathematics, biology, or earth science. Recruitment efforts will include high school students in concurrent enrollment programs and members of groups typically underrepresented as mathematics and science educators. Through a strong pre-service training and in-service support program focused on professional engagement, recipients will be well-prepared to teach in high-need school districts and inspire a new generation of students in mathematics and science disciplines.\r\n\r\nThe program will build on UVU's previous successful Noyce Scholarship program to increase the number of 7th-12th grade STEM teachers in Utah by: (1) providing scholarship support to additional cohorts of talented science and mathematics majors; (2) conducting longitudinal evaluation and research activities on previous and new cohorts of scholarship recipients; and (3) expanding outreach efforts to Snow College and to UVU's Community College Division. Program activities will focus around cultivating a community of teachers and scholars, including participation in state and national professional organizations through which novice teachers work with practicing educators to energize their efforts and help them succeed in their early years of teaching and beyond.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nPhase II of the Noyce Professional Engagement for Educators in Mathematics &amp; Science program at Utah Valley University concluded in September of 2022.  The goal of the program was to build on UVU's previous successful Noyce Scholarship program to increase the number of 7th-12th grade STEM teachers in Utah by 1) conducting longitudinal evaluation and research activities on existing cohorts of scholarship recipients; 2) providing scholarship support to new cohorts of talented science and mathematics majors to support a strong pre-service training and in-service support program focused on professional engagement; and 3) expanding the program's outreach efforts to Snow College (a 2-year institution) and UVU's Community College Division.\n\nThe project team played an integral role in recruiting, instructing, and mentoring Noyce Scholars during their pre-service instruction and the initial stages of their careers.  Each team member taught courses focused on evidence-based instruction with a focus on inclusive pedagogy to ensure our teachers could support the diversity of students in high-needs Utah schools.  Relationships built in these classrooms continued when team members supervised students during student teaching by providing feedback, support, and reinforcement of best practices.\n\nThis effort extended beyond UVU as we created partnerships with local school districts and Snow College.  Snow College, a two-year college in central, rural Utah, participated in the program, recruiting, and preparing excellent students to enter UVU's baccalaureate programs in mathematics and science education.  As a result, 14% of scholarship recipients were transfer students from Snow College.  The partnership with Snow created a direct pathway, along with a strong support network, for STEM students from Snow to transfer to UVU, complete their degree, and transition smoothly into their profession.\n\nEnrichment activities for Noyce Scholar program established a community of teachers and scholars, including participation in state, regional, and national teachers' organizations where new teachers developed associations with practicing educators that energized their efforts and helped them succeed in their early years of teaching and beyond.\n\nThis program has seen a dramatic increase in the retention and graduation rate of STEM educators.  Retaining math and science pre-service teachers at UVU has historically been a challenge. This can be seen in institutional data which shows that only one-third of science and mathematics education majors entering their junior year at UVU end up graduating.

Initial longitudinal data shows a turnover of only 13% for our Noyce Scholars (it should be noted that some of the attrition will be temporary as many have left to start a family, but plan on returning to teaching).  The sense of community built within this program provided the necessary structure for students to transition successfully into productive careers. \n\nOverall, this program awarded scholarships to 56 Scholars, producing highly qualified science and mathematics teachers prepared to teach in high-needs school districts.  These teachers are persisting in their careers and quickly integrating into district-level professional learning communities and state professional organizations.\n\n \n\nLegislative Auditor General (2021).
