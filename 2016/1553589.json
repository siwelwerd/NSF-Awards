 "awd_abstract_narration": "There are approximately 80,000 school-age children who are deaf or hard of hearing in our nation's schools and these students typically lag behind their hearing classmates in mathematics achievement.  There is a pressing need to ensure that these students learn mathematics and are able to advance academically with equal access to science and mathematics education. Recent research suggests that early language development affects young children's cognitive representations of numbers and their number vocabulary.  A delay in language exposure, which occurs for more than 90% of children who are deaf or hard of hearing, may negatively impact number development.  It is also unknown whether children who acquire sign language early in life demonstrate delayed mathematical development.  This CAREER scholar will investigate how deaf or hard of hearing children, compared to hearing children, learn numbers.  The research will examine how language experiences affect the development of number representations, symbols and words.  Project activities will also include studies about how parents and children can be trained to impact number learning.  Results of this work are expected to provide information to parents, educators and researchers about how to help deaf or hard of hearing children learn numbers for mathematical development.\r\n\r\nThe Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) program is a National Science Foundation (NSF)-wide activity that offers awards in support of junior faculty who exemplify the role of teacher-scholars through outstanding research, excellent education, and the integration of education and research within the context of the mission of their organizations.  This award is supported by the EHR Core Research (ECR) and Linguistics programs.  ECR emphasizes fundamental STEM education research that generates foundational knowledge in the field.  Linguistics supports basic science in the domain of human language.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this CAREER project is to develop a model of the formation and quality of number systems as related to the timing of language acquisition and language modality, with an emphasis on advancing knowledge about how deaf and hard-of-hearing children learn number representations.  The basic premise is that language is needed before number concepts can be learned.  Research questions include:  (1) Do deaf and hard-of-hearing children who acquire American Sign Language (ASL) from birth follow the same trajectory in acquiring number knowledge as do their hearing peers?  (2)Do deaf and hard-of-hearing children who are exposed to language later in life follow the same trajectory in acquiring number knowledge as do deaf and hard-of-hearing children who acquire ASL from birth?  (3) Do delays in exposure to sign or spoken language affect children's ability to fluidly and automatically manipulate number representations?  (4) Can explicit training with labelling and counting sets increase the number knowledge of young signing deaf and hard-of-hearing children relative to non-number training? (5) Can structured parental interactions with deaf and hard-of-hearing children, in which parents label and count sets increase the number knowledge of deaf and hard-of-hearing children relative to interactions that are not about numbers?  A series of studies will be conducted to address these questions and results will be published, disseminated at professional conferences and shared with teachers via training workshops.",

However, most studies do not take into account that deaf and hearing children have very different experiences learning their first language. Our project, the Study of Language and Math (SLaM), took an approach that allowed us to understand how the kind of language a child learns, and when they begin learning language, affects how they learn to count and do math.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>We asked two main research questions: 1) Does learning a sign language (American Sign Language, ASL) or a spoken language (English) affect how children learn to count and think about numbers? 2) Does a child?s age of learning their first language affect how these skills develop? We studied 280 deaf or hard of hearing children and 124 typically hearing children 3-10 years of age. To answer the first question, we compared two groups of children who both began learning their first language at home, from the time they were born: deaf and hard of hearing children who had a Deaf parent who used ASL, and typically hearing children who were learning English. If these groups perform similarly on our assessments, then we can conclude that both ASL and English support learning to count and think about numbers.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>To answer the second question, we compared children who began learning language at different ages. The children described above made up the Early Language group: deaf or typically hearing children who began learning their home language from birth. The children in the Later Language group were deaf children who began learning language later in development. This group was made up of children who were learning spoken English via assistive technology (e.g., hearing aids, cochlear implants) and children who first began learning ASL in early intervention or in an educational program using ASL. Comparing the Early vs. Later Language groups will help us understand how the timing of children?s access to language affects their number development.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>A team of deaf and hearing researchers carefully developed games that the children enjoyed playing that would give us information about their number knowledge. Deaf signing experimenters carried out the testing with the children who used ASL, and hearing experimenters carried out the testing with the children who used spoken English. We assessed several aspects of children?s number knowledge, including: counting, giving the correct number of objects when asked, estimating and comparing the quantity of items in sets, and understanding Arabic numerals. We also collected information about their language and cognitive skills, such as vocabulary, organizing and regulating behavior, and understanding relationships between objects.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>In one game, the experimenter asked the child to put a certain number of fish into a ?pond? (a bowl). This tests whether the child knows the meaning of the number word or sign, and tells us whether the child understands the cardinal principle. Children who understand the cardinal principle know that the last number word they use when counting a set of objects, for example, ?seven?, tells them something about the set. The cardinal principle is a critical milestone in learning about numbers and is important for future mathematical education and achievement.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>First, we found similar performance between Deaf children who were learning ASL and typically hearing children learning spoken English. Children learning both languages mastered the cardinal principle at the same age. This result shows that ASL, like spoken English, can support counting and learning about numbers. Second, we found that deaf and hearing children who began learning language from birth performed better than those whose language experience began later in development. Many children in the Later Language group performed like the Early Language children; however, overall, the children in the Later Language group performed worse. For example, children in the Later Language group mastered the cardinal principle about 6 months later, on average, than children in the Early Language group.</span></p>\n<p>These findings support theories that say that language is important for building number concepts. They also show that differences we observe between deaf children and hearing children are not due to the children being deaf. These results also show that children need accessible language early in development. To guarantee that they get enough language to support learning about numbers, deaf and hard of hearing children must receive exposure to fully accessible sign language input as early as possible. This sign language exposure can be in addition to hearing technology aimed at improving their access to spoken language.</p>\n<p>In addition to these scientific contributions, this project also broadens participation in science for deaf people. The project trained several deaf people in research techniques, enabling more deaf people to enter science-related fields.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 06/06/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Marie&nbsp;Coppola</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1553589/1553589_10408168_1686083888790_01_Give-Nsimulation--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1553589/1553589_10408168_1686083888790_01_Give-Nsimulation--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"A deaf white boy with short red hair and glasses sits at a table with a middle-aged white woman with short gray hair (the principal investigator).

They also show that differences we observe between deaf children and hearing children are not due to the children being deaf. These results also show that children need accessible language early in development. To guarantee that they get enough language to support learning about numbers, deaf and hard of hearing children must receive exposure to fully accessible sign language input as early as possible. This sign language exposure can be in addition to hearing technology aimed at improving their access to spoken language.\n\nIn addition to these scientific contributions, this project also broadens participation in science for deaf people. The project trained several deaf people in research techniques, enabling more deaf people to enter science-related fields.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/06/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Marie Coppola"
