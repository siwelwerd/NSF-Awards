 "awd_abstract_narration": "Anne McCoy of Ohio State University is supported by an award from the Chemical Theory, Models and Computational Methods program in the Chemistry division to develop theoretical and computational tools needed to understand the spectra of molecules in which the  atoms in the molecules undergo large amplitude motions. The work has a particular focus on protonated and hydrogen bonded systems.   This class of molecules can be found close to home in our atmosphere and also far away in the interstellar medium.  Such molecular systems also provide prototypes to understand the solvation of ions in water.  Experimentalists use   vibrational spectroscopy   to study these molecules.  In the case of astrochemistry,  vibrational spectroscopy provides the best method for studying chemical composition.  Unlike many common molecules, however, the bonding in these systems is weak.  Most of the models that have been developed to predict and interpreted   rotation/vibration spectroscopy do not apply to them.  By developing these new approaches, McCoy and her research group are addressing this deficiency.  The results of these studies will be used to develop connections between spectra and structure and bonding.  McCoy and her research group collaborate with experimental research groups on all of these projects. This research program provides educational and research opportunities for both undergraduates and graduate students.  McCoy is very active in encouraging women and other members of under-represented groups to pursue careers in science. \r\n\r\nOf particular interest is the interaction between rotation and vibration motions.  To this end, the McCoy group is developing several Monte Carlo-based techniques to probe these interactions.  Much of the proposed work involves the Diffusion Monte Carlo approach, with an emphasis on extending the range of properties that can be calculated using this general approach.  In addition,  they employ an approach based on Monte Carlo sampling of potential surfaces to deepen the understanding of the origins of the broadening of spectral features in hydrogen bonded systems.  Specific applications include molecules, specifically H5+ and CH5+ that are of astrochemical interest, as well as several studies that probe the origins of spectral signatures of hydrogen bonding.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe work supported by this grant focused on developing theoretical and computational tools that enable understanding of the relationship between the structure and spectra of molecules and ions that display large amplitude vibrational motions.  Two approaches are generally used in the work.  The first is quantum Monte Carlo and the second involves thee development of models that greatly simply the computations involved.  \n\nIn this work, we developed models to better understand and interpret the relationships between structure (OH bond lengths) and the spectrum of OH bonds involved in hydrogen bonding.  Since hydrogen bonding (particular involving water molecules) is ubiquitous, this correlation enables better structural interpretations from experimental studies of hydrogen bonded systems.   We used these insights to develop more efficient computational approaches for more precise analysis of the quantum mechanical structure and energy of small hydrogen bonded systems (specifically water clusters) based on quantum Monte Carlo approaches. \n\nWe also explored ways to better understand the spectrum of CH5+, a molecule of astrochemical interest.  This molecule is also of considerable interest to the theoretical spectroscopy community because of the highly delocalized nature even at very low temperatures.  As a first step, we used statistical approaches to unravel the delocalized nature of this ion, and how it is affected by deuteration.  With these insights in hand, we explored how this delocalization impacted the measured rotational spectrum, obtained by the Schlemmer group, Science 347 pp 1346-1349.\n\n \n\nIn a third set of studies, we used quantum Monte Carlo approaches to study the structure of protonated water clusters with three or four water molecules.  In the first part of the work, we focused on projections of the ground state probability amplitude to identify the average structure.  With this in place, we moved onto a study of how these insights allowed us to interpret the spectra for these ions obtained by Mark Johnson and his group at Yale.   Such work provides detailed spectroscopic underpinnings for the observed broadening of spectral features in strongly hydrogen-bonded systems.\n\nAdditionally, we used models to understand the spectra of a variety of molecules.  Specifically, in studies of substituted Criegee intermediates (RR?COO), we focused on the relationship between the measured spectrum, and its  ability to isomerize and form OH through thermal excitation.  We used local oscillator models to understand the couplings between OH oscillators in several ion-water complexes.  These include protonated water clusters, where the use of these models allowed us to identify trends in the couplings that are manifested in the spectra of these systems.   We studied the Grotthus mechanism for proton transport in solution but exploring the spectra of H3O+.(H2O)3 with various small molecules hydrogen bonded to one of the water molecules.  We also looked at Cs+ encapsulated in a cluster of twenty water molecules.  This allowed us to explore the various bonding environments experienced in a water monolayer, and how these environments are reported in the spectrum.  Such work provides fundamental understanding that can be translated to deeper understanding of the relationship between structure and spectra in larger molecular assemblies.\n\nThe insights obtained from these studies strengthen our understanding of how to interpret spectral signatures of large amplitude vibrational motions.  Work on these projects involved contributions from one post doc, ten graduate students (five of whom were women, one from Ghana and two first generation students), and three undergraduate students, and the work contributed to the development of a diverse scientific workforce.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/14/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Anne B Mccoy"
