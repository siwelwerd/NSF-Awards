 "awd_abstract_narration": "The science describing the interaction between light and matter has produced a wide variety of technologically important applications that our society has come to rely on (for example, fiber optics that form the backbone of the internet, lasers used in industries ranging from telecommunications to manufacturing, solar cells used for sustainable energy, and many others).  For decades, researchers have been trying to increase the strength of coupling between light and matter by engineering artificial dielectric structures (like silicon or glass) to be in resonance with incoming light.  Nearly all such structures have been patterns that are periodically repeating in space: a kind of microscopic scaffolding.  One of the principal goals of this project is to show that certain non-periodic structures with no repeating units can facilitate stronger light-matter coupling than periodic designs.  This could open a new design principle for light-matter interaction and lead to applications like more efficient lighting, solar cells, or even components for optical quantum computers. \r\n  \r\nThe principal investigators will engineer photonic structures (both waveguide arrays in silica and photonic crystals in silicon) to have Dirac points in their band structure.  These structures will be \"strained\" (either imparting physical strain or by fabricating artificially-strained structures) in such a way that they become aperiodic and experience a \"pseudomagnetic field.\"  This pseudomagnetic field causes the eigenvalue spectrum to become highly degenerate, leading to a large density-of-states, which in turn causes stronger light-matter coupling (Purcell enhancement). This project is a cross-disciplinary endeavor of an engineer, whose contribution is through fabrication and characterization of optical media (Kevin Chen, University of Pittsburgh), a physicist (Mikael Rechtsman, Penn State), who will perform optical experiments and modeling and an applied mathematician (Michael Weinstein, Columbia), who will co-develop mathematical PDE / discrete models and analyze these in collaboration with Rechtsman and Chen.  Each of their expertise will be essential for the project's success.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nWith this award, our team explored how light propagates in structured photonic devices such as waveguide arrays and photonic crystals.  There was a particular emphasis on how, by straining the structure in a particular way, the propagation of light could be described similarly to quantum mechanical electrons under the influence of a magnetic field.\n\nIn a magnetic field, electrons undergo \"cyclotron orbits\" - that is, they rotate in a circle.  In the quantum mechanical (i.e., wavy) description, these orbits lead the electrons to only be able to take on fixed energy levels, called Landau levels.  This is also true for propagating light under the influence of the strain described above.    \n\nOne of the principal results that we put forward over the course of the grant period was to show that two-dimensional silicon photonic crystal structures could exhibit this effect.  We published a manuscript on the topic that is highly rigorous from a mathematical perspective; we found: (1) strain could indeed give rise to these Landau levels in photonic crystals; (2) explicit formulas for the strength of the pseudomagnetic field in terms of the basic parameters of the structure; and (3) that under the influence of the field, \"Landau level dispersion\" naturally arose, which distorts the Landau levels, but that this can be corrected using an additional strain that gives rise to a pseudoelectric field.\n\nThe motivation for studying Landau levels in particular is because the give rise to a relatively high \"density of states\", which dictates how the photonic crystal allows coupling between light and matter.  Stronger coupling means that it can perform useful functions more efficiently, such as generating entangled pairs of photons, generating a wide range of wavelengths, and lasing in a very small area on a chip. \n\nOur work on such structuring also led us to other related discoveries involving the enhancement of the coupling between light and matter, including the realization of a \"Weyl exceptional ring,\" the prediction of a certain new class of \"Bound States in the Continuum\" in photonic crystals, among others.  Each new discovery was published in a peer-reviewed journal.       \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/20/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Mikael Rechtsman"
