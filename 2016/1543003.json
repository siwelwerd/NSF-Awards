 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Weddell seal is the southern-most mammal in the world, having a circumpolar distribution around Antarctica; the McMurdo Sound population in Antarctica is one of the best-studied mammal populations on earth.  However, despite this, an understanding of how populations around the continent will fare under climate change is poorly understood. A complicating matter is the potential effects of a commercial enterprise in the Antarctic: a fishery targeting toothfish, which are important prey for Weddell seals. Although the species is easily detected and counted during the breeding season, no reliable estimates of continent-wide Weddell seal numbers exist, due to the logistic difficulties of surveying vast regions of Antarctica. Large-scale estimates are needed to understand how seal populations are responding to the fishery and climate change, because these drivers of change operate at scales larger than any single population, and may affect seals differently in different regions of the continent. We will take advantage of the ease of detectability of darkly colored seals when they the on ice to develop estimates of abundance from satellite images. This project will generate baseline data on the global distribution and abundance of Weddell seals around the Antarctic and will link environmental variables to population changes to better understand how the species will fare as their sea ice habitat continues to change. These results will help disentangle the effects of climate change and fishery operations, results that are necessary for appropriate international policy regarding fishery catch limits, impacts on the environment, and the value of marine protected areas. The project will also further the NSF goals of training new generations of scientists and of making scientific discoveries available to the general public. It will engage \"arm-chair\" scientists of all ages through connections with several non-governmental organizations and the general public. Anyone with access to the internet, including people who are physically unable to participate in field research directly, can participate in this project while simultaneously learning about multiple aspects of polar ecology through the project's interactive website.  \r\n\r\nSpecifically, this research project will: 1) Quantify the distribution of Weddell seals around Antarctica and 2) Determine the impact of environmental variables (such as fast ice extent, ocean productivity, bathymetry) on habitat suitability and occupancy. To do this, the project will crowd-source counting of seals on high-resolution satellite images via a commercial citizen science platform. Variation in seal around the continent will then be related to habitat variables through generalized linear models. Specific variables, such as fast ice extent will be tested to determine their influence on population variability through both space and time. The project includes a rigorous plan for ensuring quality control in the dataset including ground truth data from other, localized projects concurrently funded by the National Science Foundation's Antarctic Science Program.",

The Weddell seal can be a harbinger of change. Changes to their marine environment, their haul-out locations or their food supply will reflect changes to their distribution or population numbers. These environmental changes can result from either climate change or an unsustainable fishery. The importance of the Weddell seal to Antarctic ecology is reflected in the fact that it is one of the key species actively monitored within the newly designated Ross Sea Region Marine Protected Area. But tracking the Weddell seal even at regional scales, let alone continental scales, has thus far been impossible to achieve, or prohibitively expensive, at least by traditional means (i.e., by ship or aircraft).</p>\n<p>Here, we combined citizen science with remote sensing to learn about the environmental and biological factors that explain the fine-scale distribution of Weddell seal haul-outs. The citizen scientists who participated in our project not only learned about an iconic Antarctic species and its environment, but also were active contributors to the science. Without the participation of hundreds of thousands of citizen scientists, such a circumpolar survey of the Weddell Seal would not have been possible, or would have required far more resources and years to conduct.</p>\n<p>Our circumpolar survey of Weddell seals was conducted using very high-resolution satellite imagery (0.3-0.6 m resolution) and the web-based platform Tomnod, which hosted the imagery and gave citizen scientists tools to search and identify Weddell seals on hundreds of satellite images (Figure 2). The Weddell seal is relatively easy to detect, given that the seal is large (3-4 m long, 1 m wide), dark in color, and hauls out onto a very white background every November for pupping (the background being Antarctic coastal fast ice, sea ice fixed to the coastline) (Figure 1a). More than 325,000 citizen scientists searched 790 satellite images (consisting of more than 1 million searchable maps) that covered 268,611 square kilometers of coastal fast ice, to search, identify and locate Weddell seals.</p>\n<p>Once the data was collected, a first step in our analysis was to describe the environmental factors that explain seal presence across the entire Ross Sea by testing 15 different hypotheses (LaRue et al., 2019). Across the Ross Sea, we found that the primary environmental factors determining seal presence included haul-out locations near cracks in the ice (Figure 3), deep water, and proximity to emperor penguin colonies (another Antarctic species requiring stable fast ice during breeding and chick rearing). However, we also found seals apparently avoided Adelie penguin colonies entirely, while tolerating emperor penguins but only to a certain population size.</p>\n<p>Similar hypotheses were applied to the Antarctic-wide circumpolar survey. Interestingly, the circumpolar distribution of Weddell seals was detected on only 0.4% of all maps searched (430 of 1,074,444 maps searched) (Figure 4). The overall accuracy in detecting seals was 98%. The rate of false negative detections was low (1.7%), though false positives were high (67%), highlighting the importance of training our citizen scientists to distinguish seals from similar-looking dark features (e.g., rocks, dark cracks, shadows) (Figure 5). We found in general that seals are present on only approximately 0.55% of available fast ice area around Antarctica (LaRue et al, 2020). Our final analysis will report on the circumpolar population dynamics of Weddell seals, including an assessment of habitat and environmental factors that explain their circumpolar distribution (i.e., an extension of the Ross Sea analysis mentioned above) (LaRue et al, in prep).</p>\n<p>An overall important outcome of our study was the development of statistical methods for transforming counts of seals determine by citizen scientists to reliable estimates of seal abundance (Salas et al, under review).
