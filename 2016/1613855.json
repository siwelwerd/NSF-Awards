The EoR is one of the last unexplored phases in the history of the universe. Broader impacts of the work include training of women and underrepresented minority students through a program called Research Experiences for Non-Traditional Undergraduates (RENTU). \r\n\r\nThe award will provide support for the US-based imaging power spectrum analysis team, which has been at the forefront of analyzing data from the Mileura Widefield Array telescope in Australia, and will provide one of the cornerstone analysis pipelines for the new Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA), an NSF-supported radio telescope in South Africa.",
