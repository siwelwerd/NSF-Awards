 "awd_abstract_narration": "The first direct detection of gravitational waves by Advanced LIGO in September 2015 has officially launched the era of gravitational-wave astronomy, bringing a plethora of new astrophysics to our doorstep.  This grant supports the work of members of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration at Kenyon College.  Kenyon LIGO group members have lead roles in the calibration of the Advanced LIGO (aLIGO) interferometers and the search for gravitational wave signals from large black holes.  The calibration of the aLIGO detectors is the first fundamental step after data has been collected by the detector.  Only after the data is calibrated can searches for gravitational wave signals begin.  LIGO scientists search for a range of sources, but the most promising source is the coalescence of two compact, astrophysical objects, such as black holes and neutron stars.  Historically, LIGO has performed careful searches for black hole systems with masses that range up to 100 times the mass of the Sun.  Members of the Kenyon LIGO group are part of the effort to expand this search to black holes of even higher masses.  These large black holes may hold key answers as to how the supermassive black holes at the centers of galaxies were formed.   Additionally, the Kenyon LIGO group is exploring and improving aLIGO's ability to extract information about the matter that composes neutron stars in preparation for the first gravitational wave detection from a coalescing neutron star system.  While electromagnetic signals from binary neutron star systems can provide insight into the surface of neutron stars, the detection of gravitational waves from a binary neutron star system could dig deeper and reveal secrets of the illusive neutron star matter itself.  Finally, this project also supports the expansion of an existing NSF-funded outreach program at Kenyon College that targets engaging middle-school-aged audiences with exciting, hands-on science workshops.  Separate workshops are held for middle school boys (LADS: Learning and Doing Science) and middle school girls (GSS: Girls Science Saturdays) several Saturdays throughout the school year. \r\n\r\nThis award supports three main efforts in the field of gravitational-wave physics.  The first is related to ongoing work in the calibration of the aLIGO detectors.  Specifically, Kenyon LIGO group members will not only maintain existing low-latency calibration software, which is a large task as the calibration procedure is constantly changing with upgrades to the interferometers, but they will also work towards reducing the latency of the current calibration software from around a few tens of seconds down to a few seconds.  The lowest possible latency calibration is crucial for electromagnetic follow-up of gravitational wave signal candidates.  The main methods that will be employed to reduce the latency of the calibration software are to reduce the complexity of the procedure, shift as much of the calibration procedure as possible into the real-time instrument computers, and improve the computational efficiency of all existing calibration software.  The award also supports the development and execution of a modeled, matched-filter search for intermediate mass black hole binary (IMBHB) systems.  The goal of the search is to make the first confident detection of black holes in the intermediate mass range or to provide upper limits on the existence of IMBHB systems.  Existing search software is being optimized to fit the needs of a higher mass, and therefore shorter waveform, matched filter search, and the search is being developed to run in a low-latency mode during future observing runs.  Finally, this grant supports the development of tools to extract information about the neutron star equation of state from a binary neutron star gravitational wave detection.  Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) gravitational wave parameter estimation software is being modified to more optimally explore the neutron star equation of state parameter space, and software to allow for the use of different models of the neutron star equation of state is being developed. The first few gravitational wave detections from binary neutron star systems will be able to provide a wealth of new knowledge about neutron star matter.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n \nThis project supported the Kenyon College LIGO Scientific Collaboration (LSC) group and a set of \"Saturday Science\" middle school boys and girls outreach programs.  The LSC is a collaboration of more than 1,000 scientists in pursuit of uncovering mysteries of the universe through the detection of gravitational waves, which are ripples in the curvature of spacetime predicted by Einstein?s theory of General Relativity.  The detection of gravitational waves from dramatic astrophysical events, such as the collision of neutron stars and black holes, can reveal exciting new information about their source.  To date, the LIGO and Virgo Scientific Collaborations (LVC) have published on 15 compact binary mergers detected through their distinctive gravitational-wave signatures. These detections have revealed a new class of stellar-mass black holes. Nobody knew that such heavy black holes even existed, let alone existed in these numbers. At least one of these detected systems and at most three likely contained neutron stars, which flaunt the most extreme matter known to mankind.  Additionally, the most recent compact merger published by the LVC likely contained an intermediate mass black hole component, which is a sought-after class of black holes.\nThis award funded research in four main areas of LIGO gravitational-wave science: 1) calibration of the LIGO detectors, 2) searches for gravitational waves from intermediate mass black hole binary systems, 3) development of methods for extracting the neutron star equation of state from gravitational wave detections, and 4) use of machine learning algorithms to improve LIGO data quality predictions.  \nThis award funded important components of the calibration of the LIGO detectors, resulting in calibrated strain data used to make some of the most monumental discoveries in the field of gravitational-wave physics to-date.  This award funded the development of a robust low-latency calibration pipeline and a reliable method for recalibrating the LIGO data for improved accuracy.  \nAdditionally, this award supported the search for gravitational waves from intermediate mass black hole binary systems in LIGO?s first and second observing run data.  The development work funded through this award contributed to the tools used to eventually detect the first-ever intermediate mass black hole binary system in LIGO?s third observing run.  \nThis award funded the development of new methods for extracting the neutron star equation of state, which fundamentally describes the behavior of neutron star matter, from LIGO detections of binary neutron star systems.  Throughout the period of this award, the first detection of gravitational waves from a binary neutron star system (GW170817) was made by the LIGO and Virgo detectors.  The Kenyon College LSC group was an integral part of turning this detection into the first ever statement about the neutron star equation of state from a gravitational-wave signal.  Subsequent signals have been found and continue using the method of inference developed by the Kenyon College LSC group.\nFinally, this award funded undergraduate students to explore modern machine learning technologies with an eye towards improving low-latency data quality infrastructure in LIGO.  This project allowed students to develop artificial neural networks while investigating fundamental questions, such as what set of information is most critical for making LIGO data quality statements.  Students who worked on this project developed easily-transferable skills to industry, engineering, technology, and even national defense.\nThe middle school \"Saturday Science\" outreach programs, Boys Learning About Science Together (BLAST) and Aiming To Heighten her Experiences Near and Around Science (ATHENAS), involved middle school students from the community surrounding Kenyon College in a positive science experience.  These programs include a set of six, unique sessions packed-full of hands-on science experiences.  Since programs are offered twice per year, participants can attend every offering during their three years in middle school and never see the same program twice.  On average, the programs served about 50 participants per session and recruited 15-20 Kenyon College STEM majors to serve as staff members for the program sessions.  These programs were regularly elevated by Kenyon College STEM majors as a highlight of their Kenyon careers.  Participants often came back for multiple sessions, and many participants ended up completing all six sessions throughout their middle school years.\nAdditionally, this project launched an \"ambassador\" program where high school students who had aged-out of the ATHENAS and BLAST programs were invited to rejoin the program as staff.  The ambassadors program was immensely successful.  Once the ambassadors program was fully launched, we had 4-5 ambassadors participating in each program session.  We received extremely positive feedback from the ambassadors, including comments that these programs inspired ambassadors to continue with STEM and pursue a STEM major in college.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/27/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Madeline Wade"
