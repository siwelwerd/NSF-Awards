 "awd_abstract_narration": "This REU Site award to Kettering University, located in Flint, MI, will support the training of ten (10) students for eight (8) weeks during the summers of 2017-2019. The REU Site focuses on the use of plants and plant products in innovative scientific and engineering research, and faculty from the biological, chemical, and physical sciences as well as math and engineering will be involved in mentoring and conducting directed research with participants. In addition to undertaking research during the eight-week program, students will participate in seminars and journal clubs, including training in ethics and responsible conduct of research and field trips to other research institutions. Participants for the REU site will be widely solicited, to include students enrolled in schools on the quarter-system and those who are from groups traditionally underrepresented in science and engineering. A committee of faculty members from Kettering University will select REU participants based on academic performance, interest in research, and phone interviews. \r\n\r\nIt is anticipated that a total of 30 students, primarily from schools with limited research opportunities will be trained in the program. The interdisciplinary approaches employed in the REU research projects to tackle real-world issues will help to foster the students' ability to collaborate with people from across STEM fields, allowing participants to better engage with and solve 21st century problems. Students will learn how research is conducted, and many will present the results of their work at scientific conferences.\r\n\r\nA common web-based assessment tool used by all REU programs funded by the Division of Biological Infrastructure (Directorate for Biological Sciences) will be used to determine the effectiveness of the training program. Students will be tracked after the program in order to determine student career paths. Students will be asked to respond to an automatic email sent via the NSF reporting system. More information about the program is available by visiting http://TBD, or by contacting the PI (Dr. Lihua Wang at lwang@kettering.edu) or the co-PI (Dr. James Cohen at jcohen@kettering.edu).",

Twenty two (73%) of the participants were female and eleven participants (37%) were African American, Hispanic, or Native American students.   In addition, we focused on providing these research opportunities mostly to students who studied at schools that have limited research facilities; twenty two (73%) of the participants were from such schools.  Finally, we also made an effort to recruit community college students; a total of four (13%) community college students and two (7%) non-traditional students participated in the program.\n\nThe participants of the program engaged in both inter and multi-disciplinary research with eleven to sixteen faculty members from seven to ten research teams across the University each year. Each participant was mentored by at least two faculty members from two different disciplines.  The research areas chosen focus on the applications of plants in science and engineering, but also cover a wide variety of topics and disciplines spanning biology, chemistry, chemical engineering, physics, computer science, and mathematics.  These research projects address some of the most important challenges facing society today including the use of green energy to reduce fossil fuel consumption; the exploration of natural compounds for medicinal uses; the applications of natural composite materials to reduce waste; and the use of native plants for phytoremediation, etc.\n\nIn addition to research experience, participants were also provided opportunities to participate in professional development workshops and seminars.  The topics covered by these workshops and seminars include: chemical and biological laboratory techniques, searching and reading scientific literature, ethics in science, as well as scientific communication and presentation skills, etc.  Each student was required to present and lead the discussion of a scientific paper during weekly journal clubs in addition to presenting a final poster presentation at the end of program research symposium.  Finally, there were two field trips each year for the participants to visit research facilities in the University of Michigan and Michigan State University and interact with the scientists and graduate students working there.   \nThe program has enhanced participants? ability to engage in scientific, research-oriented thinking and work habits.  Subsequent to participating in the UPIR REU program, four participants went on to become co-authors for four peer-reviewed journal publications and seventeen participants became co-authors or have presented their research at national and regional conferences.\n\nIn addition, Kettering?s UPIR REU program has significantly enhanced participants? interest in pursuing careers in research in science, engineering, and mathematics.
