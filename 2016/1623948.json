These impacts are projected to become more significant in the future due to ongoing urbanization, population densification, and global climate change. The aim of this research is to answer the question, what are the most effective urban heat mitigation strategies for the populations that are most vulnerable to extreme heat? The analysis will focus on neighborhoods in Los Angeles, CA that contain populations that are especially physically and financially vulnerable to increasing extreme heat: (1) the elderly, (2) those without air conditioning, and (3) those of low socioeconomic status that cannot afford increased energy costs. \r\n\r\nThe research will develop a multi-scale coupled modeling framework that resolves regional-scale meteorology, micro-scale meteorology, and building energy flows. Neighborhoods in Los Angeles with vulnerable populations will be identified using parcel-level GIS datasets of population age, income, and access to air-conditioning. The heat mitigation strategies that will be assessed include solar reflective rooftops and pavements, and increased use of street-level and rooftop urban vegetation. These mitigation strategies will be assessed for impacts on (a) outdoor and indoor air temperatures, (b) human thermal comfort, heat stress, and heat-related mortality, (c) indoor thermal conditions for representative buildings without air conditioning, and (d) air-conditioning energy use for representative buildings with air conditioning. Model performance for each element of the model will be thoroughly evaluated by comparing to observations. The multi-scale model and methods for targeting vulnerable populations will be applicable to other cities worldwide in future work. Results from the project will provide targeted solutions to help vulnerable populations deal with extreme heat. Solutions will be communicated to local policy makers, utilities, and other stakeholders, all of whom the PIs have already-established relationships, to provide pathways for implementation. Discoveries will also be communicated to middle and high school students in areas with vulnerable populations through outreach programs at University of Southern California (USC). The PI will work with teachers through USC's Research Experience for Teachers program, with the goal of designing curriculum and research focused lessons that teach students about the fundamental physics describing extreme heat mitigation. Additionally, the PI will teach a demonstration focused lesson in participating teacher's classrooms to excite future young scientists and engineers to follow careers in STEM. A simple website will be created summarizing research outcomes and providing practical solutions for mitigating extreme heat.",

Next, using a computational approach including building, neighborhood, and regional models, we investigated the impacts of adopting heat mitigation strategies in these neighborhoods on outdoor temperatures, pedestrian thermal comfort, indoor temperatures and occupant thermal comfort (for unconditioned homes), and air conditioning energy use. We found that adding street trees and cool pavements led to the largest reductions in near-surface air temperatures. In addition, street trees led to the largest improvements in pedestrian thermal comfort due to added shade. The impacts of cool pavements on pedestrian thermal comfort were more complex. During the day, thermal comfort was worsened in some situations due to increases in sunlight that was reflected by the pavement and then absorbed by pedestrians. However, at nighttime, pedestrian thermal comfort was improved by cool pavements due to residual temperature decreases. Measurements conducted in three Los Angeles neighborhoods found the first observational evidence (to our knowledge) that solar reflective cool roof adoption is associated with neighborhood scale near-surface air temperature reductions.

We found that cool roofs, cool walls, and cool pavements can reduce temperatures in cities, and as such are an important contributor for mitigating urban heat islands and partially reversing the local effects of global climate change. In addition, we found that adopting solar reflective materials can have other environmental co-benefits such as reducing concentrations of some air pollutants (e.g., ground-level ozone). We also found that adopting cool roofs around the world can reduce urban temperatures, but counter to some previous research, we suggest they would have negligible impacts on global climate. Lastly, solutions to other environmental challenges (e.g., water stress) can have consequences on urban climate. For example, we found that adopting drought-tolerant vegetation (in place of lawns) for reducing water use can lead to daytime near-surface air temperature increases and nighttime temperature decreases. Daytime temperature increases were driven by reductions in evapotranspiration caused by reduced irrigation and consequent reductions in soil moisture. On the other hand, nighttime temperature decreases occurred due to reductions in soil moisture causing changes in the thermal properties of soils and subsequent increases in upward ground heat flux.</p>\n<p class=\"Default\">Outcomes from this research were communicated to policy makers around Los Angeles through the Committee on Urban Cooling and Heat Impacts.
