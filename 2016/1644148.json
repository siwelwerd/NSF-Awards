 "awd_abstract_narration": "The \"Strategic Undergraduate STEM Talent Acceleration Initiative\" (SUSTAIN) project at Syracuse University will address the challenges of recruiting and retaining high-achieving, low-income students from diverse backgrounds into undergraduate STEM programs.   The SUSTAIN program will award thirty $10,000 scholarships for up to two years, and will provide a coherent system of academic, social, and career support services strategically designed to enhance the success of biology and chemistry students during their first and second years of undergraduate study.  Program goals include retaining at least 90% of the initial cohort of 30 scholars as intended or declared STEM majors following their freshman year, and to retain at least 80% of these students as declared STEM majors following their second year of participation in the SUSTAIN program.  The program will establish a STEM faculty professional development workshop designed to foster the implementation of cutting-edge instructional practices that support dynamic, active learning approaches in introductory STEM courses. \r\n\r\nScholars will be provided 360 degree wrap-around support programming that is responsive to their evolving academic, social, and career development needs as they move through the freshman and sophomore years.  Research efforts will investigate the socialization experiences of scholars throughout the program to examine the efficacy of the multi-faceted series of intervention supports to assess their impact on the future STEM trajectories of students.  Findings from this project will promote the identification of promising approaches, identify areas for program refinement, and result in the development of a sustainable model for providing wraparound academic and social support services to STEM majors that can be replicated on other campuses.",

The project provided participants with a robust, multi-faceted series of curricular and co-curricular learning experiences and professional services that are designed to: foster their sense of preparedness for collegiate STEM work; enhance their access and motivation to continue STEM pathways; and provide the academic and social supports necessary to ensure their persistence in the STEM pipeline throughout the challenging first and second years of undergraduate study. The project featured the following key programming elements; 1) STEM faculty mentoring and an early-immersion research program, 2) community-building activities, 3) STEM career awareness activities, 4) Peer-Led Team Learning, 5) professional living-learning community experience, and 6) nature of science and inquiry themed first-year forum course.</p>\n<p>SUSTAIN selected a cohort of twenty-eight entering first-year undergraduate students and provided them with $10,000 of financial support annually for their first two years of academic study. 20 of the Scholars were female, 24 Scholars were first-generation college students, and they were racially/ethnically diverse (14% Asian, 11% Black/African American, 7% Hispanic, 18% multiracial, 50% White).</p>\n<p>Out of 28 Scholars, three Scholars graduated in three years, 21 Scholars graduated at the end of their senior year, two Scholars took leave of absence, and two Scholars transferred to another university but still graduated within four years with degrees in a STEM major.
