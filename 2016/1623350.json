The project at Lincoln University seeks to build on previous successful efforts to increase participation of African-American students in STEM disciplines. The project aims at improving retention, persistence and graduation rates of STEM students through an evidence-based set of activities and strategies. Colleges and universities facing similar retention problems as Lincoln University can benefit by adopting best practices from the project.\r\n\r\nSpecific activities and strategies to achieve the goals are: curriculum and pedagogy reform for gate-keeping mathematics and science  courses; establishment of an integrated freshman science course; undergraduate research for about half of all STEM majors; increased enrollment of community college students into STEM majors; increased  outreach activities to high schools in the Philadelphia; and establishment of  a Science Village for STEM freshmen students that will include joint housing, study halls and academic support. The project strategies supporting these objectives are evidence-based and will be monitored and evaluated for effectiveness through formative and summative evaluation as well as a research study.",

Transformation (LEAPS-T) was initiated in 2016 through a grant from the National Science Foundation (NSF) Historically Black Colleges/Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) to increase the recruitment, retention and graduation rates of STEM majors at Lincoln University, and to increase the number of STEM graduates from Lincoln University who are prepared for STEM careers and post-graduate experience.</p>\n<p>In order to accomplish the objectives of the program, undergraduate teaching assistants were recruited and trained to assist faculty in helping students enrolled in gate-keeping STEM courses to master key concepts thereby increasing retention and persistence in STEM. STEM faculty were also awarded mini-grants to enable them mentor STEM students in research during the regular school year and also during the summer. Internship fairs were organized each year to promote internship opportunities in research-intensive universities, and science fairs were organized each year to showcase research accomplishments of the students. Financial support was provided to students to enable them to participate in preparatory courses for admission to graduate and professional schools. Weekend outreach activities to introduce high school students to campus life and research were carried out in partnership with Young Men and Women In Charge (YMWIC).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We report that a total of 113 Undergraduate Teaching Assistants (UTAs) were recruited and trained during the period of the grant to assist in 100 gate-keeping STEM courses. They conducted a total of 4917 sessions for 1204 students. Thirty one faculty mentored 164 undergraduate student researchers during the regular school year. Twenty student researchers were mentored during the summer months. Our internship fairs attracted a total of 334 students in four years, an average of 83.5 per year. There were 136 posters presented at Lincoln University?s annual science fairs in three years, an average of 34 posters per year. Fifty four students were sponsored for MCAT, GRE, PCAT and DAT Kaplan preparation courses. An average of 18 students from YMWIC attended outreach activities each weekend.</p>\n<p>Our results show that the use of UTAs helped to increase the number of STEM graduates; there were 182 STEM graduates between 2012 and 2016; however, from 2017 to 2020, we graduated 206, an increase of 13.2%. The quality of STEM graduates as measured by the percentage of STEM graduates who earned high honors at graduation also improved. STEM graduates averaged 17.9% of the graduating class from 2017 to 2020; however, they accounted for 37.8% of the <em>summa cum laude</em> and 23.4% of the <em>magna cum laude. </em>There was also a net gain in the percentage of students who earned grades above C in gate keeping STEM courses; 78.2% in biology; 73.6% in chemistry; 84.9% in computer science; 64.8% in mathematics; and 92.3% in Physics.</p>\n<p>Faculty mentored undergraduate research resulted in 26 of 136 (19.1%) posters at the science fairs, and thirteen published papers.
