 "awd_abstract_narration": "Measurements of ground deformation due to the motion of the Earth's tectonic plates are important for scientific research aimed at understanding volcanoes and earthquakes.  Tiltmeters are instruments that measure changes in the tilt or slope of the ground that can occur for example, when a volcano inflates prior to an eruption or when the stresses that cause earthquakes lift up one part of the earth relative to another.  A challenge with designing tiltmeters is that the measurements tend to drift with time due to instability in the sensors \u00a1V this limits their ability to measure tilt signals that are changing slowly.  This project will develop a new type of tiltmeter that will correct for instrument drift by calibrating the sensor against the Earth's gravitational force, which can be considered constant at any point on the Earth.  The tiltmeter will be deployed on a real-time cabled seafloor observatory at Axial Seamount, an active volcano in the Northeast Pacific Ocean.  This is a site of significant scientific interest; the volcano has erupted three times in 20 years.  It is also a site where tilt is being measured by other methods which allows validation of the new instrument.  The data collected by this instrument will be made available to the public and other scientists.  In the future, the tiltmeter may contribute to studies that seek to understand the geological processes that lead to great subduction zone earthquakes or that cause hazardous volcanic eruptions.  The project will train a graduate student and provide field opportunities for undergraduates to help deploy the instrument at sea.\r\n\r\nGeodetic measurements of seafloor deformation are essential to understand geodynamic processes at oceanic plate boundaries but are quite challenging.  The project will employ a novel approach to creating a short-baseline tiltmeter.  The tiltmeter is based on a high-resolution three-component quartz crystal accelerometer.  If the accelerometer is deployed on a stable platform that is coupled to the seafloor, changes in tilt of the horizontal channels of the accelerometer will lead to changes in the measured accelerations with time but so will the drift of the sensors.  The approach to correcting the horizontal channels for sensor drift is to conduct a periodic calibration by rotating (or \"flipping\") each horizontal channel into the vertical for a short interval to measure the acceleration of gravity, g.  Since g is to a high degree of accuracy invariant at any location, changes in the measurement of g between successive rotations can be attributed to sensor drift.  This measurement of drift can then be used to correct each horizontal accelerometer channel to obtain a time series of true tilt changes between calibrations.  The resulting tiltmeter will have unique characteristics \u00a1V a high-dynamic range (it cannot go off scale), high precision (~ a few nrads) and good long-term stability after calibration (<10 micro rads).  At least a year of data will be collected at the Ocean Observatories Initiative cabled observatory on Axial Seamount.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project developed a new instrument, the Self Calibrating Triaxial Accelerometer (SCTA) to make measurements of very small changes in the tilt (or slope) of the ground that occur when the Earth is deformed by geological processes such as faulting or the movement of magma into a volcano.  The SCTA is based on a three-component quartz crystal accelerometer that measures the acceleration (or force) of gravity in three perpendicular directions.  When one component is vertical and the other two horizontal, the vertical component will measure all the acceleration of gravity and the two horizontal components will measure no acceleration.  If the instrument steadily tilts with time, the horizontal channels will measure a small acceleration that will grow slowly with time.  However, the output of an accelerometer channel also slowly changes with time due to natural aging of the quartz crystal, a process termed sensor drift.  It is not possible to distinguish small changes in the tilt of the Earth from sensor drift unless the sensor drift can be measured.  In the SCTA the sensor drift is measured by periodically rotating the horizontal channels into the vertical for a short time where they measure the acceleration of gravity.  Since the acceleration of gravity does not change with time, the difference between successive calibrations, a month or so apart, is a measure of the sensor drift.  The calibrations allow us to separate signals from tilting of the Earth from sensor drift.\n\nWe built a seafloor version of the SCTA which makes automatics calibrations by rotating the accelerometer on two gimbals and connected it to a cabled observatory on Axial Seamount, a volcano 300 miles off the coast of Oregon.  We collected data for 3 years and performed &gt;100 calibrations.  We also tested a prototype SCTA at Pinon Flat Observatory, a stable site in Southern California.  The data is quite complicated to analyze but we were able to show that the calibrations can remove drift to a precision of one millionth of the acceleration of gravity.  When deployed in a stable borehole, the SCTA may be able to measure changes in slope of the ground that result for lifting a point one inch per year, relative to a site 20 miles away.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/28/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: William S Wilcock"
