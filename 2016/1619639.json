 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Missouri Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (MoLSAMP) includes two HBCUs, three major research institutions, a regional comprehensive university, a highly selective liberal arts university and an urban community college. The MoLSAMP Alliance will deploy a variety of activities and establish a logical cohesiveness among the individual campuses to promote recruitment, retention and graduation of underrepresented minority students with a goal to increase the number of underrepresented minorities (URM) majoring in and graduation with degrees in STEM disciplines by 125% in five years. The activities undertaken by MoLSAMP to achieve this ambitious objective will be designed to address both the cognitive and non-cognitive factors that influence success in undergraduate education. Featured activities include expansion of access to research and internships that provide experience in real world applied science, comprehensive academic advising and mentoring by dedicated faculty and administration, summer bridge programs for first and second year students and career development conferences and research symposiums designed to bring students and faculty together for informative and inspirational social gatherings. To facilitate a boundary-lite synergistic effort, articulation and reverse articulation agreements will be established to increase fluidity of academic credits between alliance institutions. A comprehensive and frequently updated MoLSAMP website will provide detailed information regarding MoLSAMP activities and related resources and serve as a conduit for student and faculty communication within and between alliance campuses. MoLSAMP supported activities will be continually evaluated to identify best practices and results will be disseminated though a variety of channels to facilitate efforts to increase URM participation and success in STEM nationwide.\r\n\r\nThe MoLSAMP Alliance currently yields 64% of the total STEM baccalaureate degrees conferred to URMs in the State of Missouri. A primary goal of MoLSAMP is to increase the recruitment, retention and successful STEM degree completion of URMs by at least 125% by the year 2021. This goal will help to address the underrepresentation of minority groups in STEM education and the workforce, and with the success of MoLSAMP supported activities, inform the broader efforts of colleges and universities nationwide to diversify the STEM student population and ultimately strengthen our nation's science based workforce. Minority students face a variety of challenges that contribute to their underrepresentation in STEM degree programs. These challenges include insufficient preparation for college level STEM coursework, financial hardship and failure to socially and culturally integrate during the first year of college. MoLSAMP scholars will receive a variety of support mechanisms to mitigate these factors, including intrusive academic advising, ample opportunity to explore applied science through research and internship opportunities, social, academic and career networking opportunities through MoLSAMP organized social gatherings, social media platforms, mentoring programs, and summer bridge programs. MoLSAMP activities will also include measures to increase successful transfer of students from St. Louis Community College to four year degree Alliance institutions, and a 25% increase in URM students entering graduate programs. Successfully and substantially increasing the number of URM students completing degrees, entering graduate programs, working in research laboratories and importantly, teaching and mentoring the next generation of URM STEM students, should provide a scaffold for a sustainable increase in diversity in STEM education and industry.",

  "por_cntn": "<div class=\"porColContainerWBG\">\n<div class=\"porContentCol\"><p>The Missouri Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (MOLSAP) launched in Fall 2015 under a five-year $5 million grant awarded to Harris-Stowe State University (HSSU) from the National Science Foundation (NSF) to support retention, persistence to a STEM degree, and graduate school and career preparation for underrepresented minority students (URM) enrolled in STEM majors. Serving as the lead institution, HSSU, an Historically Black College and University (HBCU) located in the city of St. Louis, Missouri led the execution of MOLSAMP across nine colleges and universities in the state including Lincoln University, Missouri State University, Truman State University, University of Central Missouri, University of Missouri &ndash; Columbia, University of Missouri - St. Louis, Washington University in St. Louis, and St. Louis Community College.</p>\n<p>Executing MOLSAMP activities on the campuses of the nine-member Alliance and through collaborating across institutions, MOLSAMP led a synergistic effort to accomplish a list of ambitious objectives aimed to:</p>\n<p>1. Increase the total number of URM graduating with STEM degrees in the MoLSAMP Alliance by 125%, from 283 to 636, in five years.</p>\n<p>2. Increase the first- and second-year retention rates of URM in STEM disciplines to at least 60%.</p>\n<p>3. Increase the successful transfer of URM students from the two to four-year institution by 25% through strengthening and developing articulation agreements and reverse transfer opportunities. A special emphasis will be placed on transferring students in the STLCC Center for Plant and Life Sciences to four-year MoLSAMP Alliance institutions; and</p>\n<p>4. Increase the number of underrepresented students entering graduate programs in STEM fields by 25%.</p>\n<p>Operating a set of high impact practices such as, undergraduate research experiences, academic symposiums, summer bridge programs, and engaging scholars in experiential learning including laboratory research mentored by STEM faculty, STEM internships, and teacher assistant programs, MOLSAMP supported STEM student success for a critical mass of underrepresented minority students across MOLSAMP. Over the course of four project years (2016 &ndash; 2020) MOLSAMP exceeded its retention objectives, which included a high of nearly 75 percent retention rate for URM STEM scholars across Alliance institutions during the 2018-2019 academic year. MOOLSMAP&rsquo;s retention success was fueled by project activities such as intrusive academic advising, execution of summer bridge programs including the Summer Sophomore Experience, the MOLSAMP Summer Sophomore STEM Institute, and the implementation of MOLSAMP Drop in Centers at respective Alliance institutions. These activities benefited retention and persistence in ways such as providing scholars an understanding of how to navigate academic catalogs to design degree plans and monitor their own academic success through charting self-designed degree audits. The MOLSAMP Drop-In Centers created at multiple campuses were used to create a sense of belonging of the campuses, to provide access to advising, tutoring, and a gathering space for scholars to engage in study and research groups that aided scholars in their academic journey for graduating with a STEM degree.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The retention success experienced by MOLSAMP supported the increase of URMs graduating with STEM degrees from Alliance institutions. Graduating well over 1500 URM STEM students across the nine-member Alliance throughout the life of the grant, MOLSAMP increased the number of URMs graduating with STEM degrees, however the ambitious objective for doubling the number of STEM graduates eluded MOLSAMP. The MOLSAMP project experienced major challenges brought on by the shut down of the country due to the corona virus pandemic. Like many things, the project was abruptly put on pause as all attention was diverted to the health and safety of the Alliance campus communities as efforts were underway to respond to the crisis of the pandemic. Not only did this pause impact the synergy of MOLSAMP, it also disrupted the infrastructures set up at Alliance campuses to operate the project. The loss of in-person opportunities, navigating new ways to engage students, and challenges of reaching students who didn&rsquo;t have readily available access to internet services and other important learning tools for a virtual environment impacted how things were done and overall project progress.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Yet, even with the challenges brought on by the pandemic, MOLSAMP navigated a most uncertain time to still execute a summer undergraduate research experience and hosted an undergraduate research symposium that allowed students to engage in an on-line STEM community with peers to present research and to learn from STEM professionals who serves as keynote speakers.</p>\n<p>A highlight of MOLSAMP is the success it had in producing students who were recognized for their work as undergraduate researches. During the course of the project MOLSAMP scholars participated in local, regional, and national academic conferences to present posters and to conduct oral research presentations. Moreover, MOLSAMP orchestrated three Undergraduate Research Symposiums that provided its scholars opportunities to present research to its peers, faculty, staff and administration across Alliance institutions to disseminate project produces research.</p>\n<p>MOLSAMP improved the number of URM STEM scholars graduating from Alliance i<span>nstitutions</span>.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 03/11/2024<br>\nModified by: Freddie&nbsp;E&nbsp;Wills</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1619639/1619639_10463728_1706600635599_STEM_Speaker_Series--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1619639/1619639_10463728_1706600635599_STEM_Speaker_Series--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Seeing ME in STEM Speaker Series\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1619639/1619639_10463728_1706600635599_STEM_Speaker_Series--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Seeing ME in STEM Speaker Series\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">MOLSAMP Speaker Series designed to introduce near peer STEM professionals to undergraduate students who share similar generational status as the MOSLAMP Scholars.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Harris Stowe State University</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Freddie&nbsp;E&nbsp;Wills\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Seeing ME in STEM Speaker Series</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1619639/1619639_10463728_1710198192179_file_52--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1619639/1619639_10463728_1710198192179_file_52--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"MoLSAMP Summer Sophomore STEM Institute Students\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1619639/1619639_10463728_1710198192179_file_52--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"MoLSAMP Summer Sophomore STEM Institute Students\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">MoLSAMP Summer Sophomore STEM Institute students at Ameren Missouri's  Callaway Energy Center in Fulton, Missouri.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Harris-Stowe State University</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Freddie&nbsp;E&nbsp;Wills\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">MoLSAMP Summer Sophomore STEM Institute Students</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1619639/1619639_10463728_1710195974026_MOLSAMP_at_ERN.2019--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1619639/1619639_10463728_1710195974026_MOLSAMP_at_ERN.2019--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"ERN 2019 MoLSAMP Delegation\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1619639/1619639_10463728_1710195974026_MOLSAMP_at_ERN.2019--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"ERN 2019 MoLSAMP Delegation\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">MoLSAMP Scholars and Faculty from Harris-Stowe State University, Lincoln University, Missouri State University, Truman State University, University of Central Missouri, University of Missouri -

MOOLSMAPs retention success was fueled by project activities such as intrusive academic advising, execution of summer bridge programs including the Summer Sophomore Experience, the MOLSAMP Summer Sophomore STEM Institute, and the implementation of MOLSAMP Drop in Centers at respective Alliance institutions. These activities benefited retention and persistence in ways such as providing scholars an understanding of how to navigate academic catalogs to design degree plans and monitor their own academic success through charting self-designed degree audits. The MOLSAMP Drop-In Centers created at multiple campuses were used to create a sense of belonging of the campuses, to provide access to advising, tutoring, and a gathering space for scholars to engage in study and research groups that aided scholars in their academic journey for graduating with a STEM degree.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe retention success experienced by MOLSAMP supported the increase of URMs graduating with STEM degrees from Alliance institutions. Graduating well over 1500 URM STEM students across the nine-member Alliance throughout the life of the grant, MOLSAMP increased the number of URMs graduating with STEM degrees, however the ambitious objective for doubling the number of STEM graduates eluded MOLSAMP. The MOLSAMP project experienced major challenges brought on by the shut down of the country due to the corona virus pandemic. Like many things, the project was abruptly put on pause as all attention was diverted to the health and safety of the Alliance campus communities as efforts were underway to respond to the crisis of the pandemic. Not only did this pause impact the synergy of MOLSAMP, it also disrupted the infrastructures set up at Alliance campuses to operate the project. The loss of in-person opportunities, navigating new ways to engage students, and challenges of reaching students who didnt have readily available access to internet services and other important learning tools for a virtual environment impacted how things were done and overall project progress.\n\n\n\n\n\nYet, even with the challenges brought on by the pandemic, MOLSAMP navigated a most uncertain time to still execute a summer undergraduate research experience and hosted an undergraduate research symposium that allowed students to engage in an on-line STEM community with peers to present research and to learn from STEM professionals who serves as keynote speakers.\n\n\nA highlight of MOLSAMP is the success it had in producing students who were recognized for their work as undergraduate researches. During the course of the project MOLSAMP scholars participated in local, regional, and national academic conferences to present posters and to conduct oral research presentations. Moreover, MOLSAMP orchestrated three Undergraduate Research Symposiums that provided its scholars opportunities to present research to its peers, faculty, staff and administration across Alliance institutions to disseminate project produces research.\n\n\nMOLSAMP improved the number of URM STEM scholars graduating from Alliance institutions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/11/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: FreddieEWills\n"
