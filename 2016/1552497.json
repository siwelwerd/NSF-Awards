 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ubiquitous sensing has enabled new services and applications that mark\r\nevery aspect of our lives. However, the ensuing data deluge is a brick\r\nwall in face of our abilities to interpret, process and store data. Also, not\r\nall the data collected is informative, nor well-attuned to the tasks we\r\ncare to accomplish. This project introduces new approaches for data\r\nprocessing that hold promise to bring about stunning speedups in the\r\nprocessing of massive data, and explores principled controlled data\r\nacquisition paradigms for numerous inference problems. The research\r\nactivities are expected to advance the theory and practice of data\r\nprocessing and acquisition in emerging cyber-physical systems for civil\r\ninfrastructure, healthcare, energy, and transportation.\r\n\r\nThe research involves 1) developing, and analyzing the fundamental\r\nlimits of, transformative subspace-based approaches to data processing\r\nthat are simultaneously scalable and robust to outliers using subspace\r\npursuit in structure-preserving data sketches, and data-subspace\r\nformulations which are invariant to transformations that preserve the\r\nunderlying low-dimensional data structures, 2) exploring controlled data\r\nacquisition in asymptotic regimes of large number of observations with\r\nrelaxed notions of optimality to unravel the complete structure of\r\noptimal design and recognize unifying principles for the design of\r\nefficient control policies for a host of controlled inference problems. The\r\npractical implications of the fundamental results are studied in the\r\ncontext of structural health monitoring for damage detection and\r\ncharacterization of engineering structures. The educational activities\r\ninclude establishing a new miniature sensing lab, developing an\r\nintroductory course on learning from big data and sequential analysis,\r\ncompiling a corpus of intuitive tutorials laying out the core concepts of\r\nresearch results, and mentoring of senior design projects.",
