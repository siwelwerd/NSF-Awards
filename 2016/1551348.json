 "awd_abstract_narration": "The origin and subsequent evolution of the Earth and other planets in our own and other solar systems is dictated by several factors including original composition and the melt behavior of the constituent phases. However, estimates of the melting temperature of Earth's mantle, which comprises more than three-quarters of the Earth's volume and nearly two-thirds of its mass, remain controversial and elusive. The conditions at which the mantle melts and solidifies is especially important for understanding compositional heterogeneity, which constrains deep structure and mixing and is crucial for inferring the thermo-chemical evolution of the Earth, from planetary accretion and the magma ocean, to continental growth, the formation of the oceans and atmosphere, and the current state of the core-mantle boundary. \r\n\r\nThe melt behavior of one of the most abundant minerals in the mantle, ferropericlase (Mg, Fe)O, at high pressures will test hypotheses on Earth's formation and elucidate the geochemistry of the deep mantle.  Experiments conducted at pressures corresponding to depths greater than ~1200 km suggests that an ideal solid solution behavior becomes more eutectic-like with increasing pressure.  The experiments will be studied by 2-dimensional mapping of temperature, composition and texture of sample materials placed under the extreme high-pressure, high-temperature conditions of the Earth's early mantle as produced by a laser-heated diamond-anvil cell, in order to identify the conditions at which melting occurs and its subsequent influence on the composition and morphology of the molten and surrounding regions.  Additionally, this experimental investigation will help constrain current temperatures of the Earth by estimating the temperatures at the core-mantle boundary.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe main goal of this project was to further test hypotheses of Earth formation and the thermochemical evolution of the mantle by investigating the melt behavior of the second most abundant mineral in the Earth, ferropericlase (Mg, Fe)O, at high pressures using the laser-heated diamond-anvil cell.  Additionally, we expanded on the experiments by coupling with first-principles molecular dynamics (FPMD) simulations to explore other important melting relations beyond ferropericlase to include FeO2Hx and various silicate melts.  We found that the electronic spin transition in iron acts to depress the melting temperature in important mantle minerals, ferropericlase and bridgmanite, while it gos from high spin to low spin.  This phenomena can be understood and predicted by both Lindemann?s Law as well as through thermodynamics.  With our results we were able to constrain mantle viscosity today as well as in the past as a magma ocean.  These constraints can be used to model mantle convection and the overall evolution of the solid Earth through time thus increasing our understanding of Earth and the engine beneath our feet.\n\n \n\nThis project supported the work of two graduate students and a lab manager, mentored by the PI.  Additionally, the project supported technique development that can be used across the high-pressure community.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/04/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Kanani K Lee"
