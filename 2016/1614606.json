 "awd_abstract_narration": "Virtually every important thing cells and tissues do involve changes in cell morphology:  cell division, cell migration, and wound healing all involve profound changes in cell shape.  These shape changes are powered by the outer layer of the cell, which is called the \"cortex\".  The cortex contains a meshwork of fibrous proteins that can contract, protrude, and slide.  These movements provide the basis of cell shape changes.  The control of this fibrous network is the domain of a protein called Rho.  Rho is somehow activated in distinct patterns, each of which corresponds to a different cell shape change.  Thus, in order to understand and control processes such as cell division, cell migration and wound healing, it is essential to learn how to understand and control patterns of Rho activation.  In this collaborative project, investigators from the US and the UK use synthetic cell biology and mathematical modeling to test mechanisms underlying cortical pattern formation.  This project will provide research opportunities for interdisciplinary training at the interface between quantitative cell biology and mathematical modeling for undergraduates, graduate students, and postdocs.  The project also offers embedded research opportunities for high-school teachers as well as topic-specific K-12 and public outreach activities. \r\n\r\nPrevious studies by the PIs demonstrated that cells can support sustained waves of dynamically-coupled Rho activity and actin assembly, and mathematical modeling followed by experimental verification revealed that cortical wave propagation is based on Rho autoactivation and actin-mediated Rho inactivation.  This constitutes the basis of an \"excitable\" system, a family of well-established theoretical models with few previously-known cellular manifestations.  This project will deduce and experimentally validate a minimal molecular mechanism and basic design elements required for cortical excitability.  To achieve the goals of this project, a novel semi-synthetic platform for replicating complex cell behaviors using simple macromolecular parts will be employed, enabling manipulation of the molecular network at escalating complexity instead of by dissecting a complex physiological network.  The project will couple computational modeling of excitable dynamics to live-cell imaging in whole cells and in a new ex vivo model of cortical dynamics.  First, excitable dynamics will be reconstituted in resting, non-mitotic cells (oocytes of frogs and echinoderms) using natural regulators and their mutants, followed by their replacement with synthetic equivalents.  Second, a quantifiable ex vivo model will be developed (using frog oocyte or egg extracts and supported lipid bilayers) that permits precise control of system composition in a simplified context.  Third, to achieve on-demand control of cortical pattern formation, an optogenetic approach in animal oocytes will be used to explore the repertoire of both natural and synthetic cortical pattern formation.  Iterative experimentation and computational modeling will be employed throughout the project to 1) interpret biological data, 2) express candidate mechanisms in the form of mathematical models, 3) generate predictions, and 4) test those predictions experimentally.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nExcitable behavior emerges in systems ranging from simple protein interaction networks, to cells coupled to each other in tissues, to swarms of animals, even humans, and is characterized by the long-range propagation of activity waves driven by coupled self-activation and feedback inhibition.  This project started with the revelation of excitable behavior in the cell surface of eggs and embryos of starfish and frogs.  In these cells, waves of contractile protein assembly at the cell surface are driven by a small signaling protein, Rho, and one of its key activators, named Ect2.  These same proteins - along with others they interact with - are the core participants in one of the most important surface contractile functions animal cells ever conduct: they are the basis for the device that pinches animal cells in two during division.  An overlapping set of proteins functions during numerous normal and pathological cell behaviors, including intracellular wound healing and microbial attack.  Therefore it is of great importance to understand the repertoire of behaviors Rho and its regulators can manifest.  To this end, this project sought to reconstitute Rho-based contractile excitability in resting cells that do not normally exhibit excitable dynamics: the immature oocytes of starfish and frogs.  These cells, once they mature, become highly excitable, but also commence cell division and development, which complicates experimental study of cell surface behaviors.  What is the smallest set of components we have to add to these cells to render them excitable?  And how can we tune excitability?  \n\n This effort showed, first, that in addition to the Rho activator Ect2, which mediates self-activation of Rho signaling from one patch of cell surface to the next, the key element of feedback inhibition is likely provided by a Rho inactivator known as RGA3/4 or MPGAP.  Second, in frog oocytes, supplying just these two proteins -  Ect2 and RGA3/4, mutated such that they avoid sequestration in the oocyte nucleus - suffices to make the immature oocyte excitable for many hours.  Furthermore, the amount of these proteins supplied determines the relative amplitude and period of the contractile waves.  RGA3/4's participation in this simple protein circuit depends on a key trait: it associates with the cell surface via the very contractile proteins recruited by Rho signaling.  Hence, Ect2 activates Rho; Rho recruits contractile proteins to the cell surface, while prompting its own Ect2-dependent activation in the neighboring patch; RGA3/4 associates with newly-recruited contractile proteins, turning off the Rho signal, and the wave moves on.  Computer models based on these premises, developed in tandem in this project, show that the known traits of these proteins account for their observed behavior.\n\n Other key outcomes from this project include the discovery that the same Rho-based regulatory circuit gives rise to regular contraction waves in barnacle eggs.  This is significant because it represents a naturally-occurring case in which cells use this phenomenon for an obvious purpose: the highly-regular waves in newly-fertilized barnacle eggs reshape this large cell from a sphere into a football shape.  Moreover, as development proceeds, the barnacle egg tunes its cell surface through a full spectrum of excitable behaviors.  In the course of this project we discovered, in barnacles, a likely role for another feedback inhibitor, the Rho-dependent protein kinase (\"Rock\").  Although Rock is normally thought of as merely an agent of Rho signaling, we provided evidence in both barnacles and starfish that Rock inhibits Ect2's association with the cell surface, thereby squelching further Rho activation. \n\n This project's training outcomes included providing research opportunities for numerous undergraduate students, including several from minority groups under-represented in science.  The project also included the participation of a high-school science teacher.  Finally, by supporting research at a marine field station, this project indirectly enabled many other scientific investigations by sustaining infrastructure and instrumentation as well as expertise.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/13/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: George Von Dassow"
