The objectives are to (1) develop a shared vision for what environmental education should be for all teacher preparation programs in Wisconsin; (2) produce 20 environmental education instructional activities for middle and high school preservice teachers that integrate traditionally separate disciplines; and 3) bring the strengths and expertise of faculty from different institutions together to collaboratively offer new learning opportunities about environmental education for students now and in the future. The project offers a 3-day, Environmental Education workshop to faculty from all 33 public and private teacher preparation programs in Wisconsin. Two individuals in different licensure program or content areas from each institution will be invited to participate (66 participants total). \r\n\r\nThe three- day workshop that will help determine a shared vision for how to include environmental education in teacher preparation programs (a legal requirement within the state) and produce deliverables (20 environmental education instructional activities) that may be used in programs for middle and high school preservice teachers.",
