 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Bioinformatics Training with Industry Support and Engagement (BITWISE) project will provide financial, academic, and career support for academically talented, low-income students while enrolled in a new interdisciplinary Master of Science program in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology at Saint Louis University. The project will leverage the university's midtown location within a vibrant community of biotechnology industries in the Greater St. Louis area. Community partners provide a broad network for placing students into internships while completing their master's degrees and into careers upon graduation. Local industries will invite groups of BITWISE scholars on location through a series of field trips during the academic year, and industry mentors will participate in on-campus activities such as research seminars and career panels. \r\n\r\nDirect outcomes of the project will include improved educational opportunities for both the BITWISE scholars and future generations of students who follow a similar educational pathway, and the enrichment of the biotechnology workforce in a field of great local and national need. Further impact of the project will include establishing and assessing a model for a robust university-industry partnership in support of a professionally-oriented master's degree in an interdisciplinary STEM field, and for using both common courses and extracurricular activities to develop a cohesive interdisciplinary cohort from an initial population of students who arrive with diverse backgrounds ranging over more discipline-specific undergraduate fields of study.",

An evaluation of the various interventions concluded that the use of Supplemental Instruction, with a second-year student supporting first-year students in their introductory sequence, was most well received by students, both because of the academic support and the building of a cohort. \n\nThe broader impact of the project is most directly reflected in the successful development of the cohort of scholars, and the resulting enrichment of the workforce.  The project also strengthened this relatively new academic program and established pathways that will be used by many future students.  The sustainability of the academic program is demonstrated by the Fall 2022 intake of students, which was the largest cohort to date for the program, despite students no longer being supported as NSF S-STEM scholars.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/27/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Michael H Goldwasser"
