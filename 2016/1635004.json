 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to understand how computer simulation can be used to predict the motion of large systems of bodies interacting with each other through friction and contact. Studying these so-called \"many-body dynamics problems\" has theoretical and practical relevance in several disciplines (physics, chemistry, astronomy, geomechanics), industries (pharmaceuticals, food processing, farming, manufacturing, construction, mining), and engineering applications (additive manufacturing, nanoparticle self-assembly, robotics, ground vehicle mobility). In terms of educational and outreach impact, initiatives undertaken as part of this project will (i) promote the discipline of Computational Science at middle and high-school levels via a \"The Science Behind Video Gaming\" short course and a residential summer program, respectively; (ii) update and expand curricula in two graduate courses on high performance computing and advanced computational dynamics; (iii) expand a biannual advanced computing forum that facilitates transfer of technology; and, (iv) provide training via a Master of Engineering distance learning program for practitioners who need to analyze, process, and solve problems using information generated by the growing use of data collection in engineering design and industrial operations.\r\n\r\nThe research effort will focus on investigating techniques that facilitate a discrete-continuum dual representation in the simulation of many-body dynamics problems. The fundamental question answered is how should one handle parts of a many-body dynamics problem using a continuum formalism so that the new mixed discrete-continuum representation manages to preserve the dynamics of the original problem? Also, how should a continuum representation be fine-grained into a discrete one, and conversely, what techniques should be used to coarse-grain a discrete representation into a continuous one? Mechanical engineering expertise (dynamics of many-body systems, solid mechanics, plasticity), applied math techniques (meshless methods for solving partial differential equations, optimization methods), and computer science components (machine learning, software engineering) will combine in a coordinated effort to solve the stated problem. In this context, the goal of this project is to (a) establish a systematic methodology for producing rheologies that, when embedded in a continuum mechanics model, produce a solution that is close to that of a large discrete many-body dynamics problem; and (b) use this methodology to understand whether there are rheologies that have a universal attribute; i.e., that are applicable to all, or a large spectrum of, many-body dynamics problems. In this context, a rheology is regarded as a methodology that ties at microscale the dynamics/flow of a continuum to the forces acting on it. The research plan is built around the idea of augmenting physical insights with a machine learning process that uses large amounts of data generated by fully-resolved, many-body dynamics solutions to produce rheology candidates.",

Under the second one, we homogenized the motion of the many-body system and thus treated the system as a continuum endowed with appropriate constitutive laws. The research effort was successful in proving our hypothesis correct. In doing so, we established an approach that relies on conservation of mass and momentum laws associated with continua to capture the dynamics of discrete, many-body dynamic systems. This work has led to seven journal submissions (five accepted, two under review), an ASME IDETC/ICE Best Paper Award in the Multibody Systems and Nonlinear Dynamics and Controls technical conference (Cleveland, 2017), and one NSF Graduate Research Fellowships Program (GRFP) Award (2019).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Broader Impact: This project provided the funding to train and mentor a group of 60 high-school students through the ?Promoting the Computational Science Initiative?

In this program, high-school students from underrepresented socioeconomic groups, who most often come from low-income families, spend an inspiring week on-campus at UW-Madison having room and board covered. The high school students spend this week participating in Computational Science related activities, including: introduction to computational dynamics through development of a basic video game, aspects of Computer Aided Design, and concepts of Computer Graphics. A thorough description of ProCSI's statement of purpose, activities, schedule, and more than 500 pictures are available at the online event website (<a href=\"https://sbel.wisc.edu/procsi/\">https://sbel.wisc.edu/procsi/</a>).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The outcomes of this research project are used the PIs in an ongoing NASA project to simulate the mobility of the VIPER rover on lunar soil for its 2024 mission to the moon; its goal is to probe for frozen water.
