 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the participation of US based graduate students, early career researchers and workshop leaders at the 31st Summer Topology Conference on Topology and its Applications, which will be held August 2-5, 2016 at the University of Leicester. This conference series originated in New York City and specializes in advancing the development of topological methods and applications to a broad range of areas including computer science, analysis, and algebra. It maintains a tradition of an inclusive attitude towards developing new application areas.  Special focus this year is on algebraic topology as well as new mathematical notions of spectrum in connection with diffraction for point-patterns modelling distributions of matter. \r\n\r\nThe goal of the conference is to present the latest developments in several areas of topology and its methods, and to foster collaborations and bridges between them. The scope of the conference includes special sessions in Algebraic Topology, Continuum Theory and Dynamical Systems, Topology and Foundations, as well as sessions featuring applications to Computer Science and Analysis. The session in Algebraic Topology will feature newly developed categorical methods. The session on Continuum Theory and Dynamical Systems will highlight recent results in hyperbolic 3-manifolds and aperiodic flows on 3-manifolds. \r\n\r\nThe conference website is https://sites.google.com/site/summertopology/home",
