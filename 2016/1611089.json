 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-technical Abstract\r\nColloids are collections of small particles suspended in a liquid.  They occur in many different places in everyday life, such as paints and milk.  The properties of these colloids can be controlled by varying the size and composition of the particles allowing them to serve as models for atomic systems.  This project will explore the properties of colloids to obtain a better understanding of the various phases (liquids, crystals, glasses) of atomic and molecular systems.  Colloids offer an advantage in this study since the location of individual particles can be tracked in 3D. In addition, the PI's will develop new techniques that will allow more control of the particles in the colloids.  The project will provide training for graduate and undergraduate students in state-of-the-art synthesis and measurement techniques.  In addition, the relative simplicity and the visual character of the experiments make them highly accessible to the public.\r\n\r\nTechnical Abstract\r\n\r\nThis project will use colloidal particles as models for the study of interesting and important phase behavior of a variety of solid phases.  Colloids offer the unique advantage in that the motion of individual particles can be tracked. This enables direct three-dimensional, time-dependent imaging of complex dynamic processes, such as crystallization, nucleation or deformation, on the molecular level; these processes are common to both colloidal systems as well as molecular systems. This capability will be exploited in the work proposed to investigate new properties of the phase behavior of solids, including phase transitions between amorphous and crystalline states, solid-solid phase transitions and the nature and dynamics of the amorphous state and the interfaces of crystalline materials. An important part of the project is the development of new experimental tools.  One of them is the \"electric bottle\", in which the particle density is controlled by dielectrophoresis.  New types of electrodes are being developed to aid in the study of phase transformations, in particular homogeneous crystal nucleation from the melt and solid-solid transformations.  A second tool being developed is a highly sensitive traction-force method for measuring the stress in a colloidal crystal or glass during deformation.  The tool will also present the rheology community with a new, highly sensitive instrument.  The colloids also provide a unique opportunity to study the mobility and fluctuation dynamics of a large variety of random and engineered three-dimensional grain boundaries.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nColloidal systems are suspensions of large number of small particles (about one micrometer in diameter) in a liquid. The particles move around and form structures that are similar to those formed by atoms:  crystals, liquids and glasses.  Because the particles are ten thousand times larger than atoms, they can be followed in an optical microscope, and show us, experimentally, how various complex phenomena occur on the atomic scale. \n\nThe figure shows an example.  It shows a snapshot of a slice through the interface between a colloidal crystal and its liquid.  By observing the fluctuations in the position of the interface in a series of these snapshots, we can learn about the its energy and its dependence on orientation of the underlying crystal.  The colloids provide a uniqe way obtain such quantities experimentally.\n\nOther applications include the study of the kinetics of melting and crystallization:  how do individual liquid particles join the crystal, or vice versa ?  How do the interfaces between crystals of different orientation (grain boundaries) fluctuate, and what does that teach us about their structure and energies ?\n\nUnderstanding the plastic (i.e., permanent) deformation of glasses is a particularly challenging problem in materials science.  Unlike the plastic deformation of crystals, which is relatively well understood from the sliding of the planes that make up their structure, the lack of periodic structure in a glass makes the process much more complex.  By tracking all the particles during the plastic deformation of a colloidal glass, it is possible to see how the intense local deformation of small groups of particles add up to give the overall, macroscopic deformation.  We have also developed a method of measuring the stress the sample feels during deformation.  This is a challenging problem, since these colloidal samples are very soft.  Our method consists of coupling the colloidal glass to a soft gel of known stiffness, and measuring its deformation under the same stress.  This allows us to create stress-strain curves, which are the bread-and-butter of mechanical testing of structural materials such as steel, at stress levels that are ten orders of magnitude smaller.\n\nAlthough our work is aimed at obtaining basic insights and fundamental quantities in materials science, the insights gained also aid in improving technologies such as solidification and mechanical processing.\n\nColloidal systems are also great tools for educating students at all levels of preparation.  The highly visual nature of the work allows even high school students direct insight into the structure and deformation of crystals, diffraction of light, formation of glasses, and fundamental phenomena such as diffusion and Brownian motion.  REU students, in particular, have found our colloidal work very attractive, and several have continued their work for their thesis.\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/03/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Frans Spaepen"
