 "awd_abstract_narration": "Each year an average of twenty passengers on intercity buses are killed in crashes according to data in a report from National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration (NHTSA). Several hundred serious injuries also occur annually in these crashes. Intercity buses often travel at high speeds on highways late at night. Since these buses are top heavy, they are prone to potentially rolling over in the event of some collision. Studies by both NHTSA and National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) show that passenger use of seat belts could prevent more than half of these fatalities as well as the severity of many injuries by adequate restraint of passengers in such collisions. In spite of the obvious need, recent census data shows that nearly 80% of the total fleet of almost 30,000 intercity buses in the US is still not equipped with seatbelts for passengers. NHTSA ruled two years ago to require seat belts on all new intercity buses produced on or after 2016. However, all older buses are exempt from that ruling due to the estimated cost of $40,000 per bus to add seatbelts to the existing buses. The conventional approach requires replacement of all bus seats with more expensive seats that have seatbelts built into them. The team at University of Massachusetts at Amherst has a patent pending invention that can retrofit seatbelts onto existing intercity buses without any need to replace the existing seats. Thus, the cost will be lessened, and retrofits with seatbelts may now be feasible.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to validate a design version of this retrofit invention that is compatible with the needs of the customer identified during a customer discovery process. Achievement of this goal will involve a scope and approach of: 1) verification that the design will meet the worst case load magnitudes specified in the federal standard that represents head on collisions, 2) verification that dynamic simulation of a rollover crash proves adequate restraint of passengers to prevent ejection of passengers from the seating area, which NHTSA studies show is a leading cause of the fatalities, 3) design for cost minimization and manufacturability given the need to meet these stated requirements, 4) development of an executable business model canvas based on customer discovery by contact of at least 100 potential customers. These customers are primarily the intercity bus owners and operators. To maximize the market penetration, the customer base could extend throughout the supply chain to bus manufacturers, bus seat suppliers, and motorcoach rebuilding facilities. Customer discovery will also involve discussions with regulators and insurers, and surveys of passengers. Here, the team can network from established contacts at the American Bus Association (ABA), Sarah's Wish Foundation, NHTSA, NTSB, American Seating, Peter Pan Bus Lines, Stage Arrow Lines, Lancer Insurance, and vehicular kinetics specialists to identify ideal product configurations, potential business models, customers, value propositions, cost structures, and revenue streams. If successful, the potential contribution should include both acceleration of the pace of retrofitting the existing total fleet with seat belts and an increase in revenues throughout the supply chain by the introduction of an innovative and more affordable product.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nDuring the I-Corps grant, we conducted 114 customer interviews to assess the demand and potential commercialization of this product.  We began with the hypothesis that passengers would want to wear seatbelts if available and that bus owners would want to add seatbelts to reduce liability and gain competitive advantage.  This customer discovery process revealed that only passengers with children are interested in access to seatbelts and that large bus owners already have enough belted buses to meet any demand and are thus not interested in any retrofit product.  We continued customer discovery and learned that Resellers of used buses occasionally receive requests to add seatbelts and would like an affordable option.  We then pivoted to find that different market size and a path to make that option available.  We talked to bus seat suppliers and learned of three organizations that may be interested in buying a license from UMass to be able to sell the product to Resellers for retrofitting.  Our Go decision was to pursue that licensing potential and proceed with the customer validation process. \n\nIn parallel to finding out the commercialization potential, we have now completed all of the product design verification goals identified in the abstract above.  We will soon begin writing a journal paper about the technical aspects and how they relate to the vehicle crashworthiness of the product design.  During 2016, we completed significant work on customer validation.  Thanks to what we learned in the customer discovery process and the I-Corps program, we knew the key stakeholders to invite to presentations of our invention at three separate events this year.  The results revealed that another pivot is now needed.  The international market, particularly in India, happens to much greater than it is in the US.  Thus, our current pivot involves our collaborator, who also works in that area, to begin pitching this invention to key stakeholders in India.  In summary, our major outcomes thus far include the following:\n\nThis invention is now patented internationally and published under \"Retrofit seat belt system.\" International Patent Number WO2015179784 (A9) ? 2016-01-14\n\nThe product licensing potential was pitched to main contacts from all three potential licensees in face to face meetings to:\n\nDonovan Albarran, Export Sales Director at Amaya-Astron Seating\nDoug Oswald and Dave McLaughlin at American Seating\nCharlie Vits at IMMI\n\n\nArticles about this invention and this project are now published in the Greenfield Recorder, the Springfield Republican, MassLive, and on the website of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME).\n\nFeatured presentations were given at the following events this year: \n\nAmerican Bus Association Marketplace 2016 event in Louisville, KY in January\nUnited Motorcoach Association Expo 2016 in Atlanta, GA in February\nDATTCO Sales &amp; Service Expo 2016 on Thursday March 24, 2016 at Foxwoods Resort &amp; Casino in CT\n\n\nDr. Chandra Thorbole, the founder and director of Thorbole Simulation Technologies (TST), will present this invention at his seminar on vehicle crashworthiness in New Delhi, India on May 25, 2106.  \n\n  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/05/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Sundar Krishnamurty"
