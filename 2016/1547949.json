 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project creates an Innovation Corps Site at Missouri University of Science and Technology (Missouri S&T or S&T).\r\n\r\nNSF Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors.\r\n\r\nThis Site at M S&T integrates education and research with cutting-edge applications to create and convey knowledge that serves the State of Missouri and the nation, and helps solve societal challenges at global scale. The Site enhances the university strategic plan which requires experiential learning as an integral component of undergraduate curricula to foster innovation and creativity. In addition, the I-Corps Site encourages a large number of untapped STEM talents and provides institutional support for commercialization. The complementary, on-campus Student Design and Experiential Leaning Center is also leveraged to develop student entrepreneurs and accelerate their business ideas to the market place. \r\n\r\nBy providing targeted seed funds for commercialization efforts, the I-Corps Site enhances existing programs at S&T, improves visibility of entrepreneurship, and expands participation in existing technology transfer programs. Thirty teams per year receive I-Corps Site funding to translate ideas and research to the marketplace. The Site entrepreneurial education program is based on the I-Corps curriculum with experiential, collaborative learning and uses the Lean LaunchPad methodology. The Site objectives are to: \r\n(1) Enhance entrepreneurial activities and training experiences for undergraduate and graduate students at S&T; \r\n(2) Expand training opportunities available to post docs, faculty, underrepresented groups using LLP model; \r\n(3) Increase the number of teams entering the I-Corps program, entrepreneur fellows at the University of Missouri System and S&T, and VentureWell E-Teams; and \r\n(4) Transition more activities to commercialization. \r\nTeams are recruited from existing and new entrepreneurial student activities, course projects, research, and participants in local and regional venture competitions and entrepreneurship events.\r\n\r\nThe I-Corps Site impacts the Midwest region and Central Missouri where S&T is located. Rolla and its surrounding rural areas are remote and in need of economic resurgence. The I-Corps Site catalyzes activities to create a critical mass of innovators and entrepreneurs to establish a local technology hub and economic base and engage civic leaders and other stakeholders. The Site also serves as a bridge for collaboration with more mature startup communities and developed economic bases in St Louis and Kansas City. The Site provides fertile ground for experiential training of students from nearby community colleges, middle schools, and high schools through entrepreneurship courses, seminars, workshops, innovation camps and competitions, and other outreach activities. Special attention is being paid to recruit and involve female and underrepresented minority students in this program; the activities of which will be widely disseminated through various mechanisms including a dedicated website, newsletters and other social media.",
