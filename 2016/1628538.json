Prosecutors and defense lawyers usually help determine the jury by using a fixed number of \"peremptory\" challenges to remove jurors they believe to be unsympathetic.  The present study will be the first to test empirically the common assumption that peremptory challenges increase the impartiality of juries.  This study will also expand the scope of the limited empirical research on discrimination in jury selection, and provide a novel data set for use in future analysis.  \r\n\r\nResearchers will collect court data from Minnesota about the demographics of all jurors summoned over a multi-year period, as well as details about juror selection and trial verdicts, and combine these with data already gathered from North Carolina. The purpose of the study is to examine (i) if there are distinct patterns in peremptory challenge use for prosecutors and defense attorneys, (ii) how peremptory challenges affect the composition of impaneled juries, (iii) how any effect on composition influences verdicts, and (iv) how results compare to previously collected, parallel data from North Carolina. Data will be collected on site in Minnesota district courts, and through remote access to court files.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Sixth Amendment to the US Constitution gives criminal defendants the right to trial by an impartial jury.  As part of the jury selection process, attorneys are allowed a fixed number of strikes, called peremptory challenges, which they can use to remove prospective jurors from the pool.  Attorneys are not allowed to use peremptory challenges to strike a juror due to their race or gender, but otherwise attorneys are free to use their challenges as they see fit.  This project examines how attorneys use their peremptory challenges, and how these challenges affect the composition of the jury and verdicts.  Some results include that prosecutors challenge black prospective jurors at a much higher rate than defense attorneys, and this results in black jurors being underrepresented on juries.  This is true despite the fact that challenging a prospective juror based on their race is unconstitutional.   Other results include that prosecutors are more likely to challenge younger, less educated prospective jurors, while defense attorneys challenge older, more educated prospective jurors.  We find that peremptory challenges have a significant effect on the composition of the sitting jury, and that, in general, the opposing challenges do not \"cancel out.\"  Peremptory challenges change the composition of the sitting jury in ways that affect conviction rates, and increase the variability in the outcomes of trials.  This project will produce a database past of jury selection outcomes in North Carolina and Minnesota, which will be accessible to the public.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/09/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Francis X Flanagan"
