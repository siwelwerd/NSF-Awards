The key innovation of this system is a proprietary Spectrum Intelligence capability used to identify spectrum occupancy in the vicinity and modify transmission parameters in the network. The Intellectual Merits of this project include: 1) Implementing and testing a novel IoT Gateway with autonomous channel selection capability based on spectrum occupancy information; 2) Transferring spectrum sensing algorithms into an FPGA platform for its field deployment, and as the first step towards and spectrum sensing ASIC design; 3) Obtaining a model-based design for an enterprise network architecture of IoT Gateways; and 4) Implementing and testing new adaptive OFDM approaches to optimize power and frequency usage is 4g/5G wireless communications.",
