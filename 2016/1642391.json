 "awd_abstract_narration": "Gravitational waves - tiny ripples in the fabric of space - were detected for the first time in history on September 14, 2015 by the US-led gravitational wave observatory, LIGO. This watershed event has ushered in a new era of gravitational wave astronomy, which will transform our understanding of the Universe by providing information through a previously inaccessible channel. LIGO operates at the very edge of the sensitivity required to detect gravitational waves, and therefore, non-stationary noise caused by the environment, e.g., weather and man-made noise, limits LIGO's sensitivity to short-duration gravitational wave transient signals such as the one detected in September. In order to ensure the most opportunity for the advancement of science, this project aims to mine the extensive auxiliary information available in the LIGO observatories in realtime in order to mitigate the impact of non-stationary noise and increase the rate of transient gravitational wave detections. Doing so will afford increased opportunities for joint gravitational wave and electromagnetic observations, which are thought to be rare.\r\n\r\nThis project aims to address a key piece of missing software infrastructure to use machine learning and inference techniques to utilize auxiliary information such as seismometers, microphones and various control loop signals, to identify non-stationary noise that couples to the gravitational-wave channel in near realtime. The software will be broken into three components: a signal decomposer, a signal classifier and a signal trainer. The signal classifier will determine, given the decomposed, instantaneous output of auxiliary channels and the training data, the probability that non-stationary noise is present. These software components will be built from reusable resources that can be applied across the time-domain gravitational wave community in data calibration, data transfer, and analysis.\r\n\r\nThis project is supported by the Division of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure in the Directorate for Computer & Information Science & Engineering and the Physics Division in the Directorate of Mathematical and Physical Sciences.",

Using the National Science Foundation funded LIGO Observatories, we now regularly detect when two black holes smash together from the gravitational wave ripples that they send across the universe which stretch and squeeze space as they pass. Gravitational waves encode fundamental information about the structure of space-time and the properties of the densest matter known to exist, and they have given us insight into stellar processes and the evolution of our universe which we would not otherwise have access to.\n\n\nFirst predicted 100 years earlier, the discovery of gravitational waves required decades of advances in theoretical physics - but also decades of advances in technology, computation and statistical techniques.  Gravitational waves remained elusive for 100 years because of their infinitesimal effect on the space around them which made them notoriously difficult to detect. In fact, the largest gravitational wave detected to date only stretched and squeezed the space around it by one part in 1021.  \n\n\nIn order to detect the infinitesimal stretching and squeezing of space from a passing gravitational wave, the LIGO detectors are extremely sensitive instruments.  Despite cutting edge noise isolation, LIGO detectors are still prone to transient noise sources from their environment such as seismic waves, weather events, and nearby man-made activity.  Fortunately, thousands of additional sensors constantly monitor the environment and instrument status around LIGO to help characterize noise.  This project aimed to use the auxiliary sensor information recorded by LIGO along with machine learning and statistical inference to determine when non-stationary noise could impact LIGO\u2019s ability to detect gravitational waves in real-time.  Personnel funded by this award developed software and operated services that helped to increase LIGO\u2019s ability to detect black hole mergers resulting in additional gravitational wave detections.  Graduate students and postdoctoral scholars received training in software engineering, machine learning, statistics, signal processing, databases, web development and visualization, and have transferred those skills to technical jobs.  \n\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/27/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Chad Hanna"
