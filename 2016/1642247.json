Participants will attend two events for junior researchers in the field of Software Engineering. The first is the Doctoral Symposium for PhD students.  The second event is the Mentorship Sessions program, which connects junior researchers (senior PhD students and pre-tenure faculty) with senior researchers who will serve as mentors. \r\n\r\nThe education, training and mentoring received by the participants helps build the next generation of US-based researchers and educators, also encourages the exchange of ideas and new research collaborations to advance the field of Software Engineering, which is important to the economy.",
