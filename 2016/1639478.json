 "awd_abstract_narration": "As part of an overall strategy to enhance learning within informal environments, the Innovations at the Nexus of Food, Energy, and Water Systems (INFEWS) and Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) programs partnered to support innovative models poised to catalyze well-integrated interdisciplinary research and development efforts within informal contexts that transform scientific understanding of the food, energy, and water systems (FEWS) nexus in order to improve system function and management, address system stress, increase resilience, and ensure sustainability. This project addresses this aim by using systems thinking and interdisciplinary integration approaches to develop a novel immersive educational simulation game and associated materials designed to highlight the role and importance of corn-water-ethanol-beef (CWEB) systems in supporting the ever increasing demands for food, energy, and water in the United States. The focus on FEWS and sustainable energy aligns well with both the INFEWS program and the sizable sustainability-related projects in the AISL program portfolio. The development and broad dissemination of a multiuser game specific to CWEB systems are particularly innovative contributions and advance for both program portfolios and their requisite fields of study. An additional unique feature of the game is the embedding of varying degrees of economic principles and decision-making along with the nuisances of cultural context as salient variables that influence systems thinking. Of note, a team of computer science, management and engineering undergraduate students at the University of Nebraska - Lincoln will be responsible for the engineering, development, and deployment of the game as their university capstone projects. If successful, this game will have a significant reach and impact on youth in informal programs (i.e., 4-H clubs), high school teachers and students in agriculture vocational education courses, college students, and the public. The impact could extend well beyond Nebraska and the targeted Midwestern region. \r\n\r\nIn conjunction with the game development, mixed-methods formative and summative evaluations will be conducted by an external evaluator. The formative evaluation of the game will focus on usability testing, interest and engagement with a select sample of youth at local 4-H clubs and youth day camps. Data will be collected from embedded in-game survey questionnaires, rating scales, observations and focus groups conducted with evaluation sample. These data and feedback will be used to inform the design and refinement of the game. The summative evaluation will focus on the overall impacts of the game. Changes in agricultural systems knowledge, attitudes toward agricultural systems, interest in pursuing careers in agricultural systems, and decision making will be aligned with the Nebraska State Science Standards and tracked using the National Agricultural Literacy Outcomes (NALOs) assessment, game analytics and pre/post-test measures administered to the evaluation study sample pre/post exposure to the game.",

The project utilized Nebraska's integrated Corn-Water-Ethanol-Beef (CWEB) Nexus as the context. Scientific models were identified and integrated using a loosely-coupled web-based framework. Each model was selected based on the ability to provide scientifically valid information and ability to develop APIs to interface with the gaming environment. The computational framework developed for this project was also used as a scientific research tool to analyze the CWEB system. For example, the tool was used to determine the ability of the Nebraska's&nbsp;CWEB system to meets its share of global corn, ethanol, and beef supply under varying climate scenarios. A theoretical framework was conceptualized to translate these scientific models into an interactive and educational video game. The team used agile project management to foster collaborations between members from various disciplines including engineering, computer science, agriculture, business, and graphic design. In the early stages of the project, the students developed an interactive board game called <em>Preservation</em> based on the scientific data and resources collected for the project. Pilot testing of the board game with 36 undergraduate students revealed that the game resulted in a significant increase in the student understanding in of the interconnection of food, energy, wand water systems. Initially, the goal was to develop a 3-D immersive downloadable game called Agpocalypse where players make decisions related to agricultural sustainability. Beta-testing of early version of game highlighted significant challenges in equitable access to the game and hardware compatibility issues in non-formal educational settings. The COVID-19 pandemic limited in-person deployment which further exasperated this issue. This prompted the team to shift to 2-D web-based versions that was more easily accessible and significantly reduced development time between versions. Supporting material such as tutorial videos, and curriculum resources were also developed. We integrated game-based learning with a systems-modeling tool called Loopy in our curriculum resources. A web-portal was created for long-term dissemination of these outputs (<a href=\"https://growable.unl.edu/agpocalypse-video-game\">https://growable.unl.edu/agpocalypse-video-game</a>). Over the course of the project, 78 educators received professional development training to use the products developed by the project. Evaluation of the training participants revealed significant increases in reported level of knowledge on systems-thinking. Educators reported that they were likely to use the video games to teach students about systems thinking. &nbsp;The project provided an excellent cross-disciplinary training environment for numerous undergraduate and graduate students and has positively influenced their career trajectories. For example, this project motivated an engineering graduate student who worked on the project to become non-formal youth educator who now uses the products developed by the project.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/21/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Deepak&nbsp;Keshwani</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1639478/1639478_10457721_1671635448760_2DGameScreenShots--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1639478/1639478_10457721_1671635448760_2DGameScreenShots--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Agpocalypse 2-D Game\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1639478/1639478_10457721_1671635448760_2DGameScreenShots--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Agpocalypse 2-D Game\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Screen shots of the 2-D web-based Agpocalypse video game</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Deepak Keshwani</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Deepak&nbsp;Keshwani</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Agpocalypse 2-D Game</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1639478/1639478_10457721_1671635319140_CWEBNexusModels--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1639478/1639478_10457721_1671635319140_CWEBNexusModels--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"CWEB Nexus Models\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1639478/1639478_10457721_1671635319140_CWEBNexusModels--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"CWEB Nexus Models\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Scientific models of the interconnected Corn-Water-Ethanol-Beef Nexus used to develop the Agpocalypse video game.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Deepak Keshwani</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Deepak&nbsp;Keshwani</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">CWEB Nexus Models</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1639478/1639478_10457721_1671635519212_preservationboardgame--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1639478/1639478_10457721_1671635519212_preservationboardgame--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Preservation Board Game\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1639478/1639478_10457721_1671635519212_preservationboardgame--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Preservation Board Game\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Interactive cooperative board game based on Corn-Water-Ethanol-Beef Nexus.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Deepak Keshwani</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Deepak&nbsp;Keshwani</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Preservation Board Game</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1639478/1639478_10457721_1671635995386_3Dgamescreenshots--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1639478/1639478_10457721_1671635995386_3Dgamescreenshots--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Agpocalypse Preliminary 3-D Game\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1639478/1639478_10457721_1671635995386_3Dgamescreenshots--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Agpocalypse Preliminary 3-D Game\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Screen shots from the 3-D preliminary version of the Agpocalypse video game.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Deepak Keshwani</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Deepak&nbsp;Keshwani</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Agpocalypse Preliminary 3-D Game</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
