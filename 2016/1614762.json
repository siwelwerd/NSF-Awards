 "awd_abstract_narration": "Even though spacecraft have visited the planet Venus many times, little is understood about how Venus? middle and upper atmosphere and clouds move and interact. The recent spacecraft Venus Express provides new data to consider when modeling activity in the atmosphere. The investigators will model Venus' middle and upper atmosphere using special, rigorous computer programs. For this modeling, they set the base atmospheric level to be considered as the height above Venus' surface where clouds are observed. Different types of waves will be introduced as forces at this base atmospheric level to see how they drive the circulation in the atmosphere. The new measurements from Venus Express will guide and confirm the computer modeling, making more realistic models of Venus' middle and upper atmosphere. The results of this modeling will be fed back to other scientists modeling the Earth?s atmosphere to understand climate change, thus benefiting the national interest. The investigators will also design classroom experiments related to planetary atmospheres for middle and high schools, and undergraduate and graduate college-level classes.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe dynamics and circulation of the planet Venus' atmosphere at cloud heights and above are poorly understood. In this study, the principal investigator will employ an innovative approach to modeling the dynamics of Venus' atmosphere, using a computer code based on the Community Atmosphere Model (CAM). The lower boundary of the atmosphere to be modeled is defined to begin at the height where clouds are observed above Venus' surface. Dynamical calculations will focus on this cloud-level atmosphere. Different kinds of waves will be introduced, including tides, Rossby waves, and gravity waves, to effect forces at the lower boundary of the atmosphere. New measurements from the Venus Express spacecraft mission at cloud levels and above will guide and validate the atmospheric modeling. Venus' middle and upper atmosphere can then be modeled at locations in time and space where data have not yet been measured. Adaptations of the CAM computer code for the Earth?s atmosphere resulting from this study of Venus' atmosphere will be fed back to the Earth climate research community, benefiting the national interest in understanding climate change. The investigators will design a series of STEM-related practical experiments addressing the physics of planetary atmospheres for UCLA outreach middle and high schools, and for undergraduate and graduate university classes.",

Venus is completely enshrouded in thick cloud layers and its atmosphere is still poorly understood. During this project we created a new global model of Venus' atmosphere focused on altitudes around the cloud-levels.&nbsp; Venus' clouds show a large number of anomalous features, many of which may be related to wave phonomena. We used the model to simulate waves similar to those observed in the clouds, including Kelvin and Rossby waves. Our research improved our understanding of how Venus' atmosphere works. We also used simulations to understand what the atmospheres of Venus-like exoplanets (i.e. Venus-like planets in planetary systems around other stars) might look like, which will help provide valuable information needed for the many upcoming exoplanet observing missions. During the project we also developed several kinds of demonstrations to help explain atmospheric physics to the public. One version of the demonstrations was taken out to many schools with large numbers of children from groups traditionally underrepresented in science, technology, engineering and mathemetics (STEM) fields. We left instructions and documentation and simple versions of the demonstrations with the students so they will be able to make new and inexpensive versions for themselves in the future. We also used a number of different demonstrations at large public outreach events such as the annual Exploring Your Universe (EYU) event at UCLA, to inspire and educate the general public and families. We also developed a more sophisticated version to demonstrate the principles of atmospheric convection for teaching in undergraduate and graduate classes. The classes at UCLA include a high percentage of students from traditionally underrepresented groups in STEM fields. Our work will help to stimulate public interest in the atmospheres of the Earth and other planets, and help to focus public attention on important issues such as climate change, using Venus' atmosphere as an example. Our outreach work will produce more public understanding of why we are sending out probes to attempt to observe the atmospheres of other planets and exoplanets, and will hopefully inspire the next generation of scientists to help resolve issues on our own planet and beyond.<br /><br />The first two figures show examples of simulated Kelvin and Rossby waves at cloud altitudes on Venus. The second two figures show examples of a booth at one of the large outreach events (EYU) as well as a simplified convection demonstration used at the booth. The fifth and sixth figures show the design of the more sophisticated convection experiment and a rotating Taylor column demonstration, both used in the undergraduate and graduate teaching classes. The Taylor column demonstration was also take out to schools.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 08/01/2020<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Helen&nbsp;F&nbsp;Parish</p>\n</div>\n<div
