 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the major unsolved problems in solar physics is the question regarding how the solar corona is heated to temperatures over a million degrees.  One suspected mechanism is the conversion of magnetic field energy near the Sun's surface into heat energy through the dissipation of waves and turbulence.  In this proposal, the PI will develop numerical models of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves and turbulence.  These models will allow the PI to trace the dynamical evolution of these features as they travel outward from the surface of the Sun into the outer corona.  The numerical simulations will make predictions that can be tested by high-resolution observations made by telescopes such as the Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope (DKIST).  The proposed research will support the training of the next generation of solar scientists.  The PI will involve a graduate student in the proposed work and also plans to incorporate the research into his undergraduate and graduate courses. \r\n\r\nIn this proposal, the PI proposes to construct realistic, physics-based models of MHD fluctuations traveling from the Sun?s surface into the outer corona to shed light on the problem of coronal heating.   With current observations, the dynamics of small, inter-granular, magnetic flux concentrations have been difficult, however, these structures form the seeds that eventually heat the corona to such high temperatures.  The models that the PI will produce will be used to track the inter-granular magnetic flux elements and measure their evolution as they move outward into the corona.  The models will then be used to generate observable diagnostics for telescopes like DKIST to test the MHD turbulence theory.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe corona is a layer of hot plasma that surrounds the Sun, traces out its complex magnetic field, and ultimately expands into interplanetary space as the supersonic solar wind.  Although much has been learned in recent decades from advances in observations, theory, and computer simulations, we still have not identified definitively the physical processes that heat the corona and accelerate the solar wind.  One long-standing stumbling block has been the fact that the Sun's visible surface (the \"photosphere\") and its upper layers are so different in nature: the photosphere consists of relatively small and thin (50 km sized) magnetic \"tubes,\" while in the upper layers these tubes have expanded to fill the entire corona (with sizes of hundreds of thousands of km).  These connections have not yet been properly resolved with telescopes, but if any one has a chance, it will be the new 4-meter Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope (DKIST) coming online in 2021-2022.  This NSF project aimed to pave the way toward understanding DKIST observations by producing computer models of the deep connections between the photosphere and the corona.  For example, we found new ways of measuring the total amount of magnetic energy carried by the photospheric \"tubes,\" which we hope to apply to real DKIST data when it becomes available.  Also, we realized that previous measurements of the tubes (which dealt primarily with their horizontal \"swaying\" motions) were incomplete, and need to be augmented by measuring a wider array of jello-like \"squishing\" motions.  We also studied additional measurements of magnetic swaying/squishing by space-based telescopes that are pointed at locations off to the side of the Sun's bright disk; these measurements use the Doppler effect to observe how magnetic elements are moving toward and away from us, and how they connect to other observable features in the corona.  Taken together, the simulations and measurement techniques developed from this NSF project are helping us determine how the solar corona is heated to temperatures of millions of degrees.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/20/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Steven R Cranmer"
