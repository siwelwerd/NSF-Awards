 "awd_abstract_narration": "The violent star explosions, known as supernovae, are responsible for\r\nmany features of our Universe.  They produce and distribute many of\r\nthe heavy elements that make up stars, new planets, and also people.\r\nThe energy supernovae release into the interstellar gas heats and stirs it,\r\nand some of that energy goes to accelerating a few subatomic particles\r\nto extreme energies -- the enigmatic cosmic rays that fill our Galaxy\r\nand constantly rain down on the Earth.  In the last few thousand years,\r\nseveral Galactic supernovae were visible at Earth and carefully\r\nrecorded by naked-eye observers. The remnants of those supernovae,\r\nexpanding gas clouds emitting radio waves, X-rays, and visible light,\r\ncan now be studied in detail, along with hundreds of older remnants\r\nfrom supernovae too distant to be seen on Earth with the naked\r\neye. This proposal will model the effects of supernovae that occur in \r\nsystems with two stars gravitationally bound to each other. \r\n\r\nRecent evidence suggests that many supernovae originate in binary systems, \r\npairs of stars orbiting one another.  The more massive stars shed material as they \r\nage, particularly in the stages just prior to explosion, so the explosions \r\ntake place in a complicated environment of gas.  These investigators will compute\r\nstate-of-the-art simulations of pre-supernova environments, and then model\r\nthe explosion, to see what effects it has on the appearance of the supernovae \r\nat the time of the event, and on the remnants of the events, which are still\r\nthousands of years later.  \r\n\r\nThe investigators hope to identify particular features that such supernovae\r\nand remnants might show that would be clues to the environments that\r\ngave rise to them.  In addition, a few particular objects, such as\r\nhistorical remnants from supernovae seen at Earth in the last few\r\nhundred years, will be studied, to try to identify the types of stars that \r\ncreated the explosions.\r\n\r\nThe investigators will use high-performance computing systems at national \r\nfacilities, and will train students in the most up-to-date applications of \r\ncomputing to complex problems.  Improving our understanding of supernovae adds an\r\nessential piece to the grand narrative of the nature of our Universe\r\nand the place of humanity in it.",
