 "awd_abstract_narration": "Increasingly, the data visualizations used in contemporary science and media move beyond conventional graphs or diagrams to use problem-specific imagery and computational techniques to reveal patterns of interest. K-12 students, however, do not have many opportunities to explore such data visualizations, or to author their own. The goal of this project is to design software tools and classroom materials that make exploring and authoring data visualizations accessible in middle grades classrooms. The underlying hypothesis of the project is that by exploring and constructing their own data visualizations, students can develop data literacy, learn core math and science content, and engage in key STEM practices in powerful new ways. \r\n\r\nThe project involves two interrelated strands: (1) research on grade 6-8 students' knowledge related to data visualization, and (2) the development and study of DataSketch, a tablet-based tool for students to create sketches and program them to respond to archival or live data input. Research will include interviews, studio workshops, and classroom-based studies to explore: (1) what knowledge and skills middle school students have, and need to develop, to interpret and construct data visualizations? (2) how data visualization can be integrated into the grade 6-8 STEM curriculum? and, (3) what role data visualization can contribute to middle students' learning of core STEM practices and content? \r\n\r\nPartners include two schools with historically under served student populations in the Greater Boston metro area, and teachers across the greater New England region. There are opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students studying Computer Science and Education at Tufts University to conduct research and outreach at participating middle school sites. There is potential to disseminate resulting classroom activities and software through LEGO, the Tufts Center for Engineering Education and Outreach, and iCreate to Educate.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n \nThe DataSketch Project explored middle school students' data visualization competencies. While most K-12 curricula focus on standard graphical representations, this project explored how students reason about narrative, computationally-driven visualizations that have become common in scientific communication. The research questions guiding the project were: \n\n\n\n\n\n(1) What do middle school students need to know to interpret and construct data visualizations? \n\n\n(2) How can activities that promote data visualization literacy be integrated into the grades 6-8 STEM curriculum? \n\n\n(3) What role can visualization play in how students learn scientific practices and content related to the data they are visualizing?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe project used a blend of interview, classroom, and design-based research methodologies. Early years of the project explored students' baseline strategies for reasoning with data visualizations. We did this using laboratory-based interviews and analytic approaches that attended to the interdisciplinary knowledge students were likely to bring to sensemaking. Our findings included that many students could spontaneously and comfortably re-represent data they encoutered in complex visualizations. Indeed, this was often necessary while making sense of complex visualizations because these visualizations required students to consider not only patterns in the data, but also designers' intentions, scientific content, and the coordination of temporal with distributional information--aspects of visual interpreation that are not currently a part of the standard curriculum in mathematics or science classes (Laina &amp; Wilkerson, 2016; Wilkerson &amp; Laina, 2017).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese early findings informed the development of a digital tool called DataSketch (Wilkerson, 2016). DataSketch enables users to create animated digital ink sketches, by linking visual attributes of the sketches (such as size, position, color, or transparency) to time-series data. DataSketch allowed us to more deeply explore students' understandings of computational data-driven visualizations by allowing them to create their own. Using novel longitudinal, repeated interview methods (Wilkerson, Shareff, &amp; Laina, in press) we found that students' understandings of the purposes of data visualization dramatically impact what types of visualizations they produce (Laina &amp; Wilkerson, 2019). This suggests that instruction about data visualization should include an intentional focus on the many epistemic roles visualization can play in scientific practice, and that educators consider how students' perceptions of the purposes of visualization may impact how they use and create visualizations in classroom contexts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the later years of the project, we led a week long professional learning workshop to introduce science teachers to tools and techniques for data visualization in the science classroom. The workshop yielded professional learning materials including case studies and pedagogical models for teaching complex datasets in the classroom which we are finalizing to make public. Following the workshop, we partnered with several teachers to enact classroom activities where students used visualization tools including the Common Online Data Analysis Platform (CODAP) to analyze multivariate datasets associated with complex scientific phenomena such as ecosystem dynamics and the recent California drought. We developed methods for jigsaw-like approaches to analyzing datasets (Wilkerson, et al. 2019), and began to develop a theoretical approach to understanding students' \"agentive use of data\" (Lopez, Wilkerson, &amp; Laina, 2019) in scientific investigation. One promising finding from this work was that students often engage in an intermediate stage of reasoning from data, which we have termed \"data claims\" (Wilkerson, Lopez, &amp; Jamarillo, 2020). We found that while teachers may dismiss such claims as descriptive rather than explanatory (especially because they do not fit the traditional Claims-Evidence-Reasoning model for scientific explanation/argumentation, they are a necessary step for many students in the process of linking complex data to multicausal or high-inference scientific relationships.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe are currently in the process of disseminating many of the findings and materials generated from this project. So far, scholarly products emerging from this work include 1 journal special issue; 1 peer-reviewed journal article with 2 in progress; 2 published book chapters with 1 in progress; 2 invited reports; and 12 conference presentations. We have incorporated activities and data from the DataSketch project into coursework with CalTeach (pre-service teacher credential) students at UC Berkeley. Design principles (including criteria for productive scientific datasets, methods of introducing students to the CODAP tool, and treatment of curricular content) and theoretical constructs (including \"epistemic data agency\") from this project have informed subsequent research including our work on the current  NSF-funded Writing Data Stories project.\n\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/30/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Michelle Wilkerson"
