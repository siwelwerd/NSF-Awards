 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Next Generation of STEM Teacher Preparation project is led by five institutions of higher education in Washington State.  This collaborative effort will engage institutions involved in the preparation of teachers of STEM disciplines, Washington State's Office of the Superintendent of Public Instruction, P-12 educators, and other key stakeholders from business, government, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs), in bringing about statewide sustainable change in the preparation of STEM teachers at all levels.  The project moves away from isolated, single institutional program improvement efforts, to colleges and universities in Washington State working collaboratively to improve STEM teacher preparation in partnership with two-year colleges, P-12 schools, community groups, and businesses. The project will result in the production of more, highly qualified, P-12 science and mathematics teachers, including a new cadre of teachers prepared to teach computer science and engineering. In addition, the project seeks to increase the diversity of the STEM teacher workforce by actively recruiting and incentivizing underrepresented students from STEM majors at 2- and 4-year colleges to become P-12 middle and high school STEM teachers.  Financial support for this project comes from NSF's Improving Undergraduate Education program and the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program.\r\n\r\nThe project's primary goals are: \r\n1.\tTo improve STEM teacher preparation programs in Washington State (impacting greater than 90% of the state's future STEM teacher graduates,\r\n2.\tIncrease recruitment of qualified and diverse STEM students into teaching, and\r\n3.\tCreate an adaptive, research-based model for improving STEM teacher preparation through collaboration. \r\nTo achieve these goals, the project will: (a) create a common vision for STEM teacher preparation in Washington State, (b) share, develop, adapt, implement, and evaluate resources and models to achieve this vision, and (c) build and assess a model of continuous, collaborative program improvement. The critical components of teacher preparation this project will address include:  improving pre-service teachers' clinical practice and new teachers' induction experiences, improving the disciplinary and STEM pedagogical content knowledge of pre-service teachers, and integrating computer science, engineering, and sustainability into teacher preparation. Cross-institutional Working Groups dedicated to improving each component will research, create, and produce a set of materials and professional development workshops. Regional Teams of faculty and administrators from institutions of higher education, P-12 educators, and representatives from STEM businesses, NGOs, and government agencies, will in turn adapt these materials and professional development experiences to support and sustain STEM teacher preparation program improvements at their institutions. Three capacity-building components: organizational change, increasing the diversity of the STEM teaching workforce, and collaboration building, will underlie the efforts of every Working Group and Regional Team.",
