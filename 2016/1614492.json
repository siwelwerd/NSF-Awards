 "awd_abstract_narration": "New \"integral field spectrographs\" (IFS) allow astronomers to get spectra of exoplanets, or planets found around other stars. Until now, these spectra have covered wavelengths in the near infrared at 1 - 2 microns. Most gas-giant exoplanets generate their own power that peaks in energy in the thermal infrared at longer wavelengths. This research group has built the world's first thermal infrared IFS. The Arizona Lenslets for Exoplanet Spectroscopy (ALES) is installed on the 2x8.4m Large Binocular Telescope in Arizona. This project will use the ALES to obtain 3 - 4 micron spectra of 10 gas-giant exoplanets. The spectra will be combined with near-infrared spectra in order to compare and contrast the properties of the gas-giant exoplanets, including temperature, the properties of clouds, and different chemistry. This project serves the national interest by significantly advancing our scientific knowledge of the properties of gas-giant exoplanets. The investigators will teach two math classes each year at the Santa Cruz County Jail, so that each year, nine students will get college credit for a college algebra class. They will also talk about their science to the public.\r\n\r\nAdaptive optics integral field spectrographs (IFS) have enabled spectroscopic characterization of directly-imaged exoplanets. These instruments have, however, been limited to near-infrared wavelengths (1 - 2 microns), while the spectral energy distributions of gas giant exoplanets that generate their own spectral signal peak in the thermal infrared (>3 microns). As a result, most directly-imaged exoplanets already have near-infrared spectra, but none has a thermal infrared spectrum. Spectroscopic characterization over a broad wavelength range is critical for determining the bulk properties of extrasolar planets. This project will obtain 3 - 4 micron spectra of a large number of exoplanets, and, in the process, develop a cohesive sample of exoplanet spectra that can be used for comparative planetology. This research group has built the world's first thermal infrared IFS. The Arizona Lenslets for Exoplanet Spectroscopy (ALES) is installed on the 2x8.4m Large Binocular Telescope. It provides integral field spectroscopy from 3 - 4 microns at the spectral resolution, sensitivity and contrast levels required to characterize directly-imaged exoplanets. Using ALES, the investigators will obtain 3 - 4 micron spectra of 10 exoplanets, which they will analyze in combination with existing near-infrared data. The broad wavelength coverage will allow them to refine exoplanet atmosphere models by breaking degeneracies between temperature, cloud properties, and non-equilibrium chemistry. The investigators will offer two math classes per year at the Santa Cruz County Jail, resulting in ~9 students receiving college credit for a college algebra class. They will also include public talks on their science.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nWe know that nearly every star in the sky is orbited by at least one planet. These planets come in a wide variety of sizes and masses spanning ranges far greater than found in our own Solar System. A major goal of our research is to measure the properties of giant planets to better understand the phases of planet formation and evolution. This program focused on massive gas giants in orbits comparable to or larger than those of the giant planets in our Solar System. Such planets are favorable targets for the spectroscopic methods we use.\n\n\nOur study used a new instrument, the Arizona Lenslets for Exoplanet Science (ALES) mounted on the Large Binocular Telescope, that was designed for measuring the spectrum of a giant planet across infrared wavelengths. This new instrument, our observing strategy, and our careful data processing techniques allowed us to separate star light from planet light. Through the course of our program, we observed many previously known planetary systems including the famous multi-planet system orbiting the young star HR8799. We also observed new discoveries, including one orbiting a star in the young Hyades cluster. Members of our team also discovered a new very young planet just a few million years old and this system was observed with ALES as part of our program.\n\n\nThe planet spectra we collected were compared to theoretical atmosphere model predictions. These models combine a wide range of atmospheric physics and chemistry along with a detailed simulation of the transfer of radiation through a planets atmosphere. By finding models that closely match our data we inferred many of the planets bulk properties. These properties included total brightness, size and surface gravity. At very young ages, these bulk properties tell us about the earliest conditions in a giant planets evolution. We also used spectroscopy to infer additional atmospheric properties such as the run of temperature with height, the abundance of trace species (water, methane, carbon monoxide, etc.) and the properties of atmospheric clouds.\n\n\nBetter constraints on the atmosphere properties also allowed us to estimate the abundances of important molecules in several planet atmospheres. For this part of our work, we combined ALES observations with data taken at shorter wavelengths using additional telescopes and instruments. In particular, the abundances of carbon and oxygen bearing molecules offer the potential to better understand atmospheric mixing. In a few cases, we were able to also estimate the carbon-to-oxygen ratio, a quantity that has connections to a planets formation and early evolution.\n\n\nOur work has demonstrated that constraints on the fundamental physical properties of giant planets are essential for accurate determination of cloud parameters in atmosphere models. The level of cloudiness in a giant planet atmosphere has a huge impact on the predicted spectrum and, thus, the properties we infer. Consequently, any additional constraints that can be placed on the planet (e.g., surface gravity and temperature) can greatly reduce the range of possible cloud scenarios we must explore. In most cases, when the clouds are carefully constrained by observations covering a broad range of wavelengths (as enabled by ALES), we find good agreement between atmosphere models and theoretical calculations that, for a given mass and compositions, predict how a planets size and total brightness change with time. Consistency between independent atmosphere and evolution calculations is an important step toward understanding the formation mechanisms of giant planets and how planets orbiting other stars compare to our Jupiter and Saturn.\n\n\nAs the objects we study cover an increasing range of masses and ages, the types of observation-model comparisons we are conducting will continue to tighten the constraints on the planet formation and evolution processes. Our work has had a large influence on the refinement of atmosphere and evolutionary models for all types of cool substellar companions. Furthermore, our program has been helpful for guiding the analysis of recent JWST observations and the planning of future programs like ours.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/29/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: TravisBarman\n"
