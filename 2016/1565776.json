 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry Division supports the project by Professor William J. Evans of the Department of Chemistry at the University of California, Irvine, to investigate chemical compounds that contain the rare earth metals, i.e. scandium, yttrium, and the lanthanides.  Molecules and materials that contain these metals are important for technologies such as energy efficient lighting and magnetic devices, and they have been designated strategic materials by the U.S. Government.  Professor Evans is using the special properties of the rare earth metals to discover new methods to accomplish one of the most fundamental types of chemical reaction, reduction chemistry.  He is also trying to improve the performance of the world's smallest (i.e., molecular) magnets. This project simultaneously involves training the next generation of scientists to study these critically important metals and involves personnel from groups commonly underrepresented in science. The myriad uses of the rare earth elements in everyday technologies are providing an excellent basis for outreach programs at all educational levels. \r\n\r\nProfessor Evans is building upon the recent discovery of new oxidation states for seven rare earth elements in the first molecular complexes of Y2+, Ho2+, Er2+, Tb2+, Pr2+, Gd2+, and Lu2+.  The electronic structure of these ions with mixed principal quantum number 4fn5d1 electron configurations is being modeled using computational methods. The generality of obtaining new oxidation states with coordination environments that allow higher-lying orbitals to be populated is being explored synthetically.  Because new oxidation states expand opportunities to do redox chemistry, Professor Evans is examining the reaction chemistry and photochemistry of these complexes.  The mixed electron configuration of these compounds may lead to an unusual combination of transition metal and rare earth chemistry.  The influence of the mixed configuration on physical properties of the compounds is also being studied, because the Ho2+ complex has the highest magnetic susceptibility, 11.4 mu-B, ever observed for a monometallic complex.  In general the researchers are using synthetic approaches to explore fundamental aspects of reductive reactivity, oxidation state diversity, and magnetism from new perspectives. Students from diverse backgrounds are currently involved in the project, and the participants are spending time in outreach activities directed towards broadening the participation of underrepresented groups in STEM fields.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe goal of this project was to utilize the unique properties of the rare-earth metals which are defined as scandium, yttrium, and the lanthanide metals, i.e. lanthanum, cerium, praseodymium, neodymium, samarium, europium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, holmium, erbium, thulium, ytterbium and lutetium, to make advances in one of the two basic reaction types in chemistry.  This general type of reaction, redox chemistry (for reduction-oxidation) is of widespread importance in our lives and is involved in everything from respiration to rusting.  Redox processes also are involved in solar water splitting (to generate hydrogen cleanly for use as a fuel) and dinitrogen reduction to ammonia (for fertilizer to grow the food that feeds the world).  These reactions must be better developed to solve global problems involving increasing amounts of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.  This project focused on rare-earth metals since they represent extremes among the elements in the periodic table and constitute an excellent set of metals for exploring the limits of reactivity. \n\nIt was also a goal of this project to train the next generation of scientists experienced in the chemistry of the rare-earth metals.  Since these metals are designated as critical national resources due to their importance to energy, national security, defense, and the economy and the concerns about global supply, it is necessary to have experts trained in this area.  These metals are essential components in energy-efficient lighting, wind turbines, electric vehicles, and any device containing a magnet.\n\nThis project involved the exploration of new forms of the rare-earth metals in which they have +2 oxidation states, i.e. the elemental metals have lost two electrons to be +2 ions.  One fundamental characteristic of any metal is the extent to which it loses electrons to form charged species in different oxidation states.  Extensive testing has established the limits of available oxidation states of all of the elements.  For 90 years, most of the rare earth metals only would form +3 ions.  As part of this project, new +2 ions of seven rare-earth elements were discovered:  yttrium, praseodymium, gadolinium, terbium, holmium, erbium, and lutetium.  It was surprising to find these seven new oxidation states after decades in which all chemists thought they could not be isolated.  This project was designed to determine the properties of these new ions and their implications in chemistry in general.  Since the range of oxidation states is critical to the redox chemistry of an element, the expansion of oxidation states that occurred in this project allowed exploration of a broadly applied reaction type, redox chemistry, in new ways.\n\nThe discovery of these new oxidation states revealed that it was possible for the rare-earth metals to adopt a different electronic structure, i.e. the arrangement of electrons around the nucleus, from what had been previously known.  The results taught us that if we synthesized molecules with the proper geometry, a new electronic configuration was possible that allowed isolation of new oxidation states.  The new electronic configuration was a blend of that found in the rare-earth metals and in transition metals like titanium.  The results from this project forced us to change the way we think about the chemistry of the rare-earth metals and also raised interesting questions on a broader scale about reduction chemistry, oxidation states, electron configurations, and molecular magnetism.\n\nThe new electronic configurations have led to metal complexes with the highest magnetism ever observed for mono-metallic complexes.  The new +2 oxidation states of dysprosium and holmium are more magnetic than any other metal ions.  These two new ions offer the possibility of making more powerful, energy-efficient magnets.  If this can be realized, this will have broad implications.\n\nThe new electronic configurations have also led to new types of reactivity.  For example, it has been found that a common cyclic molecule, tetrahydrofuran, which has four carbon atoms and one oxygen atom in a ring, can be \"ring-opened\" in a new way to make a linear molecule.  Ring-opening reactions are important in getting the most use out of heavy petroleum and coal.\n\nIt is worth noting that all of these discoveries were made from a project that initially had a completely different target.  These results arose from studies of nitrogen fixation.  These breakthroughs were not research targets because it was thought that no new oxidation states could be discovered and the maximum in magnetic properties for a metal had already been achieved. Fortunately, they were revealed in the study of the reduction of dinitrogen.  \n\nThe discoveries in the new oxidation state area have in turn led to new dinitrogen chemistry.  New complexes of reduced dinitrogen have been discovered and found to be photo-active, i.e. they can be activated by light.  The rare-earth metals generally do not participate in photochemical processes, so this opens up a new avenue to use sunlight in the chemistry of the rare-earth metals. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/07/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: William J Evans"
