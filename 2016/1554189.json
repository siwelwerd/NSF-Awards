 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) grant will investigate a novel process to perform nanoscale patterning at high speed and low cost. Nanoscale patterning is the key process of defining critical dimensions and geometries mainly used to manufacture important semiconductor products such as microprocessors and data storage devices. Many studies have shown that nanoscale patterning has the potential to revolutionize the functions of a broad range of products that we use in our daily lives. However tools for mass production of these devices usually cost tens of millions of U.S. dollars each and are affordable only to the established semiconductor industry. This award supports fundamental research to provide needed knowledge for the development of a new low-cost process for nanoscale patterning, which will enable mass production of new kinds of nanotechnology-enabled products for a wide variety of applications in energy, healthcare, civil, defense and security. Nominally called \"pattern-on-the-fly\", the method involves scanning an array of electrical or optical probes at high speed to form nanostructures of various geometries on a substrate. The results of this research will provide economical access to untapped tiny length scales in many applications with significant impacts on U.S. economy and society. This research involves several disciplines including manufacturing, optics, chemistry, and materials science. This award will create a multi-disciplinary environment to help broaden participation of underrepresented groups in research and positively impact engineering education.\r\n\r\nNanoscale fabrication using scanning probes has proliferated with diverse techniques and varying degrees of maturity. The capability of scanning probe arrays at high speed can transform the unique strength of scanning probe-based techniques into a scalable nanomanufacturing technology. However, several fundamental and technical barriers are yet to be overcome to achieve this transformation, including circumventing the optical diffraction limit, fast scanning of probe arrays and operating of probes at high power. Some of the barriers are also common to other nanoscale patterning processes as they need to overcome their throughput bottlenecks by utilizing a massive number of parallel patterning devices at high speed and high power. This research is to fill the knowledge gap on the mechanisms of nanoscale pattern generation using high-speed probe arrays. The optical coupling principle uses mismatched surface plasmons and lightning-rod effects to achieve efficient energy concentration at nanoscale. The research team will perform integrated numerical and experimental studies to understand the microscopic mechanisms driven by strong energy input at nanoscale, design and implement the high-speed scanning of probe arrays for high throughput and fine resolution patterning, and demonstrate the feasibility and compatibility of this new process for targeted applications.",

Nowadays, magnetic data storage devices, such as hard disk drives, provide the majority of capacity, because of their advantages of capacity, cost, and reliability. High-capacity magnetic data storage has been essential for many US flagship businesses, data centers, and national security. However the ultimate storage capacity of current generation devices is fundamentally limited, and there is still a lack of mature technology to deliver the next-generation products. Lithography can help to provide the long-term solution to achieve high capacity by patterning the recording medium bit by bit into circular tracks. Although a few niche lithography technologies are used to research this task, it is yet impossible to create a low-cost manufacturing process to reduce the gulf of cost by several orders of magnitudes for mass production. In this NSF project, our research team invented the pattern-on-the-fly technology to direct writing nanoscale circular patterns at high speed on a spinning substrate (Figure 1). This pattern-on-the-fly technology can provide a natural way to fabricate low-cost patterns onto the media surface. The team designed and implemented a first-of-its-kind patterning head that can surf on a fast-moving surface covered with a liquid layer of 10-nm thick (Figure 2). By using an intense electric field across this nanoscale liquid layer (Figure 3), the team uses energetic electrons to locally excite liquids into solid structures and form nanoscale patterns at a 10-nm scale (Figure 4). This new method can be used to perform lithography in mass quantities without the need for expensive photomasks (Figure 5). During the life of this NSF Award, the research team investigated the fundamentals of nanoscale ultrafast patterning mechanism, design and fabricated a proof-of-concept device capable of scanning an array of probes at 10 m/s speed, study device response, and implement the device into their prototype lithography system to demonstrate lithography. The research team has successfully demonstrated the patterning at a 15-nm resolution in a university laboratory setting, which promises sub-10 nm features for high-volume nanomanufacturing in industrial applications.</p>\n<p>Intellectual Merit:&nbsp;It provided a scalable maskless patterning technology and enabled the process capability to bridge top-down and bottom-up schemes for full-device hetero-nanomanufacturing. The fundamental study in this project intensified our understandings of the nanoscale coupling and transport physics during the strong field-matter interaction. The immediate scientific outcomes also include a first-of-its-type multiphysics numerical tool to predict and design the scalable maskless patterning processes and a new experimental technique to enable non-invasive temperature probing at high spatial resolution.</p>\n<p>Broader Impacts:&nbsp;Research from this project helped to strengthen the U.S. leadership in the manufacturing research for future data-technology growth, and directly and indirectly impacted many high-tech areas. This work created an education pipeline for nanomanufacturing in a multidisciplinary and collaborative environment and provided new knowledge and young researchers in this field.&nbsp; Through the integration of research and education, the project provided training of the high-tech workforce in nanomanufacturing, and reach out to the underrepresented populations.&nbsp; Also, many undergraduate students participated in this research through the NSF's REU program and independent study programs.&nbsp; The Award also helped the research team to actively engage in nanotechnology education for K-12 groups.&nbsp; Results of the project have been broadly disseminated through scientific publications, participation at meetings of professional societies.&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/19/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Liang&nbsp;Pan</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1554189/1554189_10406665_1639932421863_Fig1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1554189/1554189_10406665_1639932421863_Fig1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1554189/1554189_10406665_1639932421863_Fig1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The pattern-on-the-fly technology to direct writing nanoscale circular patterns at high speed on a spinning substrate</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Liang Pan</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Liang&nbsp;Pan</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 1</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1554189/1554189_10406665_1639932475308_Fig2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1554189/1554189_10406665_1639932475308_Fig2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 2\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1554189/1554189_10406665_1639932475308_Fig2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 2\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A first-of-its-kind patterning head that can surf on a fast-moving surface covered with a liquid layer of 10-nm thick.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Liang Pan</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Liang&nbsp;Pan</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 2</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1554189/1554189_10406665_1639932558287_Fig3--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1554189/1554189_10406665_1639932558287_Fig3--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 3\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1554189/1554189_10406665_1639932558287_Fig3--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 3\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">By using an intense electric field across this nanoscale liquid layer, liquids are converted into solid structures.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Liang Pan</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Liang&nbsp;Pan</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 3</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1554189/1554189_10406665_1639932610961_Fig4--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1554189/1554189_10406665_1639932610961_Fig4--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 4\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1554189/1554189_10406665_1639932610961_Fig4--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 4\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The obtained nanoscale patterns at the 10-nm scale.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Liang Pan</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Liang&nbsp;Pan</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 4</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1554189/1554189_10406665_1639932667507_Fig5--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1554189/1554189_10406665_1639932667507_Fig5--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 5\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1554189/1554189_10406665_1639932667507_Fig5--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 5\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The team performed lithography in a large scale without the need for expensive photomasks.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Liang Pan</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Liang&nbsp;Pan</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 5</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
