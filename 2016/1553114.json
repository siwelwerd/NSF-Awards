 "awd_abstract_narration": "Evolutionary biologists have long recognized that species can evolve many different forms (phenotypes) using the same sets of genes.  One explanation for this pattern is that new forms can arise by changes in gene regulation, that is, shifts in when and where those genes are active.  Although regulatory differences are known to underlie changes in features as complex as eyes and wings, it remains unclear how broadly this regulatory hypothesis applies and whether, in some cases, changes in the genes themselves are more important. This project will address this question by tracing the evolutionary changes involved in flower color transitions across Petunieae, a group of 140 species that includes the ornamental petunias.  The genes that produce floral pigments are well studied, making it possible to characterize the genetic changes associated with flower color evolution even at this broad scale.  As a part of this work, the researchers will create and present color-themed activities to diverse groups of K-12 students and undergraduates in order to enhance teaching and learning about the connections between genes, pathways, and phenotypes across the tree of life.\r\n\r\nThis project will test the role of regulatory evolution in the color diversification of Petunieae through three specific aims. The first aim will infer the history of flower color shifts in the clade using a new phylogeny constructed from transcriptomic data. Building on this phylogenetic framework, the second aim will use comparative methods and biochemical profiling to quantify the evolutionary relationship between changes in the expression of pigment pathway genes and color variation. Given the modular nature of the regulation of these genes, the third aim will test for correlated evolution of gene expression across the phylogeny. These aims will be carried out through collaborations with botanists from Brazil and Argentina, who will participate in research exchanges to foster the sharing of knowledge and techniques. At a local scale, the research activities will be integrated into outreach events as well as inquiry-based course modules for undergraduates and upward-bound high school students. These innovative teaching approaches will be coupled with new tools to assess learning gains and guide improvement.",

These different colors result from the production of plant pigments, such as the yellow and orange carotenoids and the pink, purple and red anthocyanins, which vary in presence and amount across species. This project used the natural diversity in flower color among petunias and their wild relatives to determine how species alter pigment production to create new colors. We tested the hypothesis that color shifts are mainly due to changes in which genes are expressed (i.e., regulatory variation) as opposed to how they work (i.e., gene function). We found that, indeed, white-flowered species possess all of the genetic information to produce pigments, but they express these genes at low levels compared to their colorful relatives. Still, we identified a few cases in which flower color change has involved evolutionary changes in gene function in addition to the levels of expression. Overall, the finding that new flower colors typically evolve without changing the underlying genetic toolkit helps to explain why flower color is one of nature's most rapidly evolving traits. Our results were the collective effort of 26 trainees and three collaborating labs in other countries and were shared through 14 publications in addition to numerous scientific talks. Our research demonstrated the power of cross-species comparisons for discovering how genetic changes lead to observable phenotypic differences and provided a robust new phylogenetic framework for petunias, the best selling garden flower in america.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>We coupled this interdisciplinary research program with multiple educational initiatives to expand the impact of the award.

Participants in the research also created hands-on experiments for K-12 students that were shared through local events at libraries and museums as well as in rural outreach centers. Finally, we created course modules for Upward Bound high schoolers and undergraduate students that used flower color as a gateway into exploring plant diversity and biochemistry. These activities created a community of teaching and learning around flower color and plant bioology, with students who first participated as high schoolers returning to share their knowledge as teaching assistants and take part in research internships.
