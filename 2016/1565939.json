 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project funded by the Chemical Theory, Models and Computational Methods program in the Division of Chemistry, Professor Michael Galperin, of the University of California, San Diego, is developing new methods to provide the theoretical framework to simulate the behavior of nanoscale devices. Interest in such systems stems from their technological promise and fundamental physical properties. The goal of the project is to resolve one of the central challenges of theoretical chemistry: accurate prediction of the electronic properties of nanoscale systems and their response to external perturbations. This can lead to an understanding of such devices at the molecular level with predictive theory. The results are central in developing memory and logic molecular devices, molecule-based sensors, photovoltaics for solar conversion and new types of electronics.  The ability of the research to interconnect different scientific communities allows students involved in the project to participate in a flexible curriculum, thus preparing them to work in either fundamental or applied sciences, in academy or in national labs, in one of the fields or at interfaces of many-body theory, molecular spectroscopy, and computational quantum chemistry.\r\n\r\nTheoretical simulations of nanoscale open non-equilibrium systems mostly employ single-particle basis functions (e.g. orbitals as in the non-equilibrium Green function density functional theory (NEGF-DFT) approach). These approaches allow treatment of systems of realistic sizes, but become inconvenient in treating strong intra-system interactions. An alternative approach, the non-equilibrium atomic limit (e.g. the pseudoparticle (PP) or Hubbard NEGF), utilizes many-body states of the isolated system as a basis, which allows accounting for the system interactions. The applicability of such formulations is limited to relatively small systems. The project develops a methodology, the non-equilibrium divide-and-conquer method, which capitalizes on the strong sides of both methodologies: the NEGF-DFT ability to treat big systems and the PP and Hubbard NEGF ability to account for strong local interactions exactly. Partitioning of the original system (either in real or state space) is utilized with the parts treated by either single-particle or many-body states approaches. This extends the usual divide-and-conquer methodology to the realm of open non-equilibrium quantum systems.  The results are central in developing memory and logic molecular devices, molecule-based sensors, photovoltaics for solar conversion and new types of electronics.",

Realistic systems are too big to allow for direct application of sophisticated computational methods. The situation is even more involved when dealing with open systems far from equilibirum (nanoscale devices). Divide-and-conquer techniques which cut the system, treat each part with appropriate level of theory (low level for weakly interacting parts, more advanced - for subsystems with strong local interactions) and glue the parts back to get the overall solution are a way to build theoretical methods for realistic systems. A numerically inexpensive but highly accurate and universal impurity sover is at the heart of such embedding techniques. Two main outcomes of our project are formulations and developments of new Green's function based nonequilibrium techniques (NEGF) to be utilized as impurity solvers for strongly interacting parts of the nonequilibirum system. These are the Hubbard NEGF and dual techniques for quanutm transport.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>The Hubbard NEGF</strong> is an accurate (at the same level of perturbative expansion) alternative to the solver utilized now within the nonequilibrium dyanmical mean field theory - the pseudoparticle (PP-) NEGF. It is applicable in the situation when intra-system interactions are strong, while coupling of the system to surroundings is weak (but not negligible). Such nonequilibrium atomic limit tool is perfect for analysis of experimental data on nanoscale optoelectronic devices, where both transport (e.g., conductance or noise) and optical response (e.g., fluorescence or Raman spectrum) are recorded simultaneously. We applied the method to analyse experimental measurements of photocurrent and ectroluminiscence in single molecule junctions. Another direction, where the Hubbard NEGF is important is theoretical studies of nonadiabatic molecular dynamics. In particular, we presented general derivation of current induced nuclear forces and showed that electronic friction (which is expressed in terms of the Hubbard NEGF) can be effectively evaluated with accuracy far beyond previously employed mean-field NEGF and/or Head-Gordon and Tully approaches. Finally, we demonstrated that the Hubbard NEGF allows to connect rate (electron transfer) and transport methods, indicate pitfalls of the usually employed golden rule (and foruth order) rate expressions, and formulate ways to build generalized rate expressions employing the nonequilibirum Hubbard diagrammatic technique introduced by us within the project.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Dual methods </strong>is another advancement which allows to formulate universal impurity solver (i.e. a tool applicable in any parameetr range) which is on par in accuracy with numerically exact techniques for a fraction of numerical cost of the latter. In limits of weak intra-system interaction or weak system-baths couplings the method reduced to standard NEGF and atomic limit (e.g., Hubbard NEGF), respectively. Contrary to numerically exact approaches, dual methods have significant potential to be developed so tha tthey become applicable in ab inito simulations. We developed to auxiliary quantum master equation flavors of teh dual methods: dual fermion (aux-DF) and dual boson (aux-DB). Teh former iaccount for electron transport, while the latter extends the treatment to account for energy (e.g. electronic excitation or photon) transport as well. Aux-DF is an efficient variant of original DF formulation significantly improving the latter by making it fast and numerically inexpensive of the original DF fomrulation. We are the first to formulate the Aux-DB. Viability of the two approaches was demonstrated by test simulations within generic junction models (Anderson impurity and Anderson-Holstein models), where teh methods were tested against numerically exact benchmarks. Currently we are working on applying the methods beyond simple models.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">During the project three postdocs (Dr. Yi Gao, Dr. Maicol A.
