 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator and his colleagues study large investors in complex financial instruments.  Additionally, he considers the market for mortgage-backed securities, focusing on both how fair mortgage rates are determined, and how to improve the traditional mortgage contract by taking into account the negative effects of house price decline.  For the large investor analysis, the investigator seeks to answer the basic question of why a financial institution would take a large position in a derivative contract when the contract itself carries inherent risks.  What about the investor and underlying market would induce such behavior?  Could the investor find a willing counter-party to transact with and why?  What are the feedback effects which arise from taking a large position?  For the mortgage-backed security analysis, the investigator shows that current mathematical models can determine fair mortgage origination rates.  As these rates are typically computed using ad-hoc methods, the analysis provides both a deeper understanding of the sensitivities of such rates on broader economic factors, and a valuable tool for predicting future rates.  Lastly, the investigator studies recent proposals for adjusting the traditional mortgage contract to mitigate the \"underwater\" effect of buyers selectively defaulting on their loans in the event of house price decline.  Such defaults impose significant costs on the lending institutions as well as the broader economy.  Though various mechanisms have been suggested, rigorous proofs showing the viability, or superiority, of a given method are lacking.  Such proofs will help identify which proposal should be introduced into the marketplace.  Graduate students are involved in the work of the project.\r\n\r\n     The investigator uses modern tools from stochastic analysis to understand large investors in derivatives markets.  In particular, the theory of large deviations is appropriate, as large investors have acute sensitivities to rare events when hedging strategies fail, and large investors are seen to arise endogenously in the asymptotically complete setting where hedging errors vanish.  Developing new large deviations results, as well as using theories of optimal investment and equilibrium in incomplete markets, he shows how large positions arise and describes the resultant equilibrium.  Lastly, since large positions may induce feedback effects such as price impact, the investigator studies whether these effects are so severe as to preclude the existence of large investors in the first place.  For the mortgage-backed security analysis, the investigator uses modern functional analysis to prove existence of fair mortgage rates for agency-backed pools of residential mortgages, taking both prepayment and default into account.  Additionally, he uses the theories of continuous time optimal stopping and partial differential equations to investigate proposed changes to the traditional mortgage contract.  The goal is to show that these changes either do or do not effectively reduce the homeowner's incentive to selectively default on her loan in the event her house price has declined.",

The goal was to identify if it is ever optimal for a financial institution to take large positions in derivatives, when the institution faces price impact hedging the derivative with the underlying assets. The investigator showed that, somewhat surprisingly, it can in fact be optimal to take large positions.

Here, the investigator and his colleagues considered a dynamic trading model with an insider who receives a private signal about the assets\u2019 value at a future time. The goals are to determine what portion of the signal is passed along to the market through the insider\u2019s trading actions, and what the effect of the private signal has on asset prices.  The investigator showed that in equilibrium a noisy version of the private signal is passed to market, and this signal creates endogenous demand for derivative securities.

Here, the investigator and his collaborators both established the existence of current coupons (mortgage rates which lead to par valued mortgage pools) in commonly used industry models and analyzed recently proposed changes to the traditional mortgage contract.  Regarding the latter project, the recent housing crisis inspired several economists to propose adjustments, to the traditional fixed rate mortgage contract, which lower payments in the event of area-wide house price decline.  The investigator analyzed three specific contract types.  Using stochastic methods related to optimal stopping, it was shown that while adjusting the mortgage balance downward is effective at preventing strategic homeowner default, the prepayment penalties often built into these contracts are ineffective.  As such, the best contract only adjusts the balance downward, and this contract removes the default incentive while being competitive with the traditional mortgage (in terms of value to the bank) at relatively low mortgage rate spreads.\n\nIn terms of broader impact, the investigator enlisted the help of both post-doctoral associates and PhD students in completing the above research program.
