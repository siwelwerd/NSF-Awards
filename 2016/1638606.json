 "awd_abstract_narration": "An apparent, but untested result of changes to the urban landscape is the homogenization of cities, such that neighborhoods in very different parts of the country increasingly exhibit similar patterns in their road systems, residential lots, commercial sites, and aquatic areas; cities have now become more similar to each other than to the native ecosystems that they replaced. This research builds on the team?s prior NSF funded research on the ?ecological homogenization? of the ?American Residential Macrosystem (ARM)? and specifically investigates factors that contribute to stability and/or changes in the ARM. The aim is to determine how factors that effect change?such as shifts in human demographics, desires for biodiversity and water conservation, regulations that govern water use and quality, and dispersal of organisms?will interact with factors that contribute to stability such as social norms, property values, neighborhood and city covenants and laws, and commercial interests. The project will determine ecological implications of alternative futures of the ARM for the assembly of ecological communities, ecosystem function, and responses to environmental change and disturbance at parcel (ecosystem), landscape (city), regional (Metropolitan Statistical Area) and continental scales. Five types of residential parcels as well as embedded semi-natural interstitial ecosystems will be studied, across six U.S. cities (Boston, Baltimore, Miami, Minneapolis-St. Paul, Phoenix, and Los Angeles). Education and outreach work will focus on K-12 teachers and students and on collaborative policy efforts with city, county, and state environmental managers.\r\n\r\nThis project investigates urbanization?s impact on the ecological homogenization of the American Residential Macrosystem (ARM) in terms of plant biodiversity, soil carbon and nitrogen cycle pools and processes, microclimate, hydrography, and land cover. This similarity of ecological characteristics is driven by complex and dynamic human actions at multiple scales?e.g., parcel, neighborhood, and region?that will shape the structure and function of the ARM over 50 to 100 year time frames, with potentially significant continental scale effects on ecological processes and environmental quality. This research addresses two core questions. First, what factors contribute to maintenance and change in the ARM? While this macrosystem is a relatively homogeneous mixture of grass lawns, shrubs, trees and impervious surfaces, there is a critical need to determine how drivers of change such as shifts in human population and ethnicity, increasing desires for biodiversity and water conservation, and regulations governing water use and quality will interact with stabilizing factors such as social norms, property values, neighborhood and city covenants and laws, and commercial interests. Researchers will test the hypothesis that that although dispersal from natural and interstitial areas, climate change, and changes in homeowner knowledge will promote ecological change; institutions, norms and values will function as counteracting, stabilizing forces on these ecological dynamics. This hypothesis will be tested by evaluating the factors that motivate change and stability at multiple scales. Results will be used to produce quantitative, data-based scenarios of future land-use patterns in the ARM. Second, what are the ecological implications of alternative futures of this macrosystem for community assembly and ecosystem function at parcel (ecosystem), landscape (city), regional (Metropolitan Statistical Area), and continental scales?  The hypothesis to be tested is that management that promotes nutrient- and water-use efficient and wildlife-supporting plants as well as lower inputs of water and nutrients will give rise to greater regional biodiversity across trophic levels, higher nutrient retention, lower water use, and reduced runoff and losses of soil carbon and nitrogen from residential yards at the regional scale. Five types of residential parcels that vary in management goals and intensity and embedded semi-natural interstitial ecosystems will be studied in six U.S. cities across the U.S. (Boston, Baltimore, Miami, Minneapolis-St. Paul, Phoenix, and Los Angeles), to quantify influences on ecological dynamics. This information will be linked to land use scenarios to address the regional and continental-scale impacts of these effects. Three postdocs will be mentored as co-investigators on this project. The research program will also include interaction with municipal decision makers focused on sustainability and add a new ?Panel of Experts? feature to the YardMap citizen science program developed at Cornell University.",

To address the first question, we did an analysis of factors motivating change versus factors motivating stability in residential land use. To address the second question, we sampled actual lawns in six cities across the U.S. (Boston, Baltimore, Miami, Minneapolis-St. Paul, Phoenix, Los Angeles) representing four alternative futures; high intensity (fertilizer, water, pesticide), low intensity (just mowing), wildlife certified, hydrology (rain gardens or xeriscaping). Our results suggest that there will be significant changes in the American Residential Macrosystems over the next 50 years. The dominant driver of change is concerns about water; too little in the arid west and too much in the humid east. It is thus reasonable to expect that there will be significant increases in xeriscaped yards in the west and in yards with runoff capturing features such as rain gardens in the east. Another driver of change is concerns about water quality in lakes, rivers and coastal waters that are driving fertilizer restrictions. In 50 years, there is likely to be significantly less fertilizer applied to the American Residential Macrosystem. A final driver of change is the desire of homeowners to support wildlife in their yards. It is reasonable to expect that in 50 years there will be significant increases in the number and coverage of wildlife friendly yards in the American Residential Macrosystem. The ecological implications of these changes may be profound. If fully realized, the impacts of residential land use on water use, urban runoff, nutrient pollution, and habitat loss will be greatly reduced at the continental scale. But there is high uncertainty in the likelihood of these changes. While there are significant forces driving change, there are also significant forces driving stability of real estate values, commercial landscaping practices, social norms, municipal regulations, and perhaps most important, widespread satisfaction among homeowners with current landscaping practices that are easy to carry out and that produce important functional and aesthetic services. Our research suggests that there is significant potential for change in the American Residential Macrosystem that could produce important improvements in environmental outcomes. However, realizing this potential will require extensive efforts at the interface between science and society to facilitate change and maintain satisfaction.</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 01/29/2024<br>\nModified by: Diane&nbsp;E&nbsp;Pataki</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n></div>\n</div>\n",
