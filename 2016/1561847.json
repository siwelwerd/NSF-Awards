 "awd_abstract_narration": "This coastal geomorphology project is relevant to the large coastal populations that rely on dunes for protection during storms and it could provide useful information for coastal planners and engineers. The project aims to advance understanding of the recovery and building of coastal dunes with a focus on the welding of intertidal sandbars to the shoreline. The investigators will develop novel approaches to measure the effects of waves and wind on the movement of sand. They will communicate findings to coastal management agencies and will train one PhD student and two undergraduate students.\r\n\r\nThe goal is to improve understanding of beach-dune dynamics by testing the hypothesis that sediment supply to the backshore beach and dunes is dominated by the welding of intertidal sandbars to the shoreline. While this mechanism has long been proposed as critical, only limited quantitative data exists. The investigators propose a comprehensive field experiment (SEDEX2, the Sandbar-aEolian-Dune Exchange EXperiment) in which measurements of waves and wind, subaqueous and aeolian sediment transport, and subsequent morphological changes will be collected synoptically during an intertidal bar welding event along a highly progradational beach. The findings will inform conceptual and numerical models of beach-dune interaction and help to improve management of vital backshore resources.",

Therefore, the goal of the project titled ?The Influence of Intertidal Sandbar Welding on Dune Growth? was to improve our understanding of beach-dune dynamics.

The <strong>S</strong>andbar-a<strong>E</strong>olian-<strong>D</strong>une <strong>EX</strong>change <strong>EX</strong>periment (SEDEX<sup>2</sup>) was performed during summer 2016 along the Long Beach Peninsula, WA, USA (Figure 1). This study location is a high-energy dissipative coastline experiencing rapid shoreline progradation (&gt; +3 m/yr) and long-term dune growth.

Under what conditions is beach sand delivered from the intertidal zone via sandbar welding mobilized via wind-blown processes? &nbsp;What is the residence time of sand on the beach prior to blowing into dunes?

Coastal foredune growth has typically been associated with aeolian sediment transport processes only, while foredune erosion is associated with destructive marine processes.

From morphologic change data sets, it is estimated that marine processes explain between 9% and 38% of annual dune growth with aeolian processes accounting for the remaining 62% to 91%. The largest wind-driven dune growth occurs during the winter, in response to high wind velocities, but out of phase with summertime beach growth via intertidal sandbar welding. The lack of synchronization between maximum beach sediment supply and wind-driven dune growth indicates that aeolian transport at out study site is primarily transport, rather than supply, limited, likely due to a lack of fetch limitations.

Consistent with our field measurements, recent Windsurf applications have shown skill at simulating coastal change by winds and waves at time scales of hours to years (Figure 6).
