 "awd_abstract_narration": "Roll-to-roll nanoimprinting is expected to overcome many scalability limitations of current batch imprint techniques, including production of large imprint areas, high throughput patterning, and lower cost. There is a significant potential for creating engineered surfaces using the roll-to-roll method, which could lead to new products, such as wire-grid polarizers, anti-reflective surfaces, and nanogratings for novel color filters for use in displays. In this Scalable NanoManufacturing (SNM) project, this potential will be demonstrated by manufacturing metasurfaces which are ultrathin nanostructured films that are capable of exhibiting ultra-efficient light control and are known to find significant use in optical communication, information processing, laser systems, and to improve the efficiency of liquid crystal displays. To develop this roll-to-roll imprinting method, the project team will pursue research that involves several disciplines of science and engineering including roll-to-roll transport of flexible materials, roller nanoimprint lithography, process modeling and simulation, and structure characterization. Furthermore, this award will provide research opportunities for undergraduates, minority students, high school teachers and students and incorporate research results into undergraduate and graduate curricula. Throughout the project, the research team will collaborate on relevant technical topics with practicing engineers and scientists from industry.\r\n\r\nThis award will focus on scaling up nanoimprint lithography using ultraviolet cured resins in a roll-to-roll process to produce multilayer devices with large areas through repetitive coating and imprinting on a moving substrate. The technical challenges include determining suitable resin materials and films, uniform roll-to-roll transport of the film through the imprinting process, mold filling, process modeling and control systems to facilitate high throughput transport, metrology and inspection. The research is unique in integrating the resin characteristics, coating and imprinting processes, dynamics of roll-to-roll transport machinery with metrology into a control algorithm. This algorithm will control process and machine parameters to maintain imprint quality inferred by metrology. The goal is to improve the speed and the resolution of the current roll-to-roll nanoimprinting process and to extend the process to actual photonic device fabrication. The research team will achieve this goal by combining their expertise in modeling and simulation, material and process development and characterization, and collaboration with industry.  An example is the imprint contact mechanics will induce web tension change and result in slippage/shearing of imprinted features as the web exits the imprint roller. By combining expertise of resin characteristics during curing with contact mechanics and tension control the slippage and distortion of the imprinted features can be minimized.",

Laboratory R2R trials at OSU successfully demonstrated this speed with an epoxy UV resin imprinted with a line grid mold. The epoxy resin required a large dose of UV exposure to cure the resin prior to extraction at the exit of the imprint roller. To achieve speeds faster than 20 m/min would have required additional UV power and perhaps a larger diameter imprint roller to increase the UV dosage. The end result was that commercially viable process speeds were demonstrated and we know yet higher speeds are possible. Those imprints were characterized off-line using the atomic force microscope (AFM). Similar R2R trials were conducted at TAMU using a ABS UV resin which required less dosage at speeds as high as 50 m/min. Those imprints were also characterized off-line using the AFM. Thus, commercially viable speeds by trial and error methods in R2R process machines have been demonstrated. We have shown speed scaling is possible and not limited to 20 m/min.</li>\n<li>We have developed methods to predict mold filling, precise web positioning, successful imprint curing between the nip and the exit of the imprint roller, successful imprint extraction from the mold and deformation of imprints in wound rolls. These methods are required to move R2R UVNIL process development from expensive trial and error exploration in the laboratory to off-line low-cost exploration prior to machinery development to produce a required imprint with a selected resin. This is needed for scaling and proving commercial viability prior to expensive investment in process machinery and development. Whether R2R UV-NIL will be used to produce a given product will require cost feasibility studies.

In mold filling, the stress-free fluid film on the substrate flows into the mold pattern cavities, which is followed by the phase change sub-process in which the substrate is irradiated with UV light to cure the coated film in the pattern.
