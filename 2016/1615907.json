 "awd_abstract_narration": "Plants adjust their growth plan to maximize exposure to resources. A central tool in this adaptive program is the rapid extension of stems and roots.  Plants grow toward the sun or toward richer soils through careful re-orientation of their apical meristems, the stem-cell generating portions of the plant.  This project focuses on the fundamental properties of cellular growth processes critical to morphogenesis.  Using genetic analysis, computational models, and leading-edge microscopy techniques, this work will reveal how the internal polymer systems in the cell spatially organize in response to plant hormones to direct axial cell growth.\r\n\r\nThe microtubule cytoskeleton has a fundamental role in orchestrating the axial morphogenesis of plants through its ability to influence the mechanical properties of the cell wall. Microtubules organize into patterns just beneath the cell membrane that determine where cellulose microfibrils are deposited into the cell wall. By creating co-oriented cellulose patterns, the microtubules bias cells toward axial extension. The goal of the project is to discover the genes and molecular mechanism that lead to specific microtubule patterns and the transfer of that information to the cell wall. To accomplish that goal, genetic screening and cell biological tools will be combined to determine how plant hormone receptors trigger microtubule array patterning and how the patterning of the microtubules is integrated with cell expansion.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nHow cells achieve a specific size and shape is still one of the most fundamental questions in cell biology.  For multicellular organisms, including the flowering plants, cell form is overtly critical to cell function and allows tissues and organs to execute their respective roles for the organism.  Axial growth, the ability to extend an organ or tissue in a specific direction, is a key facet of flowering plant morphogenesis brought about, in part, by the coordinated axial extension of cells.  Our work, using the embryonic plant stem as a model system, addresses the roles played by the cortical microtubule cytoskeleton in orchestrating axial growth.  The pattern of microtubules at the cell cortex determines, to a large extent, the pattern of fiber deposition into the cell wall.  That, in turn, informs how the cell wall is allowed to strain against the forces of turgor pressure.  In this award period, we created genetically engineered plant lines, advanced microscopy techniques, and software that provided a key step forward in the analysis of microtubule pattern generation.  The outcomes include six peer reviewed publications and multiple contributions in other areas including a major review for our field.  We discovered that the four primary microtubule array patterns can be reduced to just two underlying processes.  We further demonstrated that switching between these pattern-generating mechanisms requires new gene expression and can be controlled through either of two major plant growth hormones.  These experiments are important for showing both a genetic and biophysical basis for the specification of array patterns.  Applying new methods to several previously characterized mutants, we discovered that the rate at which the microtubules change pattern is as critical to axial cell growth as the creation of the patterns themselves.  Together, these works point to a cell biological mechanism controlling how microtubules specify cell wall extensibility that relies on hormone-induced gene expression.  These results lay the groundwork for determining the molecular mechanisms specifying the axial growth habit in higher plants. \n\n \n\nThe award resulted in training opportunities for five graduate students, five undergraduate research students, and one post-doctoral fellow.  The materials and aims of the proposal were brought directly into an undergraduate honors biology course (IFLE H111) every year of the award period where students applied molecular, genetic, and cell biological methods to advance our understanding of growth phenotypes.  The materials are used in real experiments that pair what students are learning about genetics and cell biology with actual work in progress.  The award funded REU summer research experiences for three female undergraduate students to work with Dr. Kristine Schaefer, a post-doc initially funded through this award.  Materials generated and credited to this award were used for microscopy laboratory exercises with the PI in both the AQLM and OMIBs courses at the Marine Biological Laboratories, Woods Hole.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/27/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Sidney L Shaw"
