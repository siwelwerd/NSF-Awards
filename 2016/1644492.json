 "awd_abstract_narration": "The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine will conduct a study on the prevalence and impact of sexual harassment in science, engineering and medical departments and programs. Recent media coverage of cases involving prominent scientists and institutions has highlighted the fact that the processes in place to address sexual harassment in academic settings often do not function effectively, resulting in a negative impact on faculty, students, and staff. Nevertheless, no comprehensive study has yet examined sexual harassment in the science, engineering, and medical programs on college and university campuses or the efficacy of institutional responses to these discriminatory behaviors. By conducting this research, the Academies' Committee on Women in Science, Engineering, and Medicine will facilitate efforts to end sexual harassment in science, engineering, and medicine and reduce the negative impacts these behaviors may have on the attrition from, and underrepresentation of, women in these fields.\r\n\r\nAs an organization independent of the government, the National Academies will carry out the study with objectivity and balance. The study will involve an intensive effort to collect evidence regarding the prevalence and nature of sexual harassment in academic science, engineering, and medicine and consider the impact of sexual harassment on the career choices of women, and other underrepresented groups affected by sexual harassment. The study will be conducted by a committee of expert stakeholders who will review current institutional procedures for preventing sexual harassment, consider data on the prevalence and impact of sexual harassment in science, engineering, and medicine, and develop evidence-based strategies and policies aimed at preventing or addressing sexual harassment on campuses. The Academies will widely disseminating the findings and recommendations of this study. The target audience for this study includes colleges and universities; Congress and the Administration; federal research agencies; science, engineering, and business and industry executives; professional STEM societies and associations; medical professionals, and student associations.",

Institutions should combine anti-harassment and civility-promotion programs. They should ensure that training on preventing and addressing sexual harassment is tailored for specific populations, provides skills needed by all members of the academic community, teaches how to interrupt and intervene when harassment occurs, and focuses on changing behavior, not on changing beliefs.

Policies should also include an investigative and decision making process that is fair to all involved and that is undertaken and completed in a timely manner. Academic institutions should strive for greater transparency in how they are handling reports of sexual harassment while balancing a need for confidentiality.
