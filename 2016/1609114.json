 "awd_abstract_narration": "One defining characteristic of humans is their unusually cooperative nature, which is unparalleled among animals. An important goal for anthropology is to understand the nature and evolution of this \"altruistic\" behavior. This doctoral dissertation project will investigate cooperative exchanges among free-ranging rhesus macaques in order to test predictions from several competing evolutionary hypotheses about altruism. Studying cooperative exchanges among rhesus macaques will provide a comparative model for understanding the behavioral evolution of humans and our ancestors. The broader impacts of this project include the support of science education and outreach, through valuable field experience for research assistants, data analysis experience for undergraduates, and presentation of research results in various public formats, including local zoos and conferences.\r\n\r\nThis study will observe grooming interactions among 50 adult female rhesus macaques from three social groups at Cayo Santiago, Puerto Rico, using focal animal sampling methodology, for eleven months (spanning both mating and birth seasons). Specifically, the project will examine how well reciprocal grooming exchanges resemble those predicted by several competing theoretical hypotheses (kin selection, reciprocal altruism, biological markets theory, and social bond investment), in one comprehensive and integrated analysis, via AIC model ranking. These exchanges will be examined across multiple time scales and across groups of variable sizes. Additionally, there will be a more detailed investigation of biological markets theory. By focusing on exchanges of grooming for mates or infant handling, this study will test a key prediction that such exchanges conform to supply and demand relationships. The extent to which apparent supply and demand relationships may be artifacts of, or mediated by, stress responses will be examined, with stress measured both behaviorally and via fecal glucocorticoid metabolite assays.",

Therefore, one important goal for anthropology is understanding the nature and evolution of altruism. Like humans, rhesus macaques (<em>Macaca mulatta</em>) rely on cooperation to navigate their social world. This project investigated cooperative exchanges among free-ranging Cayo Santiago rhesus macaques, specifically by examining grooming for infant handling exchanges and time matching behavior when grooming was reciprocally exchanged for itself.

Supply and demand relationships have inconsistently been found to operate in grooming for infant handling exchanges in other primate species, such that grooming durations provided by handlers to mothers decrease as the availability of infants in the group increases.

Grooming could serve as a benign signal of intent or even function to de-stress commodity holders. We hypothesized that stress may serve as a mechanism mediating the appearance of supply and demand. While we did find evidence for supply and demand operating in the grooming for infant handling exchanges among rhesus macaques, we found no evidence that stress impacts this relationship. We measured stress both behaviorally and physiologically, and found no relationship between maternal stress levels and infant availability.

As with the appearance of supply and demand, conclusions about time matching also vary across species.
