 "awd_abstract_narration": "Jackson State University is examining the effect of active flipped learning on student success in STEM. The project team will structure an intervention around mathematics, physics, and engineering courses and conduct research to produce knowledge that can be used to enhance African American students' learning and engagement in STEM. The goal is to implement and assess the effectiveness of an evidence-based active flipped learning model on student outcomes.  \r\n\r\nThe project will be implemented using five experimental periods that will apply flipped learning and mixed traditional classroom lecture with active flipped learning. The activities will be guided by relevant affective, cognitive, and behavioral models. Participants will be provided data-driven personalized feedback, scaffolds, and learning tasks through advanced smart technologies. A series of surveys and interviews will be conducted to compare students' learning engagement, empowerment, self-efficacy, and satisfaction with active flipped learning. The project could catalyze a paradigm shift replacing passive learning with active learning in STEM education at HBCUs and other institutions.\r\n\r\nThis project is supported by the Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) Targeted Infusion and Broadening Participation Research in Education tracks. This program supports ideas to create and study new models and innovations in STEM teaching and learning, investigate the underlying issues affecting the differential participation and success rates of students from underrepresented groups, and produce knowledge to inform STEM education practices and interventions.",
