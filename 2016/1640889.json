 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Science of Learning Collaborative Network brings together scientists and educators from University of Washington, University of California-Santa Cruz, and partners in Chile to examine the inter-generational transfer of math-gender stereotypes and math self-concepts in K-3 students. A fundamental challenge for the science of learning is to deepen our understanding of why certain academic Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) disciplines, but not others, have significant disparities in who chooses to pursue those disciplines. Cultural stereotypes about \"who does STEM\" have been shown to influence such disparities. The impact of STEM stereotypes has been documented in adults. However, the origins of these stereotypes and their influence early in the STEM 'pipeline' are understudied. Research shows that the elementary school period is a critical time that begins to shape children's interests, motivation, and skills in academic fields. This collaborative network examines the mechanisms of transfer of information within the family environment, and the ways in which this is tied to students' actual math achievement in the classroom. The network is designed to disseminate findings to families, educators, policymakers, and students using a series of workshops and webinars. The network's outreach efforts focus on translating the scientific findings into actionable strategies that teachers can use in their classrooms and parents can use at home, which will shorten the gap between discovery and educational practice.\r\n\r\nThe network investigates the role of \"non-academic\" (psychological) factors that influence children's learning of math. The two principal research questions are: (a) the interrelation among child, parent, and teacher stereotypes about math, and (b) how these influence children's developing math self-concepts, their math achievement (grades, test scores), and career interests in STEM. Chile is a particularly important cultural context for investigating how cultural stereotypes serve to discourage math participation/achievement in young children, because it represents a society in which math-gender stereotypes are strong, historically persistent, and amenable to study. The network is highly interdisciplinary, assembling developmental scientists, social psychologists, educators, and community leaders. The network adopts a multi-method approach: (a) combing both implicit (child IAT) and explicit (self-report) measures about \"who does math,\" (b) examining the relative contribution of parent and teacher interactions on children's emerging math identity, and (c) investigating the influence of educational and community contexts (including SES and school characteristics). The network will use the results to teach parents, students, teachers, and communities about the scientific process both in the United States and in Latin America.\r\n\r\nThe award is from the Science of Learning-Collaborative Networks (SL-CN) Program, with funding from the SBE Division of Behavioral and Cognitive Sciences (BCS), the SBE Office of Multidisciplinary Activities (SMA), and the Office of International Science and Engineering (OISE).",
