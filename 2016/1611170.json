 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular, and Nanochemistry program of the Division of Chemistry, Professor Francis P. Zamborini of the University of Louisville and his team study the oxidation of small gold nanoparticles using a combination of chemical characterization techniques. Nanoparticles are tiny particles that contain thousands of atoms. While they are much larger than chemical molecules, which contain only a few atoms, they are still much smaller than solid materials that are large enough to see with the naked eye, containing trillions of atoms. Nanoscale materials are unique because they have sizes intermediate between molecules and solids, but sometimes have properties not easily predicted by averaging the two size extremes. The aim of the research is to understand the unusual electrochemical reactivity of metal nanoparticles smaller than 2 nm and of alloy nanostructure composition, arrangement, and reactivity. The aim is to develop new analytical tools for metal nanostructures, and also uncover unique properties, reactivity, and applications. The project impacts the education of students at all levels through research training and wider incorporation of nanotechnology into the undergraduate curriculum. A yearly one-day symposium highlights research by women of all ages from middle school up to academic and industrial professionals. The goal of this symposium is to inspire more young female students to pursue a long term career in science. These activities impact the education and economy in Kentucky and beyond through broad dissemination. \r\n\r\nThis project aims to correlate the specific size with the oxidation potential for nanospheres below 2 nm, which show unusual electrochemical reactivity that change dramatically as a function of size. The project also addresses the atomic arrangement of metals in two-component alloy nanospheres by determining electrochemical oxidation behavior. This method allows the sensitive detection of transformations that occur during heating or catalytic reactions. Another focus of the project is the size-selective electrochemical deposition of negatively-charged gold nanospheres onto electrodes. This process has potential for the design of highly active supported electrocatalysts. The research team also uses gold nanoplate-nanosphere dimer structures as a platform for sensitive molecular detection by surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS). Images of the structures are directly correlated to the SERS signal. A unique trimer structure is used to study catalytic reactions on non-SERS active metals. The well-controlled nanoplate-nanosphere dimer and trimer assemblies aid in better understanding and controlling SERS detection for the study of reactions at the single molecule level.",

Metal NPs are synthesized on the bench top and consist of a metallic core, which is spherical in these studies, surrounded by a shell of some type of stabilizer molecule (citrate ions, phosphines, phosphoniums, or thiols) that has an interaction with the metal NPs.&nbsp; The metal NPs, mainly gold in this work, oxidize (lose electrons) at a positive potential applied to a conductive solid electrode.&nbsp; We discovered that the potential (measured in volts) required to oxidize the gold NPs depends strongly on the diameter of the spherical gold NPs (see Image 1).&nbsp; We used the size-dependent oxidation potential as a method to characterize the deposition and electrochemical reactivity of gold and gold-copper alloy NPs, especially those below 4 nm in diameter.&nbsp; We used the oxidation voltage as a method to explore size-selective electrophoretic deposition of gold NPs (Image 2) and to study interesting size transformations of gold NPs that occur during ozone treatment and application of potential (0.45 V) in bromide solutions (Image 3).&nbsp; Interestingly, aggregation of the gold NPs in acid shifts the oxidation potential compared to well-separated gold NPs or gold NPs aggregated by a phosphonium ligand (THPC), where space remains between the gold NPs (Image 4).&nbsp; We also discovered that the oxidation of gold and copper in gold-copper alloy NPs occurs at different potentials, depending on how the NPs were synthesized, due to different relative amounts of copper-copper, gold-copper, and gold-gold bonds in the NPs.&nbsp; This leads to different signatures in the plot of oxidation current versus potential that can serve as a method to analyze atomic arrangements within NPs (Image 5).&nbsp; This project also focused on the 1) electrochemical measurement of surface-area-to-volume ratio of gold NPs to determine their size and electrode assembly, 2) size-dependent oxidation of gold NPs coated with thiols as compared to citrate ions and 3) catalysis of organic reactions with palladium NPs stabilized by a highly branched thiol ligand (glutathione) that could be activated with iodine.</p>\n<p><strong>Intellectual Merit.&nbsp; </strong>In terms of intellectual merit, the results of this research provide 1) new information on the electrochemical and chemical reactivity of metal NPs as a function of their size, metal composition, and ligand stabilizer and 2) a new method of NP analysis based on anodic stripping voltammetry.&nbsp; The first area specifically led to new knowledge about the oxidation potential of gold NPs coated with weakly bound stabilizers in the 1-4 nm diameter range.&nbsp; The project also studied the stability of 1-4 nm gold NPs during various treatments, such as heat, ozone, and electrochemical potential, showing that smaller NPs very easily transform into larger NPs with extremely mild treatments.&nbsp; The research brought new insight into chemical reactions involving ultrasmall metal NPs, including reactions involving metal replacement, catalytic reduction and catalytic hydrogenation reactions.&nbsp; Completely new reactivity occurs in many cases below the 4 nm diameter size.&nbsp; In the second area, we show that stripping voltammetry is extremely useful for analyzing the size, composition, atomic arrangement, and aggregation state of metal NPs.&nbsp; This is very useful since the technique is 10-100 times cheaper and much faster than electron microscopy, electron spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and x-ray absorbance methods traditionally used to obtain similar information. <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Broader Impacts.&nbsp; </strong>This research involved 18 people, including 10 graduate students, 7 undergraduate students, and 1 visiting research scholar.&nbsp; Out of the graduate students, 5 received their PhD degree and 1 received a MS degree, while the others are still working towards their degree.&nbsp; We disseminated the results of this research in 17 high quality, peer-reviewed journal publications and 51 presentations.&nbsp; The project directly impacted those involved in conducting the research by providing them with a valuable research experience, including their learning how to develop a research idea, design experiments, present research, and publish the results.&nbsp; The project also impacts the scientific community by providing new information on the unique reactivity of nanoscale metals as a function of size, ligand stabilizer, and composition.&nbsp; The research directly provides knowledge about important chemical properties of nanoscale metals, such as oxidation potential, size stability, metal replacement reactivity, and catalytic activity.&nbsp; Just as important, this project developed anodic stripping voltammetry as a very low cost, simple, and fast method to analyze the size, composition, atomic arrangement and aggregation state of metal NPs, which is highly valuable to those who do not have direct access to the very costly and time consuming electron, x-ray, and mass spectrometry/microscopy methods.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 09/26/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Francis&nbsp;P&nbsp;Zamborini</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1611170/1611170_10458586_1632663371614_Image1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1611170/1611170_10458586_1632663371614_Image1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Image 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1611170/1611170_10458586_1632663371614_Image1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Image 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">This image shows the size-dependent oxidation of gold nanoparticles.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Zamborini Lab</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Francis&nbsp;P&nbsp;Zamborini</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Image 1</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1611170/1611170_10458586_1632663498389_Image2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1611170/1611170_10458586_1632663498389_Image2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Image 2\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1611170/1611170_10458586_1632663498389_Image2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Image 2\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Size-selective electrophoretic deposition of 4 nm gold nanoparticles over 15 nm gold nanoparticles at 0.4 V.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Zamborini Lab</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Francis&nbsp;P&nbsp;Zamborini</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Image 2</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1611170/1611170_10458586_1632663964089_Image3--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1611170/1611170_10458586_1632663964089_Image3--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Image 3\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1611170/1611170_10458586_1632663964089_Image3--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Image 3\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Using the oxidation potential to observe size transformations of gold NPs during ozone treatment (top) and potential treatment in bromide (bottom).</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Zamborini Lab</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Francis&nbsp;P&nbsp;Zamborini</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Image 3</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1611170/1611170_10458586_1632664329116_Image4--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1611170/1611170_10458586_1632664329116_Image4--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Image 4\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1611170/1611170_10458586_1632664329116_Image4--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Image 4\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Effect of aggregation state of gold NPs on the oxidation potential.
