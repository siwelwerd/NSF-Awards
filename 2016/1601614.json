 "awd_abstract_narration": "Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) workforce studies recently completed by various organizations show that the utilization of UAS technology in the workplace is exploding in the domestic and international markets. UAS technology has the potential to impact nearly every sector of the economy and is revolutionizing manufacturing, emergency management, intelligence, agriculture, civil engineering, utility systems monitoring and package delivery. Because they have the ability to complete traditionally hazardous jobs more safely and difficult jobs more easily, UAS and related technologies are changing the way these tasks are performed. UAS have a cross-cutting impact on nearly every sector of the economy and every educational discipline. To take advantage of the opportunities provided by this emerging sector, the \"Geospatial Technician Education-Unmanned Aircraft Systems (GeoTEd-UAS)\" project, a three-year effort that focuses on geospatial technologies, will develop and implement academic courses and pathways to prepare Unmanned Aircraft Systems Operations Technicians (UASOT) to succeed in the emerging fields of geospatial data acquisition, analysis and exploitation. \r\n\r\nThe project will also provide faculty professional development and mentoring, curriculum development, and precollege activities to increase the UAS workforce pipeline. GeoTEd-UAS will build college and faculty capacity at two partnering community colleges and support these faculty to develop pathways for UASOT training. Activities include workforce needs and skills analysis, compilation of the duties and responsibilities of a UASOT, convening of leadership and faculty development workshops, faculty mentoring, curriculum development and student recruitment. The partnering community colleges represent rural and urban locations allowing the project to broaden the participation of many underrepresented groups. Project materials and resources will be shared nationally through the GeoTech Center and the GeoTEd website (http://geoted.org). GeoTEd-UAS project partners include Thomas Nelson Community College, Mountain Empire Community College, the Virginia Community College System, Virginia Tech, and the Virginia Space Grant Consortium (VSGC). The project will be led and administered by the VSGC. The innovative UASOT courses and pathways being developed through the GeoTEd-UAS project will advance the field significantly and serve as national models.",

The project developed and implemented several major components to prepare the workforce pipeline. GeoTEd-UAS was administered by the Virginia Space Grant Consortium (VSGC) and partners included: Virginia Peninsula Community College (VPCC), Mountain Empire Community College (MECC), Virginia Community College System (VCCS), and Virginia Tech. The partnering community colleges represented rural and urban locations allowing the project to broaden the participation of many underrepresented groups.</p>\n<p>The GeoTEd-UAS project accomplished all stated goals and objectives resulting in many products and successful outcomes. The team facilitated the development of a sUAS-OT DACUM chart which was the first-of-its kind chart to define the tasks and duties of the workforce. Eight sUAS industry professionals contributed to the DACUM. The DACUM ensured project content would be aligned with industry needs and served as the foundation for all new community college and high school courses, new pathways, professional development institutes, precollege outreach, non-credit workforce courses, and other content.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A new Unmanned Systems (UMS) prefix and four new UMS courses were developed by the project team. UMS was chosen as the prefix in anticipation of the need for other courses in other unmanned domains. At the request of the VCCS, the GeoTEd-UAS team facilitated a system-wide review of the proposed courses allowing representatives from other colleges to provide input. The courses were then facilitated through the VCCS approval process and included: UMS 107 - sUAS Remote Pilot Ground School (RPG); UMS 111 - sUAS I; UMS 177 - sUAS Components and Maintenance; and UMS 211 - sUAS II. A fifth UMS class has been added, UMS 112 - sUAS Program and Flight Data Management. Following development of the courses, both partnering colleges developed sUAS-OT pathways. MECC developed a two-year technical studies degree while VPCC developed a 19-credit hour career studies certificate. These pathways have served as models for all community colleges.</p>\n<p>The GeoTEd-UAS project provided sUAS-OT professional development institutes for community college faculty and other educators. Faculty from all community colleges in Virginia were recruited into a two-year cohort model and 23 educators attended two five-day institutes at Virginia Tech. Participants obtained their FAA Remote Pilot Certificate and gained experience in performing flight operations. The educators committed to integrating sUAS into their instruction and to build a program at their institution. Participants received training on operations, safety, and strategies for integrating service-learning projects. The team provided active mentoring including in-person and virtual collaboration. The project also provided a third institute where participants led a service-learning project to help the Virginia Commonwealth University Rice Rivers Center collect data of interest.</p>\n<p>Supplemental funding through the NSF Skills Training in Advanced Research and Technology (START) program was used to establish the GeoTEd-UAS Internship Program which supported six community college student interns and four faculty interns to increase their knowledge and skills in sUAS through engagement in cutting-edge research in partnership with the Center for Unmanned Aircraft Systems (C-UAS) at Virginia Tech. The six students participated in a residential four-week internship while the four faculty, chosen from previous GeoTEd-UAS cohorts, each attended one week of the internship. A team member also attended each of the four weeks to serve as liaison to Virginia Tech.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>To prepare the interns for the summer internship, the project provided two courses: UMS 107 RPG to prepare students to sit for the FAA Remote Pilot Certificate Exam and a custom UMS 111, sUAS I course. The course prepared the interns to plan and fly missions for both manual and autonomous flights, including content specific to the needs of the Center and training for certification to fly on Virginia Tech properties.&nbsp; Two in-person training events were held at VPCC where participants improved their flying skills and learned how to conduct safe missions under Part 107.</p>\n<p>The internships provided participants with real-world technical and research experience in collaboration with and support of the Center. The interns supported flight testing including conducting experimental and test flights. Typical duties of the interns included pre-planning discussions of the flight test objectives and procedures; pre-briefs on operation and safety; mission execution, recovery, and post-flight analysis and summary. The participants gained experience in using sUAS to take weather measurements to support a NASA project; built and flew a fixed wing cardboard aircraft; and assembled, programmed, and tested a smoke detecting sensor attached to an Arduino circuit board.</p>\n<p>Prior to this GeoTEd-UAS project, there was no UMS course prefix, no sUAS courses or content, and no faculty capacity at any college other than the partnering colleges. During this project, 10 different colleges have offered at least one UMS course and more than 900 students have enrolled in a course.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified:
