 "awd_abstract_narration": "Between 65 and 100 million years ago, during the time that dinosaurs walked the earth, a large, tropical seaway covered the central part of what is now North America. This seaway teemed with marine life. Snails and clams lived on the seafloor; ammonites, along with giant mosasaurs, plesiosaurs, sharks, and fish, swam about; at the same time early birds and pterosaurs floated on or flew above the seaway. What remains today is a prolific fossil record that has been collected by paleontologists for over 100 years. Notable fossils from this time period and region are on display at museums around the world. However, the vast bulk of fossils collected from this region are locked away in museum drawers. To provide scientists and the general public access to these fossils and their associated data, this project proposes to digitize invertebrate and vertebrate fossils from this time period and region, making information accessible through searchable electronic databases. Additionally, a variety of online resources illustrating and describing these fossils and mapping their distributions will be developed. A freely accessible online textbook of paleontology will be generated and a website and App will be developed to highlight the appearances, occurrences, and ages of constituent species, to help students and aspiring paleontologists identify and learn about these fossils. The project plans to generate a variety of curricular materials for K-12 education, including 3-D scans of fossils for free download and printed 3-D models for classroom use. Products of this project will also include workshops to engage science teachers and items to augment public programs and exhibits at participating institutions. \r\n\r\nThis work will greatly increase the scientific value of eight major U.S. museum collections of fossils. The museum collections contain large amounts of data useful for studying what causes marine species to migrate, go extinct, and evolve during a long period of greenhouse climate conditions similar to those our planet may soon experience. These data have relevance for evaluating how global change has and will continue to affect life on earth. An estimated 164,000 specimens collected from thousands of locations, in the region once occupied by the Western Interior Seaway, will be databased and georeferenced. Representatives from each of roughly 1,500 microfossil, invertebrate, and vertebrate species will be imaged. The digitized records will be made available online via individual museum databases, iDigBio, and iDigPaleo. The resultant data will enable scientists to answer questions about how different species interact and ecosystems change in the face of environmental shifts during a key time in the history of life. Moreover, the data will be ideal for use with an assortment of modern quantitative tools -including paleoecological niche modeling (PaleoENM) - and will help improve paleoclimate and paleoceanographic models. Finally, several undergraduate and graduate students will be trained. Results of the project will be published at the following url: www.digitalatlasofancientlife.org.",

This ocean had actual sea monsters like marine reptiles, mosasaurs, huge sharks, sea turtles the size of cars, and 17-foot long fishes! Amongst these predators, lived thousands of invertebrates (animals without backbones), like ammonoids (coil-shelled relative of the squid and octopus), clams, snails, and even microscopic plankton. The Western Interior Seaway was a shallow sea that covered the western North American interior from 100-65 million years ago (in the Cretaceous Period) at a time when Earth had a greenhouse climate with stable warm temperatures. Temperature and sea level both peaked about 100 million years ago?one of the highest sea levels ever in geologic time?estimated at hundreds of feet higher than current levels, followed by gradual cooling and sea-level fluctuations through the end of the Cretaceous.</p>\n<p>The Yale Peabody Museum, with one of the finest Western Interior Seaway collections in the world, teamed up with other institutions in the Cretaceous World TCN (NSF Award# DBI-1601884) to record the existence of these fossils, by <em>digitizing</em> our collections. Previously, information and access to these specimens was available only to scientists fortunate enough to visit the museum collections. Now these collections are freely available to scientists around the world and to <em>anyone</em> wanting to know more about the unique fossils and ancient ecosystem. Digitization includes recording the fossil identification and all other relevant details about the fossils, including: when and by whom it was collected, the geographic coordinates and specific rock unit from which the fossil was collected, and photographing the specimens. These data can be used by scientists to answer many questions about life in the WIS, including the structure of food webs and ecosystems in this ancient sea and biodiversity loss and the response of plants and animals to climate change. By evaluating past responses of animals and biodiversity to climate change and sea level change to make predictions about how current climate change will affect life on our planet.</p>\n<p>Digitizing is time consuming and we have tens of thousands of relevant specimens to digitize, so high throughput digitization protocols were developed and shared with the museum community to aid in other digitization projects (in all disciplines). Along the way, this digitization has been conducted by many future scientists and museum workers who have gained critical skill contributing to this project. Fourteen undergraduate students worked during the academic year and summers digitizing collections and learning curatorial practices and how museum collections support scientific research. Four high school students and two undergraduate mentors interned during the summer 2017 and 2018 (100 hours each) on the Cretaceous World TCN. They are participants in ?EVOlutions\", the Yale Peabody Museum afterschool program for underserved populations in STEM education. They participated in all activities involved in digitization of natural history collections, including cataloging, photography, and 3D image capture, and learned basic scientific principles of earth science and paleontology. Most of these participants have gone on to pursue their next level of education (including undergraduate and graduate school) or pursued a career in STEM fields (including biomedical engineering, museum collections work, biological laboratory science, and K-12 science education).</p>\n<p>Over the course of the grant, the Yale Peabody Museum divisions of invertebrate and vertebrate fossil have digitized 110,143 specimen lots (an estimated 164,000 specimens) from the Western Interior Seaway. We have made digital map coordinates for 2,449 fossil collection sites. Nearly 100,000 fossils have pictures, often from more than one angle. In addition to posting on cretaceousworld.org, they are aggregated with hundreds of other institutions on iDigBio.org, the national portal for digitized museum collections for scientists.</p>\n<p>Beyond scientific research use, we have made this new digitized material available in meaningful ways to the public via an easy to navigate database of images and data (cretaceousworld.org). With input solicited from middle school and high school teachers and high school students, this site facilitates use in a classroom with guided browsing of collections, by using common names rather than Latin names, and through special tools, like annotation and measuring, that allow students to use virtual museum collections in the same manner that scientists use the physical collections.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/22/2020<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Susan&nbsp;H&nbsp;Butts</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1601884/1601884_10426469_1603381778516_YPMIP36058side1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1601884/1601884_10426469_1603381778516_YPMIP36058side1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"fossil shell with bite marks\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1601884/1601884_10426469_1603381778516_YPMIP36058side1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"fossil shell with bite marks\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Fossil ammonoid shell with bite marks from a mosasaur</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">susan butts</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Susan&nbsp;H&nbsp;Butts</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">fossil shell with bite marks</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1601884/1601884_10426469_1603382269245_VP2177--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1601884/1601884_10426469_1603382269245_VP2177--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"giant 70 million year old fish\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1601884/1601884_10426469_1603382269245_VP2177--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"giant 70 million year old fish\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Xiphactinus, a 17 foot long fish from the Western Interior Seaway.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Susan Butts</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Susan&nbsp;H&nbsp;Butts</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">giant 70 million year old fish</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1601884/1601884_10426469_1603382718197_mayajumanYALE--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1601884/1601884_10426469_1603382718197_mayajumanYALE--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Yale undergraduate student digitizing\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1601884/1601884_10426469_1603382718197_mayajumanYALE--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Yale undergraduate student digitizing\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Fourteen undergraduate students gained experience digitizing fossils and learning how museum collections support scientific research.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Susan Butts</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Susan&nbsp;H&nbsp;Butts</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Yale undergraduate student digitizing</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1601884/1601884_10426469_1603382875790_ethanchristinajasmine--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1601884/1601884_10426469_1603382875790_ethanchristinajasmine--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"3D image capture\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1601884/1601884_10426469_1603382875790_ethanchristinajasmine--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"3D image capture\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">High school interns assist in 3D image capture of 68 million year old fossils.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Susan Butts</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (restricted use -
