 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Arctic Research Consortium of the U.S. (ARCUS) will administer and implement \"PolarTREC - Teachers and Researchers Exploring and Collaborating\", a program that brings together U.S. teachers to participate in cutting-edge field research with polar scientists in various, and often remote, locations in the Arctic and Antarctica. Through hands-on field experiences in the Arctic and Antarctica, participating teachers (pre-service and in-service) will improve teaching strategies, develop resources for their careers, and change how they teach STEM in the classroom. The program goal is to invigorate polar science education and understanding by bringing educators and polar researchers together in professional collaboration. By integrating research and education, PolarTREC will help sustain and grow the considerable academic and public enthusiasm for polar research and education. \r\n\r\nThe award provides funding for ARCUS to support 12 teacher-researcher teams during 2016. ARCUS will recruit, select, and match teachers and researchers, maintain a website for dissemination of information about the expeditions, provide orientation training for the teachers that includes field safety and communication training, provide travel support for the teachers to meet with scientists prior to deployments and for them to join the scientific expeditions in the field, and evaluate results of the program. Teachers will participate in a variety of outreach events following their deployments to ensure dissemination of information about the polar science and educational activities related to their scientific expeditions.",

All 15 teachers were either middle school or high school teachers from around the United States. All the teachers took part in an Orientation before they joined their research team. Training involves teachers learning how to use technology to communicate science, safety training, working with team training, and how to best prepare and use this experience in the classrooms. Soon after training, teachers began heading to the various field locations, starting in the late spring of 2016 and continuing through late January 2017. In the field, the teachers work very closely with the researchers and learn how to collect data, record data, and even analyze the data. They become an integral part of the team. Our program is also evaluated by an outside evaluator and they report that researchers enjoy having teachers on their teams as they are integral in both helping collect the scientific data as well as sharing the science with the public.
