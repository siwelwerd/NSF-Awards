 "awd_abstract_narration": "Since 1997, the National Science Foundation (NSF) has required that all proposals submitted for funding explicitly address two review criteria: intellectual merit and broader impacts. Advances in both intellectual merit and broader impacts are essential if NSF is to achieve its mission \"to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare; to secure the national defense; and for other purposes.\"  The two criteria are often considered separately in developing and reviewing projects.  A conceptual framework for understanding the various dimensions of the two criteria and their potential synergy may lead to projects with greater societal value. \r\n\r\nThis workshop brings together thought-leaders from the Civil, Mechanical, and Industrial Engineering academic research communities to define a roadmap for broader Impact innovations. Participants are academic researcher leaders who have demonstrated innovation in broader impact activities -- creating measurable economic, human capital, and societal value through their research. A publicly available workshop report will define innovative approaches to enhancing the broader impact from NSF-funded research.  Subsequent presentations and publications by workshop participants will make these ideas widely available to the community.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "This grant provided funding to support a workshop to promulgate the value of Broader Impact activities, and provide ideas and guidelines to facilitate quantum leaps forward to enhance NSF?s investments in basic research.  On 26-27 May 2016, a group of 30 researchers and administrators in the areas of mechanical, industrial manufacturing, and civil engineering met to discuss a plan to uncover how investments made by NSF in these areas can be enhanced via Broader Impact contributions.  A series of presentations on Broader Impact contributions by academic thoughts leaders in these engineering research communities, plus a vibrant discussion on the issues related to Broader Impact, led to several key points that could add value to NSF?s basic research investments:\n\n1)      Broader Impact can and should be held to the same level as Intellectual Merit when evaluating research proposals.  Therefore, transformative ideas in both Intellectual Merit and Broader Impact are feasible and should be encouraged.\n\n2)      Information/Communication, Global Leadership, People, Economic, Quality of Life, and National Interests outline how Broader Impact activities can be classified.  It would benefit NSF and PIs to classify their proposed Broader Impact activities using these guidelines.\n\n3)      The time horizon over which the impact of Broader Impact activities can be realized can vary.   It would benefit NSF and PIs to classify their proposed Broader Impact activities based on the time horizon over which they will be conducted and their impact realized.\n\n4)      Institutions and PIs should work together to leverage their efforts in producing innovative meaningful Broader Impact activities.\n\n5)      NSF can work with the academic research community to educate how Broader Impacts can be better evaluated in the large scope of federally funded research support, with the goal to enhance the societal output value from such investments.   \n\n \n\nThe results of this workshop have been communicated via professional magazine publications and presentations at national conferences, to provide the greatest footprint of reach for the ideas and recommendations that percolated from the workshop. The workshop served not to mark a definitive end point for the Broader Impacts discussion, but rather, to create a starting point for discussions on how investments made by NSF can be enhanced and elevated based on Broader Impacts.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/14/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Sheldon H Jacobson"
