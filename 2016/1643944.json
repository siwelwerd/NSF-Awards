 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will establish a scholarship program through a consortium of two four-year institutions in Texas and California and two partner two-year colleges: the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP), California State University-Stanislaus (CSU-S), El Paso Community College (EPCC), and Merced College (MC). The project will prepare low-income, academically talented students to enter the workforce in the high demand areas of computer science and cyber-security. S-STEM scholars will participate in co-curricular activities that actively engage them in professional development activities that support their trajectories through undergraduate studies, in particular from two-year colleges to four-year institutions, and onto advanced degrees. The project will build on the effective practices and strategies of the Computing Alliance of Hispanic-Serving Institutions (CAHSI), funded by NSF (CNS-1042341).  As the lead institution of CAHSI, UTEP will coordinate the implementation in this project of activities based on CAHSI's proven practices that support student success. Such activities include: the Affinity Research model that focuses on student professional, communication, and research/workplace skills development; mentoring that provides access to resources, information, and guidance; and the CAHSI Summit that provides opportunities for students to network with industry representatives, participate in technical workshops, and prepare for interviews and internships. The project will have a dedicated website hosted by each participating four-year institution, and it will use social media to reach potential applicants. In addition, each four year institution will employ face-to-face recruitment activities that include an annual two-day event for a pool of potential applicants from area high schools, the university, and partnering two-year colleges. The event will include highly interactive activities to build interest in computing degrees and discuss career pathways, including jobs in industry, government, non-governmental organizations, and entrepreneurial opportunities. The activities will also stress the importance of advanced education.\r\n\r\nThe project will investigate the effectiveness of integrated evidence-based practices with the targeted student population and will contribute to the existing knowledge base with new understandings regarding factors that lead to the recruitment, retention, and degree attainment of the target population of students in computing. In particular, it will identify to what extent students pursue cyber-security as an area of expertise and which activities are particularly compelling for students. The research will utilize a sociocultural, situated learning lens to examine how S-STEM scholars develop and expand communities of computing practice. Research methods include the following: participant observation, semi-structured individual and group interviews, document analysis (including institutional research data analysis), and survey methods. Analysis will involve inductive and deductive coding practices, constant comparative analysis, and statistical analysis of differences in student outcomes (e.g., transfer rate, GPA, intentions for graduate school). The research study will inform the education research and CS communities about the specific elements that are needed to create inclusive learning environments in computing, while also building a much-needed foundation of knowledge on factors that facilitate the adoption and sustainability of evidence-based reforms that serve low income, highly qualified students in computing.",

The four-institution consortium is made up of two four-year institutions, the University of Texas at El Paso and California State University Stanislaus, as well as two partnering two-year colleges, the El Paso Community College and Merced College. <strong>The specific goals of the project</strong> are to: 1) provide financial support to low-income, academically talented students who are at two-year institutions seeking an associate degree in CS and planning to transfer to a four-year institution, and those at four-year institutions in computer science disciplines; 2) integrate quality evidence-based practices grounded in social science research for the recruitment, retention, and placement of students in computing-related fields or graduate studies; and 3) contribute to the existing knowledge base with new understandings regarding factors that lead to the recruitment, retention, and degree attainment of the target population of students</p>\n<p>The program funded a total of 108 students across Texas and California. 43% (46) of the students funded were females. 23 students earned an associate degree in CS from a two-year institution in their way to completing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS) degree from a four-year institution. Of the funded students, 85 have earned a BSCS degree with 17 more expected to earn a BSCS degree in Spring 2023. In total, 102 (95%) of the funded students have earned at least a BSCS. Of the funded students, 16 (17%) have completed or are in the process of completing a graduate degree, 50 (46%) have completed an internship, 104 (96%) have attended at least one conference, and 41 (38%) have been involved in undergraduate research.&nbsp; Significant engagement of S-STEM Scholars in extracurricular activities such as internships, research, and conference attendance, have resulted in those students' ability to secure lucrative positions in industry and government upon their graduation. Of the students supported through the scholarship and graduated in Texas many have secured jobs at entities that include Microsoft, Google, NASA, USAA, AT&amp;T, JP Morgan, Leidos, Johns Hopkins' Applied Research Laboratories, and the US Army Research Lab. Of the students supported through the scholarship in California, many have secured jobs at entities that include Amazon, US Marine Corps, G3, Google, and Northrop Grumman.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In addition to students' success and advancement, a key outcome of this project is the <strong>establishment of significant collaborations between the two-year and four-year institutions</strong>. Mainly because of the establishment of the four-institution consortium, a significant collaboration between the two-year and four-year institutions has materialized. This includes more work on curriculum alignment, smooth students' transfer from two-year to four-year institutions, and collaborative research work between students in both types of institutions. In addition, this S-STEM consortium has contributed significantly to two of the pilot projects (Southwest and Northern California Pilots) that are part of the NSF funded CAHSI-Includes project which was funded by NSF in 2019. In interviews, students who transferred from the two year to the four-year schools indicated that the program created a cohort of transfer students and of students who were already adept at navigating the four-year departments which supported their retention in the major.</p>\n<p><strong>Research</strong> conducted throughout the project gave insights into how Computer Science departments might create conditions for students' development of capital. Our research shows that students need space and opportunity to build relationships with one another, and those from either side of their cohort (just ahead and just behind). Institutionalizing these opportunities through dedicated resources (e.g., physical space for student coordination of activity) could support social capital development, as well as the brokered capital that often arises from peer relationships. Students need to have access to conferences that highlight a diversity of identities in STEM, particularly in the field of Computer Science. Faculty can promote and encourage participation through their own guidance and can offer experienced students opportunities to communicate benefits to their peers</p>\n<p>The many successes of this S-STEM Scholars program have resulted in the funding of a subsequent NSF S-STEM grant which will span from 2022 to 2028 and support over 80 students at the four institutions.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/30/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Salamah&nbsp;Salamah</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1643944/1643944_10462716_1672418138501_SSTEMATWiCyS--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1643944/1643944_10462716_1672418138501_SSTEMATWiCyS--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"WiCyS\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1643944/1643944_10462716_1672418138501_SSTEMATWiCyS--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"WiCyS\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">S-STEM Students at the WiCyS Conference in 2016</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">UTEP</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Salamah&nbsp;Salamah</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">WiCyS</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1643944/1643944_10462716_1672418697517_GHC--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1643944/1643944_10462716_1672418697517_GHC--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"GHC\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1643944/1643944_10462716_1672418697517_GHC--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"GHC\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">S-STEM Students at the GHC in 2022</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">UTEP</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Salamah&nbsp;Salamah</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">GHC</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1643944/1643944_10462716_1672418766149_GoogLE--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1643944/1643944_10462716_1672418766149_GoogLE--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Google\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1643944/1643944_10462716_1672418766149_GoogLE--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Google\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">S-STEM Students at Google</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">UTEP</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Salamah&nbsp;Salamah</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Google</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1643944/1643944_10462716_1672418850420_2017GMiSHackathon--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1643944/1643944_10462716_1672418850420_2017GMiSHackathon--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"GMiS Hackathon\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1643944/1643944_10462716_1672418850420_2017GMiSHackathon--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"GMiS Hackathon\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Students participate in the Cybersecurity Hackathon at the Great Minds in STEM conference in 2017</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">UTEP</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Salamah&nbsp;Salamah</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">GMiS Hackathon</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1643944/1643944_10462716_1672419037084_HackathonWinners--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1643944/1643944_10462716_1672419037084_HackathonWinners--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Hackathon Winners\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1643944/1643944_10462716_1672419037084_HackathonWinners--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Hackathon Winners\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">UTEP/ARL Cybersecurity Hackathon 2019 winners</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">UTEP</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Salamah&nbsp;Salamah</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Hackathon Winners</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
