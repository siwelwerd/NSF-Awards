 "awd_abstract_narration": "The XXXV Workshop on Geometric Methods in Physics will take place in Bialowieza, Poland, from June 26 to July 2, 2016, and will be followed by the School on Geometry and Physics, from July 4 to July 9, 2016. The goal of this project is to increase the attendance of US-based researchers, particularly early-career faculty, postdocs, graduate students, and those without other forms of support. The series of Workshops on Geometric Methods in Physics, which has been organized by the Department of Mathematical Physics of the University of Bialystok, Poland, was created with the mission of bringing together an international community that works on a broad spectrum of problems inspired by physics; areas of special emphasis include harmonic analysis, infinite-dimensional groups, integrable systems, Lie groupoids and Lie algebroids, mathematical aspects of field theory, noncommutative geometry, operator algebras, quantization, symplectic and Poisson geometry. The series has achieved international reputation and was featured in the Newsletters of the European Mathematical society. In 2012, a summer school was added, to follow the workshop and offer nonexperts an in-depth training on selected themes of the meeting, to further promote active research and collaboration. In this 35st edition, there will be a special session on integrable systems.\r\n\r\nThe workshop is expected to promote intense activity and new collaborations in areas of theoretical mathematics that are instrumental to solve problems in physics, and reciprocally have been enriched by them, ranging from algebraic geometry to representations of infinite-dimensional Lie groups to symplectic, Poisson and noncommutative geometry. The special session will focus on the geometric, algebraic and analytic features of completely integrable systems. Plenary speakers in the special session on Integrable systems and Geometry will include E. Previato, C. Roger, L. Takhtajan, and V. Zakharov, representing very different facets of the subject. Discussion on open problems is also planned. The 2016 WGMP will be the occasion for a diverse community of experts and rising experts to come together with significant potential for advancement. \r\n\r\nDetails of speakers and participants, logistic and scientific information can be found on the conference website: http://wgmp.uwb.edu.pl",
