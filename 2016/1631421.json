 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests funding to partially support a workshop that will promote greater communication between the Science of Science and Innovation Policy (SciSIP) academic community and science policy decision-makers within the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The goal of the workshop is to enhance the quality and relevance of SciSIP research by: (1) making S.ciSIP researchers more aware of the key policy issues and problems confronting NIH leadership, (2) enhancing understanding of both public and administrative data generated by NIH that may be useful for SciSIP research, (3) increasing NIH leadership?s understanding of how both public and administrative data might facilitate SciSIP research, and (4) identifying the major hurdles to data access for SciSIP researchers and propose solutions to resolve them.  \r\n\r\n\r\nThis workshop addresses this question by bringing together SciSIP researchers and officials at NIH, one of the largest funders of extramural basic science, in a structured format intended to concentrate discussion on key issues that require greater understanding on both sides. The outcome of the workshop will be smoother interaction between the research community and NIH officials and greater access to data necessary to advance the SciSIP research agenda.",
