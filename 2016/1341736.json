 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project will characterize the functional, taxonomic, biotic and abiotic drivers of soil ecosystems in the Trans Antarctic Mountains (one of the most remote and harsh terrestrial landscapes on the planet).  The work will utilize new high-throughput DNA and RNA sequencing technologies to identify members of the microbial communities and determine if the microbial community structures are independent of local environmental heterogeneities.  In addition the project will determine if microbial diversity and function are correlated with time since the last glacial maximum (LGM).  The expected results will greatly contribute to our knowledge regarding rates of microbial succession and help define the some of the limits to life and life-maintaining processes on Earth.\r\n\r\nThe project will analyze genomes and RNA derived from these genomes to describe the relationships between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning from soils above and below LGM elevations and to correlate these with the environmental drivers associated with their development during the last ~18,000 years. The team will identify the taxonomic diversity and the functional genetic composition within a broad suite of soil biota and examine their patterns of assembly and distribution within the framework of their geological legacies. The project will mentor participants from undergraduate students to postdoctoral researchers and prepare them to effectively engage in research to meet their career aspirations. The project will contribute to ongoing public education efforts through relationships with K-12 teachers and administrators- to include University-Public School partnerships. Less formal activities include public lecture series and weblogs aimed at providing information on Antarctic polar desert ecosystems to the general public. Targeted classrooms near each PI's institution will participate in online, real-time discussions about current topics in Antarctic ecosystems research.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIn December 2017 through January 2018, we successfully executed our field research plan to study how the soil ecosystems in the Shackleton Glacier region of Antarctica have responded to deglaciation since the last ice age.  To achieve this, we collected over 230 soil samples along elevational transects at 13 different locations, spanning a distance of over 130 km and 2,000m in elevation.  We identified the organisms in the soil, their relative abundance, and potential functions.  We also characterized in fine detail the chemical composition of each soil sample.  Using this information, we were able to make several exciting discoveries:\n\nFirst, using the rate at which soils accumulate nitrogen from the atmosphere and radiometric dating we developed a novel way to estimate the age of these soils.  Next, we identified relationships between soil age and soil habitat harshness.  Older soils at higher elevations receive less frequent liquid water and accumulate harsher salts, and in higher concentrations, making them less suitable habitat for soil organisms.  Soils at lower elevations and closer to the glacier receive more frequent wetting, are more leeched of salts, and provide more suitable habitat for soil biota.  Exploring this relationship further, we found predictable patterns of biotic communities.  The abundance and diversity of life was highest at the low-elevation sites which were typically warmer and wetter.  Higher, drier, colder, and saltier soils harbored less taxonomically and functionally diverse communities. \n\nAt the harshest location we identified, for the first time, soil that was devoid of life.  This is especially surprising given that these soils have been exposed to the atmosphere for millions of years.  At the margins of habitability, we also found that the single-celled microbes capable of living under the harshest conditions have evolved a very slow-growing strategy, and likely use atmospheric dihydrogen, carbon dioxide, and carbon monoxide as sources of energy. \n\nWe also showed how soil communities assemble during periods of glacial recession.  Using the reconstructed evolutionary history of some of these organisms, we recovered and corroborated the timing of the waxing and waning of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet over the past 20 million years.  This finding informs fundamental questions associated with climate change, including predictions about the rate and magnitude of sea level rise.\n\nThroughout the course of this project our research findings were highlighted by several popular news and media outlets.  We gave accessible presentations of our research to the broader public through participation in highly publicized, high-profile lecture series, and partnered with local educators to engage hundreds of K-12 students and several teachers in our activities.  This project also directly supported the training of several postdocs, graduate, and undergraduate students, and successfully implemented measures to improve the representation of BIPOC participants in our research, outreach, and education activities.\n\nThe outcomes of this project inform fundamental ecological and evolutionary processes associated with how organisms and ecosystems respond to climate-driven changes.  It also shines a light on the boundary conditions of life on Earth and provides insight into the possibility of finding life (as we know it) elsewhere in our solar system (and beyond).  The products of our project built capacity and representation in STEM and continues to be disseminated to a broad, lay audience.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/24/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Byron J Adams"
