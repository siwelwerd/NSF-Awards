 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract - You, 1554558\r\n\r\nPublic interest in carbon and water footprints, ecosystem degradation and resource depletion, are just some of the environmental issues that drive the process industries to exercise greater responsibility for the environment in the design and operations of their manufacturing systems. This increasing emphasis on sustainability has driven a shift in process systems design and optimization from the traditional, economics-oriented methods towards methods that balance environmental protection in addition to economic profitability. This project is aimed at incorporating sustainability principles systematically and effectively into the design and optimization of process systems. Previously, such efforts were limited to the process boundary, while now, the boundary has expanded to include the life cycle. This broader perspective reduces the chance of unintended externalities by shifting the problem outside a narrow process boundary. Research challenges arise from the large size and scope of the problem, the multiscale nature of models and data, the potential presence of multiple non-cooperative decision makers, and the high degrees of uncertainty across temporal scales. \r\n\r\nThe objective of this project is to address the fundamental issues associated with multi-scale sustainability optimization of process systems design and operations decisions. This work will augment process systems engineering tools on supply chain optimization, sustainable engineering and the treatment of uncertainties. The research activities are to develop: (1) a systematic study and a novel multi-scale life cycle process systems optimization (LCPSO) framework that accounts for and optimizes the direct and indirect environmental impacts from the foreground process systems scale and from the background economy scale through the integration of process systems optimization with process-based and input-output-based models; (2) a novel and transformative LCPSO framework based on game theoretical modeling for non-cooperative supply chains with multiple individual decision-makers to account for the life cycle environmental sustainability and economic objectives of individual decision makers; and (3) a new approach for quantifying the role of uncertainties at multiple temporal scales for LCPSO.\r\n\r\nThe research has the potential to improve the economic competitiveness and environmental sustainability of the process industries. The results will offer insights to identify sustainable strategies for (re-)designing process systems and improving operational practices. The proposed optimization algorithms could result in benefits beyond the chemical engineering community and find applications in other arenas where systematic decision-making is pursued. The results will be integrated into education and outreach activities in the following areas: (1) incorporation of research findings into \"Chemical Engineering Design Projects\" and \"Process Optimization\" courses; (2) enhancing undergraduate students' participation in research; (3) working with a local, predominantly minority high school for an interactive STEM Saturdays outreach program; and (4) development of a \"Distinguished Junior Researcher Seminar Series\" by inviting junior research scholars in related fields to deliver seminars at the PI's institution.",

At the fundamental level, we developed novel systems methodologies on life cycle optimization, including the state-of-the-art integrated hybrid life cycle optimization framework, the consequential life cycle optimization concept, and the game-theory-based life cycle optimization approach. We also pioneered the fundamental study on data-driven adaptive robust optimization for tackling uncertainty in various process operations and control problems. At the application level, we explored and extended the applications of the proposed lifecycle-based methodologies and data-driven optimization under uncertainty approaches for various applications, including chemical manufacturing, shale gas supply chain, biorefinery and biofuel systems, plastics recycling, bitcoin mining, solar cell recycling, and carbon-neutral hybrid energy systems (for Cornell campus and New York State, among others).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The proposed research methodologies and their innovative applications potentially improved the economic competitiveness and environmental sustainability of the process and energy industries. The results offer insights to identify sustainable strategies for (re-)designing process and energy systems and improving operational practices and control systems. The proposed optimization algorithms for tackling uncertainty using machine learning and robust optimization led to benefits beyond the chemical engineering community and found applications in other arenas where systematic decision-making is pursued (e.g., electric power systems, transportation, finance, etc.). The results were integrated into education and outreach activities in the following areas: (1) incorporation of research findings into undergraduate senior Process Design courses and graduate-level \"Computational Optimization\" and \"Machine Learning and Data Analytics\" courses; (2) enhancing undergraduate students' participation in research by engaging/funding around a dozen of undergraduate students, most of who had co-authored publications; and (3) successful development of a \"Distinguished Junior Researcher Seminar Series\" by inviting junior research scholars in related fields to deliver seminars at Northwestern University and Cornell University; most selected speakers of this program are now taking faculty positions in leading chemical engineering departments in the U.S.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/01/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Fengqi&nbsp;You</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1643244/1643244_10406596_1664651149306_Picture1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1643244/1643244_10406596_1664651149306_Picture1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Multi-scale life cycle optimization\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1643244/1643244_10406596_1664651149306_Picture1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Multi-scale life cycle optimization\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Multi-scale life cycle optimization framework applied to problems ranging from molecules to global ecosystems.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Fengqi You</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Fengqi&nbsp;You</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Multi-scale life cycle optimization</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1643244/1643244_10406596_1664650731270_ascecg_NYS--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1643244/1643244_10406596_1664650731270_ascecg_NYS--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Multi-scale optimization for New York State Energy Transition.\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1643244/1643244_10406596_1664650731270_ascecg_NYS--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Multi-scale optimization for New York State Energy Transition.\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Cover art of the ACS Sustainable Chemistry & Engineering (Feb. 2022) based on our paper titled \ufffdToward Carbon-Neutral Electric Power Systems in the New York State: a Novel Multi-Scale Bottom-Up Optimization Framework Coupled with Machine Learning for Capacity Planning at Hourly Resolution\ufffd.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">American Chemical Society; Fengqi</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Fengqi&nbsp;You</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Multi-scale optimization for New York State Energy Transition.</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1643244/1643244_10406596_1664650913933_ascecg_plastics--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1643244/1643244_10406596_1664650913933_ascecg_plastics--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Life cycle optimization of chemical recycling of waste plastics\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1643244/1643244_10406596_1664650913933_ascecg_plastics--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Life cycle optimization of chemical recycling of waste plastics\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Our paper titled \ufffdConsequential Life Cycle Assessment and Optimization of High-Density Polyethylene Plastic Waste Chemical Recycling\ufffd (ACS Sustainable Chem.
