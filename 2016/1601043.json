 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is motivated by the growing demand for a middle-skill advanced manufacturing technician workforce in the region, and will focus on developing flexible career pathways with a particular emphasis on women and other rural students. The project team will work to modularize existing curricula as well as develop a core curriculum that will be used by advanced manufacturing technician tracks. The Northeast Iowa Community College NICC and a number of industry members and northeast Iowa secondary schools will collaborate closely in completing the project.\r\n\r\nThis study will examine the skills and body of knowledge required across advanced manufacturing technician occupations. Project activities will include 1) an analysis of common curricula in multiple technician programs, 2) training opportunities for secondary school teachers and College faculty to better align curriculum along the K-14 experience, 3) development of distance learning options to expand access, 4) a study of the efficacy of an open lab model that enables high school, college, career pathway students, and industry professionals to work simultaneously, 5) development of work experience options for technician students including apprenticeships. The results of this project will build on a body of evidence documenting the benefits of open lab structure, competency-based education, and co-operative education. Project activities will align the efforts of secondary educators, community college faculty, and industry needs.",
