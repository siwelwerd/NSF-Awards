 "awd_abstract_narration": "While people both in Japan and the United States are more likely to attend to objects in the foreground than the background of a visual scene, several studies show that people in the United States attend more to objects in the foreground than people in Japan. This difference has profound effects on how people interact with others and their surroundings. The underlying reasons for this difference are unexplored. Possible explanations include differences in social values (e.g. group cohesion vs. self-independence), language background (e.g. English vs. Japanese) or physical environment (e.g. the way buildings and roads are structured in Japan vs. the U.S.). This award supports research to explore how these factors influence differences between the visual attention of people in Japan and the United States. The work will be performed in collaboration with Dr. Jun Saiki, an expert in vision science at Kyoto University.\r\n\r\nTo explore the underlying causes for visual attention differences between people in Japan and the United States, the fellow will conduct an eye-tracking experiment.  The experiment will measure the eye movements of people living in Japan as they look at visual scenes. The experiment will assess each individual's alignment towards individualism-collectivism, linguistic background, and their familiarity with particular physical layouts of cities in Japan and the United States. The data collected from participants in Japan will be compared to results from participants in the United States. By assessing how individual scores on measures of individualism-collectivism, language background, and physical environment familiarity predict differences in attention, this research will contribute to the understanding of how the interaction of these large-scale cultural factors modulate the visual attention preferences of individuals. \r\n\r\nThis award under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science.",

The primary goal of the research was to investigate cross-cultural differences in the visual attention of people in Japan and the United States.&nbsp;Several experimental studies show that people in Japan and the United States use different attentional strategies when looking at visual scenes.

People in Japan value group cohesion more and people in the United States value independence more, leading to different viewing strategies. For this project, the fellow conducted an experiment to assess how individual differences in several cultural factors -- social values, language background, and familiarity with particular physical environments -- predict performance in an eye-tracking task that measures visual attention. The results from participants in Japan were compared to results from participants in the United States, revealing significant differences between the eye fixations of participants in Japan and the United States. Further analysis investigating how individual differences predict this variation is currently in progress. In addition to research, the fellow was exposed to the Japanese culture and language.

This project provided undergraduate students at the fellow's home university -- many of whom are from minority populations and first generation college students -- with opportunities to engage with and learn about the research process.
