 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-technical Description: When a material's size is reduced to atomic dimensions, material properties become profoundly altered, and new opportunities emerge for discovering useful phenomena. An important example of this occurs in two dimensional materials, which are sheet-like objects that are just a few atoms thick. This project addresses fundamental challenges in understanding the behavior of these materials when the two dimensional materials are stacked on top of each other to build a multi-layered composite. The materials synthesized in this project are useful for information technology and energy conversion and storage. The research in this project is integrated into many aspects of outreach and education. The students who work on this project are exposed to advanced challenges in materials synthesis and characterization. This project also engages the broader public through several activities, including outreach to high-school students through demonstrations that use art supplies such as graphite, clay, and mica - all of which are built from two dimensional materials - to engage students in scientific inquiry.\r\n\r\nTechnical Description: Recent observations of emergent properties in few-flake stacks of graphene, boron nitride, and dichalcogenides, termed van der Waals heterostructures, have generated immense interest because of their remarkable electronic, optical, chemical, and mechanical properties. All of the studied van der Waals heterostructures are held together primarily by weak van der Waals interactions, highlighting an opportunity to design and understand multilayered materials that are held together by stronger forces, especially electrostatic forces. The primary research goal is to build model heterostructures and understand the principles that relate their structure to their electronic and photonic properties. This project combines experimental and theoretical approaches, including microspectroscopy to assess the optical properties, conductivity measurements to assess electronic coupling and charge transfer, and photoemission spectroscopy coupled with density functional theory calculations to assess band structure. Ultimately, an understanding of the structure-property relationships in these heterostructures can provide an important framework for designing the optoelectronic properties of these new materials.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIn this project, \"Layered Electrostatic Heterostructures for Electronics and Photonics\", a new class of two-dimensional materials was discovered and explored.  Two-dimensional materials are materials that are just one or a few atoms thick.  In this project, the researchers, led by Professor Scott Warren, discovered two-dimensional materials that have large concentrations of electrons on their surface.  Because these electrons are present on the material's surface, they are available for chemical reactions, for catalyzing reactions, or for being donated to other materials.  In fact, the researchers explored this final possibility -- the donation of electrons to other two dimensional materials.  The researchers described rules that govern how and whether electrons are transferred between two materials.  When electrons do transfer, the resulting materials have extremely different properties than their two distinct building blocks.  For example, the resulting materials are layered (in that they are made from two-dimensional materials) but held together by strong interactions (\"electrostatic interactions\").  This itself is a new category of layered materials, and the researchers explored the properties of these layered materials.  For example, the researchers discovered that the materials can be used in batteries, as lubricants, and in advanced electronic devices.  The researchers are continuing to explore these material properties, especially for use in batteries.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/18/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Scott Warren"
