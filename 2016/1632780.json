 "awd_abstract_narration": "This work aims to exploit recent advances in technology to shrink the cost and size of accelerator-based synchrotron radiation facilities to a level appropriate for typical university and industry labs, as well as hospitals.  Since their discovery in 1895, x-rays have been the single most powerful technique for determining the structure of all forms of materials. Through increasingly powerful techniques scientists and medical doctors, as well as quality-control inspectors, airline passenger screeners, and forensic investigators have resolved the length scales from the size of an atom to the size of the human body. Every day, that knowledge underpins our modern technologies, our health, and our safety. Today, however, the benchmark for x-ray performance is set by large accelerator-based synchrotron radiation facilities which, due to their size and cost, have to be located in national labs or major university facilities.  The goal of this project is to bring the same cutting-edge capability to a smaller and cheaper scale.\r\n\r\nThis research aims to test a disruptive hypothesis that modestly relativistic electron beams can generate and sustain density modulations at x-ray scale.  It aims to: (1) develop foundational understanding of diffraction of relativistic beams through experiments with thin slab Si crystals and to create a dynamical beam stop that extinguishes the forward beam; (2) determine the dependence of diffraction parameters on electron beam properties using experiment and simulation derived from first principles; (3) demonstrate that diffraction can result in a nanopatterned beam where Si grating structures and imaging optics are used to establish the density modulation in the patterned beam; (4) demonstrate that the nanopatterned beam retains its density modulation through acceleration with tunable period using a new state-of-the-art Arizona State University (ASU) accelerator facility.  This project will facilitate mentorship and training of the next generation of x-ray and accelerator scientists and engineers in the new world class accelerator R&D and x-ray science facility. Dissemination with global reach will be achieved through the Nanopatterned Electron Beams Discovery Mission website, which will host training modules that fortify hands-on instructional classroom outreach programs to middle and high-school students and through K-12 'Science is Fun' program at ASU.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nWe are pursuing novel methods of shaping relativistic electron beams produced by a high brightness linear accelerator into nanometer-scale bunches that can then be used to produce fully coherent ultrafast x-ray pulses in a future compact x-ray free-electron laser (CXFEL).  After producing the electrons several manipulations are needed to maneuver them into nanometer bunches, the first step of which was supported by this award.\n\nIn this first step we produce the bright electron beam and then diffract it through silicon crystal structures that have different patterns lithographically etched into them.  The crystal patterns consist of thin and thick sections, typically repeating with a fixed length period less than 500 nm to make effectively a grating structure.  The patterning of the silicon crystal determines the diffraction pattern produced by the electrons, which in turn can be manipulated to make nanometer-scale stripes of electrons.  When electrons diffract through a crystal structure, they produce well known patterns of spots known as Bragg diffraction patterns.  The probability of electrons diffracting into any particular spot is determined in part by the thickness of the crystal that the electrons travel through.  We used crystals with alternating thin and thick stripes to diffract electrons preferentially into one or another Bragg spot.  We then filtered the Bragg pattern by blocking all but one spot from continuing down the beamline.  We focus this one spot with quadrupole magnets to produce an image of the diffraction crystal. Because we have allowed only one spot to be focused, and all of the electrons in that spot came from either the thin or thick part (but not both) of the crystal, the resulting image is a set of stripes representing either the thin or thick parts of the crystal (we can choose either). Figure 1 shows an example of one of these images showing the excellent contrast achieved.  This is exactly what we need to further manipulate the electrons into nanometer bunches that will lase coherently. \n\nBeyond showing the basic principle of patterning via electron diffraction, we were also able to demonstrate that the electrons do very little damage to the silicon so that the crystals can last for weeks or months in the beam before being replaced.  We were also able to show that the lithographic methods can accurately etch particular thicknesses of silicon reliably and repeatably.\n\nFurthermore, we have shown that the electron beam quality needed for high fidelity imaging is achievable in modern high brightness photoinjectors and linear accelerators.  The beam quality includes very low normalized emittance, which is defined as the product of the beam size multiplied by its transverse momentum, very low energy spread, and very low shot-to-shot variations in the beam charge per pulse and the beam energy.  These studies are an important step toward generating fully coherent x-rays that are useful across the sciences including studies in biochemical reactions, fundamental atomic physics, and the development and study of new materials with novel quantum properties.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/18/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: William S Graves"
