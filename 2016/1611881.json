 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is now well known by the general public that El Ni\u00f1os have dramatic impacts world wide yet, in many ways there is still much to learn about these events and their effects. This project will help us to better understand past El Ni\u00f1os so that one can better prepare for them in the future. El Ni\u00f1os occur when warm waters from the South Pacific travel eastwards and override the cold waters of the Humboldt Current that flows from south to north along the coast of Peru. This produces rains on the normally arid Peruvian coast and droughts in the highlands but also affects the weather in Mexico, the Caribbean, the United States, and even Western Europe. El Ni\u00f1o-induced weather is radically different from normal variations in these areas  and usually results in severe impacts to economies and human lives. Knowing when El Ni\u00f1os occurred in the past, their intensities, and frequencies thus are important to help us understand El Ni\u00f1os in general and to learn how to avoid or mitigate their impacts. \r\n\r\nDr. Jeffrey Quilter of Harvard University will direct a small research team to focus on a specific aspect of El Ni\u00f1os on the coast of Peru that will produce important data and information. In the 15th century, ancient Peruvians built earthen aqueducts in their extensive canal systems. These aqueducts cut across the mouths of side canyons in larger valleys, thus creating dams for any water flowing through them during El Ni\u00f1o events. Over time, sediments from El Ni\u00f1o events were built up behind these aqueduct-dams.  While el Nino related sediments can be identified in relevant deposits it is not possible to determine rates associated with individual el Nino events. This award will permit measuring devices to be installed in areas behind multiple dams to determine sediment buildup resulting from heavy rainfall predicted to occur during the upcoming el Nino season. These deposits can then be analyzed to better understand earlier strata and the El Ni\u00f1os that deposited them. This work will be done in cooperation with Peruvian authorities who will monitor the events via drone technology as they happen.",

Technically a component of the El Ni&ntilde;o Southern Oscillation (ENSO), El Ni&ntilde;os begin with the movement of large masses of Southern Pacific warm waters eastward where they override the cold Humboldt Current directly offshore of the coast of Peru.

They tend to produce the inverse of &ldquo;normal&rdquo; conditions, such as rain in dry periods and drought in rainy seasons. Two decades ago, conventional wisdom stated that El Ni&ntilde;os occurred about every seven years. Since then, however, we have learned that the frequency of ENSOs and their intensities vary greatly.

Archaeology is an established discipline that can investigate the remote past, beyond historical records to look deep into prehistory. Following previous researchers, we employed methods to chronicle El Ni&ntilde;o events in prehistory with particular attention to the period of CE (&ldquo;AD&rdquo;) 1000&mdash;1450, when a prehistoric culture, the Chimu, built a complex empire on the North Coast of Peru.</p>\n<p>When El Ni&ntilde;o rains occur, they wash down the sides of small canyons (<em>quebradas</em>) and carry sediments and desert plant fragments with them. These materials are deposited in layers when the waters encounter barriers such as earthen aqueducts or mud-brick (adobe) architecture. We selected seven sections of such a Chimu aqueduct to place small excavations to search for layers of sediments in which we wished to find plant fragments that we could date using the radiocarbon method. Theoretically, we would be able to build a chronology of how many El Ni&ntilde;os had occurred during the more than four centuries in which the Chimu culture thrived in the region. We also took advantage of the El Ni&ntilde;o event of 2017 to place PVC pipe in the ground at the seven locations to gauge the quantity of sediment deposited against the aqueduct sections that we had selected.</p>\n<p>The results of our research were successful insofar as we successfully performed the tasks of investigating flood deposits and the 2017 El Ni&ntilde;o. What we discovered, however, was discouraging, because our work undermined our own presumptions and those of many other scholars before us. Although El Ni&ntilde;o rains do pond behind prehistoric canals that cut across quebrada mouths and produce graded sediment deposits (rhythmites) reflective of past discharge events caused by El Ni&ntilde;os,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there is not a one-to-one relationship between a single El Ni&ntilde;o event and a single deposit. Instead, there often are multiple rainfall events during any one El Ni&ntilde;o, stretching over months, including dry periods between each rainfall and quite likely producing multiple rhythmites. Indeed, recent research has shown that even in strong ENSO events the frequency, intensity, and even locations of rain over the coast of Peru can vary greatly.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Our work thus revealed that while the theory of the relationship between sediment deposits and El Ni&ntilde;os is sound, our ability to reconstruct prehistoric El Ni&ntilde;o frequency will require much more sophisticated and complex methods and greater abilities to identify and date different rhythmites. Thus, although we achieved negative results, we have contributed to the study of ENSOs by learning the limits of current science and have pointed the direction in which to advance such studies in the future.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span><br /></span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 03/16/2020<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Jeffrey&nbsp;Quilter</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1611881/1611881_10405244_1584139301518_Figure-3_Panorama--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1611881/1611881_10405244_1584139301518_Figure-3_Panorama--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 3_Panorama of a Study Area\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1611881/1611881_10405244_1584139301518_Figure-3_Panorama--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 3_Panorama of a Study Area\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Panorama of a Study Area</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">J.
