 "awd_abstract_narration": "Tribal communities represent the final frontiers of Internet access in the U.S., with fast (broadband) Internet access available to fewer than 10% of Native Americans on tribal reservation lands. The lack of broadband access is caused by a collection of challenges, including remote terrain, inadequate funding, and complex telecommunication policies. Yet Native Americans need reliable avenues for participation and contribution to Internet content to strengthen their communities. This project investigates technologies that will increase Internet availability on reservation lands.  Further, it will develop new methodologies of disseminating Internet content to reservation residents, prioritizing content by relevance during periods of limited connectivity.  Ethnographic methods and interviews of Native Americans residing on the reservations will be incorporated to ensure usability and utility of the proposed solutions.  Through the trial of the solutions within Southern California tribal communities, the work has the potential to reach over 2,700 homes and 60 community anchor institutions. Within the three participating institutions, the PIs will include in courses results from the research that demonstrate the positive humanitarian impact of computer science in order to increase the appeal of computer science to female and minority groups. \r\n\r\nThe goal of the research is to make critical inroads to addressing the lack of Internet access on tribal reservations, to increase the number of Native American reservation residents who are able to engage with, create, and disseminate Internet and on-line social network content. This project will achieve this goal through four related elements: (1) develop an architecture suitable for a multi-network setting comprised of cellular, wireless ISP and whitespace networks, where coverage, cost and network speed varies; (2) develop a tribal content distribution network, consisting of computation and storage at cellular, wireless ISP and white space towers across the reservation, that delivers content to and receives content from end users;  (3) conduct a limited empirical study of Internet use and organizational network technology use capacity within the TDV community using ethnographic methods to inform the content prioritization and distribution mechanisms.  Interviews will also be conducted and engaged in prototyping activities as needed to ensure that the system interfaces support use and administration by members of the community; (4) collect and analyze multiple years' worth of traffic from the TDV network to develop models of content relevance and consumption to prioritize content distribution in the network.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOverview: The goal of this project was to develop technologies to support communications and content production and dissemination among Native Americans through innovative and repurposed use of existing network infrastructures, novel software platforms, and deep analysis of communication practices, aspirations, and the organizational realities that, if ignored, can render any technological solution irrelevant. Central to our goals and approach was the deployability and acceptance of technologies we develop. True deployability is a challenge within the field of network research, but it is critical in the context of our work. \n\nIntellectual Merit: Relevant to these goals, this project had many innovative outcomes.  In partnership with a tribally-owned internet service provider in California, our team captured network traffic traces, for the three year project duration, that represented all flows transporting traffic in or out of the local network.  Through detailed analysis of traffic captured, we identified numerous critical nuances of Internet usage behavior that enabled us to develop Internet access solutions that could more optimally deliver traffic in this and similar communities.  As an example, our analysis demonstrated the high spatial locality of content interaction, whereby individuals in fairly isolated communities interact more heavily with content that has been locally generated.  Similarly, community members tend to exist predictable and similar Internet access patterns.  With this information, we developed the FiDO network architecture, whereby relevant Web content could be accurately predicted, proactively fetched and disseminated across a tribal content distribution network (tCDN).  The tCDN would then proactively push Web content to users as they traveled across regions of cellular access, without the need for users to engage with their phones, such that the content was available for browsing when the user arrived at their destination.\n\nAnother important outcome of this project is the successful installation of multiple TV white space (TVWS) network links, through which homes now have Internet access for the first time.  TVWS technology represents a new frontier in wireless communication.  Due to its long range and good penetration properties, TVWS offers the potential to bring broadband Internet access across sparse population densities that are common in rural and tribal areas.  This work studying the performance of the TVWS links, as well as the complex installation process itself, in order to further advance the technology and ready it for more widespread and easy deployment.\n\nA third technical contribution of this project is the development of a solution that can detect LTE overload via third party devices without requiring the cooperation of the cellular provider.  Through two ground measurement campaigns, we demonstrated that the rate of particular messages broadcast in the clear by LTE eNodeBs, such as Radio Resource Control Connection Reject and Cell-barring messages, can be used to accurately determine the level of overload on nearby eNodeBs.  This solution enables individuals to assess cellular network usability without requiring third party data or provider cooperation.\n\nBroader Impacts: The outcomes from this project were disseminated at multiple venues.  In addition to numerous publication and Ph.D. dissertations, the principal investigators disseminated results through multiple speaking engagements, including the Grace Murray Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing 2018; the Information and Communication Technologies and Development (ICTD) conferences; an NSF-funded workshop on Computing, Data Science, and Access to Justice; the Internet Society's Indigenous Connectivity Summit 2017; the Computing Research Association's CCC Symposium on Computing Research Addressing National Priorities and Societal Needs 2017; and UCSB Engineers with Borders student group, among others.  In addition, there have been multiple press releases and news stories covering the work and findings stemming from this award.\n\nIn addition, many MS and PhD students were involved in the project. Prior to this work, none had experience with field-site data collection, either quantitative measurement work or qualitative interviewing work. For the students who have graduated, their skills and experience acquired in the research were important components of their job resume. Further, students have learned how to meaningfully and respectfully engage with members of disenfranchised communities.\n\nFinally, tribal communities represent the final frontiers of Internet access in the U.S., with fast (broadband) Internet access available to fewer than 20% of Native Americans on tribal reservation lands.
