 "awd_abstract_narration": "A longstanding problem in astrophysics is to understand how galaxies form and develop throughout their lifetimes.  Such understanding is necessary to uncover the history of our Universe and to gain insight into the origin of our own Milky Way Galaxy.  Many research projects are centered on unraveling these mysteries.  Observations of nearby dwarf galaxies and of very distant galaxies hold clues about the nature of galaxy formation during the first billion years of the Universe, and these first galaxies are being detected by the Hubble Space Telescope and will be further elucidated with the commissioning of the James Webb Space Telescope in 2018.  To accurately interpret and connect these nearby and very distant galaxy observations, precise computer simulations that consider the entire star formation history are essential.  The purpose of this project is to make detailed computer simulations of the formation process of nearby dwarf and distant ultra-diffuse galaxies.  These simulations will track the complete star formation history of dwarf galaxies including their earliest stellar and galactic ancestors.  This project meets the national need to develop US scientific leadership in astrophysics.  This project will also strengthen the US science workforce by directly training students in computational astrophysics, high performance computing, and software engineering, which will enable these students to excel in a competitive job market.  In addition, the investigators' research activities will be integrated into the teaching of astrophysics in K--12 schools and other public venues, such as planetariums, television shows, and online learning environments, where the audience can digest the latest advances in computational astrophysics in a visual and intuitive manner.\r\n\r\nMore technically, this project has the following goals: (1) to explore formation scenarios for ultra-diffuse galaxies in cluster environments and to determine whether they are related to the formation sequence of dwarf spheroidal galaxies; (2) to construct novel, efficient, and accurate methods for radiation transport; (3) to correlate the high-redshift environment of dwarf galaxy formation and evolution to present-day characteristics---star formation histories, metallicity distribution functions, stellar kinematics, and [alpha/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] evolution; and (4) to determine the chemical connection between the first stars and metal-poor stars in dwarf galaxies.  This project will  support the development of a hybrid radiation transport solver that incorporates the advantages of both ray tracing methods and moment methods.  This method will be utilized in a suite of radiation hydrodynamics simulations of isolated dwarf galaxies, following their complete star formation, starting with individual massive metal-free stars.  The simulation data produced during the course of this project, as well as various data products, will be made publicly available through the nascent National Data Service.  These data will be usable by the astrophysical research community and will enable researchers to address a much broader range of questions than this project alone.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis award supported the study of the chemical enrichment of metal-poor stars that are some of the most ancient stars in the universe.  This award also supported the education of two graduate students at the Georgia Institute of Technology.  We used numerical simulations run on high-performance computing systems to investigate how ejecta from supernova in the early universe enriches low-mass stars that survive until the present day.  We primarily focused on the first generations of stars that were devoid of elements heavier than lithium and were mostly massive.  Thus a large fraction of these stars result in supernova explosions that provide the first heavy elements (metals) in the universe.  This marks a transition to more typical star and galaxy formation similar to processes seen today.  Because these first stars are generally massive, they have short lifetimes, and to date, no metal-free stars have been discovered in the Milky Way and nearby galaxies.  To study the first stars, we must resort to galactic archaeology that uses the elemental abundances in metal-poor stars as tracers of earlier star formation.\n\n\nOur cosmological simulations of the first stars and subsequent metal-enriched star formation pushed the state-of-the-art by including a coupled dust grain model and the transport of ionizing radiation.  Specifically, the dust model includes several different species whose abundances and sizes can change over their lifetime.  They are created just after a supernova explosion and react with other chemical species.  We found that faint supernova are responsible for the creation of carbon-enhanced extremely metal-poor (CEMP) stars that have very low iron abundances, dissimilar to almost all stars in our Milky Way.  Carbon grains that are produced in the lead-up to CEMP star formation provide an efficient pathway to radiative cooling that is necessary for low-mass star formation.  This project also included ionizing radiation transport, which is essential to determine an accurate thermodynamic state of the pre-galactic gas and the mass function of ensuing star formation.  We prototyped a new method of radiation transport as a part of this project that combines two existing methods, ray tracing and moment-based methods.  It is computationally efficient for simulations with large numbers of radiation sources, a characteristic of moment-based methods, while maintaining a high level of accuracy associated with ray tracing.  This software will be incorporated into future versions of our simulation code Enzo.\n\nThis project supported a workshop on running cosmological simulations with our open-source code Enzo and its successor Enzo-E that is capable of exascale calculations.  Twenty young researchers from North America, Europe, India, and the Middle East attended this workshop.  The core developers of Enzo and Enzo-E guided them through tutorials of running simulations and the basics of further developing the code.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/20/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: John Wise"
