 "awd_abstract_narration": "When going from a dark movie theater into the bright sunshine, vision is initially overwhelmed by the suddenly bright light levels, but after time we are again able to see well. This process, called light adaptation, involves a change in the sensitivity of neurons in the retina of the eye. Although retinal adaptation to brighter light levels is a crucial function of the visual system, the changes that happen in the retina to enable this adaptation are not well understood. Previous work has suggested that release of the chemical dopamine from retinal neurons is responsible for light adaptation, but the details of how this works are not clear. This study will determine what changes are occurring in the retina to allow adaptation to increasing light levels and determine how dopamine is changing visual signaling. Additionally, since the retina is an easily accessible part of the brain, these experiments can be used as a model for how dopamine changes the responses of groups of neurons. Dopamine signaling is important throughout the brain and in disorders such as Parkinson's disease. As part of this research, educational materials will also be developed with students to explain how light adaptation works and the importance of this process for normal vision. These materials will be used to increase interest in science for high school students, many of whom are underrepresented in science, and the public through outreach at a yearly festival and web interactions. \r\n\r\nLight adaptation is a crucial retinal signaling mechanism that allows the visual system to avoid saturation by resetting the gain of neuronal signaling. Light adaptation also increases visual acuity by increasing the response of ganglion cells, the output neurons of the retina, to small light stimuli. Inhibition of bipolar cells, which relay information to ganglion cells, influences ganglion cell spatial resolution. Therefore, light adaptation modulation of bipolar cell inhibition could increase visual acuity. However, the role of inhibition in light adaptation is not known. Modulation of inhibition may be especially important to adaptation of the retinal pathway that responds to the offset of light (OFF), as inhibitory inputs to OFF-bipolar cells switch between dim light rod and bright light cone sources and light adaptation decreases the spatial extent of inhibition to OFF-bipolar cells. This suggests a model where light adaptation narrowing of bipolar cell inhibition underlies the changes in ganglion cell spatial signaling. It is unknown how narrowing of OFF-bipolar cell inhibition will affect OFF-ganglion cell signaling or what mechanisms underlie the OFF-bipolar cell changes. Dopamine is a key neuromodulator of retinal light adaptation. Dopamine-mediated uncoupling of gap junctions and/or increases in inhibitory connections between upstream neurons might narrow OFF-bipolar cell inhibition. However, the role of dopamine modulation of physiological inhibition is not known. These proposed mechanisms for light adaptation of OFF pathway inhibition and their effects on retinal acuity will be tested using a combination of single-cell electrophysiology, morphology, genetic mouse models and optogenetic activation of retinal neurons.",

The ability to respond to increasing light intensities is called light adaptation. Light adaptation reduces the sensitivity of retinal neurons, so they are not overwhelmed by bright lights. Light responses of the retina start with photoreceptors (rod and cones) that signal to bipolar cells and then ganglion cells, the output neurons of the retina. The signals in this pathway are modulated by inhibition from horizontal cells and amacrine cells. Dopamine release from amacrine cells is partly responsible for light adaptation. This grant was part of my long-term goal to understand how modulation of the inner retina that consists of bipolar, amacrine and ganglion cells, contributes to visual signaling. My objective in this grant was to test the role of several potential mechanisms in modulating inhibition to and output from the inner retina with light adaptation. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that light adaptation modulates the magnitude and spatial extent of inhibition to bipolar cells that respond to the offset of light from cone photoreceptors &ndash; OFF cone bipolar cells. The research from this grant had several outcomes that have either been published in scientific journals or have been presented at scientific conferences and will be submitted for publication. We found that activating a type of receptor for dopamine &ndash; the D1 receptor- replicates the effects of light adaptation on inhibition to OFF cone bipolar cells. We also found that activating dopamine D1 receptors reduces the spatial extent of OFF cone bipolar cell inhibition, which would lead to increased input to retinal ganglion cells. Additionally, we found that ganglion cell inputs are modulated by both dopamine type 1 and type 4 receptors, and that the combined input replicates many components of light adaptation. Finally, we have used a new optogenetic system to analyze inhibition to bipolar cells by being able to activate inputs directly, with direct activation of a light sensitive channel expressed in amacrine cells. This system showed that activating amacrine cell inputs directly showed similar roles of dopamine receptors and was similar to normal light activation of photoreceptors in the retina. We plan to use this for many future studies. In addition to the research studies, my goal to broaden the impact of this research was to create new outreach tools and a blog with a group of undergraduates and use these tools to teach K-12 children and the general public about retinal research. For this broader impacts goal, I formed a group of undergraduates who named themselves the Arizona RETINA (Researcher Educating Tucson in Natural-light Adaptation) Project. These students developed and presented outreach activities related to the retina and vision and published social media posts to educate people about the retina and vision, both healthy and in diseases. Over the course of this grant, I have worked with 34 undergraduates who have published ~1000 posts and Twitter threads that were viewed &gt; 230,000 times on social media. We have also presented the outreach activities we developed at events around Tucson to thousands of people.
