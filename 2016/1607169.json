 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Syracuse group will support the search for gravitational waves by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO), with special emphasis on the search for signals from binary star systems consisting of black holes and/or neutron stars. The group's research will be aimed at developing better ways to recognize brief intervals of time when LIGO's data is of poor quality or when one of the LIGO interferometers generates a spurious signal. This work will improve the sensitivity of searches for new signals by increasing our confidence that weak signals are real astronomical events, not instrumental artifacts. The group will continue to train students and postdocs who will be tomorrow's leading scientists. The P.I. will also support broader understanding in the community by completing the editing of a book on the technology of gravitational wave interferometers, and by consulting with sociologist Prof. Harry Collins as he completes his study of the history of gravitational wave detection and hands off the project to a new generation of scholars.\r\n\r\n   In support of LIGO's search for signals from compact binary systems, the group will develop a new technique for distinguishing between genuine black hole binary signals and instrumental transients that mimic signals, improving the sensitivity and reliability of the search. They will improve on tools for associating transients in auxiliary data channels with spurious binary signals in the main gravitational wave channel. The group will also build tools for exploring the LIGO data via audio methods, and will compile a library of standard sound files for comparison with interesting events. They will develop new tools for examining data quality in close to real time, in support of the effort to link gravitational wave signals with electromagnetic observations. By learning better ways to distinguish between genuine gravitational wave signals and instrumental artifacts, the Syracuse group will improve the sensitivity of LIGO's searches and increase the believability of its results. This research will also enable instrument specialists to focus more clearly on instrumental problems that are detrimental to searches for signals, leading to further improved performance.",
