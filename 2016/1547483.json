 "awd_abstract_narration": "The strength and direction of Earths magnetic field varies in both time and space. These variations are recorded in a variety of geological materials, and by interpreting the records we learn about processes deep in Earth's liquid core (where the field is generated); about how the Earth and our atmosphere have evolved over geologic time; and we can use knowledge of field variations to put age constraints on geologic formations and some archeological artifacts. Although it is relatively easy to recover the direction of Earth's field, it is far more difficult to recover field strength (also known as 'paleointensity'). Typically, laboratory procedures designed to recover paleointensity are only appropriate for very small (less than a few tens of nanometers) magnetic crystals, but these small crystals are rare in nature. Volcanic glass (such as obsidian) is one material in which they are relatively abundant, and previous work has demonstrated that in some cases geologically young volcanic glass accurately records paleointensity. Glass is not a stable material, however, and the glass structure changes over time and with the absorption of water. If the magnetic minerals also change after the initial formation of the glass, they most likely will not provide us with accurate paleointensity information. The proposed work will provide an understanding of how magnetic mineralogy varies with the age and water content of natural glasses and will allow us to evaluate the suitability of natural volcanic glass as a paleointensity recorder over geologic time. In addition to the impact on geoscience disciplines, natural glasses have long been considered an analogue for nuclear waste glasses and other hazardous waste glasses. The proposed work may contribute to our ability to monitor incipient alteration of waste glasses via magnetic properties.\r\n\r\nTechnical description:\r\n\r\nAlthough knowledge of the strength of Earth's magnetic field through time ('paleointensity') is critical in our understanding of field generation and evolution, paleointensity data remain sparse throughout Earth's history. This stems partly from the fact that few natural materials have the required fine-grained (single-domain) mineralogy and are also resistant to alteration both in nature and during laboratory reheating. Natural volcanic glasses, because they are quickly cooled, typically contain single-domain titanomagnetite, and the glass serves to at least partially protect the titanomagnetite against alteration. It has been demonstrated that young (<50-100 ka) submarine basaltic glass can reliably record the field, but it is unclear how the magnetic mineralogy and hence magnetization might change with age as the metastable glass structure relaxes and/or the glass becomes hydrated. Limited studies of more silicic glass (such as obsidian) suggest that it may also reliably record the field, but that devitrification and/or hydration will negatively impact paleointensity estimates. While important questions have been raised regarding the suitability of volcanic glass over geologic time, there has been no attempt to systematically address the issues surrounding glass relaxation, devitrification, and hydration.  The objective of the proposed work is to assess the reliability of natural volcanic glasses to recover the intensity of Earth's magnetic field throughout geologic time.",

Our work is providing an understanding of how magnetic mineralogy varies with the age and water content of natural glasses, allowing us to evaluate the suitability of natural volcanic glass as a paleointensity recorder over geologic time. \n\nBecause there is considerable variability in magnetic mineralogy of young, fresh volcanic glass, it is impossible to determine how these mineral populations change over geological time simply by examining glass of varying ages.  We therefore start with young, fresh glass and establish the existing magnetic mineral populations.  We then artificially \"age\" these samples by annealing at temperatures from 200-400&deg;C for durations up to 240 days.  Elevated temperatures accelerate the aging process that naturally happens over hundreds of millions of years.  We monitor changes in magnetic properties during this process and can infer changes in the magnetic mineral population.  We find that the aged samples have more magnetic material, which most likely results from growth of pre-existing magnetic minerals. \n\nWe also artificially added water to (hydrated) a separate set of samples.  This was done by sealing the samples in capsules with a small amount of water, pressurizing them, and then heating the samples to 300-450&deg;C for up to 15 days.  These results also showed changes in the magnetic mineral populations, but the changes were less consistent than found in the aging experiments.\n\nOngoing work will help us link the changes observed here over short timescales to changes that might naturally occur over hundreds of millions of years.  However, both experiments suggest that the use of older natural glass in paleointensity experiments should be used with caution.  Those working with these types of samples will need to make additional measurements to ensure reliable results.\n\nIn addition to the impact on geoscience disciplines, natural glasses have long been considered an analogue for nuclear waste glasses and other hazardous waste glasses.  Our work has generated interest in the materials science community, where magnetic properties are being studied as a way to monitor incipient alteration of waste glasses.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/24/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Julie A Bowles"
