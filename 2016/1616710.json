 "awd_abstract_narration": "The team will investigate the enigmatic \"dark matter\" in nearby galaxies.  Dark matter does not radiate but its gravity tugs at the stars in a galaxy.  Observations of such tracer stars provide clues about the dark matter.  The team will use forefront facilities to study the starlight at optical wavelengths.  They will focus on the faint outskirts of giant galaxies and on some just-discovered dwarf galaxies.  The team will compare their observations to simulations of the dark matter in these diverse -- thus challenging -- settings.  Senior team members will train junior members recruited from underrepresented groups.  The team will continue its successful partnership with Science Buddies, an on-line resource for increasing K-12 science literacy.\r\n\r\nFor the giant early-type galaxies, the team will use chemodynamics to map out their dark matter distributions and to study their assembly histories.  For the dwarf ultra-diffuse galaxies, the team will use spectroscopy to study their dark matter distributions and their star formation histories.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project studied the distribution of dark matter within galaxies, and the origins and properties of different types of galaxies along with their interconnections with star clusters.  Ultra-diffuse galaxies are a mysterious population of diffuse stellar systems whose existence became widely recognized at the outset of this project, and which were explored extensively in this project.   Some of these galaxies were found to be exceptionally rich in dark matter, and others to be missing dark matter entirely.  Both extremes presented challenges to conventional pictures of galaxy formation, and also provided unique tests of dark matter.  Alternatives to standard cold dark matter theory were found to be problematic in the light of new observational evidence.  Some ultra-diffuse galaxies were found to be fossils of the early universe based on trace elements in their stars.\n\nThe global properties of giant elliptical and lenticular galaxies were mapped out in great detail, including the outer orbits of their stars and star clusters, and the spatial distribution of their dark matter.  These properties were compared to numerical simulations of galaxies, with some points of agreement, along with tensions that pointed to improvements needed in understanding galaxy formation.\n\nUndergraduate and masters students from a minority-serving institution were engaged in cutting-edge research on galaxies, dark matter, and star clusters using open access databases and machine-learning tools -- with broad application in other areas of science, technology, and business.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/29/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Aaron J Romanowsky"
