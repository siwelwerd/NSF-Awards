 "awd_abstract_narration": "This RAPID award will enable researchers to determine the prevalence of the Zika virus and dengue virus co-infections in humans and mosquitos, household climatic factors affecting disease transmission, and which other species of mosquitos might transmit Zika. This project will fill in gaps to our knowledge about pathogen levels in the blood for a particular part of the human population, infection rates, co-infection between Zika and dengue in both humans and mosquitos, and what other mosquitos are able to transmit Zika. Building on an on-going study of mosquito-borne disease in Ecuador, the rapid deployment of this study will capture the spread of Zika through a naive population. The results will provide important information that can be used to control the spread of Zika in other locales, including the continental US. Results from this project will be relevant to the Zika public health emergency, and the researchers have set in place mechanisms to share quality-assured interim and final data as rapidly and widely as possible, including with public health and research communities.\r\n\r\nThis project will assess the spatiotemporal distribution of Zika and dengue virus infections in humans and mosquitoes in Ecuador by collecting household-level data for the following: i) blood draws for infection monitoring, febrile episodes, and household surveillance where mosquitos are positive for Zika virus, ii) climate data, and iii) biweekly mosquito collections and dengue virus diagnostics expanded for Zika virus. This data, combined with mosquito control interventions by the government and individual households, and information on socio-ecological conditions will be incorporated into modeling of local Zika transmission and mosquito dynamics. This will allow for a framework to assess drivers and mosquito control at scales from households to the entire region. This project will identify and compare drivers for Zika and dengue viruses to reveal key factors in the spread of Zika virus.",

In this region, ZIKV is transmitted to people by the same mosquito vector (<em>Aedes aegypti</em>)<em> </em>as the dengue virus (DENV), one of the leading causes of febrile illness. The aim of this study was to measure the prevalence of Zika virus (ZIKV) and dengue virus (DENV) infections and co-infections in humans and <em>Ae. aegypti </em>mosquitoes in a cohort of households, in 4 sites (Machala, Huaquillas, Portovelo, Zaruma) with distinct climate regimes, in southern coastal Ecuador. This project expands the currently funded EEID project, &ldquo;Nonlinear responses of vector-borne disease transmission to temperature (PI: E. Mordecai). &nbsp;From July to December 2016, we enrolled 293 individuals from 226 households into the study. Over a four-month period, homes were visited every two weeks to collect adult mosquitoes inside and outside of the home. Mosquitoes were analyzed for the presence of ZIKV and DENV. Over 12,000 mosquitos of all species and sexes were collected and classified, including over 1,000 <em>Ae. aegypti</em> mosquitos. Blood samples were collected from study volunteers once per month to determine whether they had been infected with ZIKV or DENV. We monitored the microclimate (temperature, relative humidity) inside cohort homes to determine the effects of climate on disease transmission. Household social-ecological risk factors were measured through household surveys conducted in the EEID study. Training and outreach efforts included a GIS training workshop for the public health sector in Ecuador (15 participants) and 18 community meetings, trainings and symposiums/presentations that reached 840 persons across the four sites in Ecuador. Although no students were directly funded on this project, the project provided training opportunities for 18 students in a wide array of field methods, lab techniques, survey methods, and entomological research. Preliminary results indicate that 12 pools of <em>Ae. aegypti</em> (10 specimens or less per pool) were positive for DENV, and 21 pools were positive for ZIKV. Diagnostic analyses of human samples are ongoing. These results will be used to understand the effects of climate and local social-ecological risk factors on the spatiotemporal dynamics of DENV and ZIKV through multilevel hierarchical modeling. This RAPID study has generated spatially and temporally explicit data on an emerging and unfolding epidemic of ZIKV. These findings will elucidate key factors in the spread, and thus control efforts, needed for ZIKV, and will provide a large repository of basic scientific data on the virus and disease vector.&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 08/29/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Anna&nbsp;Stewart</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1641145/1641145_10423575_1504041753565_D97A0569--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1641145/1641145_10423575_1504041753565_D97A0569--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Blood sample collected\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1641145/1641145_10423575_1504041753565_D97A0569--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Blood sample collected\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Study nurse collects a blood samples from a community member who has volunteered to enter the study.
