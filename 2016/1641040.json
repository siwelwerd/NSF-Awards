 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 2016 Geochemistry of Mineral Deposits Gordon Research Conference (GRC) will bring together a diverse group of scientists who are focused on ensuring a sustainable supply of metals that are woven into the fabric of modern society. Participants include representatives from academia and various government agencies and laboratories, as well as from the mining and geothermal industries, who bring to the group their experience and expertise concerning immediate problems requiring practical solutions. The conference serves as one of the premier venues for international researchers with differing levels of experience to gather and discuss issues concerning the geochemistry of metal transportation and deposition in the natural environment. This proposal will allow scientists to present research and engage with scientists from around the world who are focused on the evolution and sustainability of ore minerals for our growing society. The GRC is a small meeting, with a maximum of 180 participants, and all participants are encouraged to actively participate in the discussions. All participants share meals together and the format of the meeting provides an ideal opportunity to interact with scientists with different perspectives in the field of research and also on applications of new methods. This is an ideal venue for early-career researchers to interact with senior members of the academic and industrial communities and to get feedback on their ideas. \r\n\r\nTopics to be discussed at the GRC will include high-resolution exploration strategies, magmatic and hydrothermal processes, active hydrothermal systems, metasomatism and sulfur cycling in the mantle wedge and redox processes, chemical signatures of mineralizing systems recorded in zircon, dynamic processes involved in ore genesis at a variety of scales, the relationship between climate change and weathering and formation of supergene deposits, fluid flow in sedimentary copper and uranium deposits, and rare earth element systems, and the role of geomicrobiology in mineralizing systems.",
