 "awd_abstract_narration": "IRES-SAGES will train US undergraduate students to help discover and characterize exoplanets, planets outside our solar system. Students will travel abroad to receive mentorship from international experts in the most important observational techniques for exoplanet studies. The students will then bring their acquired skills and research products back to the US where they will continue their investigations, train fellow students, disseminate their findings, and develop outreach activities for their local communities and K-12 schools. The students? research will target gas giant exoplanets in close orbits ? so-called ?hot Jupiters? ? around especially bright stars. Although thousands of exoplanets have been discovered, nearly all of our direct in-depth knowledge of exoplanet properties comes from a handful of hot Jupiters orbiting bright stars. Both the students? home institutions and the foreign institutions they will visit are members of the Kilodegree Extremely Little Telescope (KELT) project, a global collaboration with a proven record of discovering these important planets. IRES-SAGES will produce US citizens who are both globally engaged and more rigorously prepared for employment in physics- and space-related industries, advance the field of astrophysics research, promote national and international interests in space exploration, and improve scientific literacy in the US through outreach activities. The recruitment of IRES-SAGES students will target demographic groups traditionally underrepresented in the physical science fields.\r\n\r\nSurveys for exoplanet transits ? dimmings of a star when one of its planets partially eclipses it ? have been largely limited to stars fainter than tenth magnitude. KELT was created to search for planets transiting brighter stars through the use of telescopes specially designed to prevent image saturation. Only about two dozen hot Jupiters transiting stars brighter than tenth magnitude are known, but they are responsible for nearly all of the published literature on exoplanetary atmospheres, direct thermal emission, and spin-orbit alignment. Until more transiting super-Earths and Neptunes are discovered around bright stars and technology advances to the point where we can investigate them more thoroughly, hot Jupiters transiting bright stars remain the best sites for individual exoplanet exploration. KELT has discovered several of these planets through its global network of observatories and astronomers with different key specialties. IRES-SAGES will leverage this network to train US students in the discovery and characterization of these planets, as well as the wider range of planet types targeted by the microlensing, radial velocity, and transit programs of KELT?s foreign partners.",
