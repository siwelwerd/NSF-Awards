 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI and her students at the University of California Santa Barbara will carry out a comprehensive program of theoretical studies that will allow her to predict which physical conditions generate planetary systems comparable to our own. Ultimately, this will facilitate identification of outlier planets that could host life. Integrated with her research program, she will identify Hispanic students interested in physics as they enter UCSB and lead an effort to increase their retention in the physics major. To do this, she will develop a freshman course specifically designed for underrepresented minority students, help them develop a cohort and establish a mentoring network as they continue with their undergraduate studies, and provide them research opportunities.\r\n\r\nThe specific goals of this project are to (1) test whether disk turbulence sets the wide separation limit for core-accretion formation of giant planets by calculating the efficiency of pebble accretion in turbulent disks, (2) test whether giant planets formed via core accretion or gravitational fragmentation, (3) perform dynamical analyses of disturbed debris disks to study scattered interlopers in the wide-separation planet population, (4) use the combined dynamics of classical and resonant Kuiper belt objects to constrain the outer solar system's dynamical history, and (5) synthesize the results of these studies into collections of planetary system architectures that can be used to test which physical parameters determine a particular system's structure.",

Results include:\n\nWe modeled how quickly solid planets and cores of gas giants grow by accreting small bodies within their natal gaseous disks (known as \"pebble accretion\"). We demonstrated that gas turbulence is a key factor determining how far away from its star a giant planet can form. Once formed, we showed that giant planets can open gaps in protoplanetary disks by consuming disk gas, setting their final masses. In contrast, explaining the masses of our solar system's ice giants may require dynamical reshuffling after depletion of the gas disk triggered a dynamical instability.\n\nWe demonstrated that the masses of super-Earths in inner planetary systems may be explained by pebble accretion, cut off by a process we named \"flow isolation.\" Once a planet grows large enough, it can no longer accrete small solids effectively because they are pulled around the planet by the flow of protoplanetary disk gas. This sets a planetary mass scale that primarily depends on particle sizes and disk temperature instead of how much solid material is available. \n\nIf some planetary systems produce multiple gas giants in their inner regions (perhaps because their disk temperatures and hence flow isolation masses are large), then an epoch of planet-planet scattering results. We showed that such a giant planet giant impact phase reproduces observed correlations in planetary orbital properties. This work suggests that many observed giant planets may have formed with Jupiter-like masses but grown substantially larger due to collisions.\n\nWe developed a novel method of observationally measuring protoplanetary disk masses through \"dust lines,\" using the fact that grains grow and drift over the lifetime of a protoplanetary disk. Interestingly, our derived disk masses are large, often a full order of magnitude larger than values from standard dust observations, which rely on assumptions about the ratio between disk dust and gas. \n\nWe demonstrated that because ice prefers to accumulate on large grains, large grains in the outer regions of protoplanetary disks accumulate carbon monoxide ice near the cold disk midplane. Our model matches previously unexplained carbon monoxide observations across a range of disks and has significant implications for the composition of the solid building blocks of planets as a function of distance from the central star.\n\nWe identified new systems of observed gas giants in resonant orbits, developed an analytical model for the mass scales of asteroid-sized planetary building blocks, showed that super-Earths around stars with enhanced elements heavier than hydrogen are likely more massive than those orbiting less-enhanced stars, and generated a new simplified model for interpreting the observational signature of hydrogen gas outflowing from planetary atmospheres.\n\nThese combined projects made a substantial contribution to our understanding of the physics that determines the structure of planetary systems. Given the variety of environments expected on extrasolar planets, efforts to translate formation histories, including dynamics and compositions, into observed system architectures are a critical component of the search for life on other worlds. Such efforts will ultimately enable the separation of signatures of life from signatures of abiotic planetary processes. \n\nFor Broader Impacts, we developed a vertical mentoring program to provide early research opportunities to first- and second-year students in the physics and astrophysics majors at UC Santa Cruz. Early research opportunities improve retention in the physical sciences, but faculty workloads often make providing these opportunities difficult. This program addresses this gap, emphasizing recruitment of students from underserved communities while serving all interested students. The program included 30-40 students per year and is comprised of several parts: (1) two-quarter-long research projects in astrophysics, conducted in groups of about four students, advised by faculty, postdocs, and graduate students, (2) a two-quarter class that provides scaffolding and project support, reducing the load on mentors, as well as soft skills development, and (3) community building via visiting speakers, peer mentors, and a departmental poster session. The program ran five times (with a gap during the pandemic), and statistics are available for the first three cohorts.
