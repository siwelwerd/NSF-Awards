 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will foster collaborations between computer scientists and geoscientists that will advance research in both areas.  Geoscience problems are complex and often involve data that changes across space and time. Frequently geoscience knowledge and understanding provides valuable information and insight for problems related to energy, water, climate, agriculture, mineral resources, and our understanding of how the Earth evolves through time. Simultaneously, many grand challenges in the geosciences cannot be addressed without the aid of computational support and innovations. Intelligent and Information Systems (IS) research in computer science includes a broad range of topics and computational methods such as knowledge representation, information integration, machine learning, robotics, adaptive sensors, and intelligent interfaces. IS research has an important role to play in accelerating the speed of scientific discovery in geosciences and thus in solving challenges that cannot be addressed by other means. Similarly, many aspects of Geosciences (GEO) research pose novel large-scale problems for IS researchers to improve and validate their methods. Intelligent Systems for Geosciences (IS-GEO) represent an emerging community of interdisciplinary researchers producing fundamental new capabilities for understanding Earth systems and how the application of IS technologies can cultivate key new developments in both fields.\r\n\r\nThe EarthCube Research Coordination Network for Intelligent Systems for Geosciences (IS-GEO RCN) will catalyze collaborations to enable advances in our understanding of Earth systems through innovative applications of intelligent and information systems to fundamental geosciences problems. The goal of the IS-GEO RCN is to leverage expertise and generate interactions between both the geosciences and computing sciences communities to provide advanced scientific capabilities. To enable the network, the IS-GEO RCN will host meetings and other activities that: (1) foster an active and broad-based community across GEO and IIS areas; (2) identify barriers to research, such as terminology differences among the disciplines involved and highlight knowledge gaps that hinder collaboration across the disciplines; (3) establish and enhance communication channels between GEO and IS researchers; (4) defining grand challenges in geosciences that are well suited to IS techniques; and (5) encourage robust, long-term collaborations.  Furthermore, the educational component aims to identify new approaches to teaching students in this new interdisciplinary area, seeking to raise a new generation of scientists that are better able to apply IS methods and tools to geoscience challenges of the future. By providing avenues for IS and GEO researchers to work together the IS-GEO RCN will serve as both a point of contact, as well as an avenue for educational outreach across the disciplines for the nascent community of research and practice.\r\n \r\nThe initial efforts are focused on connecting the communities in ways that help researchers understand opportunities and challenges that can benefit from IS-GEO collaborations. The uncertain, heterogeneous and disparate nature of geoscience data paired with recent IS advances and increases in observational data offer unique opportunities for new approaches and discoveries through joint efforts. The IS-GEO RCN will jumpstart interdisciplinary research collaborations in this emerging new area so that progress across both disciplines can be accelerated.",

Collaborative efforts across IS-GEO fields of study offer opportunities to accelerate scientific discovery and understanding. The IS-GEO community engaged with over 300 researchers from 2016 through 2022, with active researchers from across the US, international members, and an early career committee.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Coordination included monthly meetings with active members to review topics of interest to the community and progress on shared efforts, as well as a monthly Subject Matter Expert lecture series presentation to highlight innovators completing research at the intersection between Geosciences and Artificial Intelligence applications.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>AdHoc working groups focused on four thematic areas with regular coordination meetings and presentations at professional conferences such as the American Geophysical Union (AGU), Geological Society of America (GSA), Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI), American Meteorological Society (AMS), Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM), and Association for the Advancement of Sciences (AAAS).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Adaptive Sensing working group looked at techniques for analyzing and integrating information from low-cost sensors to advance understanding of how ground truth data informs geoscientific field studies and to implement data collection capabilities with Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications across environments. During the 2018 workshop, with support from the University of Hawaii System, the IS-GEO RCN coordinated a week-long workshop where participants designed, developed, and deployed near real-time sensing devices across eight ecosystems on the Big Island of Hawaii. The workshop activities included using other NSF-supported EarthCube tools like the Cloud.HOsted.Real-time.Data.Services (CHORDS ) data streaming service and the 3D-Printed Automatic Weather Station (3D PAWS) supported by the US National Weather Service International Activities Office (NWS IAO), with support from the USAID Office of US Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Geoscience Case Studies working group created guidelines for describing and posting benchmark data sets to enable new collaborations between geoscientists and data scientists. The group published an article defining best practices and demonstrating with example datasets from geoscience collaborators.

The resulting research collaborations have advanced reusable applications and a model integration platform designed with semantic and ontological links to streamline access and use of physics-based models. The 2017 IS-GEO RCN workshop hosted at The University of Texas at Austin via the Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC) informed the creation of a model-based decision support system for groundwater at this workshop, developing the reusable application within five days. The workshop leveraged NSF Science Gateways' capabilities to set up the initial data portal services and computational notebooks.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Education working group reviewed lessons learned regarding best practices for engaging across disciplines, published the review results with recommendations, and hosted four hands-on workshops. Given the rapid emergence of data science techniques in the earth sciences, there is an urgent need to prepare future scientists to be knowledgeable in both earth science and data science. Target competencies include all aspects of data management, processing, analysis, and visualization, as well as interdisciplinary collaboration and teamwork. Several educational models combining training in earth science and data science have been proposed, including T-shaped, pi-shaped, and shield-shaped, which differ in the depth of training a student receives in a secondary field. The education working group evaluated different educational models and published an article summarizing the findings for educators and curricular design use. The most recent IS-GEO organized workshop in 2022 to look at model-based reasoning in collaboration with NSF-supported hydroinformatics researchers at CUASHI, natural hazards researchers at DesignSafe, and polar scientists with the NSF IHARP harnessing the data revolution institute. This workshop included teams that leveraged the EarthCube-supported Ontosoft application to gather collections of curricular materials and datasets for both Polar and Disaster Response Communities.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Over time the IS-GEO RCN developed collaborations with organizations, including government agencies like the US Geological Survey and NASA; private entities like Microsoft, Redfish, and SparkFun; International organizations like the University of Wageningen in The Netherlands and Petrobras Brazil; and nonprofit organizations such as CUAHSI and Ecorise. These collaborative relationships expanded the reach of the community.
