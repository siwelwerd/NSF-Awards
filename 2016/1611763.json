 "awd_abstract_narration": "Through this project, a new set of instructional tools for engineering graphics courses is being developed. Spatial visualization (SV) skill has been shown to be necessary to succeed in engineering; however, it is a difficult skill to master. This project will (1) develop a set of physical models and integrate them with SV learning in the classroom, and (2) develop and implement an online assistant environment that can be used at any time on mobile devices and computers. The investigators are developing a game-based classroom approach that combines the theories of game and puzzle-based learning and reasoning, active learning, and the use of tangible models for instruction. \r\n\r\nThe project is creating and testing the effectiveness of a promising way to teach spatial visualization using a game-based active learning approach. Students' SV skills are hypothesized to improve through hands-on examination of objects that they construct.  The online assistant will allow students to independently develop SV skills through immediate feedback. The gaming component of the project addresses student motivation. This work has potential for widespread reapplication in K-12 and other engineering schools. Outreach efforts will include classroom implementations in local area K-12 schools, and through two early engineering programs offered at Tuskegee University. In addition, workshops and webinars designed to train educators at these schools will enhance the classroom implementations.",
