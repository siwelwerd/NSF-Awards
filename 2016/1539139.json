 "awd_abstract_narration": "A goal of the Tribal Colleges and Universities Program (TCUP) is to increase the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) instructional and research capacities of specific institutions of higher education that serve the Nation's indigenous students. Expanding the STEM curricular offerings at these institutions expands the opportunities of their students to pursue challenging, rewarding careers in STEM fields, provides for research studies in areas that may be culturally significant, and encourages a community and generational appreciation for science and mathematics education. This project aligns directly with that goal, and moreover will increase the body of knowledge on the material properties of sandwich beam parts created by selective laser melting using titanium.\r\n\r\nNavajo Technical University (NTU) will examine data from two different designs and their meanings and lay the groundwork for comparing other sandwich beam designs, thereby leading to designs for optimum strength-to-weight ratio. The research will explore two constructs, stretch-dominated (truss-type lattice cells) and bend-dominated (dodecahedron-type lattice cells) beam structures, using simple supported bending experiments. The research will explore creating and simulating 3D computer models of the test specimens using off-the-shelf analysis software. NTU will collaborate with Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), which will include but not be limited to guiding appropriate structure designs for testing and testing process data collection. Another aspect of testing will use a high-speed camera system to gain full view analysis of the forces, force vectors and in-process white light scanning.The project also uses cutting edge techniques that capture real-time force data to plot accordingly, which will provide a more expansive interpretation of test data. Comparing test specimens created on two different machines with dissimilar surface finishes may demonstrate an impact on the test specimens' ability to resist bending forces.",

Positive outputs and outcomes were identified through various data collection tools such as Project Tracking Logs, Student Internship Interviews, Student Course Surveys and Document Reviews, demonstrating the overall success of the project. A high-level summary of project accomplishments and findings is provided below.</p>\n<p>The TCUP Lattice Structure Research Project provided STEM research opportunities to Native American undergraduate students by (1) providing internships for key members of the research project team and (2) engaging students enrolled in specific classes in research through their coursework. The project hired two paid TCUP interns during each year of the project; however, a total of eleven advanced manufacturing interns contributed to the TCUP research efforts across the three years. The interns engaged in numerous activities using TCUP equipment (e.g., 3D Printers), as well as ATE inspection equipment (e.g., FARO arm and CMM machines) to conduct research projects that involved designing, printing and testing various lattice structures. At least five NTU students also participated in the research each year through NTU courses such as Engineering Graphics, Industrial Engineering Design of Experiments, Design and Manufacturing Processes II, and Introduction to Engineering.</p>\n<p>Through the internships and course activities, the NTU undergraduate students were introduced to material, product and part tolerance research, as well as research techniques and processes developed through the implementation of the TCUP Project. As part of the TCUP Lattice Structure Research Project, the NTU interns created test specimen that will be used as samples in future NTU courses, as well as by other Tribal colleges and universities, to continue to engage Native American students in hands-on activities related to key concepts from the lattice structure research.</p>\n<p>Key findings from a group interview conducted with seven NTU student interns contributing to the TCUP Lattice Structure Research Project indicated that participation in the research internships has increased the intern?s knowledge about concepts related to lattice structure research and the use of related tools/technologies. The interns indicated that their experiences have increased their desire to learn, understanding of the technology?s diverse applications, interest in concepts from their courses, interest in STEM careers, and research skills.</p>\n<p>NTU students participating through courses also indicated increased knowledge and abilities resulting from the TCUP Lattice Structure Research Project. For example, during the final year of the project, all of the Student Course Survey respondents (i.e., 21 students across semesters) indicated working on course projects using the equipment from the NTU Center for Digital Technologies (Fabrication Lab). The students specifically indicated using the 3D Printer, FARO Arm, Laser Scanner, Laser Tracker, CT Scanner, White Light Scanner, Coordinate Measure Machine (CMM), Lathe/Mill, CNC Machine, Instron Tensile Machine, and related software (e.g., SoildWorks). All of the Student Course Survey respondents also either ?strongly agreed? or ?agreed? that they understand the purpose and the benefits of the equipment. In addition, the majority of the engineering students completing the survey (about 70% or more) ?strongly agreed? or ?agreed? that they know what equipment is available through the NTU Fabrication Lab, understand how the equipment is used in the field, and are able to operate the equipment. These findings were notable given that the students completing the Student Course Survey were in an introductory stage of their education about the equipment and not expected to be able to operate the equipment yet.</p>\n<p>In order to sustain the successes of TCUP Lattice Structure Research Project moving forward, NTU plans to continue to engage students in related research activities as they develop the new NTU Advanced Manufacturing Center, which will include a Certified Metrology and Materials Testing Center. The Center will not only create local internships and jobs, and provide hands-on opportunities for Native American students in advanced manufacturing and metrology, but it will also help the economic development of the Navajo Nation. The research processes and samples developed through the TCUP Lattice Structure Research Project will continue to be utilized in the Education and Services and Construction Branches of the new Certified Center.</p>\n<p>Foundational lattice structure knowledge was gained through this research and NTU will continue to pursue this research. This project will also be used to explore simulation of 3D metal printing of lattice structures, CT analysis of lattice structures and application of lattice structures.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 07/15/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Harold&nbsp;Halliday</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1539139/1539139_10430670_1563213749892_IMG_1739--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1539139/1539139_10430670_1563213749892_IMG_1739--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"FaroArm of Lattice\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1539139/1539139_10430670_1563213749892_IMG_1739--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"FaroArm of Lattice\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Adriane Tenequer Using FaroArm to Measure Lattice Structure Coupon.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Harold S Halliday</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Harold&nbsp;Halliday</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">FaroArm of Lattice</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1539139/1539139_10430670_1563213974726_IMG_2008--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1539139/1539139_10430670_1563213974726_IMG_2008--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Students FaroArm\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1539139/1539139_10430670_1563213974726_IMG_2008--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Students FaroArm\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Students using FaroArm portable CMM.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Harold S Halliday</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Harold&nbsp;Halliday</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Students FaroArm</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1539139/1539139_10430670_1563213262294_IMG_1309--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1539139/1539139_10430670_1563213262294_IMG_1309--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"CT-Scan of Lattice\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1539139/1539139_10430670_1563213262294_IMG_1309--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"CT-Scan of Lattice\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Adriane Tenequer CT scanning a lattice structure.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Harold S Halliday</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Harold&nbsp;Halliday</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">CT-Scan of Lattice</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1539139/1539139_10430670_1563214383270_IMG_1976--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1539139/1539139_10430670_1563214383270_IMG_1976--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Coupon Test\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1539139/1539139_10430670_1563214383270_IMG_1976--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Coupon Test\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Testing of lattice coupon using ARAMIS Digital Imaging Correlation system - Concentrated Load.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Harold S Halliday</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Harold&nbsp;Halliday</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Coupon Test</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
