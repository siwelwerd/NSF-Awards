 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports research on fabrication of micro-scale ceramic structures by combining green-state micro-machining and powder-injection molding processes. The research objective is to gain fundamental knowledge on the combined process through integrated experimental and modeling studies. The specific research approach will include (1) analyzing the green micromachining process for different ceramic materials, powder and binder characteristics, and process parameters to determine their effect on process characteristics, including geometric quality and productivity, and (2) characterizing and modeling mechanical and geometric characteristics of parts fabricated using the combined process. The research will include aluminum-nitride and silicon-carbide as sample systems, and will demonstrate the effectiveness of findings by fabricating industrial ceramic parts. The educational objectives include enhancing the future manufacturing workforce, and improving existing manufacturing curricula, and attracting students to manufacturing through pre-college outreach activities.\r\n\r\nIf successful, the results of this research will lead to rapid, predictable, reproducible, low cost, and accurate manufacture of ceramic parts with micro-scale features. Ceramics offer many advantages such as high-temperature strength, chemical stability, thermal conductivity, and electrical insulation. Although the prevailing micro-fabrication technologies have been effective in creating micro-electronics components and sensors from semiconductor materials, we currently do not an effective micro-manufacturing technique to create three-dimensional micro-structures from ceramics. This approach will provide and effective way to make ceramic components with micro-structures, thereby facilitating exciting technological and scientific advances. Micro-scale ceramic devices and parts will benefit many industries, including medical devices, electronics/lighting systems, and clean energy technologies. The knowledge gained from this work will provide in-depth understanding of green micromachining and powder-injection molding processes to facilitate fabricating parts in a predictable fashion. Collaboration with industry and national laboratories will enable rapid transfer of research findings and our technology to industry, thereby impacting the advanced manufacturing industry. This research is also critical for the United States in its efforts to gain back the manufacturing leadership through advanced manufacturing efforts.",

The main objective&nbsp;was to gain a fundamental understanding of the combined GMM/PIM process characteristics through an integration of carefully designed experiments and modeling. Although the prevailing micro-fabrication technologies have been effective in creating micro-electronics components and sensors from semiconductor materials, we did not have the viable capabilities to create micro-structures from ceramics when we undertook this collaborative work. While mechanical micromachining enables effective micro-manufacture of polymers and soft/easy-to-machine metals, it is not viable for fabrication of sintered ceramics due to process and tooling limitations. On the other hand, application of PIM (alone) at the micro scale poses significant practical and technological challenges, and has important geometric/material limitations. To this end, we developed and studied a combined PIM/GMM process that could eliminate the barriers to micro-molding of micro-structures with complex 3D geometries. In the combined PIM/GMM process, the first step is to fabricate green compacts by injection molding of a mixture of powdered ceramic with a polymer/wax binder. Next, GMM is applied by using micro-scale milling and drilling tools to create complex 3D structures at the micro scale, including undercuts, freeform surfaces, and high aspect ratio structures. Following GMM, parts are debound and sintered to obtain the final (full density) part with micro-scale features.
