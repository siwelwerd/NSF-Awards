 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this award is to provide partial travel support for 40 graduate and undergraduate students to attend the American Society of Mechanical Engineers International Mechanical Engineering Congress and Exposition on November 11-17, 2016 in Phoenix, Arizona. The students will participate in a poster symposium to present their research projects to the broader Mechanical Engineering community. The students will be selected on the basis of an application including a brief resume, a one-page statement of why they want to attend the conference, and a statement of support from their faculty advisor. Consideration in the selection process will be given to inclusion of members of underrepresented groups and diversity of institutions that the students represent. \r\n\r\nThis participation support is expected to benefit students' professional, scientific and technical development. Attendance at the conference will give the students a broader view of the engineering profession and of state-of-the-art research in their fields via access to approximately 2000 technical and professional development talks by domestic and international speakers. Students will enhance their communication skills via lively discussions of their work with the top researchers in their fields during the society-wide Poster Symposium. They will also have the opportunity to attend many technical presentations spanning more than 240 topics, join the keynote and plenary sessions featuring technological pioneers, and network with potential mentors, colleagues, and employers. This interactive experience will significantly broaden their education, increase their enthusiasm for their research topic, acquaint them with expectations for scientific careers, and expose them to new avenues for innovative research. This award will benefit the nation through the education of a skilled and diverse engineering workforce better prepared to provide transformative solutions the challenges of their chosen fields.",
