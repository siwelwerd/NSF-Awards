 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dunbar/1543454\r\n\r\nAntarctic ice cores offer unparalleled records of earth?s climate back to almost one million years and perhaps beyond. Layers of volcanic ash (tephra) embedded in glacial ice can be used to establish an accurate ice core chronology. In order to use a visible or ultrafine volcanic ash layer as a time-stratigraphic marker, a unique geochemical fingerprint must be established, and this forms the basis of our research. This award will investigate the volcanic record in the 1751 m ice core that was completed at the South Pole during the 2015/16 field season. The core is in an ideal location to link the existing, established, volcanic records in East and West Antarctica, and therefore to connect and integrate those records, allowing the climate records of ice cores to be directly compared, as well as to focus research on the most widespread and significant volcanic eruptions from West Antarctica.  Tephra derived from well-dated, large, tropical volcanic eruptions that may have had an impact on climate will also be studied.   Recent success in identifying and analyzing very fine ash particles from these types of eruptions makes it likely that we will be able to pinpoint some of these eruptions, which will allow the sulfate peaks associated with these layers to be positively identified and dated. Volcanic forcing time series developed from earlier South Pole ice cores based on preserved sulfate were crucial for testing climate models, but without tephra analysis, the origin of these layers remains uncertain. \r\n\r\nWork on the tephra layers in the South Pole ice core has a number of significant specific objectives, some with practical applications to the basic science goals of Antarctic ice coring, and others that represent independent scientific contributions in their own right. These include: (1) providing independently dated time-intervals in the core, particularly for the deepest ice, (2) quantitatively linking tephra records across Antarctica with the goal of allowing direct and robust climate comparisons between these different parts of the continent, (3) providing information for large local eruptions, that will lead to direct estimates of eruption magnitude and dispersal patterns of Antarctic volcanoes, several of which will likely erupt again. The initial stages of the work will be carried out by identifying silicate-bearing horizons in the ice core, using several methods.  Once found, silicate particles will be imaged so that morphological characteristics of the particles can be used to identify volcanic origin.  Particles identified as tephra will then be chemically analyzed using electron microprobe and laser ablation ICP-MS.  Samples that yield a robust chemical fingerprint will be statistically correlated to known eruptions, and this will be used to address the goals described above.  Broader impacts of this project fall into the areas of education of future generation of researchers, outreach and international cooperation. These activities will continue to promote forward progress in integrating the Antarctic tephra record and more broadly tying it to the global volcanic record.",
