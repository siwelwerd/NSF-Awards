 "awd_abstract_narration": "Gamma-rays are the highest energy form of electromagnetic radiation. Observations of astrophysical gamma-rays serve as probes of physical conditions and processes in the most extreme environments throughout the Universe, and can be used to test fundamental physics. The Very Energetic Radiation Imaging Telescope Array System (VERITAS), located in southern Arizona, is a ground-based observatory designed to study high-energy gamma-rays. VERITAS has unique capabilities, providing high sensitivity pointed observations of both galactic and extragalactic sources. This award supports scientists at Iowa State University to carry out research with VERITAS. The group will work on new data analysis techniques to improve the study of spatially-extended sources and to facilitate the joint analysis of data from multiple observatories. Using these new analysis techniques the group will conduct a systematic study of Galactic sources of particle acceleration, and ultimately search for signatures of dark matter. The group will work with the Iowa State University planetarium developing multi-wavelength astronomy and high-energy astrophysics shows, displays, and demonstrations. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe PI has adapted a maximum likelihood framework for VERITAS data analysis that will be extended to enable simultaneous fitting of data from multiple instruments. In addition, the PI will implement a new background estimation method based on this maximum likelihood framework that will improve the analysis of extended sources. Together, these developments will help maximize the impact of the VERITAS long-term science program. The PI will perform a systematic study of Galactic particle accelerators such as supernova remnants and pulsar wind nebulae, their interaction with their immediate environment, and the evolution of the particles they produce, along with more long-range work searching regions of high dark matter density for the gamma-ray signature of dark matter self-annihilation.",
