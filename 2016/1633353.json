 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a comprehensive research proposal on the statistical modeling and analysis for educational assessment. This research addresses issues concerning fundamental statistical problems that arise in the analysis of Big Data in education. The research focus is on modeling and inference for large-scale data with complex dependence and structures (such as high-dimensional response and process data). These data arise from the introduction of new methods of testing student knowledge that rely on scenarios presented to the students and on simulation-based environments where student responses to a simulated environment are tested. This research is collaborative between Columbia University  and the Educational Testing Service.\r\n\r\nThe topics studied include latent graphical modeling for high-dimensional item response data, modeling and segmentation of process data via dictionary models, estimation of item-attribute relationship, dimension reduction, theoretical analysis and computational methods for the proposed models. The analysis combines techniques and concepts from mathematics and probability and applies them to nonlinear statistical models and data analysis. The proposed model combines latent variable and graphical approaches for high-dimensional data; for modeling process data, recent advances in modeling and segmenting techniques for natural language processing will be investigated. In the theoretical development,  several algebraic concepts to formulate model identifiability and perform combinatorial analysis on high-dimensional discrete spaces will be studied. In addition, optimization algorithms will be developed using recent advances in numerical methods.",

For instance, respondents in the success group showed patterns in following clear sub-goals and used digital tools when solving complex problems; while those in the unsuccess group showed hesitative behaviors by using \"cancel\" button more often and clicking on \"help\" function for further information. The sequence-based methods were extended to sequence distance measures to capture the consistency of individual?s problem-solving strategies and behavioral patterns. In this study, the distance between the optimal sequences that were defined by content expert and item developers and each observed individual sequence was computed. Two indicators of sequence similarity and sequence efficiency were defined, which interprets how similar the individual sequence is compared with optimal reference sequence and what percentage of the redundant actions were adopted when solving the digital tasks. The results showed that most respondents keep consistent behaviors when solving digital tasks.
