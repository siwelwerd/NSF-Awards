The goal of the preconference meeting is to consider unique concerns and challenges associated with preserving best practices in infancy research to enhance replication and reproducibility.  Results from a survey of infancy researchers on their research and training practices will be disseminated, and leaders in the field will make presentations about important considerations on topics such as training, inclusion criteria, and cross-lab replications.  The meeting will culminate with a discussion among members of the Executive Committee of the International Congress of Infant Studies and the editors of the Congress' flagship journal, Infancy, regarding standards for the conduct and publication of research.  The outcomes of this meeting will have important implications for the support and preservation of robust and reliable infancy research.",
