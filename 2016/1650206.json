 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to investigate how natural, turbulent airflow affects insect flight stability, and to determine how insects deal with this challenge. Turbulent airflow, which includes unpredictable wind gusts and swirling vortices, is found in nearly all natural habitats.  However, the extent to which turbulence affects animal flight remains unknown, because most studies of flight are performed in lab settings with smooth, simplified airflow, and because we know very little about the characteristics of environmental turbulence at size scales relevant to flying animals.  This project will address these unanswered questions by (1) quantifying the natural aerial environments that flying insects encounter and simulating them in a wind tunnel, (2) assessing the effects of turbulent flow on flight stability in two widespread insect pollinators, bumblebees and droneflies, and (3) investigating how insect body form and/or behaviors may help enhance flight stability in unpredictable aerial environments. The flight studies in this project focus on insect pollinators, as these typically travel long distances through a variety of habitats, performing essential services upon which plants, ecosystems, and the global food supply ultimately depend. The innovative research proposed will form the foundation for future studies examining how habitat alteration and climate change may affect the movement patterns and efficiency of pollinators and other flying animals by inducing changes in the aerial environment. In addition, this project may provide inspiration for the design of micro air vehicles (MAVs) by identifying novel methods of enhancing flight stability.\r\n \r\nThis research is inherently multi-disciplinary, as an animal's movements depend on numerous aspects of its biology (from cells and tissues to behavior and ecology), and are mediated by physical interactions with the external environment. Due to these cross-disciplinary connections and the tangible, visually appealing nature of biological motions, this subject forms an ideal platform for engaging non-science majors and the general public in biology, physics and engineering, and for instilling a sense of excitement about scientific research. To take advantage of this unique opportunity, the educational objectives of this proposal are to (1) develop a general education course centered around movement in biology, and (2) expand and improve the Concord Field Station outreach program at Harvard University to expose K-12 students and the public first-hand to integrative, compelling scientific research. Through these educational efforts, this project will expose students of all ages as well as the general public to scientific research that integrates biology, physics & engineering, and that is tangible, exciting and memorable.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n Air flow in natural settings is rarely smooth, yet most animal flight research before 2010 examined animals flying in perfectly smooth flow in wind tunnels.  Thus, our understanding of how natural winds affect flying animals, including the pollinating insects that our food supply depends upon, remained limited.  Over the course of this project, our lab performed several of the first studies to generate complex, natural air flow conditions and document how these flows affect insect flight performance.  We compared flight performance in smooth flow to that in the wake of an object, such as a tree branch, where wind swirls into regular vortices circulating in alternate directions.  We also modified our wind tunnel to examine flight performance in chaotic turbulence, where vortices of all different sizes mix and swirl unpredictably.  Finally, we studied flight performance in turbulent flows caused by thermal convection, such as when sunlight warms the blacktop of an urban environment more quickly than the cool air above it, causing air to swirl up from the surface.  In all cases, we found that the unsteady flows found in natural habitats present a challenge to flying insects.\n\n            We examined how unsteady wind affects the flight performance of many different insects, focusing on important crop pollinators such as bumblebees and honey bees, as well as carpenter bees, mason bees, orchid bees, and fruit flies. The primary insect we studied, the common Eastern bumblebee, was affected in several important ways.  All of the unsteady flows we tested challenged bees\u2019 flight stability, causing the largest instabilities around the rolling axis (with bees rolling from side to side around the long axis of their body), regardless of the orientation of flow perturbations.  Bumblebees compensate in several ways, by sweeping one wing over a longer distance than the other to correct for immediate disturbances, and by increasing their overall wing beat frequency (how many times they beat their wings per second) when flying in unsteady flow.  Increasing wing beat frequency allows them to respond to disturbances more quickly, but it carries an energetic cost.  We performed respirometry (measuring the amount of carbon dioxide produced to determine energy consumed) on flying bees, and found that the main determinant of energetic cost during flight is wing beat frequency.  Thus, bees foraging in unsteady, turbulent winds spend more energy to cover the same distance when collecting resources, and this energy loss may limit the range over which bees forage (reducing pollination effectiveness) and ultimately reduce productivity of the hive (reducing the number of hives in the next generation).  All of these potential effects are especially troubling in light of climate change predictions that foresee increasingly stronger winds and more unsteady air flow in the future.\n\n            Our work revealed several additional adaptations in bees\u2019 body forms and behavior that may partially alleviate the burden of flying in turbulence.  We found that the natural flexibility of bees\u2019 wings, which causes them to bend and twist in complex ways, improves stability when flying in wind.  We also devised a new flight \"choice\" experiment to examine which environmental conditions bees choose to fly through when given the option, testing whether bees prefer to fly upwind or downwind, through unsteady wind or obstacles, etc.  These studies show that bees do have marked preferences for different flight conditions and that they actively choose where they will fly in the environment so as to minimize flight challenges. \n\n            We expanded on these studies to show that bees land more roughly, colliding with the surface when flying in wind. In another study, we showed that the wing damage that results from collisions further increases bees\u2019 flight instability in unsteady flow. Finally, we showed that bees can manage their own flight stability to some extent, trading off between stability and maneuverability by choosing which type of resources to collect &ndash; carrying nectar in their guts makes them more maneuverable (performing sharper, more accurate turns), whereas carrying pollen on their hind legs makes them more stable in unsteady wind.  This suggests that environmental wind conditions may affect the resources bees collect, with potential implications for pollination effectiveness and hive productivity.\n\n            Over the course of this award, we worked to convey key points - how wind affects flying insects (especially pollinators), and why understanding how insects fly is important for everyone &ndash; to many different audiences.  We delivered several talks each year at scientific conferences and published our results in respected, peer-reviewed journals.  We also engaged in numerous events to convey the importance of our research to the general public, giving talks at beekeepers\u2019 clubs, conservation organizations, and other clubs and public events.  Finally, we developed several undergraduate courses (such as \"Extreme Animal Athletes\" for non-majors) to convey how research on the biomechanics of living organisms can fuel bio-inspired discoveries and help predict the consequences of future environmental change.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/31/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Stacey A Combes"
