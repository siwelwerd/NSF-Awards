 "awd_abstract_narration": "This National Science Foundation (NSF) Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (S-STEM) project at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee will provide scholarships for talented, low-income students with demonstrated financial need pursuing bachelor's degrees in engineering and computer science. In addition to scholarships, the program will provide academic and other support to increase the persistence of academically talented, low-income students.  The project aims to provide a seamless graduation pathway for academically talented yet economically disadvantaged students.  In recognition of the varied types of support needed by individual students, the program will utilize a holistic framework of evidence-based effective practices to ensure that the challenges particular to each scholar are addressed. Scholarships and support for academically strong students, who may not otherwise be able to afford college, will help to produce a well-trained workforce that will contribute to the economic vitality of the greater Milwaukee region and the nation.\r\n\r\nThe program organization is informed by research indicating that significant reasons for STEM attrition include poor classroom experiences of students, lack of faculty mentoring, and an unsupportive campus atmosphere.  The proposal will test the idea that strong faculty mentoring and advising, community-oriented activities, undergraduate research opportunities, and selective participation in student organizations and professional societies will reduce isolation, increase connectedness, and improve STEM career commitment for talented low-income students whose initial connection to the university may be limited. The holistic framework established in this project builds on a variety of existing student support activities including pre-orientation and summer bridge programs, tutoring, a living-learning community, internship and undergraduate research opportunities, and participation in student organizations and professional societies. Scholars will have mentors who are experienced engineering and computer science faculty. An active cohort of scholars engaged in career development and community-oriented activities will help establish a supportive climate. The project will utilize the resources available in the industries located in the Milwaukee region. In addition to the opportunity for industrial internships, scholars will have industrial mentors. These mentors from industry will help students learn about the nature of the opportunities available in their prospective careers in engineering and computer science.  The project has identified commitment to career goals as an important element in student persistence and anticipates that industrial mentoring combined with faculty and other career advising will improve student understanding of the prospects of their intended majors. The findings from the program will be disseminated widely to the STEM education community and help increase understanding of the attributes and practices of successful student scholarship and support programs.",

The goal of the program was to recruit and support cohorts of freshmen at the College of Engineering and Applied Sciences (CEAS), offer them financial support and most importantly, academic enrichment through the years of their baccalaureate studies. All students recruited to the program had to have demonstrable financial need. In addition, the process was selective to choose students who were academically motivated and math-ready (i.e. ready to declare their STEM major in the first year of study). The selection process, based solely on academic qualification and financial eligibility, resulted in scholars from diverse backgrounds, gender and majors. Each scholar received $6000 per year ($3000, disbursed per semester), if they maintain a 3.0 and above GPA, and be registered for at least 30 credits per academic year. <strong>A total of 52 students received support from the program over the years (2017-2022)</strong></p>\r\n<p>Besides financial support, the program mandated the following activities:</p>\r\n<p>(1) Monthly PECS group meetings, often held on Friday nights. The goal of these meetings was to cultivate a relationship-rich learning environment for the scholars. In addition, thematic workshops were facilitated at these monthly meetings to provide scholars with personal, financial and professional development opportunities.</p>\r\n<p>(2) One meeting per semester with a faculty mentors and one-on-one meetings with the PI, Dr. Otieno. These meetings were held at the beginning and at the end of the semester, to assess students&rsquo; academic progress and ensure that they had the necessary support to secure internship, job, or research positions.</p>\r\n<p>(3) All PECS scholars were required to engage in two professional workshops/conferences &ndash;including the PECS monthly workshops and two community outreach activities per semester. In total, over the scholars&rsquo; time in UWM, they each engaged in at least 24 PECS monthly meetings, 16 professional development events/workshops and 16 community outreach events. Notable community outreach was made at the following annual events: UWM&rsquo;s ENQUEST programs (day and night summer camps for middle and high school students), Milwaukee&rsquo;s Discovery World&rsquo;s STEM Day, and UWM&rsquo;s Society of Women Engineers&rsquo; annual Girl Scout STEM Days.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Heading2a\"><strong>Notable successes:</strong></p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>87% of PECS scholars attained a bachelor's degree. This is great, compared to the College of Engineering and Applied Sciences 4-yr, 5-yr and 6-yr graduation rates that were 27%, 42%, and 47% respectively (as of Fall 2018).</li>\r\n<li>The 13% scholars who left college, did so in their sophomore year. </li>\r\n<li>Of those who graduated, only 7% left the STEM major for a non-STEM degree.</li>\r\n<li>In addition to the scholar&rsquo;s academic motivation the wrap-around academic support enabled those who graduated to do so with an average of 3.44 GPA.</li>\r\n<li>The average and median years to graduation were 4.3 and 4 years respectively. Once again, this remarkable time to graduation could be attributed to the scholars&rsquo; math readiness, their academic motivation and programmatic support. </li>\r\n<li>80% of the students who completed their bachelor's degree in UWM CEAS were involved in a professional student chapter.</li>\r\n<li>100% of the scholars who persisted till graduation had an internship or were involved in research experiences by their junior year. </li>\r\n<li>Over the length of the program, 30% of the scholar presented their research at several conferences and events, including, the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee&rsquo;s undergraduate research symposia, the College&rsquo;s Student Research Poster Competitions, the NSF-funded Emerging Researchers National Conference in STEM, among others.</li>\r\n<li>Several of them PECS Scholar received awards or notable mentioning at the conferences.</li>\r\n<li>One scholar&rsquo;s rich involvement with UWM&rsquo;s Lubar Entrepreneurship Center supported his creation of <em>Await</em>, a software platform that connects job and internship-seeking candidates.&nbsp; He exhibited his work at the LEC&rsquo;s Innovator&rsquo;s Expo and was a featured speaker at that event.&nbsp; Jacob won third place in the UWM CEO Wisconsin Big Idea Tournament and UWM&rsquo;s Collegiate Entrepreneur&rsquo;s Organization (CEO) awarded Jacob as the first place 2022 Entrepreneur of the Year. </li>\r\n<li>The PI provided recommendation letters to support graduate school applications for 6 of PECS Scholars who were all accepted into their respective graduate schools.</li>\r\n<li>Following the PECS PI&rsquo;s recommendation, one scholar, was accepted into the Mechanical Engineering PhD program at the University of Colorado-Boulder, and she was also a recipient of the 2024 Department of Defense's National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate Fellowship (7% acceptance rate). </li>\r\n<li>Three scholars belonged to a Senior Design Project Team that received Best Senior Project Awards (established in Fall 2022).</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>Overall, the PECS program met its goals and most importantly the scholars appreciated the opportunity to be in a learning community&mdash;surrounding themselves with like-minded learners.
