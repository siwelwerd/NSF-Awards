 "awd_abstract_narration": "Catalysts are used to accelerate production of chemicals in industrial processes, greatly increasing the efficiency of production and providing significant energy savings in chemical manufacturing.  Multicomponent alloys, homogeneous mixtures of two or more metals, are used as catalysts in these reactions because they are more effective than any of the pure metal components by itself.  The relative metal compositions are variable over a wide range, which presents a challenge in designing alloy catalysts in finding the optimal relative amounts of each metal component for maximum catalyst efficiency. This can become a tedious and time-consuming research activity because it requires the preparation, characterization and catalytic evaluation of hundreds of different alloy catalysts, each with a different composition. Dr. Gellman has invented a rapid, high-throughput method to accelerate the study of three-component (ternary) alloy catalysts over a wide range of possible compositions.  Dr. Gellman fabricates a single material in which the composition of the alloy is varied continuously along the material surface.  He then uses a number of state-of-the-art spatially-resolved analytical tools.  Each measurement probes a catalyst alloy with a different composition.  This methods allows 100 catalyst compositions to be prepared at once, then characterized and studied in a fraction of the time that sequential preparation of each composition would allow.  Dr. Gellman is using his high-throughput method to understand how the composition of alloy catalysts influences the kinetics and selectivity of acetylene (HCCH) hydrogenation to ethylene (H2CCH2), an important chemical process in polymer production. Ultimately, Dr. Gellman's work may lead to improvement of alloy catalysts for numerous applications and may contribute to clean energy technologies for its relevance to hydrocarbon conversion.  In addition to his advancement of the field of catalysis, Dr. Gellman is making broader impacts in his work with students.  He mentors female undergraduate students in research to encourage their interest in pursuing advanced degrees in the STEM fields.  He also is engaged in public education activities as part of his role as co-Director of the Carnegie Mellon University's Scott Institute for Energy Innovation.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding the complexity of multicomponent alloy catalysts is confounded by the experimental challenges of measuring the physical characteristics and the catalytic activities of alloy materials as a function of multidimensional composition. With funding from the Chemical Catalysis Program of the Chemistry Division and the Catalysis and Biocatalysis Program of the Division of Chemical, Bioengineering, Environment and Transport Systems Division, Dr. Andrew Gellman of Carnegie Mellon University addresses this challenge by using a unique set of high-throughput methods developed in his lab.  The analysis employs an alloy film containing all possible compositions of alloys in a process called Composition Spread Alloy Films (CSAF).  Ternary alloys, CuxAuyPd1-x-y, CuxAgyPd(1-x-y), and AgxAuyPd(1-x-y), are fabricated with x and y varied over the entire compositional range within an approximately 1 cm2 area sample size.  Spatially resolved surface analysis tools are used to map alloy characteristics, including bulk composition, surface composition and valence electronic structure, as a function of composition space.  A unique, 100 channel microreactor array is then used to make parallel measurements of the kinetics and selectivities of several catalytic processes, HD exchange, ethylene hydrogenation and acetylene hydrogenation, at 100 different alloy compositions.  Microkinetic analysis is used to extract the fundamental reaction parameters for elementary mechanistic steps. These measurements establish correlations among kinetic parameters and alloy characteristics and yield insight into rate dependence of individual elementary steps with alloy composition.  In addition to his advancement of the field of catalysis, Dr. Gellman is making broader impacts in his work with students.  He mentors undergraduate female students in research to encourage their interest in pursuing advanced degrees in the STEM fields.

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nCatalysis is the most important process by which chemicals and molecularly based materials are made; however, the catalysts that are used for many of these processes are themselves complex, multicomponent materials that require sophisticated design and optimization.  This project has focused on alloy catalysis and the understanding of how alloy catalyst composition, AxByC1-x-y, influences catalytic properties; a prerequisite to catalyst optimization.  In the course of this work, we have developed and applied new tools for the experimental study of alloys in such a way that the results span large continuous regions of alloy composition space; i.e. x = 0 &rarr; 1, y = 0 &rarr; 1-x. \n\nOne of the unique experimental tools developed for this work is a 100-channel microreactor array (Figure 1) that allows concurrent measurement of the catalytic activity on alloys having 100 different compositions (x,y).  Relative to traditional methods, this vastly accelerates the rate at which alloy catalysts can be studied.  Over the course of the project, we have made improvements to this reactor design that allow operation with 10- to 100-fold higher sensitivity than before.  In addition, we have changed some of the materials in the reactor system such that its maximum operating temperature has been increased from &lt; 300 ?C to &gt; 400 ?C.\n\nIn the course of studying the alloy composition dependence of ethylene and acetylene hydrogenation, we have examined the kinetics of H2-D2 exchange on AgPd and CuAuPd alloys. In doing so we have discovered some unusual behavior that has been previously observed on pure Pd catalysts and ascribed to the involvement of subsurface hydrogen.  Prior observers noted that the reaction kinetics were inconsistent with a standard Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism and they developed a ?breakthrough? model for incorporation of hydrogen into the subsurface of their Pd catalysts.  By analysis of our data and several other kinetic models we were able to discount the breakthrough model but also identified another mechanism that is consistent with the data and involves simple equilibrium transport of hydrogen from the surface to the subsurface (Figure 2).  This is an important outcome because it is quite likely that this behavior is occurring during processes such as ethylene and acetylene hydrogenation and that this subsurface hydrogen must be factored into our understanding of their reaction kinetics.\n\nFinally, our studies of H2-D2 exchange, ethylene hydrogenation and acetylene hydrogenation have yield maps of catalytic activity versus alloy composition spanning the entire ternary composition space.  These yield remarkably similar maps of composition dependence for all three reactions (Figure 3).  The initial conclusion is that they are dictated by a common reaction step which, in this case, might be H2 adsorption. \n\nThe outcomes of this work impact catalysis science, catalysis R&amp;D and ultimately consumers of the vast array of chemicals and materials that are critical to our quality and standard of life.  The high throughput methods developed in this work demonstrate approaches to accelerating the understanding, design and optimization of new catalysts.  The ability to map catalytic reactivity across continuous regions of alloy composition space also results in data sets that are of use to computational scientists who are simulating and modeling catalysis.  These maps serve as benchmarks for calibrating their computational modeling tools.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/10/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Andrew J Gellman"
