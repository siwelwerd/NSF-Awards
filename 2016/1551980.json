 "awd_abstract_narration": "The nature of dark matter is currently unknown. Cosmic rays, which are energetic sub-atomic particles from space that travel at velocities near the speed of light, can help to identify dark matter particles. This is because one possible cosmic ray production mechanism is the annihilation of dark matter particles.  Cosmic ray antideuteron particles are a particularly interesting potential signature of dark matter annihilation.  This CAREER award supports scientists at the University of Hawaii to study dark matter by performing the first measurements of the cosmic-ray antideuteron flux.  The group will utilize data from the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS), currently operating onboard the International Space Station, and data from the General Antiparticle Spectrometer (GAPS), a balloon experiment that is under development.  This award will support scientific investigations that utilize the complementary capabilities of both experiments to perform high-sensitivity measurements of cosmic-ray antideuterons.  The group is also developing a summer course to teach computer programming to local high school students.  Students will be taught programming skills using Raspberry Pi computers.  Mimicking scientific ballooning operations, the devices will be mounted on kites to measure temperatures and humidity, and take aerial pictures.\r\n \r\nThe planned program includes the development of antideuteron production physics simulations, analysis of AMS data, simulations and calibration of the GAPS detectors, and ultimately analysis of GAPS data.  These experiments use different technologies to detect cosmic rays.  Utilizing both provides the group with complementary data, extending the energy range of the proposed study and improving the control of the systematic effects that limit the sensitivity of the search for these rare events.  This award is jointly funded by the Physics Division and the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).",
