The scope is broad: topics that have been covered in the past include the misperception of risk, security usability, deception, security and privacy decision making, and so forth. As the SaTC program has expanded to include social sciences in addition to its core in computer science, gatherings such as SHB provide a key venue for interaction between the different communities.\r\n\r\nThis award supports student attendance and participation in the 2016 SHB workshop.  Participation in the SHB Workshop is by invitation - and the first rule of the SHB Workshop is that everyone who attends actually participates in the discussion. This will ensure that students get more value from attending SHB than many conferences and workshops where they can simply listen.",
