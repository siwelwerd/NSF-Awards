 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this research project is to investigate the water control systems and the land management practices at the Maya city of Tikal. This project is highly innovative because it provides an opportunity to advance the scientific understanding of the fundamental adaptive practices that enabled the ancient Maya to support a high population density and complex social order during their zenith. In addition, this study represents a significant technological advance in the study of ancient cultures by identifying harmful bacteria and other microorganisms in the Tikal water system and by offering a better understanding of the history of Maya agriculture, nutrition, and encounters with diseases. These anticipated results can be compared to other known stages of Maya prehistory, including the time of the collapse, and form a baseline for regional comparisons. The proposed project represents a technological breakthrough; it will be the first time a microbial community composition study will be undertaken in the Maya area. In particular, this project has the distinct promise of leading to a more complete understanding of the basic economic underpinnings of one of the great Maya polities and how the ancient Maya, in the face of droughts and burgeoning populations in the mid-9th century AD, may have been unable to keep their complex water management system clear of problematic pathogens.  \r\n \r\nDr. Lentz and his research team will address the following theoretical questions: How were the ancient Maya in the prominent city of Tikal able to maintain water quality and protect the watersheds surrounding the reservoirs that provided their large populations with adequate supplies of water during the Late Classic period (AD 600-900)? Did the Maya differentiate between water stored for human consumption and water collected principally for agriculture? Were the ancient Maya of Tikal able to keep their critical water resources clear of contamination from human and animal waste? How did the Maya protect their reservoirs, many with steep banks, from severe erosion? Did waterborne human pathogens contribute to the devastating collapse and abandonment of Tikal at the end of the Late Classic period? To answer these and other questions the use of next generation, high-throughput genetic sequencing techniques and soil geochemistry assessments will be employed in ways that will be both innovative and insightful. The novel techniques and planned research directives for this project will provide substantive answers to aspects of all of the proposed research questions.",

To answer these and other questions we have used soil geochemistry assessments and the next generation high throughput genetic sequencing techniques in ways that are both innovative and insightful. This project has contributed answers to the following questions:</p>\n<p class=\"BodyA\">1) Were the ancient Maya of Tikal able to protect their critical water resources from contamination by human and animal excreta as well as pollution from inorganic substances? As usual, the answer turns out to be yes and no. The Corriental Reservoir was kept free of organic wastes as well as inorganic pollutants, such as mercury, largely because of a set of sand filters at the ingress of the reservoir. The Palace and Temple Reservoirs had high levels of phosphate, a proxy for pollution by organic substances, (Fig. 1) and also extraordinarily high levels of mercury, especially during the Late Classic and Terminal Classic periods (Fig. 2). The mercury likely came from the extensive use of cinnabar (HgS) in the ceremonial sector of the city.</p>\n<p class=\"BodyA\">2) Did the Maya differentiate between water stored for human consumption and water collected principally for agriculture? Yes, they did. The Perdido Reservoir seems to have been part of an elaborate irrigation system whose source of water originated in the \"Lost World\" portion of the site core. We know Perdido was used for irrigation because the tank itself was filled with debris and the land below the reservior was flooded repeatedly as seen in the stratigraphy. The Temple, Palace and Corriental Reservoirs appeared to be used to store water for household use.</p>\n<p class=\"BodyA\">3) How did the Maya protect their reservoirs, many with steep banks, from severe erosion? From our genetic probe study, we learned that the Tikal Maya protected the steep sidewall of each reservoir with native trees and planted orchard trees with an understory of ferns.</p>\n<p class=\"BodyA\">4) Did waterborne human pathogens contribute to the devastating collapse and abandonment of Tikal at the end of the Late Classic period? We found no evidence of human pathogens in the Tikal reservoirs, but we did find evidence of other problematic microorganisms, viz., cyanobacteria or blue-green algae. In fact, there appeared to be several blue-green algal blooms in the Late Preclassic and the Late Classic (Fig.3), both periods of extensive drought. At least two strains of the cyanobacteria, Planktothrix and Microcystis produce deadly toxins known as microcystins. These toxins&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;would have rendered the waters of these two reservoirs poisonous to anyone who consumed them.</span></p>\n<p class=\"bodya\"><span>The geochemical and molecular genetic techniques we used have been effective and our research has provided substantive answers to aspects of all of the questions listed above.
