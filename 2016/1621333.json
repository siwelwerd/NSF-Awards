 "awd_abstract_narration": "Districts have long struggled to implement instructional programming in ways that meaningfully and sustainably impact teaching and learning. Systemic education reform is based on the hypothesis that prevailing patterns of incoherence and misalignment in an educational system can send mixed messages to local implementers as they try to respond to various cues and incentives in the environment. Systemic reform seeks to bring alignment to education systems in multiple ways, including consistency across instructional philosophies, alignment across grade levels, and vertical coherence from district to schools to classrooms. This project builds on the Consortium for Policy Research in Education's (CPRE) ongoing, NSF-funded experimental study of the impacts of the Ongoing Assessment Project's (OGAP) math assessment intervention on elementary teachers and students in Philadelphia-area schools. The project will combine the OGAP math intervention with research-based understandings of systemic reform. OGAP is based upon established theory and research demonstrating the impact of teachers' use of ongoing short- and medium-cycle formative assessment on student learning. It combines these understandings with recent research on learning trajectories within mathematics content domains. By bringing to bear the strengths of all three of these areas of research - formative assessment, learning trajectories, and systemic reform - the project promises a significant contribution to the knowledge base about the application of math learning research to classroom instruction on a large scale. This project will produce concrete tools, routines, and practices that can be applied to strengthen programs' implementation by ensuring the strategic support of school and district leaders. This project is funded by the Discovery Research PreK-12 (DRK-12) and EHR Core Research (ECR) Programs. The DRK-12 program supports research and development on STEM education innovations and approaches to teaching, learning, and assessment. The ECR program emphasizes fundamental STEM education research that generates foundational knowledge in the field. \r\n\r\nCPRE and the School District of Philadelphia (SDP) will establish a research-practice partnership focused on developing, implementing, refining, and testing a systemic support model to strengthen implementation of the OGAP math intervention in elementary schools. CPRE's current experimental study of OGAP's impacts reveals, preliminarily, statistically significant positive effects on teacher knowledge and student learning. As a result, SDP has decided to expand OGAP into an additional 60 schools in 2016-17. However, the current OGAP study has also revealed weak implementation stemming from a lack of consistent leadership support for the intervention. The project will address this implementation challenge by developing, refining, supporting, and documenting a systemic support component that will accompany OGAP's classroom-level implementation. The systemic supports will be developed by a research-practice partnership between CPRE; SDP; OGAP; the Graduate School of Education at the University of Pennsylvania (PennGSE); and the Philadelphia Education Research Consortium (PERC). The team will use principles of design-based implementation research to iteratively refine and improve the systemic support model. Along with the design and development of the systemic support model, the project will conduct a mixed-methods study of its impacts and roll-out. A three-armed quasi-experimental study will examine the differential impacts of OGAP, with and without systemic supports, and business-as-usual math programming on teacher and student outcomes. A mixed-methods study will examine teacher and administrator experiences in both treatment groups, and will provide feedback to inform the iterative development of the systemic support model.",

OGAP provides a suite of tools to support teachers in using evidenced-based learning trajectories to guide instructional decisions. The project built on findings from a randomized control trial (RCT) in the SDP and a neighboring district, which examined the impact of OGAP on teacher and student outcomes (also funded by NSF, Award #<strong> </strong>1316527).&nbsp; This grant supported a partnership, referred to at the Philadelphia Mathematics Learning Collaborative (PMLC), between the research team at the Consortium for Policy Research in Education at the University of Pennsylvania, the OGAP providers, and the SDP. The primary focus of PMLC was to incrementally shift the culture in the district from a performance mindset to a formative assessment mindset, which we believed would support more robust use of formative assessment practices. Overall, OGAP provided professional development and ongoing support for almost 1,150 teachers of mathematics in grades K-8 in 146 schools and impacted an estimated 22,900 students. As part of the systemic focus, the grant also provided professional development and support for principals and math leads in many of the schools.</p>\n<p>We also undertook a series of quasi-experimental studies of program impacts and mixed method analyses of program implementation. The research team studied the impacts of the OGAP mathematics professional development and school supports on teachers' knowledge, teacher reports of impacts on their practice, and student outcomes with both experimental and quasi-experimental research designs. Teacher knowledge was measured through an authentic assessment of teachers' formative assessment practices and familiarity with learning trajectories.</p>\n<p><strong>Research Findings</strong></p>\n<p>The research findings showed consistent impacts on teacher knowledge of learning trajectory-oriented formative assessment, which are the core principles of OGAP. To assess teacher knowledge we used an authentic performance assessment called the Teacher Assessment of Student Knowledge, or TASK, which asked teachers to examine six pieces of student work on a grade appropriate open-ended mathematics problem and analyze the student thinking, sort the solutions according to their sophistication and explain their rationale, and suggest instructional next steps. The TASK was administered to OGAP and comparison teachers in the summer (i.e. before treatment) and in the spring of the following year. Each year, OGAP teachers scored significantly higher on the TASK assessment than did the comparison teachers, after controlling for baseline TASK performance and teacher and school characteristics.</p>\n<p>We also examined the impacts of OGAP on state test results on the mathematics component of the Pennsylvania State System of Assessment (PSSA) quasi-experimentally in 2018. The results showed significant differences in performance in the first year of the experiment in grades 3-5, but not in the second year. In 2018, there were significant differences favoring the OGAP students in grades 4,6, and 7, while performance was roughly equivalent in grades 5 and 8.</p>\n<p>Finally, the research team produced a series of implementation studies that are collected in a forthcoming edited volume. Some of the key implementation findings include the benefits of bringing support closer to the schools were teachers do their work; the more nuanced ways in which teachers grapple with the conceptual shifts that underlie many contemporary instructional reforms; the headwinds produced by seeking to implement ambitious instruction in an education system that is largely still constructed to support outmoded notions of teaching and learning; and the important role of school leaders in fostering the environment for ambitious instruction to take place.</p>\n<p><strong>Research Products</strong></p>\n<p>The team produced many products that examined the process and product of the activities supported by the grant.

Additionally, principals and teacher leaders from each school received professional development aimed supporting a formative mindset. The team launched a website to make OGAP recourses available to participating teachers.
