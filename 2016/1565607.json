 "awd_abstract_narration": "Scientific teams allow for the integration of individuals? expertise into a coherent effort, benefitting from depth and breadth of knowledge - a winning combination for creativity and novelty, two cornerstones of innovation. However, obstacles arise that must be overcome in order to fulfill the aims of research yet little is known about what kinds of obstacles are confronted and how and whether they are resolved. A greater understanding of strategies to deal with research obstacles will benefit academics interested in problem-solving and team science, managers seeking to increase their teams? problem-solving capabilities, and funding agencies and science policy experts as they seek to increase the effectiveness of research investments. \r\n\r\nThis project introduces and explicates the concept of a research obstacle, develops measurements of this concept, and investigates problem-solving processes of scientific research and development (R&D) teams. Qualitative analysis of in-depth interviews with project leaders and scientists seeks to understand the problem-solving routines of multi-disciplinary/ multi-functional pharmaceutical R&D teams. Additional analysis explores how routines break under the weight of serious research obstacles. Scientists are surveyed to discern the efficiency of problem-solving communication patterns and to uncover the inter- and intra-team communication structures that promote team-based problem-solving capability.\r\n",

This goal is important because problem-solving is a fundamental part of the innovation process, but it is under studied. To meet that goal, this project interviewed 39 biopharmaceutical scientists and surveyed over 600 members of a professional science association. The biopharmaceutical field is particularly interesting because its projects are conducted by multidisciplinary teams of scientists and it is considered a very innovative field. Interestingly, this field also has a high rate of project failure, indicating that scientists must engage in problem-solving as part of the innovation cycle. The first study utilizes interview conversations with scientists in the biopharmaceutical industry. Conversations with these scientists about a research problem they encountered and how it was dealt with, I argue, teaches us how biopharmaceutical companies are set up to deal with problems. As expected, biopharmaceutical research and development projects often experience research problems that must be dealt with in order to avoid project failure. Interestingly, these types of companies have a unique structure that facilitates scientific problem-solving. These results are also of interest to those studying science, innovation, and teams. Results of the second study seek to provide measurements and statistical models associated with individuals&rsquo; and teams&rsquo; problem-solving capability. These results establish that problem-solving plays a key role in the realm of biopharmaceutical research and development by supporting the innovation cycle. These results also provide guidance about how problem-solving can be supported by teams, managers, and organizations.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 02/02/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: David&nbsp;Mcbee</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"></div>\n</div>",
