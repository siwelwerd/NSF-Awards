 "awd_abstract_narration": "Polynomials, and more generally rational functions (meaning ratios between two polynomials), are used throughout science and engineering, since they are the functions that are best understood.  It turns out that most rational functions of any given degree will behave similarly in almost every application.  The goal of this research project is to determine the special rational functions whose behavior differs from this typical behavior.  This will have important applications in various areas of mathematics, as well as in science and engineering.  Much of the research will be carried out in collaboration with junior mathematicians ranging from high school students to postdoctoral researchers, thereby providing a rare opportunity for such junior mathematicians to play a significant role in the proofs of important results.  Several of these junior mathematicians will be members of underrepresented groups.\r\n\r\nThe goal of the proposed work is to determine all possibilities for the essential geometric data describing the \"shape\" of the function induced by a complex rational function, namely the monodromy group and ramification type.  This problem has been studied by Hurwitz, Ritt, Zariski, Thompson, Guralnick, and other mathematicians, and it now seems possible to solve it in case the rational function is not the composition of lower-degree rational functions.  A solution would resolve longstanding questions about diophantine equations, dynamical systems, value distribution of meromorphic functions, and several other topics.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project obtained fundamental new results in algebra, analysis, and geometry.  The main achievement is a determination of all complex rational functions -- meaning ratios between two polynomials -- which are \"special\", in the sense that their behavior as functions does not resemble that of a \"typical\" rational function.  A consequence in analysis is a determination of the extent to which a rational function (or more generally a meromorphic function, which can be thought of as an \"infinite\" rational function) is determined by its preimages at a small number of small sets.  A consequence in geometry is existence and nonexistence results for maps between geometric objects with prescribed behavior near finitely many points.  A surprising consequence in algebra is a description of all rational functions over some number system -- such as the rational numbers -- which cannot be written in a nontrivial way as compositions of other rational functions over that number system, but do admit a nontrivial expression as the composition of other rational functions over a larger number system such as the complex numbers.  This result provides a bridge which enables our main result about complex rational functions to be applied to questions about rational functions over other number systems such as the rational numbers.  This project also yielded new classes of simply defined permutations over finite number systems, which have potential applications in cryptography.  In addition it yielded new results about basic questions in algebraic geometry, including a formula for the main geometric invariant of a commonly occurring class of algebraic curves, namely the genus.  Finally, the project yielded a new type of result in dynamics, classifying all ways to repeatedly compose one complex polynomial with another and obtain the same composite polynomial as one gets from a different composition of copies of the original two polynomials.  This last result opens up new possibilities in dynamics, where typically one composes one polynomial with itself, but now one can repeatedly compose two polynomials with each other and obtain manageable situations.\n\nOver a dozen high school students, undergraduates, and graduate students participated in this project.  Their participation in cutting-edge research will surely inspire some of them to become mathematicians, and will provide valuable perspective and experience for those who do not become mathematicians.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/14/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Michael E Zieve"
