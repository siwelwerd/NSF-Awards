 "awd_abstract_narration": "Proteins are large biopolymers made up of amino acids and participate in most processes within cells.  Their structure and the dynamics or flexibility of that structure is essential to protein function.  This project will develop Electron Spin Resonance (ESR) methodology to measure precise distance constraints that are reporters of protein backbone structure and flexibility. In this project, a Copper ion based spin probe will be developed for the ESR measurements.  The copper spin probe can be assembled without modification of the protein, and is much smaller that conventional probes and thus will enable more precise distance measurements. This project will measure changes in protein structure directly in cells under conditions where functional measurements can be performed. While training a number of graduate and undergraduate students, this project will expand access to pulsed ESR instrumentation to undergraduates and graduate students at regional colleges in Pennsylvania including those serving predominantly African American populations. This project will also provide hands on science experience, career awareness and academic advising to assist pre-college historically under-represented students in STEM fields.\r\n\r\nThis project will develop strategies to exploit native protein residues to site-specifically and selectively attach Copper(II) for pulsed ESR distance measurements both in-vitro and in cells; and probe initial steps in the gating mechanism of ELIC, a prokaryotic, pentameric, ligand-gated ion channel from Erwinia chrysanthemi in lipid vesicles and in cells. A Copper(II)-based spin probe that can be assembled in situ from natural amino acid residues and a metal salt, without the need for post-expression synthetic modification, will be developed and used. This probe will be used to determine distance constraints that are more narrowly defined and overcome the inherent limitation of the current technology which relies on a spin label with a highly flexible side-chain. Conformational changes in the extracellular domain of ELIC that lead to the opening of the pore upon ligand binding will be determined and such changes will then be measured directly in cells under functional conditions. This project is supported by the Molecular Biophysics Cluster of the Molecular and Cellular Biosciences Division in the Directorate for Biological Sciences.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nA key achievement of the present NSF-MCB grant has been the development of site directed Cu2+ spin labeling. We have developed approaches for labeling proteins with Cu2+ ions and showed the enhancement in the fidelity of the measured distance distribution when compared to nitroxide spin labels.  Specifically, we have shown that Cu2+-based distance measurements using the double-histidine (dHis) motif by pulsed ESR present an attractive strategy to obtain precise, narrow distance distributions that can be easily related to protein backbone structure. In this approach two strategically placed His residues (i to i+2 for a beta sheet, and i to i+4 for a helix) are used to create a Cu2+-binding site. The Cu2+-ion is introduced as a complex with a chelating agent, which enhances binding selectivity to the dHis site and reduces non-specific binding. The resultant distance distributions are up to five time narrower than comparable nitroxide based distances and therefore provide robust constraints on protein structure and flexibility.  For DNA, we have developed a site-specific Cu2+ binding motif within a DNA duplex for distance measurements by ESR.  The DNA label is nucleotide independent, can be placed anywhere on a DNA sequence and provides distance constraints that can be directly related to DNA backbone constraints.  We have developed applications of this spin labeling methodology that show their use in distinguishing between protein conformations, monitoring conformational changes, and assessing three-dimensional protein arrangement, which has implications for protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions, quaternary structural arrangement, and native metal binding site location, as well as determining the relative orientation of protein subunits. Twenty publications resulted from support by this NSF grant. \n\nThe grant has contributed to a multi-pronged effort to enhance opportunities for under-represented groups to participate in science.
