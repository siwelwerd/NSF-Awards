 "awd_abstract_narration": "Major efforts have been devoted to earthquake research to further our understanding of this natural phenomenon and attempt to reduce its disastrous damage. However, it is not possible to directly observe earthquake processes, because they occur along faults at depths of a few to hundreds of kilometers. The researchers from Oklahoma University have developed an experimental laboratory with tools to duplicate earthquake speeds and offsets on samples of natural rocks. They will partner with a laboratory at Hebrew University that simulate high speed fracturing on acrylics, which are not the same as naturally occurring rocks but can help researchers see aspects of what is happening that could be related to the natural rock experiments. The combination of these sets of complimentary lab experiments will help us to understand how fractures that cause earthquakes and radiates seismic waves. This information is important to improving how we understand seismic hazards because it will advance what we know about strong ground shaking.\r\n\r\nThe Oklahoma University team developed an apparatus that physically simulates the velocity and displacement of large earthquakes on experimental rock faults. This team succeeded in reproducing well-known earthquake features of rock weakening and energy consumption. The Hebrew University team has developed unique, high-speed experimental tools that quantitatively measure the extremely fast mechanical evolution of the rupture of a \"laboratory\" earthquake. The project will combine the unique capabilities of the two experimental systems for better understanding of earthquake rupture, including detailed description of realistic processes of rock fracturing, friction, and ground shaking. Experimental data on earthquake processes at depth are essential for the derivation of useful models, interpretation of seismic observations, and the evaluation of seismic hazard. The advanced features of the two experimental systems will allow monitoring of rupture along rock-faults at very high resolution, which cannot be achieved for natural earthquakes. It is anticipated that this rupture monitoring will provide the missing links between experiments, theory and seismic concepts, and therefore will significantly advance the understanding of earthquake rupture processes, earthquake energy balance, physics of fault weakening, and the scaling of slip rate, slip magnitude, and seismic hazard.",

Stick-slips have been widely observed in laboratory experiments of slip along experimental faults. In 1966, Brace and Byerlee declared that stick-slips are the laboratory analogues of natural earthquakes but did not present a mechanical analysis for the stick-slips. One of the main outcomes of our research is the derivation of the first mechanical model for stick-slips along faults. The model is based on direct experimental observations of asperities, which are tiny points of contact across any fault that are highly stressed and fail during fault motion (Fig. 2). We studied in detail the asperity failure and the fault geometry, and explained how breaking asperities can cause stick-slips and weaken the fault. Our model predictions suggest that a smooth fault will generate more intense earthquake ruptures than a rough fault, and this prediction will be tested in the seismic character of natural faults.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Earthquake nucleation</span></p>\n<p>The unstable rupture of an earthquake along a fault requires dynamic weakening that traditionally was attributed to the frictional weakening.

We monitored the spontaneous ruptures in detail and found that they started abruptly at a small nucleation site and propagated extremely fast, in the so-called supershear velocity. Most importantly, we found that the rupture fronts intensely reduced the fault strength by as much as 60% during tiny displacements of tens of microns. This dynamic weakening is more efficient by orders of magnitude than the frictional weakening in traditional friction experiments. We apply these results to natural earthquake faults by proposing the following scenario (Fig. 4): Natural faults are heterogeneous with many patches, and some of them are as small as our experimental fault (about 30 cm long). Once such a patch breaks, it generates a tiny rupture, which is a very low magnitude earthquake that cannot be detected by the existing seismic systems. However, as in our laboratory earthquakes, this rupture can intensely weaken the natural fault. The salient question is whether such a tiny rupture can nucleate a large earthquake. We can illustrate this situation by considering a large forest with many living and dead trees. Here, a large fire can be caused by a single match if and only if the forest is very dry. In the earthquake case, the tiny rupture could nucleate a large earthquake if and only if the earth crust around the fault has sufficient stored elastic energy to ?feed? the propagating rupture. Without sufficient stored energy, the tiny rupture will ?die out? without being noticed.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 08/28/2020<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Ze'ev&nbsp;Reches</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1620330/1620330_10434319_1598645869035_stickslipsforoutcome--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1620330/1620330_10434319_1598645869035_stickslipsforoutcome--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1.\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1620330/1620330_10434319_1598645869035_stickslipsforoutcome--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1.\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Three stick-slip events that are regarded as laboratory earthquakes.
