 "awd_abstract_narration": "Centromeres are DNA segments that ensure the faithful segregation of chromosomes to daughter cells during division. The structure of centromeres is not well understood, although coordinated changes in the DNA and associated factors are necessary for centromere function. Furthermore, centromere structure and function can change over time raising questions about how the genome responds and adapt at the chromosome level. Centromeres are difficult to study because they are composed of retrotranspons and other mobile elements that consist of highly repetitive sequences. The ability to assemble spans of short repeated sequences is notoriously difficult, so the centromere regions of chromosomes have remained nearly obscure to researchers. This project will sequence and analyze the centromere regions of all ten maize chromosomes using new sequencing technologies and software tools that permit assembly and analysis of the repetitive sequences and will permit study of the associated factors unique to centromeres. The results of this project will add value to the already sequenced maize genome and will result in an improved reference genome fully available to the plant research community. By discovering the structure and function of centromeres, the potential to construct artificial chromosomes will be expanded and agronomic traits associated with centromeres may be identified. As part of the project, undergraduate students will be trained in modern plant engineering methods and synthetic biology. The team of undergraduate students will participate in an international student research competition, thus promoting student and public understanding of plant centromeres and synthetic biology. \r\n\r\nLittle is known about the role of DNA in centromere function and evolution. In a first step, the nature and arrangement of centromere-specific repeats at all ten maize centromeres of the inbred B73 reference genome will be determined using PacBio technology. The impact of these repeats on the deposition of centromere-specific proteins will be determined using a number of different experimental approaches, including comparative genomics and epigenomics, as well as biochemical and genetic assays. Neocentromere formation is an epigenetic change that involves movement of CENH3, the centromere specific histone H3, to a new genomic region. Rapid invasion of neocentromeres by centromeric retrotransposons (CR) provides an unprecedented opportunity to study the interplay of epigenetic and genetic changes. A large number of epigenetic marks have been, or are being, mapped in the standard maize genomes. Histone H2A.Z nucleosomes, which may represent persistent marks of transcribed regions, will be mapped and integrated with all available epigenetic signatures to determine the reciprocal effects of genetic (double-stranded DNA breaks and retrotransposons insertion) and epigenetic (histone variants, histone modifications, gene expression, DNA methylation). At least one additional epigenetic marker that specifically binds centromeric repeats will be characterized in detail. All data produced in the course of this research will be deposited at MaizeGDB (maizegdb.org) and GenBank (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/).",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nRetrotransposons are chromosomal DNA elements that can increase their numbers in the genome by creating a copy of their DNA sequence and inserting it elsewhere, including on other chromosomes. Elements belonging to the CR family of plant retrotransposons are able to target their integration to the centromere regions of chromosomes by an as yet unknown mechanism. Centromeres, which can be span several million nucleotides, are critical for ensuring that both daughter cells resulting from each cell division receive one complete set of chromosomes. Understanding the basis of CR targeting to centromeres, as well as identifying any role that these elements may be playing in centromere stability, requires complete and accurate centromere DNA sequence.\n\n\nThe DNA sequence of the sum of an organisms chromosomes is called the genome. Centromeres were the final genome regions to be accurately sequenced because they consist primarily of highly repetitive DNA that is difficult to assemble and very few, if any, genes. This project contributed to the first nearly complete and accurate sequence of all ten centromeres of the maize reference genome, which allowed a detailed reconstruction of maize centromere evolution.\n\n\nThe genome is adorned with epigenetic flags, which are chemical changes to the DNA or associated proteins that determine its function. These flags can be removed by cellular enzymes, but can also be heritable, i.e. passed on to the offspring. The sum of these flags is called the epigenome. Centromeres and active genes are demarcated by different epigenetic flags. Previous work showed that the epigenetic flags specific to centromeres have moved to different locations on the chromosome during the maize domestication process over the past 10,000 years. In some cases these new centromere locations already contained pre-existing epigenetic flags characteristic of genes. These relocated centromeres of maize were studied to determine how the apparently conflicting epigenetic signals, those marking active genes and those marking the centromere, influence each other when centromeres move. This work has implications for the engineering of crop chromosomes when genes are placed near centromeres.\n\n\nIn addition, the potential interactions of CR elements with centromere-specific epigenetic flags were examined. Although the centromere-targeting mechanism of CR elements is not yet fully understood, at least one member involved in the docking process has been identified. This work has implications for the engineering of crop chromosomes in the context of placing genes in or near centromeres.\n\n\nTwo postdoctoral fellows, two graduate students, and eight undergraduate students (including an iGEM team of six) received training in current molecular biology and bioinformatic techniques while performing research funded by this grant. Large datasets of epigenetically flagged maize genome sequences were produced and made available to the public for use in future research on the maize epigenome.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/28/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: GernotGPresting\n"
