 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mineral dust constitutes a critical nexus between the geosphere, atmosphere, biosphere, and hydrosphere. One of the most abundant atmospheric aerosols by mass, mineral dust can influence numerous ecosystem processes through its effects on climate and biogeochemistry. Dust supplies essential limiting nutrients as well as toxic pollutants to ecosystems, with long-term implications for elemental cycling. This project will address the considerable uncertainties regarding dust influence on terrestrial ecosystem processes, including wet dust deposition, carbon uptake, and evapotranspiration. It will maximize financial and societal return from publicly available data, provide training for the next generation scientific workforce, and broaden the participation of underrepresented groups in science.\r\n\r\nThis highly interdisciplinary project will develop the foundation for testing an integrative framework for conceptualizing dust events, dust sinks, and ecosystem interactions during a period of historic drought. It will: (1) characterize dust events during a period of widespread severe to exceptional drought; 2) analyze the chemical composition and quantify the magnitude of wet dust deposition; (3) quantify the influence of dust events on ecosystem light use efficiency, water use efficiency, and carbon sequestration. The project integrates research and education with students at all levels, including a concerted effort to recruit underrepresented students. The team will produce a lecture and laboratory module on drought and dust in arid and semi-arid regions. The project will contribute to the career development of one early career and one postdoctoral scholar (both female and Hispanic).",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project focused on the environmental impact of dust storms across Texas (at the Guadalupe Mountains in far west Texas, and in the Gulf Coastal Plain west of Houston), with a focus on dust falling/washing out in rain (wet deposition).  Most previous studies of dust storms in Texas had focused on dry falling dust, ignoring dust mixed into rain.  The team looked at samples collected weekly over the course of the year 2012, a year of extreme drought (and dust) in Texas.\n\n \n\nSamples of dusty rain were obtained from the National Atmospheric Deposition Program (NADP) from the two sites.  The researchers developed methods to separate the dust from the rainwater without contamination, and to analyze the dust and the rainwater (which included any dissolved components of dust) by several chemical and physical techniques to reveal and obtain the concentrations of many different chemical elements (titanium, iron, etc.) and ions (chloride, phosphate, etc.) in the samples. \n\n \n\nThe team?s analyses showed that the concentrations of many ions and elements detected in the rainwater samples (including calcium, iron, and titanium) were higher during weeks with dust (3 weeks total) than during non-dusty weeks (19 weeks total).  In 2012, dust-in-rain events delivered 16% of the rainwater at the West Texas site.  Yet, these events delivered nearly one-half of annual wet deposition of sodium an chloride and 25-35% of calcium, magnesium, and potassium deposition. Comparatively less sulfate, nitrate, ammonium, and bromide deposition happened during dust-in-rain events.  Calcium was the dominant ion dissolved in rainwater, while iron was the dominant element the team measured in solid particles of dust carried with rain.  \n\n \n\nStatistical analyses are underway to relate the components of dust suspended and dissolved in Texas rain to its sources from the Texas Panhandle and Plains to the Chihuahuan Desert near El Paso, and even to the Sahara Desert, whose dust can be carried all the way across the Atlantic to Texas by tropical winds.\n\n \n\nThe results of the project show that scientists and land managers cannot ignore the input of dust falling out in rain to the land and the environment.  Dusty rain contains some substances that act as nutrients to plants and ecosystems, as well as others that could be harmful pollutants.  The team has also learned and demonstrated the success of a new scientific technique for preparation and chemical analysis of dust particles filtered out of rainwater.\n\n \n\nThe research team presented the results of this project to the scientific community at meetings, including the American Association of Geographers and the American Geophysical Union, and is preparing at least three papers for publication in international scientific journals.  Beyond the impacts relevant to the research community and environmental managers, this project has helped train many young scientists, from biology to earth science to physics, from diverse groups including Latina women and a disabled veteran.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/17/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Alexandra G Ponette-Gonzalez"
