 "awd_abstract_narration": "Clinicians and researchers routinely use single molecule experiments and plate reader based assays to determine the concentration or behavior of a molecule or substance of interest. Currently, researchers utilize signal enhancing substrates and expensive imaging systems such as total internal reflection microscopes (TIR) to obtain better image quality and lower detection limits. Clinicians perform patient diagnostics using diagnostic and test kits which utilize emerging technologies to provide kits with lower detection limits and faster assay times. Typically, these assays require well-trained technicians, expensive equipment and good infrastructure in which to operate. This I-Corps team is developing a platform that can be adapted to the currently used equipment and provide much better performance by enhancing fluorescence signals. This high performance platform is expected to reduce the burden of infrastructure and expensive equipment significantly by eventually being integrated into smartphones to create a point-of-care system.\r\n\r\nPlasmonic gratings greatly enhance fluorescent signal due to interaction of plasmons and fluorophores. The inexpensive fabrication method of the gratings take advantage of commercially available master molds in the form of CDs, DVDs, and HD-DVDs. Due to the fluorescence enhancement, low detection limit and high signal-to-noise have been achieved. This team envisions three products, slides printed with gratings, microwell plates, and platforms integrated with a smartphone. The I-Corps grant will provide valuable information and training about what is needed to bring this plasmonic grating technology to industrial and clinical markets. During the project, the team will have better understanding of market needs leading to better product designs. The knowledge and experience gained through I-Corps program will be shared with other potential entrepreneurs and students through meetings and presentations. These activities would spread the knowledge and experience to other potential entrepreneur leaders at the University of Missouri as well as surrounding communities.",

Commercialization of the technology was a main goal of the project. The fluorescence platform was developed from commercially available HD-DVD and Bluray to reduce the manufacturing cost so that the final products can be used without financial burden as a part of a point-of-care (POC) system. The fluorescence platform attracted investigators as well as scientists and healthcare providers due to the capability of early detection of diseases. As a result, we achieved one license agreement between the University of Missouri and Park Technologies, founded one company to commercialize this technology (Plamonic Diagnostics, LLC), submitted one patent application (US Patent Application 62/296,253 &ldquo;Fabrication of Multilayer Nanograting Structures&rdquo;), submitted two SBIR proposals (NIH SBIR: &ldquo;Development of Ultrasensitive Analytical Method for Monitoring Therapy and Recurrence after Surgery in Prostate Cancer Patients&rdquo;, NSF SBIR: &ldquo;Ultra-sensitive Detection of Lipoarabinomannan (LAM) and Interferon-Gamma (IFN-g) as Biomarker for Detection of Tuberculosis (TB)&rdquo;, and created multiple collaborations with Intellectual Venture and Global Good for TB detection with lipoarabinomannan (LAM) antibody and Sony Biosciences DADC, Salzburg, Austria for manufacturing.Based on the study in the project, the initial targeted market for the technology is $140 million/year fluorescence ELISA market with a goal to expand to take a part of a $225 million/year fluorescence immunoassay market. IFN-g detection with Interferon Gamma Release Assay (IGRA) for TB screening has a market of $500M according to Oxford Immunotec, which produces T-SPOT TB, one of the FDA-approved commercial IGRA. &nbsp;Our fluorescence platform technology will partly take the business space with ELISA and even PCR markets due to its sensitivity.The utility of the technology (Fig. 1) will be beneficial for many applications and broaden the scientific knowledge across different fields of biosensing and imaging. The platform technology has significant development potential as a POC diagnostic device. It is highly sensitive and selective, very cost-effective, portable, and reliable. Although the main focus of the technology during the project was for diagnostics of diseases, the technology will also be useful for high resolution cell and tissue imaging using conventional microscopes. The societal impacts are broad as a POC diagnostic device for infectious diseases such as tuberculosis, Ebola, malaria, and HIV in low resource settings. The project has served as non-traditional training for a postdoctoral fellow and students who gained experience in entrepreneurial leads. The postdoctoral fellow (Entrepreneurial Lead) interfaced with entrepreneurs, venture capitalists, and companies.
