This project was created in response to the NSF Inclusion across the Nation of Communities of Learners of Underrepresented Discoverers in Engineering and Science (NSF INCLUDES) program solicitation (NSF 16-544). The INCLUDES program is a comprehensive national initiative designed to enhance U.S. leadership in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) discoveries and innovations focused on NSF's commitment to diversity, inclusion, and broadening participation in these fields. The INCLUDES Design and Development Launch Pilots represent bold, innovative ways for solving a broadening participation challenge in STEM. \r\n\r\nThe full participation of all of America's STEM talent is critical to the advancement of science and engineering for national security, health and prosperity. Our nation is advancing knowledge and practices to address the undergraduate STEM achievement and the graduation gap between NAAIs and non-native Americans. This project, the NSF INCLUDES: Indigenous Women Working Within the Sciences (IWWS), has the potential to advance knowledge, instructional pedagogy and practices to improve the performance of NAAI high school students and undergraduate students in STEM. \r\n\r\nThis project team will work to: (1) pilot activities and coursework to train K-16 STEM educators about American Indian inclusive methods and materials, (2) to provide AIAN high school students with STEM college preparatory experience using inclusive STEM practices, and (3) to provide a cohort of female AIAN high school students additional university experiences and mentors as these students transition to postsecondary education. Activities include a five-day summer educators institute for 40 K-16 STEM educators, an additional weekend workshop for 20 K-16 STEM educators, a summer STEM academy for 96 AIAN high school students, a STEM weekend workshop for female AIAN high school students, and a mentoring program for AIAN high school students.",

The intellectual merit of IWWS was for transformation to STEM education at multiple levels. <strong>A) </strong>The IWWS project trained 40 K-20 STEM educators at the Reimagine STEM Educators Institute to incorporate American Indian Inclusive teaching materials and methods within STEM lessons in order to generate a ripple effect for future students receiving inclusive education. Educators earned two graduate credits in Native American Studies (NAS), specifically NAS 484 Native American Inclusion in the Classroom. The teachers created posters, tangible artifacts, each of which were presented to the public in summer 2017. In terms of broader impact, following the Reimagine STEM Educators Institute, the IWWS project team learned of K-12 teachers going back to their school districts to serve as trainers to their peers based on what they learned at the Reimagine STEM Educators Institute furthering the ripple effect started with the IWWS. <strong>B) </strong>The IWWS project worked with over 65 high school students over two summers at the Reimagine STEM Summer Youth Academy (2017 and 2018). Students from rural Native nations to urban youth from Detroit, Michigan resided on the NMU campus for one week, then were transported for a second week to the US Forest Services Camp Nesbit in the Ottawa National Forest for a second week. High school students earned four credits in a NAS college course. Multiple instructors provided hands-on learning opportunities merging STEM and NAS activities and lessons. A primary example is the completed construction of a wiigwaas jiimaan [birchbark canoe] currently on display at NMU. Students learned how to mix multiple tree saps to produce the glue-like substance to keep water from entering the canoe as well as engineering and math techniques necessary to lay out the structure of the canoe prior construction. Students learned how to use multiple tools in the NMU Art and Design woodshop to prep materials for construction. Students also gained valuable Anishinaabe cultural knowledge pertaining to the relationship between Anishinaabe peoples and their ancestral homelands as well as Anishinaabe language skills. Anishinaabe elders-in-residence played a role in the intellectual re-shaping of conversations. The two elders-in-residence, Mary and Leonard Moose, taught workshops ranging from Anishinaabe astrology, plant-usages, forest relationships, food sovereignty, and water teachings. Their presence contributed to the Anishinaabe cultural inclusion from community learning lens; a vital component in NAS. The elders-in-residence served as gentle guides for staff and knowledgeable Anishinaabe culture bearers for all. The Academy was distinctive in that Anishinaabe language was frequently spoken by Mary and Leonard Moose as well as four Academy instructors: Leon Valliere, Greg Johnson, Dr. Jud Sojourn, and Leora Lancaster. Having six adults speaking and teaching Anishinaabe language is a major achievement. The Anishinaabe language is endangered so language learning is vital for NAS. However, language analysis created opportunities for re-thinking relationships and reinforcing interconnectivity of all Earth?s beings. <strong>C) </strong>The IWWS project worked with 16 educators and 20 youth as part of the Reimagine STEM Fall Summit. Invited Educators from the Institute and Youth from the Academy came together to foster a mentor-mentee relationship. As part of this IWWS Fall Summit, the high school youth submitted college applications and essays. Participating educators received continuing education credit as part of the Fall summit. The mentorship between educator and student was the original intended outcome, but the IWWS found that mentorships between veteran K-12 educators and emerging K-12 educators happened organically. Demonstrated broader impacts include on-going conversations between educators on the Reimagine STEM Educators Facebook page. Resources that promote American Indian inclusion for multiple disciplines are shared regularly. The IWWS project team theorized that diversity of AI inclusive teaching methods and materials would lead to broader research questions and expansive research practices; when educators share such materials with each other nearly sixteen months following the Institute, this demonstrates a pattern of expansive research and teaching practices. This also allows for further conversation in merging the discipline of Native American Studies with the STEM disciplines. Additionally, the IWWS Lead PI, April Lindala, has been invited to assist with a proposed project with notable University of Michigan mathematician, Dr. Ron Eglash. This invite demonstrates on-going excitement to further develop ethno-mathematics and Native American studies learning opportunities for young people.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/20/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: April&nbsp;Lindala</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1649082/1649082_10460843_1545341204966_Academy_Product_Nesbit2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1649082/1649082_10460843_1545341204966_Academy_Product_Nesbit2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"NMU Hosts Reimagine STEM Academy June 2017 - 2nd Week at Camp Nesbit\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1649082/1649082_10460843_1545341204966_Academy_Product_Nesbit2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"NMU Hosts Reimagine STEM Academy June 2017 - 2nd Week at Camp Nesbit\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Northern Michigan University hosted the 1st ever Reimagine STEM Academy.
