 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Hubble Deep/Ultra Deep fields are iconic, and almost certainly the\r\nmost studied space telescope observations. Upcoming observations from an enormous range of\r\ncurrent and planned instruments, from the successor to Hubble, The James Webb Telescope, to\r\nthe Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST), to the WFIRST Satellite will also have the\r\nopportunity to reach galaxies and black holes at the same extreme magnitudes or deeper, but\r\nover unprecedentedly wide fields. This will open up the study of the highest redshift galaxies\r\nand quasars to the type of statistical studies that have made modern cosmology a precision\r\nscience. This project aims to compute theoretical predictions to make contact with current\r\nand upcoming observations of the high-redshift universe using the Blue Waters supercomputer. \r\n\r\nThe project will extend the BlueTides simulation, with an unprecedented\r\nvolume and resolution, to cover the evolution of the first billion years of cosmic history.\r\nThe goal is to significantly increase the scientific impact of this calculation to the community.\r\nImportantly, the project will attempt to make contact\r\nwith observations of quasars, which have not been discovered at redshift greater than 7 (while\r\nthe simulation now has run to redshift equal 8). In addition the project will be using BlueTides as\r\na path-finder for developing methods/calculations for future cosmological hydrodynamical simulations\r\nof galaxy formation with volumes and resolutions suitable for creating mocks for next generation\r\nsurveys. The impact of the proposed work will extend way beyond BlueTides. Large hydrodynamical simulations\r\nwill be more and more useful in all stages of major observational projects in astrophysics\r\nand cosmology. For example, a simulation that covers a significant fraction of the entire\r\nobservable universe with BlueTides resolution and runs to the present day (an epoch which\r\nis fully dominated by the hydrodynamic computations) will be needed for LSST.\r\n\r\nThe project will establish a theoretical framework for understanding the role of galaxies\r\nin the evolution of the universe at high redshifts. Different communities\r\nof scientists are interested in the behavior history of quasars and galaxy assembly, including\r\ncosmologists, the galaxy evolution community and high energy astrophysicists, so the results\r\nwould have a wide impact across many different scientific communities. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, the image and catalog generation, and\r\ndatabase techniques developed by the project will\r\nstrengthen the project already on-going synergistic activities with computer science, machine learning\r\nand statistics.  Furthermore, the project will have a strong education component by involving undergraduate\r\nand graduate students in this research.  Finally, the project propose to perform outreach using\r\nthe visualization and interactive Gigapan software.",
