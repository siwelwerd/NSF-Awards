 "awd_abstract_narration": "The importance of iron (Fe) as a limiting micronutrient in the ocean is a relatively new discovery. And while critical advances have been made in understanding the marine iron cycle, a full description remains elusive due to its biogeochemical complexity and the low concentrations of iron in the ocean. The research funded in this project seeks to advance our understanding of the chemical forms of Fe in seawater. This will be done by first refining a novel, selective electrochemical analytical method for looking at Fe at natural concentrations in seawater and then relating the resulting data to the genetic composition of the microbial communities responsible for creating the organic molecules that control the fate and chemical form of Fe in the ocean. We now know that iron is an incredibly important micronutrient to biological communities, and this new approach of linked genomic and analytical data has the potential to provide important insights that will significantly advance the study of iron composition in the ocean. This project will also support two graduate students at Scripps Institute of Oceanography, both participating in a new outreach program with 6th graders initiated by the Birch Aquarium at Scripps. \r\n\r\nThe importance of iron as a limiting micronutrient in the ocean has become a topic of avid research, and there have been many advances in the field. However, characterizations of iron speciation in seawater are still broad by nature due to the lack of precision in the electrochemical analytical techniques.  Competitive ligand exchange - adsorptive cathodic stripping voltammetry (CLE-ACSV) has been a commonly used technique to study iron speciation in seawater. This research seeks to improve this method by applying CLE-ACSV at multiple analytical windows (MAW) to increase resolution at the strong and weak ends of the iron-binding ligand spectrum. Additionally, by relating data from this technique to data on the metagenomic composition of the resident microbial community, the work should be able to make meaningful connections between the microbial communities that produce the organic ligands that we now know dominate iron speciation, solubility, and uptake in the ocean. This research has the potential to make a significant contribution to the current understanding of iron cycling in seawater, and it will help us to better understand the larger global ocean biogeochemical processes that control the distribution and availability of iron and its controls on global productivity.",

These have established iron starvation can induce compensatory responses including Fe saving metabolic changes and the induction of very specific Fe transport mechanisms. Despite the substantial advancements in our understanding of Fe biogeochemical cycling and the organismal response to Fe starvation, heterotrophic bacteria have been largely disregarded at both the molecular and global levels.&nbsp; Here we utilized the ubiquitous marine bacterium <em>Altermonas macleodii</em> for control laboratory studies examining the response to Fe limitation and the role of siderophore production on Fe acquisition. Controlled and replicated growth experiments with subsequent RNA-sequencing examined the organismal response to either carbon (C) or Fe limitation on a whole genome scale. An examination of the entire transcriptome response shows unique global responses to Fe and C-limitation, which is also reflected in the expression of the suite of TonB-dependent outer membrane receptors (TBDRs, Fig. 1).&nbsp; &nbsp;TBDRs are solely found in Prokaryotic organisms and facilitate the transport of large molecules, such as siderophore bound Fe and polysaccharides, across the outer membrane.&nbsp; While Fe starved, the transcriptome also suggests that <em>A. macleodii </em>also changes Fe requirements, with the induction of nickel containing superoxide dismutase and a Fe-free form of fumarase.&nbsp; A subsequent comparative genomic analysis shows that the Fe and C responsive TBDRs are conserved across nearly all <em>Altermonas </em>genomes sequenced to date (Fig. 2), which indicates that their expression may serve as transcriptional biomarkers for Fe or C limitation of <em>Altermonas </em>population in field studies.&nbsp; One major benefit of using <em>A. macleodii </em>as a model organism is the availability of genetic manipulations, which facilitate an explicit examination of gene function, rather than one just implied by annotation and gene expression.&nbsp; Utilizing targeted homologous recombination, we inactiviated one of the primary genes in a putative siderophore biosynthetic pathway found in the <em>A. macleodii</em> genome with a subsequent examination of the growth rate relative to the wild type on a variety of Fe sources.&nbsp; Not surprisingly, the siderophore was necessary for maximal growth for organically bound Fe (Fig. 3A).&nbsp; However, it was also apparent that the siderophore facilitated on growth of colloidal and particulate Fe that represent terrestrial or hydrothermal vent Fe inputs to the ocean (Fig. 3B).&nbsp; It was also shown that this gene cluster does synthesize a specific siderophore, petrobactin.&nbsp; This petrobactin biosynthetic cluster was shown to be globally distributed, according to a comparative analysis of marine metagenomes (Fig. 4).&nbsp; Based on synthesis of these results, we are starting to paint a broad conceptual pictute of the role of some <em>Altermonas</em> in global Fe cycling (Fig. 5).&nbsp; Namely, the organism responds differently to Fe and C starvation, which should allow for us to examine natural populations and assess their nutritional state.&nbsp; However, when Fe starved, <em>A. macleodii </em>will produce petrobactin, which not only facilitates the acquisition of Fe for itself, also liberates Fe from lithogenic particles for the greater microbial community.&nbsp; Potentially this represents a large scale symbiotic system.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This work formed the primary dissertation for one PhD student as well as secondary chapters for another PhD student.&nbsp;
