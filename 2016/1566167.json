 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project funded by the Chemical Catalysis program of the NSF Chemistry Division, Professor Travis Williams of the University of Southern California's Loker Hydrocarbon Research Institute is studying hydrogenation and dehydrogenation catalysis that is directed toward new approaches for carbon dioxide utilization, hydrogen storage, and fine chemical production. Catalysts are species that facilitate chemical reactions and are utilized throughout the chemical industry. This project develops catalysts for several important processes. These include a catalyst for the removal of hydrogen from formic acid, which may allow formic acid to be used as a hydrogen carrier, another to remove hydrogen from glycerol, which may allow the formation of valuable products from waste materials of biodiesel refining, and a third to convert carbon dioxide to methanol, an important industrial starting material. This project includes a K-12 outreach program that brings local high school students into the research laboratory.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe project has three target areas. First, a diiridium catalyst supported by a chelating phosphorus (P)-nitrogen (N) ligand is being developed for formic acid dehydration. In related work, a series of iridium and ruthenium complexes containing bidentate, pyridine containing ligands are being developed as catalysts for the conversion of glycerol to lactic acid. Finally, ruthenium complexes containing a borate ligand are being designed for carbon dioxide reduction. The mechanisms of these processes are being determined by chemical, kinetic, and spectroscopic studies in order to optimize the catalytic processes.  The selected target reaction have the potential to be licensed commercially or adapted by others for industrial use.  The student-hosted colloquia program exposes graduate, undergraduate, and postdoctoral students to a variety of career possibilities.",
