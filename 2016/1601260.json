 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will analyze spatial patterns of genetic diversity in a novel mimicry system from South America to investigate whether the processes driving resemblance in mimicry systems can also promote diversity within species. Mimicry systems, where multiple species evolve mutual resemblance to reduce predation, are excellent natural laboratories to study the processes generating biodiversity. Species in mimetic systems often exhibit diverse geographic morphologies, which raises questions about how this diversity originated and is maintained. Addressing this question will quantify the role of natural selection in promoting and maintaining genetic differentiation among populations. Additionally, this research will provide a basis for using morphological traits to predict levels of genetic structure. The later will be especially useful for conservation purposes, particularly in groups or systems in which genetic data might not be available.\r\n\r\nThese goals will be addressed by conducting a fine scale landscape genetic study on mimetic beetles from the genus Ceroglossus using next generation sequencing data. Samples will be collected across areas with different geographic morphs and levels of phenotypic matching, and from two or three different species. Correlation tests between color differences and genetic differentiation will inform whether selection for mimicry can impact levels of genetic structure, whereas model-based demographic inferences will provide statistical rigor to distinguish between specific mechanisms driving such patterns. This project will encourage collaborative work with Chilean researchers and students on the study of a new and fascinating model system.",

Focusing on the remarkable similarity of the species involved in M&uuml;llerian mimicry, researchers have suggested mechanisms to explain how such diversity can be generated in these systems and its role in contributing to the formation of new species. Recently, new research has shown the need for studying systems where mimicry is imperfect to better understand the processes driving mimicry and its potential consequences as generators of biodiversity. Our study contributes to the field by introducing an enigmatic new system to study mimicry - the beetle genus <em>Ceroglossus </em>from the temperate forests of southern South America. Despite an overall resemblance among species, these beetles show a surprising mismatch of color in several local areas. As such, this system provides opportunities to study a variety of new (ecological and evolutionary) questions regarding mechanisms that prevent the evolution of phenotypic convergence, and when these differently colored beetles are studied in the context of their history of divergence across the Chilean landscape, it challenges some prevailing hypotheses about mimicries role in the formation of new species.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>By studying this beetle system through the lens of a highly resolved history of species divergence reconstructed using genomic data, we show that the matching of color and shape among species are most likely changes that accumulate after the geographic isolation of species, rather than being the cause of the formation of new lineages. This result challenges co-divergence scenarios that posit that mimicry structures local communities, which results in the accumulation of evolutionary differences over time, and the origin of new species. As such, this work highlights how the same pattern &ndash; color matching of different species &ndash; may arise by mechanisms with very different evolutionary interpretations. That is, mimics may drive the species differences that result in the formation of new species, or mimics may be consequence of species differences that arose in some other context.</p>\n<p>This work helped contribute to the training of graduate and undergraduate students in biodiversity research. Products of the work include professional publications, presentations at conferences, and contributions of scientific specimens and DNA to the insect museum collection. The project also increased our understanding and awareness of these beautiful beetles. &nbsp;</p>\n<!--  /* Font Definitions */  @font-face \t{font-family:\"Cambria Math\"; \tpanose-1:2 4 5 3 5 4 6 3 2 4; \tmso-font-charset:0; \tmso-generic-font-family:roman; \tmso-font-pitch:variable; \tmso-font-signature:-536870145 1107305727 0 0 415 0;} @font-face \t{font-family:Calibri; \tpanose-1:2 15 5 2 2 2 4 3 2 4; \tmso-font-charset:0; \tmso-generic-font-family:swiss; \tmso-font-pitch:variable; \tmso-font-signature:-536859905 -1073697537 9 0 511 0;}  /* Style Definitions */  p.MsoNormal, li.MsoNormal, div.MsoNormal \t{mso-style-unhide:no; \tmso-style-qformat:yes; \tmso-style-parent:\"\"; \tmargin:0in; \tmargin-bottom:.0001pt; \tmso-pagination:widow-orphan; \tfont-size:12.0pt; \tfont-family:\"Calibri\",sans-serif; \tmso-ascii-font-family:Calibri; \tmso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; \tmso-fareast-font-family:Calibri; \tmso-fareast-theme-font:minor-latin; \tmso-hansi-font-family:Calibri; \tmso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin; \tmso-bidi-font-family:\"Times New Roman\"; \tmso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;} p \t{mso-style-priority:99; \tmso-margin-top-alt:auto; \tmargin-right:0in; \tmso-margin-bottom-alt:auto; \tmargin-left:0in; \tmso-pagination:widow-orphan; \tfont-size:12.0pt; \tfont-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif; \tmso-fareast-font-family:\"Times New Roman\";} .MsoChpDefault \t{mso-style-type:export-only; \tmso-default-props:yes; \tfont-family:\"Calibri\",sans-serif; \tmso-ascii-font-family:Calibri; \tmso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; \tmso-fareast-font-family:Calibri; \tmso-fareast-theme-font:minor-latin; \tmso-hansi-font-family:Calibri; \tmso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin; \tmso-bidi-font-family:\"Times New Roman\"; \tmso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;} @page WordSection1 \t{size:8.5in 11.0in; \tmargin:1.0in 1.0in 1.0in 1.0in; \tmso-header-margin:.5in; \tmso-footer-margin:.5in; \tmso-paper-source:0;} div.WordSection1 \t{page:WordSection1;} -->\n<p><em><em> </em></em></p>\n<p><em><em><br /></em></em></p>\n<p><em><em> </em></em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 11/25/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: L.
