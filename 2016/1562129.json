 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project addresses the need for enhanced modeling and simulation of flexible multibody dynamics (FMD) that can accurately capture friction-induced behavior, including stick-slip motion and Schallamach detachment waves. Such system-level frictionally excited vibrations can greatly degrade efficiency and lifetime, and may be especially significant where compliant materials are in frictional contact with relatively rigid bodies, as in soft robots, engineered biological systems, and other emerging engineering areas. In addition to modeling and simulation, this research will apply the enhanced FMD formulations -- together with complementary experiments -- to study biomimetic surface patterning for influencing and controlling undesired frictionally induced behavior. The FMD simulation tools arising from this project will reduce the need for expensive and time-consuming design prototypes in important US industries, including automotive, manufacturing equipment, and robotics. The project includes outreach activities to increase participation of underrepresented groups in engineering through K-12 internship and training opportunities in the investigators' labs.\r\n\r\nThe primary research objective is to explore the applicability and enhancement of flexible multi-body dynamics simulation tools for analyzing Schallamach waves, and related stick-slip contact dynamics. Resolving such frictional behavior will be accomplished using new and efficient contact formulations, together with efficient implementations and solution procedures. Detailed experiments will test the multi-body dynamics predictions and suggest directions for further refinements. In later stages of the research, both computation and experiments will be exercised to demonstrate new capabilities for exploring design changes, such as various micro- and macro-scale patterns, that can regularize sliding and limit detrimental stick-slip and vibration behavior. Successful completion of the research effort will greatly increase our ability to design and tailor multi-body systems incorporating soft elements while significantly extending the reach of flexible multi-body dynamics simulation to new and important research areas.",
