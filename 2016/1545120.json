The SES technical meeting is held annually and provides a forum for the discussion and dissemination of recent advances in research and education in topics from all areas of engineering science. The meeting emphasizes topics on the science and mechanics of solid and fluid media in a setting that is mostly devoted to fundamental research and education. The organizers anticipate participation of researchers presenting more than 500 papers, organized in 32 symposia. Each symposium is organized by leaders in their respective fields and consists primarily of invited participants. \r\n\r\nThe SES meeting builds on a tradition of emphasis on interdisciplinary research at the boundaries of science and engineering. This award will facilitate the participation of students competing in a poster competition. Through this award, a diverse group of graduate students will have the opportunity to present their research and interact with their peers and with recognized authorities in their field of choice.",
