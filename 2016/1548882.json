 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is that it offers the potential for a new process technology to produce silicon using a sustainable, natural resource as the starting material. Currently, all silicon used in solar cells and computer chips, and all silicon used in the manufacture of silicon containing chemicals including silicone rubbers, oils, lubricants and fumed silica (paints, paper) etc. is produced in an energy, equipment and CO2-intensive process. Biogenic silica includes diatomaceous earth and many kinds of agricultural waste including rice hull ash, inorganic waste from bioethanol production, corn stover, and wheat chaff. The objectives of this project are to develop economical routes from these silica sources to high purity, high value silica products at significantly lower cost than currently available by using a green and sustainable technology. Key markets include electronic, optical, and photonic applications, specialty chemicals, and consumer products. \r\n\r\nThe technical objectives of this Phase I project are to successfully depolymerize biogenic silicas at temperatures \u00a1\u00dc 200\u00a1\u00e3C to produce distillable alkoxysilanes. The primary silica source is rice hull ash (RHA), a sustainable, heavy metal free, silica rich agricultural waste. This process uses catalytic base to dissolved RHA silica in antifreeze at \u00a1\u00d6 200\u00a1\u00e3C followed by exchange with alcohol to produce alkoxysilanes. In contrast, traditional alkoxysilanes are made from silicon metal produced by carbothermal reduction of silica with carbon at 1900 \u00a1\u00e3C in an electric arc furnace; a high energy, capital equipment and CO2 intensive process. A further advantage to this process is that the silica depleted RHA offers direct access to high purity (99.9999 %) photovoltaic grade silicon at multi-kg/day scales. If successful, the proposed project could change how high purity alkoxysilanes, precipitated silica, and fumed silica are produced as multiple RHA sources are available worldwide. The alkoxysilane products can be distilled to very high purity at very low cost compared to the same product made from Silicon metal. The initial goal is to produce tetraethoxysilane to compete against Silicon metal derived product and move thereafter to high purity precipitated silica for electronic and optical products applications.",

An additional important objective was to optimize the manufacturing process to identify process/cost constraints at this level to reach the estimated price goals for our patented green technology. A longer term, higher impact objective is to completely change the way many silicon containing chemicals and materials are made.<strong> </strong>The Mayasil Process eliminates the need to produce Si as an intermediate step offering enormous cost reductions in terms of energy and capital equipment costs by comparison with traditional synthesis methods. It could save roughly 6 tons of CO<sub>2</sub>/ton TEOS if scaled properly. In addition, all unused reagents and solvents (ethylene glycol and ethanol) can be recycled, anticipated &gt; 95 %. Most recently, we determined that GS alone offers exceptional potential as a replacement for polyols in rigid polyurethane foams (PURs), especially because it is inherently a fire retardant. The low-cost GS, which is the first product generated from the Mayasil Process, can replace more expensive and petroleum-based polyols in production of PURs. Developing a market for GS is the focus of our current commercialization efforts, given that we have proven the ability to produce 100<sup>+</sup> Kg batches of GS. GS also provides low energy access to precipitated silicas (ppt SiO<sub>2</sub>) and silica gel desiccants. In addition, the process provides access to TEOS, widely used in coatings, casting, abrasives, insulators, and planarization of silicon wafers used in semiconductor fabrication. The latter application relies on TEOS derived, very high purity ppt SiO<sub>2</sub>.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p class=\"Pa4\">The key outcomes of our Phase I studies are:</p>\n<p class=\"Pa4\">1. Understanding that the Mayasil Process works equally well using different biogenic sources of silica. We have tested several different sources of RHA and other biomass ash containing 70-90 wt. % silica.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"Default\">2. The Mayasil Process has been successfully scaled at a pre-pilot scale (in a 300-gallon-reactor at Oil Chem, Inc.), and we have learned that further optimization of the reaction process is required at larger scales. We anticipate that the next batch runs at our toll manufacturer will significantly improve the dissolution silica rate (expected 35 wt. %).&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"Default\">3. By sampling GS to an independent research group, we have found a willing, expert partner to help us prove the commercial potential of GS in the production of rigid polyurethane foams. We anticipate that further study will lead to more polyurethane applications for GS as a green, low-cost polyol.</p>\n<p class=\"Default\">4. We have attracted interest by potential strategic investors (Dow and Evonik), who are major players in all silica and silicon markets. Dow is also a major producer of polyols for the polyurethane market. After completing our Phase I project, we learned that Dow will establish an in-house team to validate the manufacturing processes at scale, market potential, and financial viability of the Mayasil Process.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 03/03/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Vera&nbsp;Popova</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1548882/1548882_10404455_1488574445138_OilChem--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1548882/1548882_10404455_1488574445138_OilChem--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Oil Chem 300 gal reactor\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1548882/1548882_10404455_1488574445138_OilChem--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Oil Chem 300 gal reactor\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Oil Chem 300 gal reactor</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Oil Chem</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Vera&nbsp;Popova</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Oil Chem 300 gal reactor</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1548882/1548882_10404455_1488574556329_WadhamEnergy--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1548882/1548882_10404455_1488574556329_WadhamEnergy--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Wadham Energy Rice Hull Storage\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1548882/1548882_10404455_1488574556329_WadhamEnergy--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Wadham Energy Rice Hull Storage\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Wadham Energy Rice Hull Storage</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Wadham Energy LP</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Vera&nbsp;Popova</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Wadham Energy Rice Hull Storage</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
