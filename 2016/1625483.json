 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation Program (MRI) and support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program (CRIF), Professor Brant Kedrowski from the University of Wisconsin Oshkosh and colleagues William Wacholtz and Sheri Lense have acquired a 400 MHz NMR spectrometer. This spectrometer allows research in a variety of fields such as those that accelerate chemical reactions of significant economic importance, as well as to study of biologically relevant species. In general, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution or in the solid state. The results from these NMR studies have an impact in synthetic organic/inorganic chemistry, materials chemistry and biochemistry. This instrument is an integral part of teaching as well as research performed by undergraduate students via independent student research and traditional academic coursework as well as researchers from the University of Wisconsin at Green Bay.\r\n\r\nThe award is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels, especially in areas such as (a) developing synthetic methodologies and applications for non-natural sterically congested amino acids; (b) synthesizing and characterizing organometallic charge transfer complexes with applications for solar energy or optically active molecular switches; (c) synthesizing and studying organometallic catalysts for carbon dioxide reduction; (d) synthesizing a potent electron transport chain inhibiting molecule stigmatellin and its analogues; (e) developing materials for organic solar cell applications; (f) developing inexpensive photovoltaics for energy harvesting; (g) analyzing natural carotenoid pigments isolated from local bacteria; and (h) synthesizing and characterizing a phosphatase inhibitor analogue.",
