 "awd_abstract_narration": "In order to explain the diversity and species composition of local ecosystems it is necessary to account for species distributions across larger areas. Processes occurring over broad spatial and temporal scales, such as geographic isolation and species evolution, drive these regional patterns and determine the regional species pool, or group of species that could potentially occupy a location. This project will use experiments to determine whether local communities or species from large regional areas explain the number and kinds of fungi associated with plants and their roots. Because these fungi are ubiquitous, they are globally important drivers of nutrient cycling and ecosystem productivity.  The scientific workforce will be strengthened through support for the education and training of a doctoral student and participation of undergraduates from underrepresented groups.  The project will contribute to improved horticulture and conservation.\r\n\r\nThe regional species pool will affect local community assembly in multiple ways.  This problem will be addressed for fungal symbionts associated with the roots of an endemic Hawaiian plant, Vaccinium calycinum. Using plant-fungal microcosms, experimental symbiont species pools will be introduced to sterile seedlings, varying the number of fungal species along with the mean age and environmental heterogeneity of the sites from which the symbionts were initially isolated. High-throughput molecular methods will be used in combination with physical measurements and analytical chemistry to assess the realized local symbiont community composition within roots. Three hypotheses will be tested: (1) older or more environmentally heterogeneous regions will result in greater functional diversity in the regional species pool; (2) species pools from older or more environmentally heterogeneous regions will result in greater realized local diversity relative to the size of the regional species pool; (3) the richness and functional diversity of the regional species pool will be the primary driver of symbiotic function, measured as the host plant's biomass and nutrient accumulation. The geologic age and environmental heterogeneity of a region will be linked to local community assembly and function via the composition of the regional species pool.",
