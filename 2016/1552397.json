 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this CAREER project funded by the Chemical Catalysis Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Vlad M. Iluc of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Notre Dame is developing new tools for the selective reaction of hydrogen atoms bonded to common elements such as carbon, oxygen, boron, nitrogen and silicon. In this project, new approaches that involve metal-ligand cooperation are being developed to facilitate chemical transformations under mild conditions. This work is expected to have environmental and societal impact by providing basic knowledge that allows the development of catalytic processes involving water, alcohol, and amines, which are readily available chemical feedstocks. As the educational component of his project, Professor Iluc is developing an outreach program that focuses on mentoring of students from socio-economic groups that are underrepresented in science. The educational program provides educational opportunities for youth at the Bashor Children's Home and promotes their recruitment into science, technology, engineering and mathematics-based careers.\r\n\r\nThe project targets (1) hydrogen transfer from the ligand to the metal and vice versa, which involves a nucleophilic carbene as part of a diphosphine pincer ligand; (2) hemilabile ligands, which incorporate olefins in a pincer architecture, in order to synthesize new untethered carbene nickel and palladium complexes; and (3) transfer of radical character from the supporting ligand to a coordinated substrate. The first class of complexes features nucleophilic carbene palladium complexes that are applied to the hydration, hydroalkoxylation, and hydroamination of olefins and other unsaturated substrates. The second class focuses on nickel and palladium and is applied to carbon (C)- silicon (Si) and C- boron (B) bond forming reactions. Finally, the third class features radical carbene palladium complexes that are applied to C-hydrogen (H) amination reactions with azides and olefin copolymerization reactions. Molecular models based on density functional theory guide these experiments. The educational project includes collaboration with the Bashor Children's Home, in Goshen, Indiana, a non-profit agency that provides help for at-risk children. In addition, the CAREER Award supports summer research activities at the University of Notre Dame. Visiting high school students work closely with graduate and undergraduate chemistry students in science activities related to research in the Iluc group.",
