 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-Technical Description\r\nThis Research Infrastructure Improvement Track-2 Focused EPSCoR Collaboration (RII Track-2 FEC) proposal is a collaboration between three institutions in Delaware, Nevada, and Nebraska, namely the University of  Delaware, the University of Nevada, Reno, and the University of Nebraska, Lincoln. The project will focus on better understanding the complex relationship between existing knowledge and information obtained through sensory perception, a central question in cognitive neuroscience. To help coordinate the research and provide training for participants, the project will set up three distributed ?methods cores?. Members of each methods core will be available for day-to-day consultations on their respective methodologies, and also conduct training workshops to achieve transfer of expertise across institutions and thus develop human infrastructure in each jurisdiction. These cores will provide support and establish standards in the implementation, analysis, and interpretation of all experiments. Another goal of the project is to promote the entry of undergraduates into graduate programs in neuroscience. To this end, the project will host summer ?brain camps? in cognitive neuroscience. Special efforts will be made to attract undergraduate and graduate students from groups traditionally under-represented in neuroscience by providing full financial support to such students and recruiting at a variety of appropriate venues.\r\n\r\nTechnical Description\r\nThe research efforts will address the interplay between knowledge and perception in a complementary manner. The first research module will investigate the formation of new knowledge via Statistical Learning, the learning of associations among sensory stimuli that tend to co-occur in temporal or spatial patterns. The second module will investigate the interactions between spatial representations of perceived objects, prior knowledge of object use, and body position, as well as the effects of these inputs into perception. The third module will examine the impact of knowledge on attention and working memory. Orthogonal to the organization of the research modules, the project will set up three ?methods cores?, focused on Neuroimaging, Neuropsychology, and Neurostimulation, that will provide support, training, and advice to members of all research modules:. The cores will host three week-long, intensive summer workshops, open to faculty and trainees from all three sites. The resources of the methods cores will also be available to new faculty at each institution, as part of planned recruitment of neuroscience faculty.",

We examined this question in three domains: 1) the impact of visual/multimodal statistical learning to determine how learning statistical contingencies leads to new knowledge and alters subsequent perception; 2) how stored information from the body and real object knowledge influences perception and 3) the role of knowledge in attention and working memory and how familiarity and knowledge alter selective attention, perception, and memory representations. Furthermore, our goal was also to develop human infrastructure by way of graduate training and outreach, and to develop sustainable collaborative infrastructure across the three institutions.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Intellectual Merit:</strong>&nbsp;The award allowed for the completion of several important studies. In the domain of&nbsp;<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">visual statistical learning</span>&nbsp;(VSL), we found novel evidence that categorical knowledge and similarity impact visual statistical learning, such that similar and same-category combinations are most often the better learned ones. We found other evidence that VSL is impacted by extraneous task elements, for example, behavioral and neural evidence suggested that reward events impact statistical learning. Evidence for impaired VSL under general memory impairment due to brain damage was found, though effects were heterogeneous and under some conditions VSL could be improved by increasing task demands.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With regards to&nbsp;<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">action and the body</span>, we found novel evidence that stored information from body representations influences multisensory integration and where we perceive touch. We have also revealed how human behavior and brain function unfold as people look at, and interact with, real-world objects around them, finding that real objects are processed differently compared to 2-D or 3-D images. These findings were supported by evidence from brain-damaged individuals, visual psychophysics, electroencephalography, transcranial magnetic stimulation, and functional magnetic resonance imaging studies.</p>\n<p>For&nbsp;<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">visual working memory</span>&nbsp;(VWM) and attention, we discovered new findings that showed when multiple items are held in VWM, only one of them seems to strongly guide attention, suggesting that some items are held in a passive state and only one is held in an active state that can affect attention. We also found neural correlates of distraction by items in VWM using a novel paradigm. In another study, we found that neural representations of items held in VWM ?drift? over time. The drift could be estimated from the neural signal and related to test behavior using a novel technique. We also found evidence that ?refreshing? and ?removal? in VWM may be related processes. We developed new methods to apply deep learning to better understand neural VWM signals.</p>\n<p>Our main scientific goal was to improve the production of high-quality, interdisciplinary research at the three participating institutions. We exceeded our goals over the course of the project, with over&nbsp;115 peer-reviewed publications, 278 presentations and posters, and 4 theses/dissertations to communicate the results of the work to the broader community. A second goal was to improve both research and collaborative infrastructure for our three institutions. This was achieved via the purchase and usage of multiple transcranial magnetic stimulation systems, yearly Core Outreach Workshops where we gathered to learn from experts in brain stimulation, neuroimaging, and neuropsychology, and the interjurisdictional mentorship of several graduate trainees.</p>\n<p><strong>Broader Impacts:</strong>&nbsp;Our major outreach initiative for our Track-2 EPSCoR grant was the ?Summer Undergraduate Workshop in Cognitive and Brain Sciences?, held at the University of Delaware. The workshop was a two-week intensive program consisting of 20 ?modules? on methodologies, theory, and current issues in cognitive and brain sciences. Teaching included lectures, group discussions, and hands-on labs (including neuroimaging). The summer workshop, attended by 20 students/year from EPSCoR jurisdictions, also included sessions to encourage careers in science, see <a href=\"https://www.udel.edu/udaily/2017/september/brain-science-interns/?utm_source=UDaily+Subscribers&amp;utm_campaign=c0b503bd21-UDaily_News_Email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_0b5034716d-c0b503bd21-177517277\">here</a>&nbsp;or a report.
