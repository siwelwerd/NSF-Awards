 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nanoscale metal foams exhibit several remarkable properties. The most common nanostructured foams are currently made of pure metals, and they demonstrate exceptional performance in areas such as catalysis, batteries, and optics. These metal foams are, however, often fragile and difficult to integrate into engineering applications. The ability to mechanically strengthen foams to create robust materials has heretofore been limited in pure metals. This award supports research aimed at creating a new class of materials - composite nano foams - which display the same remarkable properties as pure metal foams, but with significantly enhanced structural integrity. The new materials designed through this work will allow researchers and engineers to exploit unique properties without suffering failure during mechanical handling or service. The fundamental knowledge gained from this research may be used in designing and manufacturing catalysts with low cost and high strength, fuel cells with higher capacity and faster charging times, biomedical implants with high fatigue resistance, and lighter and stronger hydrogen storage units. A team of researchers at two universities, Clarkson and Purdue, will carry out this work, exposing students at both schools to the increasingly common long-distance collaborations needed for advancing research. \r\n\r\nThe research team will couple computational methods of materials engineering at the atomistic and mesoscopic scales (molecular dynamics and finite element analysis) to experimental methods of manufacturing and characterizing composite nanostructured foams. The working hypothesis is that coating individual foam ligaments with nanostructure multilayers will result in the formation of stronger foams. To create these materials, copper and nickel will be electroplated to form core-shell layers on templates of paper-like mats of eletrospun polymers, which will be oxidized and then subsequently reduced to form nanoscale copper metal wires. Pulsed-laser thermoelastic excitation will be used to determine the dispersion and vibrational resonance to obtain the foam's bulk elastic properties. These results will be compared directly to finite element simulations of the composite to isolate the effects of geometry and ligament properties. Foam strength will be predicted based on molecular dynamics simulations of the ligaments, which will provide information to feed into the finite element models, and finally compared to experimental studies of the yield strength using nanoindentation with a flat punch geometry. The intellectual significance of this work will be the development of a new class of materials guided by computational materials engineering, and the development of novel techniques for manufacturing and testing nanoscale metallic foams.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project set out to determine if it was possible to strengthen metallic nanofoams using techniques that are common in bulk materials.  Materials with nanostructures often exhibit exceptional properties.  We aimed to identify if multiple conventional bulk strengthening mechanisms would impact nanofoam strength, and to develop modeling capabilities that captured the overall deformation of these structures.  \n\n \n\nDuring 2018-1019 we experimentally examined solid solution strengthening and second phase particle strengthening.  We built off prior results examining the Cu-Ni system and created Cu-Zn foams.  Cu-Zn (in bulk) is brass; it has higher solid solution strengthening than Cu-Ni, and can be used to investigate both strengthening mechanisms.  Using our polymer templating method, where we electrospin a polymer, perform calcination to form an oxide foam, and then a reduction step to form a metal, we can create oxide particles by controlling processing in the 2nd and 3rd steps. \n\n \n\nWe successfully created brass foams, shown figure 1.  We believe this is the first demonstration of the polymer templating method that has successfully created foams of multiple alloy systems, and should open the door to investigate a much broader range of metallic systems with a ligament dimension on the order of 10s-100s of nm?s.  \n\n \n\nOver the life of this project we were able to control of the final density of foams made via the polymer templating method by controlling the viscosity of the precursor solution and the concentration of the metallic salt in the polymer precursor.  Figure 2 demonstrates the case of pure Cu showing the increase in relative density, ligament size and pore size with increasing viscosity of the polymer solution.  This was carried out for three chemistries (Cu, Cu-Ni, and Cu-Zn) to isolatie the effects of the variables of density, ligament size, and composition/structure across the composition space.  \n\n \n\nThe mechanical response of these materials was examined using flat punch nanoindentation.  As shown in figure 3, there is a very wide range of responses in the hardness (i.e. same load, higher load = higher hardness for a fixed punch area); the variation in load-depth curves tends to be related to the density of the solid, as foams with relative densities on the order of 2% dense have more variation than those with 25% density.  A statistical analysis of structure variables was carried out and the most critical factor in determining hardness was the relative density of the solid.  Therefore, to isolate chemistry and impurity effects, solids with similar densities were compared for Cu, Cu-Ni, and Cu-Zn.   As shown in figure 4, the hardness of similar (&asymp;3% dense) foams that are solid solution strengthened are not significantly different between pure Cu and the solute effect is minimal.  However, in the case of 25% Zn, the Cu structure contained ZnO particles and solid solution Zn impurities, and in this case the hardness was significantly higher than any other case.  \n\n \n\nOur collaborators at Clarkson University carried out multi-scale predictions of the yield behavior in compression of low density foams.
