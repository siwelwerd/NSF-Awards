Quantum Chromo-Dynamics (QCS), the theory describing the forces acting within atomic nuclei, predicts that at sufficiently high temperatures and/or densities, matter should undergo a transition from the standard hadronic phase to a plasma of deconfined quarks and gluons (Quark Gluon Plasma, QGP). According to our cosmological models, this transition took place in the early universe at about 10 microseconds after the Big Bang. The scientific scope of this field has broadened significantly with new measurements and theoretical developments. The discussions in this workshop will include an interdisciplinary combination of concepts from elementary-particle physics, nuclear physics, QCD thermodynamics, hydrodynamics, and non-equilibrium transport theory. Attendance at the workshop will enhance the scientific communication among the junior members, particularly graduate students, postdocs and junior faculty, both from experiment and theory.",
