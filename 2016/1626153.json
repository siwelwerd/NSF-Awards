The NNCI Coordinating Office at Georgia Tech is established to enhance the impact of NNCI as a national infrastructure network by promoting its capabilities, facilitating user access to its resources, sharing best practices, and improving overall efficiency through coordination of activities of the individual sites. The Coordinating Office will assist users from academe, industry, and government in finding NNCI fabrication and characterization resources to meet their research needs through an interactive NNCI web portal. It will use the expertise of site staff to facilitate programs in education and outreach, social and ethical implications, and computational modeling and simulation across the network, and help provide linkages with other national and international nanotechnology resources. The overall activities of the NNCI Coordinating Office will contribute to the economic competiveness of the U.S. in training a globally competitive workforce and in providing efficient access to resources for innovation and commercialization of nanotechnology. They will also help to inform and educate the general public on fundamentals and advances of nanoscience and engineering and their social and ethical implications.\r\n\r\nThe mission of the NNCI Coordinating Office is to support the individual NNCI sites, site users, and broader public interests using the combined assets of a nation-wide network of university nanotechnology user facilities. A key component of the Coordinating Office will be the development of mechanisms for communicating availability of network assets to users of the facilities as well as for fostering interactions among the sites. A primary mode for this communication will be an interactive NNCI web portal, which will allow new and existing users to efficiently locate capabilities and expertise within the network, and also provide up-to-date nanotechnology resources to the K-20 communities and broader public. To emphasize the importance of a network of sites, the Coordinating Office will be guided by an Executive Committee with representation from all 16 sites and will organize a number of working groups and committees to address topics of broad interest and solve common problems. A flagship event for the NNCI network will be an annual NNCI Conference that will highlight the research supported by the individual sites, as well as provide a venue for site staff to share best practices and research trends with the broader nanotechnology community. An External Advisory Board with members selected from the external advisory boards of all sites will provide input on network management issues and future directions. Education and outreach activities will be coordinated across the network to share and disseminate best practices and resources for impactful programs at the local, regional, and national levels. Social and ethical implications programs, such as an annual retreat and conference forums, will enable social scientists to interact with nanoscale scientists, engineers, and students so that all groups can consider the potential impacts new discoveries might have on society. Computational modeling and simulation needs of the user community will be supported through an inventory of available resources and close collaboration with the existing Network for Computational Nanotechnology (NCN). Assessment of the strength of the sites and the network as a whole will be determined through metrics developed in collaboration with the sites and will be based on site usage, site productivity and technical impact, contributions to the network, and education and outreach activity.",

The NNCI sites are located in 17 states and involve 29 universities and other partner organizations (see Figure 1). The goals of the NNCI network are (1) to provide open access to state-of-the-art nano-fabrication &amp; characterization facilities, their tools and staff expertise across US, and (2) to use these resources to support education &amp; outreach (E&amp;O) as well as societal &amp; ethical implications (SEI) programs in/of nanotechnology. Research undertaken within NNCI facilities is broad, with applications in electronics, materials, biomedicine, energy, geosciences, environmental sciences, consumer products, and many more.</p>\n<p>The NNCI Coordinating Office at Georgia Tech coordinates activities among the network sites, facilitates sharing of best practices and development of new initiatives, promotes the network and its activities, and collects annual usage data as well as data summarizing the impact of the NNCI. The Coordinating Office is guided by an Executive Committee, which includes the 16 NNCI site directors and other site leadership and is advised by an External Advisory Board comprised of members representing industry, academia, government, education and outreach, SEI, computation and non-traditional disciplines in nanoscience and nanoengineering.</p>\n<p><strong>Intellectual Merit:</strong>&nbsp;Over the first 5 years of the NNCI, the 16 sites and their 13 partners provided access to more than 2,200 tools located in 69 distinct facilities. These resources have been used by an&nbsp;<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">annual average</span>&nbsp;of more than 12,000 users including more than 3,000 external users, representing 200+ US academic institutions, nearly 800 small and large companies, 40+ government and non-profit institutions, as well as 50+ foreign entities. Cumulative over the first five years of NNCI, these users have amassed nearly 5 million tool hours (25% from external users), and the network has welcomed almost 22,000 new users. Over the first five years of NNCI, external academic users came from nearly 370 distinct US institutions located in 49 US States and Puerto Rico (see Figure 2). These institutions include 131 of the 146 (90%) Carnegie Classification R1 (Very High Research Activity) institutions and 65 of the 133 (49%) R2 (High Research Activity) institutions. 76 (21%) of the US external academic institutions using NNCI facilities serve under-represented populations, including 38 Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSI), 26 Asian-American and Native American Pacific Islander institutions (AANAPI), 16 Historical Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU), 3 Tribal Colleges and Universities (TCU), 2 Predominantly Black Institutions (PBI) and 1 Native Hawaiian-Serving<em>&nbsp;</em>Institution (ANNH). Research enabled by NNCI facilities has resulted in more than 20,000 journal publications and conference presentations and more than 2,700 patents, patent applications and invention disclosures.</p>\n<p><strong>Broader Impact:</strong>&nbsp;Education and outreach programs, as well as programs on societal and ethical implications of nanotechnology, complement the activities. Over the first five years of the NNCI, the education and outreach programs reached more than 270,500 people. These in-person and virtual interactions included classroom visits, teacher workshops, remote tool sessions, short courses, seminars, symposia, community events, conference exhibits, facility tours, internships, and summer undergraduate and teacher research experiences. Each year, more than 60 summer students from across the network participate in an annual convocation. One of the foundational SEI programs within the NNCI is the annual Winter School that has trained 59 early career social scientists from 40 universities in the latest techniques for engaging with and analyzing emerging technologies and emerging scientific communities. The second flagship program of the NNCI SEI is the Science Outside the Lab workshop. This program has provided an in-depth training experience for 56 graduate student scientists and engineers to give them a fuller understanding of how science impacts the world and how the outside world (particularly governments) impact science.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 07/28/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Oliver&nbsp;Brand</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1626153/1626153_10429843_1659019760667_NNCISiteMap_Year1-5--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1626153/1626153_10429843_1659019760667_NNCISiteMap_Year1-5--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"NNCISiteMap_Year1-5.jpg\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1626153/1626153_10429843_1659019760667_NNCISiteMap_Year1-5--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"NNCISiteMap_Year1-5.jpg\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Figure 1: US Map with Locations of the 16 NNCI Sites.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Christa Ernst, Georgia Institute of Technology</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Oliver&nbsp;Brand</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">NNCISiteMap_Year1-5.jpg</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1626153/1626153_10429843_1659019926652_NNCIAcademicInstitutions_Yesr1-5--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1626153/1626153_10429843_1659019926652_NNCIAcademicInstitutions_Yesr1-5--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"NNCIAcadeicInstitutions_Year1-5.png\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1626153/1626153_10429843_1659019926652_NNCIAcademicInstitutions_Yesr1-5--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"NNCIAcadeicInstitutions_Year1-5.png\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Figure 2: US Academic Institutions (369 External) using NNCI Facilities.
