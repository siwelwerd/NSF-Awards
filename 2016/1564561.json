 "awd_abstract_narration": "This National Science Foundation (NSF) Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (S-STEM) project at Saint Leo University in Saint Leo, Florida will award scholarships to low-income, academically talented students pursing bachelors degrees in computer science or mathematics. In addition to scholarships, the program will provide additional support in the form of faculty mentoring, interdisciplinary projects with faculty, tutoring and academic support,  along with networking and internship opportunities with industry. A key element of Saint Leo University's S-STEM program will be the formation of two interacting cohorts of mathematics and computer science students.  This cohort experience will be an  opportunity for students in both majors to engage effectively in exchanges of ideas, and to appreciate the interdisciplinary nature of the two fields.  At stronger familiarity with the complementary disciplines of mathematics and computer science is expected to help broaden the students' career perspectives to include emerging high-demand interdisciplinary career areas such as cybersecurity and data analytics. Scholarships and support for low-income and academically talented students, who may not otherwise be able to obtain STEM degrees, will help to produce a well-trained workforce that will contribute to the nation's economic growth and competitiveness.\r\n\r\nThe S-STEM program will increase retention and degree completion for students majoring in mathematics or computer sciences, increase students' appreciation and understanding of the benefits each discipline offers the other, and help these students to develop the qualifications and interests needed to pursue the expanding career opportunities at the interface of applied mathematics and computer science. The project will create interacting cohorts of computer science and mathematics majors. Cohorts will take classes together, receive faculty mentoring from both disciplines, and participate in interdisciplinary group projects.  Students majoring in the fields of computer science and mathematics will learn their chosen field of study but, through an interdisciplinary approach, will develop experience in the other discipline.  It is expected that scholarship students in the program will show an increased appreciation for the power of integrating these disciplines and awareness of the extensive opportunities in interdisciplinary career options. The findings from the program will be disseminated widely to the STEM education community.",
