 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms B Program in the Division of Chemistry, Professor William E. Geiger of the University of Vermont is studying electrochemistry in addressing chemical, biochemical, and environmental problems. The most common type of electrochemical cell is one in which two metal electrodes communicate through an electrolyte solution, with chemical reactions taking place at each electrode. Traditionally, the electrodes have been composed of expensive and rare metals such as platinum and gold. In the interest of both cost and sustainability, these traditional metals need to be replaced by cheaper and more common, preferably carbon-based, materials. However, carbon surfaces themselves lack the chemical structure needed to carry out many important reactions, such as those required in efficient fuel cells. The project is designed to molecularly alter the surface structure of carbon, thereby increasing the efficiency of these reactions. These studies provide training in electrochemistry and transition-metal chemistry for undergraduate and graduate students, in addition to high school students. The students are also experiencing other research groups through a number of collaborating arrangements. \r\n\r\nProfessor Geiger is developing a new chemical electrode modification method based on electrochemical oxidation of either an ethynyl-containing molecule or a metal-activated ethynyl molecule. An ethynyl group provides a nearly ideal linkage between a molecular substrate and a carbon surface owing to its ability to offer facile electronic communication between those moieties, its very strong bonding to the surface, and its structural integrity. Both organometallic molecules and porphyrin complexes containing transition metals are being attached to the electrode surfaces. Routes to electrode modification by porphyrins containing a number of different transition metals are being be explored, and one or more electrocatalytic reactions, such as the oxygen reduction reaction, are being probed. Electrodes also are being modified with ethynyl-linked metal photosensitizers and ethynyl-linked multi-electron transfer agents, with the goal of providing new electrode surfaces for efficient biosensors and neural sensors. A new approach to analysis of chemically modified electrodes by magnetic circular dichroism is being studied.",

Improvements in the function, efficiency, and longevity of these cells are often approached by either changing the type of metal used for the electrode or by chemically modifying its surface to enhance specific chemical interactions. The so-called &ldquo;chemically modified electrodes&rdquo; produced in the latter approach have come to dominate research in this field. A particularly important target is to replace precious metal electrodes (e.g. platium) with those based on earth-abundant elements, carbon in particular, which was used in our study.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A severe impediment to replacement of a precious metal electrode with carbon occurs if the chemical reactions take place more slowly on carbon. If so, one hopes to catalyze the reaction by modifying the carbon surface with a molecule that speeds up the transfer of electrons to the targeted molecule in solution. This concept is visualized in Figure 1 for the &ldquo;oxygen reduction&rdquo; reaction (O<sub>2</sub> to H<sub>2</sub>O, Eq 1) which occurs in a hydrogen-oxygen fuel cell. The chemically modified electrode on the right contains surface molecules which allow a more rapid transfer of electrons between the solid carbon and the oxygen in solution, thereby speeding up the reduction. Our research focused on a new way to attach a key family of molecular catalysts to the carbon surface that could improve both the efficiency and longevity of the electrode.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O<sub>2</sub>&nbsp; + 4 H<sup>+&nbsp; </sup>+ 4 e<sup>-</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 H<sub>2</sub>O</p>\n<p>&nbsp;The central core of the attachment molecules is that of a porphyrin (PorH<sub>2, </sub>Figure 2), chosen because metal-containing porphyrins are catalytically active for a number of important reactions. Our unique approach came in how we attached the porphyrins to the carbon surface and then introduced metals into the porphyrin ring.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The efficiencies of previously attached metal-porphyrin catalysts suffered from having poorly defined surface geometries and, in most cases, lacking sufficiently strong bonding to the surface to assure their continuity with repeated usage. Our system overcomes these problems by linking the porphyrin to the electrode surface through the C&equiv;C bond of an ethynyl group tethered to the porphyrin ring [(E)PorH<sub>2</sub>, Figure 2]. Binding of one of the ethynyl carbons to a carbon atom in the electrode produces a very strong (covalent) bond that improves the binding of the molecule to the surface and fixes it into a perpendicular orientation. We had previously discovered how to make such attachments in research carried out during our preceding NSF grant.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; An idealized drawing of a layered group of ethynyl porphyrins on an electrode surface is shown in Figure 3:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp; We approached this work in a sequence of three stages. First, our previously discovered attachment methodology was used to fasten ethynyl porphyrins to commercially available carbon electrodes. Next, we showed how to replace two of the porphyrin hydrogens in (E)PorH<sub>2</sub> with transition metals (Figure 2, (E)PorM, M = Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn). This &lsquo;metalation&rsquo; step essentially activates the porphyrin to electrocatalyze specific reactions with a substrate in solution. The metalation step itself requires what chemists refer to as &ldquo;forcing conditions&rdquo;, involving higher reaction temperatures and longer reaction times. Owing to the fact that our porphyrins are bound so strongly to the electrode surface, we were able to complete the metalation processes without loss of porphyrin from the electrode. Finally, as an example of how these modified electrodes might be applied to electrocatalysis, we studied the behavior of the cobalt system, (E)PorCo, as a&nbsp; catalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction. The results were promising, both in the rate of the catalytic reaction and its production of water as the main product of the reaction.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is likely to be the last &lsquo;NSF Outcomes&rsquo; report prepared by myself as PI of NSF-sponsored research.
