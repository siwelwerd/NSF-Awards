 "awd_abstract_narration": "Titanium alloys can be stronger than steel at much lower weight. The greatest barrier to the widespread use of titanium, however, has been its high cost, much of which comes from high processing costs. A new powder metallurgy process called hydrogen sintering has been introduced that can produce titanium components with the capacity to compete with the mechanical properties of standard titanium parts produced by forging, but at a fraction of the cost. This new process is very promising for dramatically reducing the cost of titanium parts and components. Titanium parts can be used in many applications (biomedical, chemical processing, aerospace, etc.), but have particular benefit to the transportation sector. By reducing the weight of vehicles, significant savings in fuel consumption will be realized, as well as associated reductions in emissions. This award supports a comprehensive study of the fundamental underlying metallurgical processes associated with the titanium powder process, and the mechanical properties that can be achieved by varying process parameters. \r\n\r\nIn this research program, the PIs will systematically study the range of mechanical properties that can be attained by several heat treating options that have already shown the capacity to produce wrought-like microstructures from this novel powder metallurgy approach. Processing parameters will be studied for their effects on phase equilibria in the relevant titanium alloy-hydrogen systems, as well as phase transformations and microstructural evolution as functions of thermal cycles and hydrogen partial pressures, the mechanisms and kinetics of the transformations, and the dependence of mechanical properties, especially the fatigue performance, on the microstructure. By studying these relationships and applying the knowledge gained toward maximizing the strength, ductility and fatigue properties of titanium alloys at substantially lower cost, a major step will be taken toward realizing the full benefit of titanium for industry and society.",
