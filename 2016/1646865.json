 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed project will support student and professional volunteer travel to Barrow, Alaska, in July 2016 to participate in research and rescue efforts at the rapidly eroding Walakpa archaeological site. Walakpa, or Ualiqpaa, is a large multi-component site dating to at least 1200 years ago and encompassing a major cultural transition in the western North American Arctic - the migration and evolution of Birnirk and Thule cultures  - first excavated by Dennis Stanford, American Museum of Natural History. Research at the site in the 1960s uncovered a rich and well-preserved record of past Arctic lifeways and environment. Previous research also identified a possible earlier Arctic Small Tool Tradition (ASTt) occupation at the site. If the ASTt occupation is confirmed, the record at Walakpa spans the entire occupation of the Arctic, over 4000 years. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, after years of relative stability, the site is now in imminent danger from increased coastal erosion due to northern environmental change. Reduced sea ice cover and increased storm frequency, coupled with melting permafrost, are rapidly devastating the North Slope archaeological record and the Walakpa site. The need for an immediate and rapid effort at Walakpa is clear. \r\n\r\nThe field season in northern Alaska is short, typically only 2-2.5 months and the need to recover materials from Walakpa in summer 2016 is pressing. The rapid rate of erosion at the site since 2013 suggests that total site loss is possible in the next few years, although when this may occur is difficult to predict as the extent of the site itself is not well understood. The opportunity for future research on the site and collections is immense, but this hinges on the collection of additional information about the site before it erodes away or is lost to climate warming induced decomposition.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Walakpa archaeological site, located 18 km southwest of Utqiagvik (Barrow), Alaska, is considered a critically important site by the local community and archaeologists.  Walakpa, or Ualiqpaa, is a multi-component site comprised of a series of mounds and associated deposits dating to at least 1200 years ago and encompassing a major cultural transition in the western North American Arctic &ndash; the migration and evolution of Birnirk and Thule cultures.  Research at Walakpa in the 1960s uncovered a rich and well-preserved record of past Arctic lifeways and environment. Unfortunately, the site is now in imminent danger from increased coastal erosion due to climate change.  Reduced sea ice cover and increased storm frequency, coupled with melting permafrost, are rapidly devastating the North Slope archaeological record and the Walakpa site.  Previous recovery efforts at Walakpa, led by Anne Jensen of the Ukpea&#289;vik Inupiat Corporation (UIC) since 2013, identified several occupation features and abundant, rapidly decomposing, organic artifacts.  By fall 2014, at least 14 more meters of the site were lost to the sea during a single storm event (Jensen 2015).  The storm exposed human remains and additional artifacts and features at the site; it is also apparent that areas of the site remain intact and significant research potential remains.  Walakpa is but one of many disappearing Arctic archaeological sites, but the research potential and importance of the site to the local community has spurred a large volunteer effort and interest in re-establishing a program of research at Walakpa. NSF awarded Portland State University (PSU) funds to support student and professional volunteer travel to Utqiagvik, Alaska in 2016; remaining funds were used to support additional student volunteer travel in 2017.\n\nOutcomes:\n\nBy the conclusion of the 2016-2017 salvage effort, the research team excavated a total of 81.0 m3 and recorded approximately 82.5 m of profile exposed by erosion and excavation activities.  Excavation identified several new features and intersected with previously investigated features.  The current excavation is now spatially linked to prior research, which means that there is additional research potential in the salvage collections. Numerous artifacts, faunal, and sediment samples were recovered over the course of the 2016-2017 salvage effort.   Lab stabilization of the majority of the artifacts and faunal samples is complete and additional analysis is underway at partner institutions.\n\nOver the course of the project, NSF funds awarded to PSU supported a total of ten students and professionals from five different institutions.  The project supported a total of 38 students, professional volunteers, and community members.  \n\nThe local community was deeply involved in the recovery effort; research results were shared with the community several times over the course of the project.  Local outreach activities include holding open lab days so that the community can see materials recovered from the site, giving local science fair presentations, and participating in local school teacher trainings.  A total of 12 professional project related presentations were given in 2016-2018, one book chapter, and one peer reviewed paper have been published; two more papers are under consideration for publication.\n\nIntellectual Merit:\n\nPrior research at Walakpa established that the site has a continuous record of at least 1200 years of coastal lifeways and environments, perhaps extending as far back as 4000-4500 BP.  While Stanford?s work was important in that it established the evolution of Thule culture, the research potential of the site is largely untapped.  Organic preservation at the site is excellent and could be used for a fine-grained reconstruction of human-environment interaction during the late Holocene.  There is further potential for addressing questions of migration, interaction, and cultural evolution through archaeological research at the site.  The opportunity for future research on the site and collections is immense, but this hinges on the collection of additional information about the site before it erodes away or is lost to climate warming induced decomposition.  The 2016-2017 field efforts were an important step in preserving this rapidly eroding site.\n\nBroader Impacts:\n\nResearch and salvage work at Walakpa provided an unparalleled opportunity for students to participate in a unique field and professional experience, establishing important connections that will be key in furthering their future educational and career goals.  Students worked alongside professional archaeologists and community members to recover materials from eroding areas of the site.  Students also had the opportunity to work in the UIC lab cleaning, cataloging, and carrying out preliminary stabilization of cultural materials recovered from the site.  Recovery and research efforts at Walakpa are linking archaeologists from around the world to the site and region, bringing attention to the problem of rapid site loss in the Arctic.  Professional synergy around the effort at Walakpa will contribute to broader anthropological and paleoecological research in the Arctic.  Additional collaborative efforts to coordinate a response to northern climate change impacts on archaeology are already underway in association with the Walakpa effort.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/04/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Shelby Anderson"
