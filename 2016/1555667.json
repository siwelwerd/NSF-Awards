 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the enablement of new and improved therapeutic drug development.  One hurdle in the development of new drugs, is their relatively low effectiveness due to poor water solubility limiting formulation choices and/or limiting cellular uptake.  Forming drug nano particles, by way of controlling the drug crystal formation process, is one tool to overcome this low solubility hurdle.   Acoustical energy has been shown to aid in the formation of drug crystallization however, current acoustical technologies are not able to reliably achieve the crystal size and distribution needed for many new drug candidates.  A reliable method for nanoparticle drug production will allow better and more effective drugs to make it to market.  Additionally, the Pharmaceutical industry is transitioning from batch to continuous flow manufacturing processes.  This has significant impact on cost, responsiveness, and quality control of the drug supply chain, and will enable more rapid and lower cost drug development and manufacturing.\r\n\r\nThe proposed project will develop equipment and processes that enable the continuous manufacture of drug nano and micron sized particles by controlling the crystallization using a novel focused acoustical field.  Focused acoustics has the advantage of delivering a highly efficient, controllable, scalable energy field to the crystallization zone.  The project will demonstrate a focused acoustics crystallization process capable of being developed into commercial grade equipment suitable for use in a continuous flow production pharmaceutical manufacturing environment.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nSBIR Phase II Public Overview\n\nThe pharmaceutical manufacturing industry is undergoing a transformation from batch processing, to continuous manufacturing.  Significant development work is underway, with numerous companies now launching product produced in continuous manufacturing fashion.  As pharmaceutical production transitions from batch to continuous processing, new technologies are needed to enable these new methods.  One critical area that does not currently have an industry wide solution, is a method of controlling nucleation and crystal growth during the crystallization or recrystallization steps of drug manufacture.  These are critical steps to effectively trigger particle formation, and/or control the drug particle size, which directly impacts the biological performance and effectiveness in treating disease.\n\nLow frequency, unfocused ultrasound has previously been demonstrated for improving crystallization kinetics. However, unfocused ultrasound has efficiency limitations due the inability to truly converge energy to a focal point, creating issues in thermal management such as non-uniform mixing, and uncontrolled thermal fields.  Additionally, traditional ultrasonic equipment does not scale efficiently and as such is not effective when used continuous production processes.\n\nThe Covaris Adaptive Focused Acoustics&trade; (AFA) technology delivers a high acoustic energy density with breakthrough efficiency.  Acoustic energy is focused to converge inside of a closed vessel.  This allows delivery of very high energy levels in a non contact, isothermal manner.  www.covarisinc.com  In small batch methods, the Covaris Adaptive Focused Acoustics&trade; (AFA) technology has demonstrated precise control of both the nucleation formation and the rate of crystal growth via control of cavitation dynamics.  Both micron size particle control, as well as nano particles are possible using AFA.\n\nDuring this Phase II SBIR development, a scalable Focused-ultrasonicator based on the AFA technology was designed, built, tested, and applied to a number of continuous drug manufacturing methods to successfully control the particle nucleation and growth dynamics.\n\nThis Focused-ultrasonicator has a number of advantages over current ultrasonic technologies and is state of the art in ultrasonic performance.  The high energy efficiency of AFA avoids excessive heat generation, reducing potential thermal instability issues during the process and allowing greater control over thermally dependent chemical reactions which dominate many of these chemistries.  Moreover, the precisely controlled energy delivery via computer software control improves the reproducibility of the process thus enabling highly repeatable results and tight quality control.  Non contact, self contained processing eliminates risk of contamination, and the processing scale is suitable for true production quantity.\n\nIn summary, during this SBIR Phase II, continuous flow Focused-ultrasonic equipment was designed and built which has demonstrated breakthrough performance in the ability to aid in the continuous manufacture of new drugs.  Most notably a method of creating drug nanoparticles, and a method to control particle size in the micron range.  These capabilities directly contribute to drug therapeutic performance such as poorly soluble API?s that would otherwise be ineffective.  Scaling to continuous process streams allows this capability to scale to production volume, lowering costs, shortening development times, reducing capital needed, and improving drug quality.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/04/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Carl Beckett"
