 "awd_abstract_narration": "This REU Site award to Georgetown University, located in Washington, DC, will support the training of 10 students for 10 weeks during the summers of 2016-2018. The program will enhance each student's ability to perform scientific research independently and expand their awareness of how such research dovetails with public policy. Students will work actively on an authentic environmental science research project advised by one of 13 faculty members. Research projects will be in environmental science fields including ecology, population biology, mathematical modeling, climate change, and earth science. Participants will learn an array of research skills including responsible conduct of research, formulating hypotheses, data management, and scientific writing. Students will participate in a full-day Communicating Science workshop to learn approaches to explaining scientific information to diverse audiences. Weekly seminars will bring to campus local professionals working in science policy to discuss their work, their careers, and career resources. Each student will produce a research poster and present at a summer research symposium. Because matching applicants to appropriate mentors is essential, advance communication with prospective mentors in the program is encouraged. \r\n     \r\nIt is anticipated that a total of 30 students, primarily from schools with limited research opportunities, will be trained in the program. Student participants will be drawn from the Baltimore-Washington DC region as well as nationally. The program will emphasize recruitment of students with research potential from groups underrepresented in environmental sciences and first-generation college students. Students will learn how research is conducted, and many will present the results of their work at scientific conferences.\r\n     \r\nA common web-based assessment tool used by all REU programs funded by the Division of Biological Infrastructure (Directorate for Biological Sciences) will be used to determine the effectiveness of the training program. Students will be tracked after the program in order to determine student career paths. Students will be asked to respond to an automatic email sent via the NSF reporting system. More information about the program is available by visiting http://biology.georgetown.edu/REU, or by contacting the PI (Dr. Matthew B. Hamilton at matthew.hamilton@georgetown.edu) or the co-PI (Dr. Martha Weiss at weissm@georgetown.edu). This REU site is co-funded by the Division of Biological Infrastructure (Directorate for Biological Sciences), and the Division of Mathematical Sciences (Directorate for Mathematical & Physical Sciences).",

During the 10-week summer program, student participants worked closely with a faculty mentor and were directly involved in a rigorous, hands-on, research activity that they had an active role in developing, carrying out, and interpreting. Students participated in a curriculum of activities designed to improve their knowledge of the research process, understanding of responsible conduct of research, and approaches to communicating STEM ideas and concepts to a wide range of audiences. Primer courses were offered in computer programming, and in the combination of science for policy (how scientific knowledge is used to formulate public policy) and policy for science (the public research funding system). Visiting speakers who are STEM professionals or in STEM-policy fields shared their educational and career experiences and provided direct exposure to a broad range of careers other than academia. Each year a full-day workshop on communicating science to the public and to policy makers was held that featured several guest speakers and that was also attended by students in REU site programs at the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center, Howard University, and the Georgetown University Dept. of Physics. All REU students presented their research as a poster during the final week of each summer at an undergraduate research symposium. Some student participants presented their research posters at their home institutions or at a regional or national meeting. The program received 64 applications in the first year (2016), 458 applications in the second year (2017), and 419 applications in the third year (2018). Program applicants were a diverse group that included slightly more females than males. To illustrate using the 2018 applicant pool, 42% were from students at non-PhD granting institutions, 33% were Pell Grant eligible; 69% were female, 38% were members of under-represented minority groups, and 23% were first-generation college students (neither parent was a college graduate). The program supported 30 participants total over the three summers of 2016, 2017, and 2018. About 45% were members of under-represented minority groups, and the participants included students from community colleges and non-PhD-granting institutions, non-traditional (&gt;30 years old) students, and first-generation college students. Numerous undergraduate students at Georgetown during the summers were supported indirectly by the program through participation in program events and interaction with REU program participants. Three program students were coauthors on a total of two peer-reviewed publications based on research carried out during one of the REU program summers. In response to anonymous surveys administered at the end of each summer, students self-reported large gains in their ability to carry out research, ability to work independently, understanding of the relevance of scientific research to public policy, and awareness of career paths for those with scientific research experience. In a longitudinal survey administered in February, 2020 completed by 15 of 30 program participants from all three program years, 67% of responses indicated the REU experience was 'extremely important' or 'very important' in making career choices after the program.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 04/21/2020<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Matthew&nbsp;B&nbsp;Hamilton</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1559887/1559887_10413579_1587497854095_DSC_0573--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1559887/1559887_10413579_1587497854095_DSC_0573--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"2016 REU participants\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1559887/1559887_10413579_1587497854095_DSC_0573--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"2016 REU participants\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Participants in the 2016 Georgetown University environmental science and policy in the nation's capitol REU program.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Matthew B Hamilton</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Matthew&nbsp;B&nbsp;Hamilton</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">2016 REU participants</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1559887/1559887_10413579_1587498165947_IMG_1129--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1559887/1559887_10413579_1587498165947_IMG_1129--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"2018 communicating science workshop\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1559887/1559887_10413579_1587498165947_IMG_1129--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"2018 communicating science workshop\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Participants in the 2018 Communicating Science workshop hosted by the Georgetown University environmental science and policy in the nation's capitol REU program.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Matthew B Hamilton</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Matthew&nbsp;B&nbsp;Hamilton</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">2018 communicating science workshop</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
