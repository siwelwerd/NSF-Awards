This AmeriMech Symposium will bring together experimental and theoretical researchers interested in the mechanical behavior of 2D materials in order to develop a comprehensive view of the state of the art, and develop a roadmap for future research.\r\n\r\nLow-dimensional materials play an increasingly critical role in advanced technologies. The mechanics of deformation and failure of these materials have been recognized by the mechanics of materials and structures community as an extremely challenging problem, both to predict computationally and to measure experimentally. This symposium will bring together leading researchers in the field of low dimensional materials. The longer presentation times, coupled with a substantial discussion period at the end of each day will foster meaningful exchanges between participants and lay the groundwork for the development of a roadmap for future research and collaborations.",
