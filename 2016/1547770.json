 "awd_abstract_narration": "Whitney Goodwin, a PhD candidate, will investigate how groups actively negotiate their identities and affiliations to navigate the complex social and political landscapes of border areas. Border areas, both past and present, are locations of frequent and often contentious redefinitions of the traditions that underlie shared identities. Archaeological approaches to identity in border areas provide the long-term and multi-scalar perspective necessary for understanding the complex causes and consequences of these changes. What strategies were used to resist change and were they successful? How and why were traditions from neighboring groups sometimes borrowed or appropriated? This research is concerned with addressing these questions by examining multiple classes of materials and how these were combined in ways that reinforced or contested and eventually redefined traditional practices. Understanding variation in responses to border interactions and their long-term implications is significant given they occur more widely and frequently today than ever before in human history.\r\n\r\nPrehispanic populations of northeastern Honduras were positioned at the border of Mesoamerica and Lower Central America. Despite shifting affiliations with groups to the north and south, the northeastern region remained a cohesive entity with minimal social inequality and internally shared styles and practices for over 1,200 years, beginning around A.D. 300. Previous research suggests this long term stability can be attributed to the active promotion of symbols of identity that purposefully blended local and exotic styles to express both internal cohesion and strategic external affiliations. The actual implementation of this strategy, however, remains unexplored. Rather than rely on stylistic analyses alone, the present study combines analyses of ceramic style with a concern for where and how ceramic vessels were used in practice. In many cases, vessels that portray symbols or designs expressing identity were combined with foods and practices that were equally as important in defining or contesting those identities. By looking at foodways - the resources and food-related practices particular to a group - in conjunction with ceramic style, the possibility for multiple or conflicting identities is recognized. If local groups were able to balance local tradition with shifting affiliations, how was this accomplished? Were ceramic styles and foodways signaling the same external affiliations or were there multiple or competing influences represented? Archaeological excavations of communal feasting events and the characterization of cooking residues in and stylistic elements on ceramic vessels in these settings will provide a long-term perspective on how both foods and styles were employed. Tracing how these significant elements of identity were combined over time, and the source of influences for both, will provide information for disentangling the processes by which identity was negotiated and highlight the varied ways in which groups embrace, appropriate, and resist change in response to interaction. \r\n\r\nThe project includes significant collaboration with descendent community leaders and government representatives to increase the representation of indigenous heritage in the regional museum, with the goal of encouraging tourists to visit local communities. Additionally, Honduran undergraduate anthropology students are partaking in fieldwork and community collaboration efforts, allowing them to fulfill their internship requirement for degree completion.",

Typological and formal analyses were combined with isotopic signatures of residues from ceramics in feasting contexts to infer how pottery style and foodways were employed in local strategies of identity negotiation. This work demonstrates how local groups used their location on the border to their advantage, shifting their networks to the south in response to increasing regional instability to the north. The results of the research highlight the universal and timeless role of food and food traditions in processes of social change and contribute to anthropological understandings of how foodways articulate with the social and political aspects of culture over the long-term.</p>\n<p>Research focused on analysis of ceramics from excavations into shell midden deposits at the Selin Farm archaeological site. Evidence suggests that consumption of local and imported painted pottery styles was common throughout the site from A.D. 300-600. Results of bulk stable carbon isotope analysis from both local and imported painted pottery in feasting contexts suggest possible maize consumption during this time. This association suggests there was a correlation between how groups chose to express their identity through the use of pottery styles and associated foodways that highlighted their ties to Mesoamerica. Initially, feasts at the site were held in open spaces and the size and quantity of ceramic cooking vessels suggest audiences were large and access to these events was not restricted. Over time, the scale of these events grew larger and the painted pottery styles used in these settings began to change. The common motifs, forms, and sizes of painted vessels at the site all shifted between A.D. 600-800. Within shared regional traditions of painted pottery, the large jars that came into use during this time are unique to eastern Honduras. These may have been used to serve fermented beverages, as they are in Lower Central America. The results of bulk stable carbon isotope analysis on ceramic residues suggest changing use of resources as well, likely less consumption of maize. Between A.D. 800-1000, stylistic elements from Lower Central American pottery traditions became dominant in the assemblages at Selin Farm. This coincides with the first evidence of monumental architecture at the site, when a single midden mound was expanded to a size and height double that of any other mound and a wattle and daub structure was built at the summit. Ritual paraphernalia also became more elaborate and abundant, but was restricted in its spatial distribution to this single monumental structure, indicating the development of increasingly specialized religious or political roles at this time.</p>\n<p>Together, this evidence suggests that the shared beliefs that connected northeast Honduras to other groups along the southeast Mesoamerican border, most clearly marked by their similar consumption of painted pottery, were a strong force in limiting social inequality and creating stability throughout the region for centuries. As these communities to the north underwent significant changes at the end of the Classic period (around A.D. 950) that resulted in destabilization, groups in northeast Honduras used their border status to actively alter their local practices to emphasize their connections to the south. This change in practice was likely connected to and part of a larger strategy that drew on long-standing ties to those groups to transform their group identity and align themselves socially and politically with powerful chiefdoms to the south while also distinguishing themselves from groups to the north. The adoption of new symbols of identity and affiliation was inextricable from changes in the way those symbols were used and understood. As the practices that constituted tradition and identity were negotiated, new opportunities for individual power emerged in the form of specialized ritual roles that were tied to the increasing social inequalities that developed in the northeast by A.D. 1000 and continued to develop throughout the Postclassic period.</p>\n<p>This research highlights the universal and timeless role of food and food traditions in processes of social change and contributes to understanding how foodways articulate with the social and political aspects of culture. In addition to Goodwin's dissertation, this research has produced multiple reports and conference presentations. The project incorporated four female Honduran undergraduate anthropology students in fieldwork, and numerous students in lab work and community outreach efforts. Two of these students undertook their own data collection on excavated materials for their theses, supervised by Goodwin. Members of the indigenous descendant community were involved in fieldwork and in presenting the research to other local stakeholders and to the broader public.
