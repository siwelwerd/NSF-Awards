 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project provides discoverability, low overhead for use, reproducibility of research, and persistence for computer vision data.  The project is hence setting a direction toward which the computer vision community can collectively work in creating a dataset infrastructure that allows for transparency across individual datasets and annotations, experimental benchmarks with community-set corpora and metrics, and a web-based infrastructure to cultivate continued development of computer vision datasets.  The availability of such an infrastructure, which is named COVE: Computer Vision Exchange of Data, Annotations and Tools, impacts the computer vision and related communities to develop next generation robust intelligence capabilities that have great potential to positively impact society. The project is integrated with education by supporting graduate and undergraduate students, and reaches middle school students through outreach activities.\r\n\r\nThe project is establishing COVE, a centralized community-run infrastructure to support the exchange of data and annotations as well as the software tools to manipulate them.  The infrastructure is web-based open-source, and provides open access to its contents. Stewardship over the contents are managed by the Investigators initially and subsequently through elected members of the computer vision community. There are two salient components of the infrastructure. First, a curation infrastructure facilitates back-end storage, querying, data annotation and curation tools, to support it.  To curate the federated data set, COVE uses widely known open-source tools like Python, Bootstrap and Postgresql.  For curation of new annotations to incorporate into the exchange, the project relies heavily on crowd-sourcing.  Second, a usage infrastructure, e.g., data structures and software enables widespread and easy use by researchers and practitioners.  The project develops APIs to allow for easy programmable access to the federated data sets and tools through common software interfaces like Matlab and OpenCV.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe open and widespread availability of data sets has been a major catalyst for the growth of the computer vision and machine learning over the last decade.  When the critical value of data became recognized, the state of community data set management was at a minimum; this includes aspects of long-term storage and availability, provenance of contents and annotations, and quality of data set management.  The COVE project was conceived to rectify these limitations, which otherwise could have long-term negative impacts of the progress in the field.\n\nThe COVE project established a community-centered infrastructure to support the open exchange of data and annotations.  Creating this infrastructure required establishing a common taxonomy over problems and tasks along with types of data and annotations for the computer vision community.  It also required core technical work to implement the openly accessible infrastructure.  The taxonomy and infrastructure are extensible so that COVE can evolve as the research foci in computer vision likewise evolves.\n\nAfter several rounds of trials within the data set submission process at major research venues, such as the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition in 2019, the COVE infrastructure was deployed publicly.  The infrastructure is openly available on the web at https://cove.thecvf.com. It has been integrated into the publication process at major conferences in the computer vision community thereby ensuring that as new data sets are created, they will be indexed in COVE.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/07/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Mingyan Liu"
