 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) and Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Programs, Professor Ipsita Banerjee from Fordham University and colleagues John McMahon, Stephen Holler, Petr Shibayev and Christopher Koenigsmann have acquired a high resolution atomic force microscope (AFM). An AFM, unlike an optical microscope, does not use light to create an image.  An AFM employs a microscopic probe (needle-like device) that passes over a surface. As the probe moves across the surface it generates electrical signals which describe the properties of the surface (hardness, roughness, cracks, wettability, elasticity, etc.).  In this way, it produces an image of the surface. This information is important for visually characterizing the surface. AFM is useful for understanding why a chemical reaction may occur on the surface, or why the surface is unreactive (inert). In general, an AFM has three major abilities: force measurement, imaging, and manipulation. An AFM is an important tool in the development of novel materials for fuel cell catalysis, enhanced solar panels, and for very small nanoparticle sensors, all of which rely on specific surface properties and morphology. AFM is used to characterize biological tissue, viruses and drug delivery materials. The instrument is employed in undergraduate research projects training these students in the use of this technique and preparing them for future technological careers in the workplace and advanced degrees in science, engineering and medical fields. \r\n\r\nThe award is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels, especially in areas such as (a) studying tissue scaffolds, protein dynamics and viral nanoparticles, (b) studying microcavity photonics, (c) analyzing nanomaterials for catalysis and fuel cells, (d) examining the role of iodine in the photocatalysis of oxygen reduction at a silver/silver iodide (Ag/AgI) fuel cell cathode and (e) studying stimuli-responsive liquid crystals and liquid crystalline polymers.",
