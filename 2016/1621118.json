 "awd_abstract_narration": "This SBIR Phase I project will test the feasibility of a new product aimed at helping students succeed in undergraduate engineering courses. The US is failing to produce enough engineers required to compete in the global marketplace. Research has shown that undergraduate students struggle when they encounter more complex engineering concepts and are tasked with designing solutions to engineering problems. This leads to a lack of engagement as they do not foresee themselves as being successful engineers. The product will be software that creates virtual worlds in which students are tasked with designing solutions for real world engineering problems. It will be based on foundational theories of learning and prior NSF-funded research, and will enable students to develop and hone critical thinking and design skills. As students work through the problem, student data will be sent to their teachers in real time to help teachers immediately identify students that may be struggling with a particular concept or design skill.  This project supports the mission of the NSF to support education in science and engineering and help students develop the skills required to pursue well paid engineering careers and contribute to the US economy.\r\n \r\nThe innovation underpinning this project is the development of a software platform in which the critical thinking skills required to design effective engineering solutions can be delineation and refined. This platform will include simulations based on the physics underpinning foundational engineering concepts that will help students develop design skills through authentic inquiry as they design solutions for real world problems. The software will also include a real time data system that reports on the heuristic quality of student design decisions and builds into a formative assessment tool that will enable teachers to measure the development of design skills by their students over time. The goals of this project will be to determine whether engineering design skills can be effectively defined, refined and used as a new pedagogical basis for a suite of products to address the needs of US engineering colleges. The efficacy of the product in improving undergraduate student learning of difficult engineering concepts and development of design skills will be tested in a US college engineering course.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe overall aim of this Phase I SBIR project was to test the feasibility of a prototype product to help undergraduate engineering students learn fundamental engineering concepts through authentic inquiry.\n\nInnovations in engineering are major contributors to the US economy.  Unfortunately, the US is lagging behind other nations with respect to the numbers of engineering graduates entering the workforce.  Currently, colleges have few options for engaging learning activities for core sophomore and junior engineering courses. The product to be developed in this project aims to meet this need by engaging all engineering students in their learning and help reduce the currently high dropout rates in these vitally important college courses.  The long term goal is help students succeed in their courses and become the professional engineers needed for the future success of the US economy.\n\nIn this project, two prototype software programs (modules) were developed and tested with undergraduate engineering students and their edcuators (professors and lecturers).  The students used the prototypes and then provided feedback to the researchers.  The educators also provided feedback regarding the prototypes and their potential to improve undergraduate engineering education.\n\nA summary of the findings of Phase I SBIR project are as follows:\n\nUndergraduate Engineering Students:\n\nThe majority of students (74% for module 1, and 77% for module 2) reported that the Engineering Education prototype was easy or very easy to use with 10% reporting that module 1 it was difficult to use, and 4% stating that module 2 was difficult to use.\nOnly 6% of students reported that the Fluid Statics concepts in module 1 were difficult to learn despite educators stating that their students usually find these concepts very difficult to master.\n43% if students found the Fluid Dynamics concepts in Module 2 were difficult to learn. Students requested more help and hint functions to aid their learning of these concepts.\n89% of students that completed module 1 and 95% of students that completed module 2 stated that they would like more of these modules in their undergraduate courses.\nStudents valued the visual representation of engineering concepts.\nStudents stated that the presentation of the concepts in the context of a real world problem was engaging and helped provide relevance in their learning.\n\n\n \n\nUndergraduate Engineering Educators:\n\nEducators reported that the modules were effective in engaging all students in the classroom regardless of gender, ethnicity or performance level.\nEducators valued the visualization of engineering concepts and the interactive features of the modules for their students.\nThe modules helped Educators engage their students in critical thinking and the application of engineering concepts to the design of solutions for real world problems.\nEducators stated that the modules would be valuable additions to traditional materials to help students gain deeper understanding of engineering concepts.  \nThe data analysis system was easy for Educators to use and helped them identify areas where students may be struggling or lack understanding.\n\n\nThe overall aim of this project is to develop a suite of modules for undergraduate engineering education that help address the need to engage students in their learning of difficult engineering concepts and practice the skills required for successful careers.  There are currently no products on the market that address these needs and, to the best of our knowledge, IS3D is the only company currently developing a product for this market segment.  We believe that the research and development activities in Phase I provide compelling evidence regarding the feasibility of the product.  By continuing to work closely with educators and students in Phase II, IS3D aims to bring to market a product that supports student success in undergraduate engineering and helps provide the skilled engineering workforce needed for the United States to compete in the 21st century global economy.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/18/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jared Jackson"
