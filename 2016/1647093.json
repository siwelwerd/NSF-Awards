 "awd_abstract_narration": "1647093 - Winslow\r\n\r\nCerebral palsy (CP) is a disorder that alters an individual's ability to control their muscles, and affects approximately 1 in every 500 births.  Individuals with CP often undergo surgery, medication regimens, or physical rehabilitation programs to improve motor control.  Physical therapy has been shown to improve muscle control, especially if it is started early when the brain is most plastic.  However, doctors and parents of children with CP do not have access to accurate tools to determine if therapy is progressing.  This project will develop a low-cost system to support and assess therapy, using optical tools such as the Microsoft Kinect, and virtual reality (VR) tools including adaptive, immersive games to train the muscles used in walking.  The tools will be developed in collaboration with rehabilitation professionals, and assessed using children with CP.  Beyond CP, the system will address physical rehabilitation across a range of disorders, and provide low-cost methods to accurately train and assess motor function.\r\n\r\nCerebral Palsy (CP) describes a spectrum of disorders that are attributed to non-progressive impairments in the developing fetal or infant brain. CP is the leading cause of childhood disability affecting function and development. Previous research has indicated that motor function improvement, including reduced spasticity and other musculoskeletal problems along with strengthened cortical pathways, is possible following physical rehabilitation programs. However, physical therapists, other rehabilitation professionals, and parents have limited access to assessment tools that objectively and quantitatively measure the motor skill progress of a child with a CP. Further, there are very few quantitative measures that can be effectively used by parents that utilize continuous variable data to assess the impact of assistive devices on gross motor function. This project will allow for easier tracking of gross motor function using quantitative, objective measures gathered by an optical device (e.g. Microsoft Kinect), and support rehabilitation of children with CP by developing and implementing a virtual reality (VR)-based, adaptive and personalized gait training system.  The system will be implemented at a pediatric CP rehabilitation center and be subjected to controlled human subjects testing. The objective of this project is to advance rehabilitation techniques for children with CP by developing and validating the core technologies needed to integrate therapy instruction with learning and feedback algorithms to stabilize or improve physical abilities. A principal goal of the project is to examine how evaluation of rehabilitation outcome metrics can be achieved through real-time system data acquisition and how optimal delivery of rehabilitation exercises and assessments can be best used through human interaction. The focus is on using human-centered capabilities to enable adaptive interaction systems to assist in rehabilitation exercises. A broader goal is to create a marketable, cost effective, commercially viable product that can be used by any parent or professional working with children with physical disabilities. Additional phases of the project will extend to other therapy centers, schools, and service providers around the country. The innovative approach of combining simple, repeatable motor skill tests and a user friendly software interface to help interpret these tests drastically widens the potential reach of this project to help children with disabilities develop greater motor abilities. The broader applications for this technology include by physical therapists for rehabilitation of their patients. Undergraduate research projects and demonstrations to special needs schools and their students are anticipated to inspire, encourage, and introduce the next generation of engineers and scientists to a growing field in which clinical studies and engineering are closely aligned and integrated.",
