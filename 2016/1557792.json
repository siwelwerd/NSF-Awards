 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ability of cells to monitor the environment and adjust their structure and function in order to best maintain all of the physiological properties that support their existence (homeostasis) is a fundamental property of all biological systems. Cells in animal nervous systems are no exception; they need to constantly change their signaling connections with other cells (synapses) in brain circuits in response to both normal environmental changes and to physiological challenges such as toxins, so that brain function can be homeostatically maintained within a physiologically appropriate range. However, we currently have a very poor understanding of the basic biological mechanisms underlying the homeostatic regulation of cell-to-cell communication that affects brain circuitry. This project uses genetic tools uniquely available in the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster together with electrical recordings, biochemical techniques, synapse imaging by microscopy, and drug manipulations to understand how a newly-identified molecular factor in fruitfly muscles (called Heartless/Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor tyrosine kinase [Htl/FGFR]) homeostatically controls the level of activity in the motor nerve cells that cause these same muscles to contract. This research will precisely elucidate what causes this muscle-specific molecule to become biologically active, and how it signals its activity backwards in this circuit to affect the activity of the nerve cells that control muscles. This research plan also integrates a variety of educational activities at multiple levels, including: 1) an ongoing research and educational collaboration with a faculty member at a nearby primarily undergraduate institution (PUI); 2) a yearly three-day summer workshop designed by the principal investigator (PI) to expand neuroscience research resources for PUIs; 3) K-12 STEM public outreach in Iowa through tours of the PI's lab and school visits by the PI and his graduate students; and 4) long- and short-term research opportunities for undergraduates, including underrepresented minority students enrolled in programs such as the SROP/McNair Scholars Program at the University of Iowa.\r\n\r\nHomeostatic forms of synaptic plasticity direct synapses and circuits to maintain normal ranges of output, despite the perturbations they may experience throughout life. A significant unknown is the molecular underpinning of the homeostatic regulation of synapse function. The PI's lab addresses this problem utilizing the Drosophila melanogaster neuromuscular junction (NMJ) as a model. At the NMJ, impaired muscle excitability is corrected by offsetting, homeostatic increases in presynaptic neurotransmitter release. Precisely how the muscle communicates a need for increased neurotransmitter release is not understood. Similar forms of regulation have been found in the mammalian central and peripheral nervous systems, and they are not understood either. Using Drosophila genetics and electrophysiology, the PI's lab has identified new molecules that illuminate signaling events controlling synaptic homeostasis. One molecule forms the basis for this project, a Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor (FGFR) tyrosine kinase. Data from the lab support muscle-specific roles for FGFR. The central hypothesis is that muscle-derived FGFR activity tunes synaptic strength by mediating both anterograde (nerve-to-muscle) and retrograde (muscle-to-nerve) cell-cell signals. There are two specific aims. Aim 1 will determine the molecular signals in the muscle triggered by FGFR during the execution of homeostatic compensation. This aim includes experiments that will identify direct targets, as well as the retrograde signal(s) activated by those targets. Aim 2 will determine how homeostatic FGFR signaling is activated and regulated. Both aims will employ a combination of electrophysiology, biochemistry, synapse imaging, and pharmacology.",
