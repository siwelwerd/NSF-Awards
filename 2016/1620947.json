 "awd_abstract_narration": "In many industries, such as the electric power and distribution sector, energy losses due to poor heat dissipation are a significant challenge. Heat dissipating coatings can be developed by understanding and engineering the interaction of electromagnetic waves with matter which are the key for such technologies that require targeted optical and infrared characteristics. This project explores the potential of atomically thin multilayered materials towards heat dissipation applications; if engineered to specification, these nanoscale-thin coatings will passively cool an object relative to an uncoated one. This project investigates the requirements and application space for such coatings through scientific insights and application demands. Potential first adopters are expected at power utilities, power distribution, and energy efficient buildings.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project aims to show how nanostructured, multilayered 2-dimensional materials can be designed to exhibit specific light-matter-interaction properties. The scope extends to permittivity-engineering via a metamaterial approach. Specifically the radiation and reflection spectra are of interest towards emissivity control of a coated object, thus reducing its relative temperature. The study of broadband permittivity data of emerging 2-dimensional materials extends the understanding of photon-electron interaction and radiation profiles. The I-Corps process will increase public scientific literacy in the STEM field through the interview method of potential customers. Thus, partnerships between academia, industry, and start-up ventures are therefore expected to emerge and accelerate the time-to-market as aligned with the Materials Genome Initiative. At a larger scheme, an enhanced efficiency along with a reliability-improved power grid supports both national security and economic competitiveness of the United States.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe major goal of ICorps was to explore customer sectors through interviews with key personnel in those sectors to determine if a 2D nanomaterial had commercialization potential as a heat dissipation coating.  The 2D coating was developed to enhance heat dissipation of an object and therefore cool it, provided it was exposed to the outdoors.  The ICorps program involved the team conducting customer discovery interviews to determine if heat dissipation was a ?pain point? for various industries &ndash; building envelope and HVAC, servers, and solar cells.  The customer discovery interviews were used to determine if there was an appropriate fit for the technology in that particular sector, and, if so, if there was a path towards commercialization.  The team interviewed over 100 customers to determine if there was a proven product-market fit.\n\n \n\nThis knowledge is important in order to identify the next steps as the team works towards commercialization of the technology.  The key outcome from the research was the determination that the solar industry has potential product-market fit.  The customer discovery interviews also revealed the requirements for the proposed technology to be adopted: namely life-cycle testing in the field and sufficient data to allow the increased energy output and cooling to be guaranteed.  To continue the path towards commercialization, the team intends to develop a prototype and work with solar companies to field test and determine if the coating will achieve the lab results under real world conditions.\n\n \n\nShould the 2D coating be successfully commercialized, the team predicts that it will have significant positive impacts. Looking specifically at the solar energy sector, the coating would increase the efficiency of the solar cells, therefore producing more electricity from a cell.  This would have impacts beyond the bounds of the academic world as increasing the amount of electricity produced from a solar cell will benefit humanity.  Many forms of electricity production have negative environmental impacts, including photovoltaics (production of solar cells, disposal of cells).  The 2D coating would allow increased electricity production from a solar cell which could permit smaller solar cell installations to produce the required electricity generation and has the potential to increase the efficiency of existing installations.  As utility scale solar production requires significant amounts of land, increasing efficiency can reduce the land requirements and potentially allow smaller plots of land to be considered for utility scale production.  As solar panel efficiency decreases as temperature rises, the coating could sufficiently cool cells to allow them to be utilized effectively in warmer climates.  This is particularly important since the highest electricity usage in the United States occurs during the hot summer months.  The most expensive electricity, and typically the dirtiest and least efficient (e.g., combustion turbines) is used to meet that summer peak load.  This coating has the potential to increase the electricity produced during those peak times thus mitigating the environmental impacts of the generation used to meet the peak loads.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/20/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Volker J Sorger"
