 "awd_abstract_narration": "ETR Associates and the College of Charleston will conduct a collaborative research project that is designed to increase diversity in computer science by exploring whether boot camps build students' adaptive expertise and how the actual preparation aligns with computing workforce expectations for knowledge and competencies. The study will be conducted in Silicon Valley in California and Silicon Harbor in South Carolina and will yield (1) models of the attributes of effective software developers from the perspective of universities, coding boot campus, and software development companies; (2) a conceptual framework of how software development workforce needs align with training preparation, and how variations in the preparation of adaptive expertise can inform efforts to broaden participation; and (3) longitudinal case studies of students from underrepresented groups from the two types of training settings. The results will inform researchers, educators, and employers about the knowledge and coursework necessary to develop adaptive software developers who are prepared for the computer science workforce.\r\n\r\nThe researchers will use a three-phase mixed-methods approach to investigate the following research questions: (1) What kinds of software development learning opportunities are offered by undergraduate programs? What kinds are offered at coding boot camps? (2) How well do the different training settings align with regional software development industry needs? and (3) What kinds of learners are attracted to the different learning opportunities and why?  They will triangulate the findings across multiple data sources, follow a tested process for developing a conceptual framework, and use a rigorous set of procedures for analysis. Data will include surveys, interviews, and focus groups.  \r\n\r\nThis project is supported by NSF's EHR Core Research (ECR) program. The ECR program emphasizes fundamental STEM education research that generates foundational knowledge in three thematic areas: STEM learning and learning environments, broadening participation, and STEM workforce development.",

The research relied upon the theoretical lenses of Adaptive Expertise and Preparation for Future Learning to better understand how learners within each community made the transition from school to workforce. The researchers were also committed to understanding to what degree each program type encouraged and contributed to increasing diversity in the field in terms of gender, race/ ethnicity, and socio-economic background.   This research contributes to the development and understanding of post-secondary computing education programs, which are increasingly essential for the growing needs of the software development and computer science industries.\n\nSurveys and interviews were conducted with 49 students from both colleges and bootcamps, 18 bootcamp instructors, and 13 university instructors (all located in the southeast United States).  National interviews also took place through a total of 3 industry focus groups and 4 one-on-one interviews with industry managers/ directors.

(5) To what extent do students (at both camp and college) self-report having the opportunity to develop components of adaptive expertise? and (6) To what extent each learning environment fosters metacognition and knowledge transfer characteristic of ?adaptive? expertise? \n\nFindings support Course Report?s annual national survey pointing towards the significant age and work experience difference between CS undergraduates and code camp graduates; namely, bootcamp students were older and had more work and educational experience.  Findings however also indicate that these two populations do not perceive their learning styles as being different in terms of how they receive information, process such information, and apply such information through practice and revision.  In terms of the educational environment characteristic of each program, coding bootcamp students reported their programs were much more ?hands on? from the start and that the curriculum was consistently grounded in peer-to-peer collaboration and timely feedback from the onset; undergraduates meanwhile reported that given the longer duration of their respective programs (i.e., 4 years versus 10-16 weeks) meant they had a greater variation of tasks and increased opportunities for knowledge-transfer.  It is interesting to note that, in interviews, bootcamp participants seemed to place more value on group work than the undergraduates.  Additional findings include that the presence of industry mentors collaborating with students is more prevalent within coding bootcamps than within university CS programs; coding bootcamp students often have had some form of training in database management, website development, programming, software development, game creation, CS theory, and/or computer programming languages prior to enrollment in the program; and there is a growing number of non-majors who take computing courses in colleges/ universities.\n\nThis project impacts computer science education by helping to understand how or whether university CS programs are preparing adaptive experts ready for future learning more effectively than intensive training grounds modeled on the workplace such as coding boot camps.

Despite marginally higher percentages of females in the code camp environment, what was also clear from the research is that code camps overwhelmingly attract college graduates who are searching for an alternative (or augmented) career pathway.  This is significant because while code camps are occasionally portrayed as an alternative to a four-year degree, the research here suggests quite the opposite: that code camps are, in fact, more often an addendum to an existing college degree.  This will have future social justice implications, as various schooling and training sources attract very different student populations.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/21/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: James F Bowring"
