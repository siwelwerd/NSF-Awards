 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project focuses on a Comparison and Explanation of Multiple Strategies (CEMS) approach for Algebra I. The instructional approach focuses on having students compare strategies and explain their thinking. The investigators will modify the current materials, the instructional approach, and the professional development approach based on prior research. The curriculum development will include supplementary materials for linear equations, systems of equations, quadratics and factoring, and graphing. These are core concepts for Algebra I courses nationwide. The goal of the proposed work is to first streamline the materials and improve the resources available for. They will also focus on the central role of explanation and discussion in the learning process. The research will focus on how teachers incorporate comparison, explanation and discussion into their teaching, how this impacts students' algebra knowledge, and how effective the approach is relative to business-as-usual instruction. The results of the research will inform teaching and learning for a central course in the mathematics curriculum since it is foundational to students' later mathematics learning. The approach also examines the entire classroom system including both students' knowledge and learning and teachers' development and implementation. This project is supported by NSF's EHR Core Research (ECR) program. The ECR program emphasizes fundamental STEM education research that generates foundational knowledge in the field.\r\n\r\nThe research will first refine the CEMS Algebra materials and then document the feasibility of their implementation and the effects on student learning. The project takes a holistic approach by incorporating materials for teaching, professional development, and the study of teaching practice. The work will expand theories of algebra learning to include both conceptual and procedural learning. It will include detailed analysis about fidelity of implementation to understand how instructional differences influence students' knowledge. The first phase of the study (refining the materials) includes implementation in classrooms, teacher professional development, collection of lesson videos, and the development of student assessments for each unit. The second phase of the study compares the effects of the treatment to the business-as-usual with one district. The teachers from year 1 will serve as the treatment group in year 2 and a comparison group of teachers will be selected. Data collection and analysis will focus on fidelity of implementation and assessments of students' learning. Year 3 will be similar to year 2 but expand to a second school district and include more teachers.",
