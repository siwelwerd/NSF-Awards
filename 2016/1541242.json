 "awd_abstract_narration": "Lamar University is introducing a Science DMZ designed to efficiently achieve higher levels of performance, reliability and predictability for critical STEM science research projects and address next generation big data research needs.  The proposed cyber infrastructure provides connectivity to state and national high performance computing facilities, including those supported through the NSF/XSEDE program, from multiple research locations across campus.  Lamar University faculty research includes, but is not limited to, biology, chemistry, environmental science, electronic systems, biomedical diagnostics, natural disasters, engineering, and high performance computing and data analysis. \r\n\r\nThe dedicated Science DMZ provides transformative capability for both research and educational programs by interconnecting research intensive areas on campus to one another through a 10G fiber backbone while removing obstacles to efficient data flows between research laboratories and external collaborative computational and analytical facilities.  The new design provides multiple 10Gbps-routed ports, DMZ switches for link consolidation and aggregation, a high performance data transfer node, and a Perfsonar node for performance monitoring and testing.  In addition, the optical fiber network is upgraded to single-mode fiber connections for research-intensive areas along with distribution and access layer switching to provide 10G capacity.\r\n\r\nThe new network also provides broader impact benefits to graduate and undergraduate students by incorporating project design and operation into classroom lecture, student engagement in intensive computational and data driven research and independent student research efforts.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe cyberinfrastructure upgrade accomplished through the CC*DNI Networking Infrastructure grant enhanced network capacity for Lamar University and is essential in transforming Lamar University's research culture to include big data and to meet current and anticipated research needs.  The upgrades introduced a Science DMZ, upgraded campus network switching and fiber, and enabled high speed connections up to 10Gbps to upstream entities including LEARN, Internet 2, SETG, XSEDE, GENI and others, thus permitting researchers to efficiently access and transfer data necessary to the University's multi-disciplinary data-intensive research for the first time.  In addition, increases in bandwidth will continue to impact research for graduate and undergraduate students through utilization within classroom and independent research projects.  New faculty recruitments will have improved cyberinfrastructure with which to conduct research and collaborate with external research partners and will allow research and educational pursuits to more fully utilize connectivity to regional and national optical networks, specifically Lonestar Education and Research Network (LEARN) and Internet2.  The improvements to Lamar's networking infrastructure have led to further cyberinfrastructure improvements including high performance computing and the improved network design benefits all campus activities by providing important additional network capacity and throughput.  Implementation of the Science DMZ included enhanced organizational structures including a Science DMZ / research technology committee that will promote collaboration and efficiency, thereby enhancing the overall generation of knowledge that results form Lamar research programs.  Professional development opportunities provided technology staff as well as researchers with new knowledge and skills in the implementation and management of shared-service research technology. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/01/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Priscilla Parsons"
