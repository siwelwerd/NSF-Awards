 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project  is to enable smaller chargers, power factor convertors and switches in applications ranging from small applications such as implanted pace-makers, mobile-phones, computer to large applications such as automobile, machinery to very large applications such as ships, locomotives, traditional and renewable energy power plants. While the impact of the power switching product to be developed using this technology in this phase II project is broad, the use of this thin crystalline technology can have even broader impact across all modern semiconductor devices such as LED, PV, flexible CMOS and passive devices.  The project will potentially enable thin form-factor packages in this broad range of power electronics applications.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses challenges to further scaling of power MOSFETs which are one of the key building blocks of the electronic revolution we have witnessed over the last few decades. While the feature size of transistors has been constantly shrinking, the substrate thickness has been increasing. These substrates are currently mechanically thinned to minimize the negative impact of this increased thickness on performance and form-factor. There are significant challenges to continue this trend and the thin crystalline technology and device architecture proposed here can enable continued scaling of device metrics over the next decade with favorable cost structures.  This effort will focus on the following specific technical challenges to bring it to market. (1) Develop power MOSFETs with improved switching characteristics using the thin crystalline technology (2) Develop the process technology on large area wafers used in current production lines (3) Develop the low-form factor package using the metallization features of thin-crystalline exfoliated technology (4) Characterize the device for performance and insertion into high volume de-risk (5) Develop a roadmap for a family of products that is sustainable over a decade to justify significant manufacturing investment to bring this technology to market.",

The thin crystalline technology proposed by AND Inc. addresses all these concerns as the wafer is not ground and polished as is currently practiced by the industry.\n\nThin wafers are required across most modern semiconductor devices but the need is most acutely felt in the Power MOSFETs and IGBTs device roadmap. These devices are ubiquitous in modern electronics systems and have a roadmap that requires thinner wafers as shown in Figure 1. The industry roadmap for performance gains in MOSFET is shown in Figure 1(a) and the roadmap for IGBTs is shown in Figure 1(b).  AND Inc. has developed and demonstrated the world?s first packaged Power MOSFET transistor without grinding and polishing from an 8\" wafer as part of this phase 1 proposal. \n\nA process of exfoliation was used to peel off the prefabricated power device from semi-processed power MOSFET wafers.  The details of the traditional process of formation of vertical power MOSFETs is not discussed here.  The substrate beyond the drift region serves no useful purpose other than as a mechanical support during process and is a parasitic component that needs to be eliminated.  During this phase 1 effort the Si wafers with complete front side processing were exfoliated using AND Inc. technology as proposed and completed into thin crystalline power MOSFETs with additional processing including drain contact formation and source and gate isolation. \n\n \n\nSeveral short flow experiments were completed as part of the objectives:\n\nExfoliation of blanket wafers to target the appropriate thickness of silicon exfoliated in the power devices.\nDesign and process variations to remove the metal on the foils to isolate the gate and source regions.\nMetal stack variations to understand the process variations that impacted the exfoliation and isolation process.\nWafer handling short flow experiments to improve the thin wafer handling and down-select to one handling process.\nCost model updates to incorporate all the variables that can impact business decisions in transitioning to this process and device architecture.\n\n\n \n\nData and learning from these short flows were used to optimize the fabrication of functional devices.  The thin crystalline power MOSFET foils were singulated with a laser then bonded onto a package to form the drain contact.  Subsequently the gate and source contacts were wire bonded to the front to form external leads.  Figure 2 shows the final packaged device, which is the world?s first 30&micro;m thin crystalline packaged power MOSFET device without any back-grinding.  Using lasers to singulate finished products is an advantage enabled by the thin silicon and metal backing that are part of our process.  \n\n \n\nThe following key results were accomplished in this Phase 1 project.\n\nFirst ~30 micron power MOSFET devices were fabricated from 8\"wafers without grinding away the substrate.\nFirst isolation of metal used in exfoliation to form gate and source contact pads of power devices was demonstrated\nDemonstration of thin device handling through the entire backend process and packaging.\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/09/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Leo Mathew"
