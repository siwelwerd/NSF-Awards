 "awd_abstract_narration": "The atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) spans the lowest few hundred meters of the earth's atmosphere and intensively exchanges mass (e.g., moisture), momentum, and heat with the underlying surface.  Wind fields in this turbulent layer play major roles in a wide range of industrial (e.g., stack gas dispersion, wind energy generation), biological (e.g., evapotranspiration, pollen transport, migrations of birds and insects), and natural (e.g., soil erosion, transport, and deposition) activities and processes.  Mesoscale models in conjunction with robust planetary boundary layer (PBL) schemes are needed to reliably capture the dynamical evolution of the ABL. At present, rigorous benchmarks for the validation of PBL schemes do not exist in the literature.  In this EAGER project, the project will research a novel scaling-based benchmarking approach based on the extended self-similarity (ESS) framework. The study has roots in the classical turbulence literature and it is expected to be quasi-universal in nature.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:\r\nThe salient features of this EAGER project are: (i) creation of an unparalleled simulated wind database using a suite of PBL schemes; and (ii) identification of the strengths and weaknesses of various PBL schemes utilizing the ESS framework. This research will not only improve the ability of contemporary mesoscale models to better capture the dynamics of wind fields, it will also make fundamental contributions to the field of classical turbulence.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:\r\nThrough this EAGER project, a post-doctoral research associate will gain expertise in mesoscale modeling, and be exposed to the emerging field of scaling laws and self-similar processes.  The findings from this project will be disseminated to the broad audience via peer reviewed publications, conference presentations and seminars.",
