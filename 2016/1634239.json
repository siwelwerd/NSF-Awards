 "awd_abstract_narration": "Extensive research has shown that soils are major sources and sinks of trace gases that play important roles in atmospheric chemistry and global climate regimes.  However, most of this research has focused on forest, grassland and cultivated soils that largely experience moderate conditions (e.g., temperature and precipitation).  Arid and semi-arid soils, which account for about one-third of total global land area, have received relatively little attention.  Saline soils, which account for an area larger than France, and constitute about 18% of total agricultural land area, have been also been overlooked.  Nonetheless, results of recent work with arid and saline soils indicates that they may contribute significantly to regional-scale to global budgets of carbon monoxide (CO), a trace gas that has critical regulatory functions in the atmosphere.  Research proposed here will include comparative studies of CO cycling in saline and arid soils in Utah, California and Oklahoma, analyses of the capacity of arid and saline soils to remove CO from the atmosphere, and analyses of the coupling between CO removal and production within the soil matrix.  The results, which will be complemented by parallel studies of microbial communities and CO-oxidizing microbes, will provide a comprehensive understanding of CO biogeochemistry for a major category of Earth's soils. \r\n\r\nWork proposed here will involve multiple tasks.  The extent of coupling between Mo-dependent CO oxidation and anoxic CO production, and the roles of each in hypersaline CO cycling will be addressed through flux studies and soil and sediment incubations in laboratory experiments designed to probe rates of oxidation and production as well as the organisms involved.  New insights about the range of conditions that support CO oxidation will be derived from analyses of activity across a wide range of extremes in water availability; both ex situ and bench-top analyses of soils and sediments will be used to assess limits of CO oxidation.   The importance of solute stresses versus matric potential stresses will be determined by comparisons of saline and arid systems across a range of similar water potentials.  Finally, genomic data from new and existing CO-oxidizing isolates will be used to establish an evolutionary history for Mo-dependent CO oxidation and a geobiological context for its origin. \r\n\r\nThis project will involve graduate and undergraduate students in several stages of the project. Students of Westminster College and University of Utah will be involved with field research, and receive training on biogeochemistry and microbial diversity analysis. In addition, students from the \"Sequence the Campus\" program of the Louisiana State University will be involved in the project. The PI will make additional efforts to recruit under-represented students through LSU's EnvironMentors Chapter.",
