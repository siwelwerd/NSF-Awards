 "awd_abstract_narration": "Because of the rise in global demand for agricultural commodities, large land areas continue to be converted from smallholder subsistence crop production to plantation-based production of highly remunerative immediate-return crops, such as cacao, palm oil, cassava, eucalyptus and rubber. Critics claim that this transformation represents a new era of enclosures and constitutes a \"global land grab,\" which has negative effects on social equity and environmental sustainability. Advocates acknowledge the impacts of the changes but argue in turn that agricultural commodity production represents the most efficient use of the resource base in many developing countries, and their best hope for economic modernization. Social scientists who seek to understand the impacts of these transformations on rural people have likewise been divided. Many studies have focused on the economic marginalization that accompanies loss of land and the transition from mixed subsistence economies to dependence on wage labor. Yet some researchers have demonstrated that various indicators of well-being in fact improve as rural residents become more integrated with national markets. This award supports scientific research on this debate: Is agricultural conversion and restructuring good for local people or not? Because this process occurs throughout the world, including in the United States where it has been ongoing for over a century, it is important to have a better understanding of its consequences. \r\n\r\nThe research will use Cambodia as a manageable and appropriate test case; there, smallholder farmers have lost their traditional resource base and have been relegated to the in-between spaces at the edges of the new enclosures. Dr. Jonathan Padwe (University of Hawai'i at M\u00e2noa) will survey land-use patterns and well-being across a series of highland villages. He will collect data to inform both sides of the debate: fine-scaled study of land-holding, resource use, and social differentiation as well as data on nutrition, well-being, and household economy.  The study will make synchronic and diachronic measurements of the impact of new land regimes. Synchronic analysis involves the study of land use and well-being across a range of villages, from those that are directly affected to those that are indirectly affected. Diachronic analysis involves the comparative study of land use and well-being in a single village where ten-year longitudinal data are available. Findings from this research will contribute to our understanding of the impacts of the transition to plantation-based commodity production at a human scale, informing both theoretical debates and development policy on an issue of global importance.",

The forested upland region of northeast Cambodia provides a case study for the study of this question. This region has seen a succession of changing land-use regimes following the end of protracted civil conflict in the 1990s. Plantation agriculture has transformed the landscape as investors have promoted the production of \"boom crops\" including coffee, Eucalyptus, cashew and especially rubber (<em>Hevea brasiliensis</em>).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The transition to plantation agriculture is generally understood to negatively affect local populations, who are likely to lose control of land. Critics writing about food sovereignty and the \"peasant way\" have pointed to the many disadvantages local populations face in such situaitons. Yet proponents of \"development\" have suggested that capital-intensive transitions such as this hold out the promise of significant benefits for local populations, including access to schooling, medical services, and economic opportunity may accompany agrarian transformations.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This project set out to test these competing claims. Using information about historical land-holding, and studies undertaken by the PI previously which demonstrated the kinds of dietary and agricultural diversity residents of the highlands traditionally enjoyed, the research sought to show what was changing over time for highland villages exposed to the impacts of large-scale plantation agriculture. The study used interviews, the mapping of land-holdings, and the recording of food consumption diaries to generate data with which to analyse these changes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The results of the study show that the effects of conversion to plantation agriculture, at least as they have occurred in this part of mainland Southeast Asia, are mixed and do not bear out either the worst-case scenarious suggested by the most ardent critics of plantation agriculture, nor the \"rising tide floats all boats\" optimism of development boosters. Rather, those within highland villages who had the most economic or political power were able to take advantage of some of the opportunities made available by the new economy, while those who were already most vulnerable within highland villages were made more precarious as the changes took hold. The result was a rapid stratification of village society. One important dimension of this change was the breakdown of traditional forms of reciprocal aid that villagers have traditionally used to mitigate the variability in yields and the insecurity that some members of society traditionally faced in a place where rice and other crop shortfalls are frequent occurrences. However, while the transition to a plantation landscape has exposed some to increasing vulnerability, highlanders have been able to fare relatively well compared to recent migrants from the lowlands. Highland farmers have, for instance, been able to hire migrant laborers to work on their farms, and have been able to grow agricultural commodity crops like cashew, cassava, and rubber on a small scale. They have thus been able to rapidly adjust their extensive farming systems and to integrate them into the market economy in ways that allow them to \"piggyback\" off of the emerging commodities production regimes taking hold. The presence of automobiles, televisions, motorcycles, refrigerators, generators, and other markers of \"modern\" wealth, which highland farmers have embraced, demonstrate the extent to which some successful households have been able to generate wealth from their landholdings.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The study thus has produced results that run contrary to the expectations of a number of researchers as well as to portrayals by international media and by non-governmental organizations and advocacy groups that tend to portray the agrarian frontier now taking hold in Cambodia as an entirely one-way street. Clearly, highland people are themselves important actors on this frontier, and while they face numerous challenges relating to their involvement, the picture that emerges is far more complex than some of the loudest voices would allow for.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 05/27/2020<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Jonathan&nbsp;E&nbsp;Padwe</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1560785/1560785_10416012_1590615406924_aa_dsc_3653--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1560785/1560785_10416012_1590615406924_aa_dsc_3653--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Harvesting upland rice\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1560785/1560785_10416012_1590615406924_aa_dsc_3653--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Harvesting upland rice\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A man harvests upland rice in northeast Cambodia.
