 "awd_abstract_narration": "For the past decade, the La Selva Canopy Tower Network, a five-tower canopy-access system equipped with electricity, connectivity through fiber-optics and WiFi connection, and a range of meteorological and biogeophysical sensors, has supported a wide range of research at La Selva Research Station (http://www.ots.ac.cr/), a lowland wet tropical forest in Costa Rica owned and operated by the Organization for Tropical Studies (OTS). La Selva research on forest dynamics and gas exchange, much of which has been carried out using these canopy towers, has played a leadership role in helping understand the significance of carbon dynamics in tropical forests under changing climatic conditions. The La Selva Canopy Tower Network is an ideal site for integrated flux monitoring of a tropical rainforest, given that is has been intensively studied with long-term datasets documenting ecological and ecosystem dynamics, and a wide range of ongoing and planned research projects using the towers. The second-generation tower network to be deployed under this award will provide continuous data on ecosystem fluxes and concurrent detailed canopy and soil environmental conditions valuable for a broad range of data analysis, synthesis, and modelling efforts. These towers already provide a valuable platform for experiential learning for both graduate and undergraduate students. Each year, La Selva hosts more than 10,000 days of student visitation to the station. OTS courses bring approximately 150 undergraduates and 150 graduate students to La Selva to learn how to conduct their own research. An important component of the OTS education programs is its emphasis on recruiting and advancing students underrepresented in the STEM disciplines. Over the last five years, 24% of all U.S. undergraduates in the OTS education programs are from under-represented groups in the STEM disciplines. Additionally, more than 120 faculty-led academic groups from the US, Europe, and Costa Rica visit the station each year. Some courses, especially those run by OTS, encourage students to conduct short-term projects using the towers and their sensors. OTS also runs summer Research Experiences for Undergraduates comprised of more than 80% minority students. These students spend 10 weeks at the station and have the opportunity to conduct their summer research using the tower network.\r\n\r\nThe canopy tower network had a recent setback caused by a treefall that affected the functionality of three towers. OTS is in the process of dismantling and re-establishing the fallen towers. While disruptive, this accident has also presented an opportunity to address the limitations of the previous system and rebuild the network of canopy towers and sensors to create a state-of-the-art ecosystem flux and bio-meteorology (biomet) monitoring system that can significantly expand the research opportunities of the tower network. In addition, a redesign of the tower walkway and installation of updated safety equipment will allow the new canopy tower network to be safer and less vulnerable to future disruptions. Specifically, as the three damaged towers are resurrected, we propose to develop a second-generation canopy tower system by adding the following flux-biomet instrumentation and safety features: (1) Eddy covariance system including a sonic anemometer, CO2-H2O analyzer, and canopy CO2-H2O profile system in order to continuously measure ecosystem fluxes of carbon, water and energy; (2) Canopy monitoring sensors for continuous measurements of canopy air humidity and temperature including four component net radiometers and PAR sensors; (3) Soil monitoring sensors for continuous measurements of soil CO2 and O2 concentration, moisture, and temperature; (4) Additional tower section to increase the height of two the tower to 50 meters (the height of the tallest canopy trees in the area); (5) Addition of mid-canopy walkway to increase access to new canopy levels; (6) Additional safety features including break-away bolts and anchors; and (7) Improved connectivity in WiFi and fiber-optic systems to increase the remote-operability of data collection and management. The new flux-biomet monitoring system combined with the improved and more robust tower infrastructure thus provide an integrated upgrade in the facilities for research at La Selva that will have broad use for existing and new research programs in tropical ecology and ecosystem science. The towers will also significantly expand the training experience and increase the safety of US and Latin American students using the towers.",
