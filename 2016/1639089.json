Funds will be used primarily to support participants from the USA, with any residual funds used to support attendees from underdeveloped countries.  The biennial EM induction workshops, which are sponsored by Division VI of the International Union of Geomagnetism and Aeronomy (IAGA), represent the only international meetings dedicated specifically to EM geophysical research. For over 40 years these meetings have provided the principal venue for presentation and discussion of methodological advances, including instrumentation, data processing, inversion, and interpretation practice. The meeting brings together researchers from around the world (academia and industry) who share a common interest in using EM methods for imaging the Earth to address both applied and basic research questions.\r\n\r\nThe workshop will benefit the US EM induction community, by increasing participation of students and early career researchers from the US, by helping US researchers to develop the international contacts that will ultimately lead to collaborative projects around the world, and by promoting international exchange of software, data, and results.",

This is likely to pay important dividends down the road with regard to human resources in this important but esoteric geophysical specialty.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/13/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Gary D Egbert"
