 "awd_abstract_narration": "This interdisciplinary research project will examine whether social and geographical disparities exist during the four phrases of emergency management (mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery).  The investigators will use multiple perspectives and scales to address the research questions, including analysis at the community, individual, and organizational scales.  Findings from this project will provide valuable insights into the interplay among regional disparities, individual social networks and behavior, and governmental/organizational policies.  This project will expand knowledge of whether social media use may serve to overcome or further deepen the social and geographical disparities in each phase of emergency management.  The project will enhance understanding of how to conduct efficient mining of social media data in order to produce useful and valid scientific information, thereby advancing both social science and information science research by developing and testing algorithms that can be used to mine noisy and imperfect data from sources like Twitter.  The knowledge gained from this project will help develop strategies to reduce disparities, create effective social media campaigns and emergency management outreach, and promote resilience to disasters.  The methods used in this project will be applicable to study other disasters in other regions.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding the sources, patterns, and consequences of social and geographical disparities in disaster resilience is critical to building long-term resilient, healthy, and sustainable communities.  Traditional resilience analysis has been confined mostly to the use of static data collected at scheduled intervals.  With the advent of the \"Big Data\" era, real-time human response data extracted from social media could provide new opportunities for studying disparities in disaster resilience.  The investigators will compare Twitter data from two events, Hurricane Isaac and Hurricane Sandy, both of which occurred in 2012.  They will pursue four interrelated research components:  (1) development of data-mining algorithms for the evaluation and visualization of Twitter data; (2) analysis of social media and resilience disparities at the community (zip-code) level across the emergency management cycle; (3) an online survey of Twitter and non-Twitter users to understand effects of social media use on individual resilience, social networks, social support, and social disparities; and (4) analysis of bi-directional communication among residents and governmental and non-governmental organizations throughout each event cycle.  Through an investigation of the Twitter data before, during, and after the hurricanes coupled with analysis of online surveys, the researchers will be able to address a set of core research questions: (1) Are there distinct geographical and social disparities in the use of social media in disaster resilience?  (2) What are the sources and consequences of such disparities?  (3) How do these disparities vary across the four phases of the disaster cycle?  (4) How do these disparities affect resilience?  (5) How can social media data be used to improve resilience?  This project is supported through the NSF Interdisciplinary Behavioral and Social Sciences Research (IBSS) competition.",

The intellectual merits of the project are:</p>\n<p>(1) &nbsp;The project examines the disaster resilience problem using multiple perspectives and scales including analysis at the community scale (spatial), individual scale (sociological), and organizational scale (political). Findings from this project have provided better insights into the interplay between regional disparities, individual social networks and behaviors, and governmental/organizational policies. For example, our analyses of Twitter use data during Hurricanes Isaac and Sandy (occurred in 2012) have consistently pointed to the conclusion that communities with higher disaster-related Twitter use had better social and geographical conditions. Socially vulnerable communities were digitally left behind in disaster-related social responses. In addition, our survey results of Twitter users during Hurricane Harvey (occurred in 2017) show that those requesting rescue on Twitter were better educated, employed, and homeowners. These results imply that enabling adequate use of social media or similar digital means of communication by vulnerable communities should help increase their resilience to future disasters.</p>\n<p>(2) &nbsp;The project evaluates how unique insights extracted from social media can contribute to an understanding of disparities, resilient community building, and human responses in the four phases of emergency management (preparedness, response, recovery, mitigation). For example, our survey of organizations highlights the obstacles to social media use in emergency management. First responders and emergency organizations were most concerned about the unknown accuracy of information on social media, followed by concerns on insufficient human resources, anonymity of user, issues of infrastructure or connectivity, user-friendliness of social media tools for emergency management use, language and cultural barriers, and rumor control and information accuracy. These results imply the following: (i) Organizations could utilize the mitigation phase to improve bi-directional communications with communities to increase social capital and hazard awareness and literacy. (ii) Individuals should take the opportunity to get familiar with the resources, hashtags, or templates provided by organizations to help speed up the response and recovery. (iii) Social media companies like Twitter could help by making it easier for the users to input necessary information to enable more efficient communication during disasters. All three sectors have expressed serious concerns of the spread of false or malicious news, uneven representation of the users, and privacy and confidentiality. (iv) Thus, the task for researchers is to find the best approach to detect false news, remove algorithm bias, build data and tools infrastructure to generate more and better research, and establish standards and criteria to help promote scientific repeatability and reliability of research results.</p>\n<p>(3)&nbsp; The project advances both social science and information science by developing and testing algorithms that can be used to mine imperfect data such as Twitter data and detect false news. First, we developed a deep learning-based framework to classify disaster-related tweets and studied the effects of various deep-learning architectures and input embedding techniques on the classification accuracy. We found that the convolutional neural network-based model using our word2vec-based embedding had the highest classification accuracy. Second, we developed a fake news detection model based on the Recurrent Neural Network method. To overcome the limitations of the relatively small number of disaster-related fake news (80 cases), we applied a transfer learning approach to pre-train our model using an existing large fake news dataset that covers diverse topics and then fine-tune the model with our disaster-related fake news data set. This approach led to a higher accuracy (91%) in detecting the fake news.</p>\n<p>The broader impacts of the project are: (i) Through this project, we established the LSU ICAR research group to foster interdisciplinary research on disaster resilience analysis. ICAR stands for Interdisciplinary Computation &amp; Analysis of Resilience. The project website contains information on the project and sample datasets available for download, along with a GIS story map of Twitter activities during the three hurricanes (Sandy, Isaac, and Harvey). (ii) The website also contains information on subsequent NSF-funded projects that have leveraged some of the resources of this project. (iii) We established a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Virginia Tech (Digital Library Research Lab) for Twitter data sharing and collaboration. (iv) The project mentored at least nine postdocs/PhD students and three MS students, which has helped increase their research experience in a multidisciplinary collaborative setting. Some of the graduates have moved on as faculty members at other universities or program managers at resource management agencies.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/13/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Nina&nbsp;S&nbsp;Lam</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1620451/1620451_10446190_1639432552574_Outcome-Figure1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1620451/1620451_10446190_1639432552574_Outcome-Figure1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1 - Sandy tweets\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1620451/1620451_10446190_1639432552574_Outcome-Figure1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1 - Sandy tweets\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Global trend of hourly and daily tweet ratio (# Sandy tweets/# background tweets) and Sentiment indexes during Hurricane Sandy which hit the Northeast USA in October 2012</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Lei Zou, Nina Lam, Heng Cai, and Yi Qiang in Annals of the American Association of Geographers</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Nina&nbsp;S&nbsp;Lam</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 1 - Sandy tweets</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1620451/1620451_10446190_1639434634423_Outcome-Figure2-v2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1620451/1620451_10446190_1639434634423_Outcome-Figure2-v2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 2 - Sandy tweets map\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1620451/1620451_10446190_1639434634423_Outcome-Figure2-v2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 2 - Sandy tweets map\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">County-level tweet ratios (# Sandy tweets/# background tweets)  during Hurricane Sandy in the United States.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Lei Zou, Nina Lam, Heng Cai, and Yi Qiang in Annals of the American Association of Geographers</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Nina&nbsp;S&nbsp;Lam</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 2 - Sandy tweets map</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1620451/1620451_10446190_1639434937049_Outcome-Figure3--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1620451/1620451_10446190_1639434937049_Outcome-Figure3--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 3 - The RIM framework\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1620451/1620451_10446190_1639434937049_Outcome-Figure3--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 3 - The RIM framework\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The Resilience Inference Measurement (RIM) framework was used to assess the level of community resilience by county for the Hurricane Isaac study.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Kejin Wang, Nina Lam, Lei Zou, and Volodymyr Mihunov in ISPRS International Journal of Geo-Information</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Nina&nbsp;S&nbsp;Lam</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 3 - The RIM framework</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1620451/1620451_10446190_1639435296091_Outcome-Figure4--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1620451/1620451_10446190_1639435296091_Outcome-Figure4--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 4 - Isaac tweets map\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1620451/1620451_10446190_1639435296091_Outcome-Figure4--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 4 - Isaac tweets map\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Counties in Louisiana and Mississippi affected by Hurricane Isaac: (a) hazard threat level (average wind speed in knots); (b) damage per capita; (c) recovery (as represented by population growth rate for 2010-2013; and (d) the RIM scores.
