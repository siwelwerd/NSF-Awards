 "awd_abstract_narration": "NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:\r\n\r\nThe project \"NSF Workshop: Frontiers in Polymer Science and Engineering\" will examine outstanding new opportunities for research and education at the forefront of the field of polymer science and polymeric materials. This class of materials plays a central role in innumerable items of commerce that directly affect the US economy, the daily lives, and the health and welfare of our entire population. The workshop will draw together approximately 70 scientists, engineers, and educators from around the nation, working in universities, companies, and national laboratories, and representing a broad diversity of areas of expertise. A central goal is to identify the most promising opportunities and critical areas for future investment in the research necessary to sustain national leadership in the science and technology that underpins this vital and multidisciplinary field. Workshop participants, representing a broadly diverse group of researchers and educators from around the nation, will collectively shape a vision for future research and education that will be captured in a comprehensive report, to be widely disseminated to the broader community and to policy makers and administrators across the country. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL SUMMARY:\r\n\r\nThis workshop will address a comprehensive set of topics aimed at identifying exciting and promising future opportunities across the interdisciplinary field of polymer science and engineering. It will be a decadal-type study across the horizon of the field, following up on its predecessor, the 2007 NSF Workshop on Interdisciplinary Globally-Leading Polymer Science and Engineering.  Latest developments associated with advancing state-of-the-art experimental, theoretical, and computational methods will be examined with the goal of identifying the most important challenges, opportunities, and emerging areas associated with polymer design and synthesis, molecular and structural characterization, a wide range of material properties, processing, and the impact of macromolecules on technology and society, including on related fields that span other areas of science and technology. The two-day workshop will begin with a set of plenary lectures designed to help shape detailed discussions in subsequent break-out sessions, each involving a group drawn from a diverse spectrum of participants. Collective inputs from each breakout session, along with accompanying assessments of educational and related opportunities, will be formed into a draft executive summary by the organizing committee immediately following the workshop. A comprehensive report will be prepared by the organizing committee detailing the findings and conclusions of the workshop. This report will be widely disseminated and posted on a public website. A summary of the report, highlighting the most important findings, will be submitted for publication in a leading polymer journal.",

The world generates more than 300 million metric tons of synthetic polymers annually, with a market value in excess of $400B, and this figure will grow in the foreseeable future. In the course of her life, a newborn child will be clothed in fabrics made of polymers; transported in vehicles increasingly reliant on advanced composites and elastomers; raised on food kept safe, sanitary, and marketable through inexpensive plastic packaging; learn on computers manufactured using and containing a plethora of polymeric components; drink water purified through advanced polymer-based membrane technology; and take medicines delivered with the aid of polymer-based excipients. Virtually all aspects of our lives are affected by advances in polymer science and engineering; those advances continue to accelerate. An NSF-sponsored workshop, &ldquo;Frontiers in Polymer Science and Engineering&rdquo;, was held on August 17 and 18, 2016 in Arlington, VA, to review the state of knowledge, to explore research opportunities and challenges, to gauge related infrastructure, and to assess educational needs. The workshop was attended by invited workshop participants drawn from over 50 universities, companies, and National Laboratories. Working groups met and addressed issues related to six separate topics: (1) Societal Needs, (2) Macromolecular Synthesis, (3) Hierarchical Structures at Multiple Length and Energy Scales, (4) Integrated Measurement, Analysis, and Prediction, (5) Advancing Performance, and (6) Partnerships: Academia, Industry, and Government. Workshop participants collectively considered the challenges in education and the needs and opportunities associated with a diverse work force and an informed public. A comprehensive report was prepared and issued in June of 2017, which reviews the state of knowledge and technology of this interdisciplinary field. It assesses the challenges of and opportunities for advancing our basic understanding of macromolecular materials with the goal of identifying promising new avenues for advancement. A host of noteworthy themes emerged from this study including the following: (<em>i</em>) The need to connect the development of new polymeric materials with the pursuit of synthesis, structural control, and dynamic response across many length scales, from nanometers to meters; (<em>ii</em>) general access to state-of-the art measurement tools, including x-ray and neutron scattering facilities at national laboratories and university-based instrumentation, such as electron microscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance and advanced mechanical testing equipment; (<em>iii</em>) application of theory, and mathematically based modeling, across all aspects of polymer science and engineering; (<em>iv</em>) the development of new approaches for collaboration between academia and industry in order to maintain the fundamental knowledge base required for competitive innovation. In addition, the report highlights needs and opportunities to enhance the field through advances in education, broadening access to a more diverse workforce, and expanding public awareness The complete workshop report can be accessed at: <a href=\"https://z.umn.edu/nsfpolymerworkshop2016\"><strong>https://z.umn.edu/nsfpolymerworkshop2016</strong></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 03/15/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Frank&nbsp;S&nbsp;Bates</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImage\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation onePhoto\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1623946/1623946_10413420_1519924897421_0001frontcover2-03--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1623946/1623946_10413420_1519924897421_0001frontcover2-03--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Frontiers in Polymer Science and Engineering\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1623946/1623946_10413420_1519924897421_0001frontcover2-03--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Frontiers in Polymer Science and Engineering\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Cover of 2016 NSF Workshop Report</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Jeffrey M.
