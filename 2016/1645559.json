 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Cyberlearning and Future Learning Technologies Program funds efforts that will help envision the next generation of learning technologies and advance what we know about how people learn in technology-rich environments. Cyberlearning Capacity (CAP) Projects focus on expanding and strengthening the cyberlearning community and often include conferences, workshops, or short courses. This project focuses on a workshop exploring the application of data science to K-12 education. It is motivated by the importance that reasoning with data has in today's world.\r\n\r\nThe workshop is entitled Data Science, Learning and Youth: Connecting Research and Creating Frameworks. Its objective is to move the educational implications of Data Science to the forefront of conversations among the cyberlearning research community. A large number of undergraduate and post-graduate programs are presently focusing on imparting data skills and computational reasoning. This workshop will extend this focus to K-12 education. It will bring together established and emerging scholars interested in Data Science Education from fields including Learning Sciences, Human-Computer Interaction and Computer Science, Mathematics and Statistics Education, Science Education, and Community Engagement and Citizen Science, and practitioners from K-12 settings. This workshop will foster new interdisciplinary collaborations and expose researchers interested in Data Science Education to relevant communities, literatures, and projects. The short term goal is to enable these communities to synthesize emerging findings, frameworks, and theories and better understand what tools, activities, and environments can support Data Science literacy. Our long term goal is to foster the development of a unified research community interested in Data Science Education. Direct outcomes of the workshop will include concrete plans to produce articles and synthesis documents focused on Data Science Education during the year immediately following the workshop. These documents will speak to three broad and complementary audiences: researchers, through the proposal of a special issue of a scholarly journal; practitioners, through two practitioner-oriented articles focusing on mathematics and science education; and the broader Cyberlearning community, through an online Synthesis Statement to be hosted by the Center for Innovative Research in Cyberlearning (CIRCL) resource website.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Youth, Learning, and Data Science summit was held August 11-12, 2016 at the University of California, Berkeley. This small workshop was hosted by UC Berkeley's School of Information and Graduate School of Education. The summit brought together emerging and established scholars including 12 keynote presenters, 10 graduate students (5 local volunteers), and scholars from industry, museums, libraries, K-12 schools, community organizations, and university departments including Education, Computer Science, the Learning Sciences, Information Science, and more. All participants had done work in the emerging field of Data Science Education, with special focus on how youth learn with and about data. Data Science is a rich interdisciplinary area that requires synthesis across these communities. Many lines of work are reaching a point of maturity that befits sharing, synthesis, and agenda-setting for the future.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe organizers Victor Lee, Tapan Parikh, Joseph Polman, and Michelle Wilkerson designed an agenda with three goals. These were: (1) Facilitate new networks and collaborations that transcend traditional disciplinary boundaries, centered on Data Science Education Research; (2) Develop a shared understanding of the landscape of Data Science Education Research, and of open questions driving the field; and (3) Determine next steps for moving forward together as a community. Toward these goals, we asked keynote presenters and attendees to consider the questions: What makes data science education different? And, What does the general public need to know right now in order to be truly data literate? External evaluators Anthony Petrosino and John Park collaborated on the project. In their evaluation, Drs. Petrosino and Park reported that \"Well over 90% of the participants responded that the workshop provided a great amount of engagement and stimulation\"; and, \"...it is clear that the workshop participants found the workshop intellectually engaging, professionally useful, and a legitimate learning experience for 90% of the participants.\" A social network analysis of attendees conducted as part of the evaluation revealed that a majority of attendees did not know one another before the workshop. (Many, however, were familiar with others' names and affiliations.) After the conference, Petrosino and Park found that many attendees had made verbal promises to collaborate, or had met or planned to meet about new collaborations or studies underway. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are ongoing efforts to broadly disseminate findings, emergent themes, and next steps from the summit. These findings include a need to better understand how so-called ?open? datasets are shifting the landscape of statistics education. They include the need for students to develop flexibility with an ever-changing landscape of new tools and techniques for working with and analyzing data emerge constantly. And, most critically, they emphasize the need for researchers of Data Science Education to study how to the social, connected nature of modern life, which leaves \"data traces\" about learners, their communities, and their world, influences students' engagement with data. In June 2017, Wilkerson presented a preliminary synthesis report prepared in collaboration with Kathryn Lanouette, the graduate student assistant for the project. The synthesis appears in the proceedings of the Tenth International Forum for Statistical Reasoning, Thinking, and Literacy. The presentation was well received by the Statistics Education community, and Wilkerson and Lanouette are now refining that paper for submission to a general purpose education journal with a broader audience. Additionally, Wilkerson and Polman have proposed a special issue of the highly regarded Journal of the Learning Sciences to showcase major themes and empirical research shared at the summit. As of September 2017, this proposal has moved to the \"Major Revisions\" stage, and a call for proposals is currently being prepared in association with the special issue.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/03/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Michelle Wilkerson"
