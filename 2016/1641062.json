This award will support participation by early career scientists at a meeting called \"Interaction of Glaciers and Ice Sheets with the Ocean.\"  The symposium is organized under the auspices of the International Glaciological Society and the Forum for Research into Ice Shelf Processes and will be held at Scripps Institution of Oceanography in July 2016. \r\n\r\nThe mass balance of the Earth's land ice (ice sheets, ice caps, and glaciers) and the circulation of the adjacent oceans are strongly coupled through physical processes occurring at the interfaces between ice and ocean. Improved understanding of these processes on the fronts and bases of ice shelves, glacier tongues, and tidewater glaciers is essential to realistically represent the evolution of ice sheets and glaciers in a changing climate and to improve predictions of global ocean circulation and sea level change. The goals of this symposium are to: (i) assess the state of knowledge of ice-ocean interactions; and (ii) discuss what is needed for development of reliable, quantitative models of ice-sheet evolution. This award will support 20 young investigators (students, postdoctoral scholars, and early career scientists) to participate in this Symposium by giving plenary presentations or shorter talks.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis Award provided support for the International Glaciological Society/Forum for Research into Ice Sheet Processes International Symposium on Interactions of Ice Sheets and Glaciers with the Ocean. The Symposium was held at Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO) in La Jolla, from 10-15 July 2016, in the new Scripps Seaside Forum, an extraordinary, oceanfront conference center facility located in the heart of SIO, with a breathtaking view over the Pacific Ocean.\n\nThe theme for the symposium was \"Interaction of glaciers and ice sheets with the ocean\".  Ice-ocean interaction is a vital topic for cryospheric studies, since most of the mass loss from the ice sheets occurs in the floating parts.  The mass balance of the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets and the circulation of the adjacent oceans are strongly coupled through physical processes occurring at the ice-ocean interfaces at the fronts and bases of ice shelves and glacier tongues, and the termini of tidewater glaciers.  Improved understanding of these processes is essential so that they can be realistically represented in models of how ice sheets and glaciers would evolve in a changing climate, and to improve predictions of global ocean circulation and sea level change.  The goals of this symposium were to: (1) assess the state of our knowledge of ice-ocean interactions; and (2) discuss what is needed for development of reliable, quantitative models of ice sheet evolution.\n\nThe IGS Symposium was an enormous success, with 160 delegates from 14 countries.  An IGS report from the meeting is attached (published in the IGS newsletter \"ICE\").\n\nWe offered travel support (airfare, per diem and lodging) for the IGS Symposium; this opportunity was announced widely using listservs and advertised on the Symposium website.  We were able to support to 21 scientists, all early career scientists (students and postdocs).\n\nThere was a balance of ~$800 and we requested a No Cost Extension so that we can use these funds to also support one attendee to the IGS Symposium in Boulder, in August 2017. We used the funds to support Ms Lynn Kaluzienski of the University of Maine.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/05/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Helen A Fricker"
