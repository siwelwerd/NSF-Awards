 "awd_abstract_narration": "A goal of the Tribal Colleges and Universities Program (TCUP) is to increase the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) instructional and research capacities of specific institutions of higher education that serve the Nation's indigenous students.  Expanding the research capacity at these institutions expands the opportunities for students to pursue challenging, rewarding careers in STEM fields, provides for research studies in areas that may be locally relevant, and encourages a faculty community to look beyond the traditional classroom for intellectual and professional growth. This project aligns directly with that goal, and moreover will increase the body of knowledge in the field of environmental science in regions that directly impact quality of life in Indian country.\r\n\r\nSitting Bull College (SBC) has begun the process of developing a Master of Science Degree (MS)in the Environmental Science (ENS) Program. Goal 1 of this project is to increase recruitment, retention, and graduation rates of students by enhancing the quality of ENS student experiences in research at all academic levels through the development of a Master of Science Degree.  This will be done by improving the research experience for all ENS students from the development of an MS degree. Goal 2 is to train a diversified work force in STEM fields for the Standing Rock community that has leadership skills and is trained in the use of state-of-the-art technology in diverse areas, such as water quality, pollution science, ecology, and climate change. A cohort model will be used for academic and research activities.  Different cohorts will address different research topics. The result will be an educated work force trained in the latest technology in diverse areas of ENS. Goal 3 is to expand interest in STEM fields to a wider spectrum of students through innovative recruitment and retention programs, international research programs and culturally appropriate curricula. This will be accomplished by Middle School Science Academy programs, a research program in Costa Rica, and development of culturally relevant course and other materials.",

In addition, other major outcomes of this grant relate to the creation of courses that are interdisciplinary in nature and include Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) and contemporary Native American Cultural inclusion into the courses.&nbsp; Finally, dissemination of the learned outcomes was completed within the college environment, as well as throughout the Standing Rock community in which SBC is located.</p>\n<p>Although the COVID-19 Pandemic hampered progress in some areas of the grant's objectives, programs were developed prior to the Pandemic that can now be built upon.&nbsp; SBC has a long history of affording its Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) students with the opportunity to study internationally.&nbsp; Since 2005, SBC has provided the opportunity for 54 students to conduct STEM research in Costa Rica.&nbsp; During this most recent TCUP grant, a research site was developed in the northern boreal&nbsp;forest of Manitoba, Canada in order to continue the expansion of the international research program.</p>\n<p>At this new research site in Canada, students at the A.S., B.S., and M.S. levels conducted ecological research in the forest setting.&nbsp; Though the research site is small and can accommodate only four people at a time, SBC was able to have six students and two faculty members participate in research on five separate events.&nbsp; Three of the six students went to the remote research site more than once.&nbsp; All six students completed research projects that were presented to the public at Sitting Bull College, as well as at academic conferences.&nbsp; In addition, one of the faculty members published the findings of his own personal research in a journal.&nbsp; The dissemination of the research findings was vitally important so other students and researchers not able to attend an international research experience still learned from their peers.</p>\n<p>The COVID-19 Pandemic put an end to the international research opportunities for SBC students.&nbsp; As the impacts of the pandemic lessen, it is anticipated that a continuation of research in Costa&nbsp;Rica and Canada will be resurrected and students will again be able to learn STEM in different biomes.</p>\n<p>Students that were not able to conduct research internationally were able to conduct research on a more local scale.&nbsp; During the grant period, over 20 students completed research projects in North Dakota and South Dakota, with most of that research occurring on Standing Rock.&nbsp; Grant funding allowed the students to conduct research at the A.S., B.S., and M.S. levels.&nbsp; The continuation of research at SBC will occur even after the grant has expired.</p>\n<p>Another major outcome of the grant was the development of two new courses in the Environmental Science curriculum that are not only ecological in nature, but they have strong cultural and interdisciplinary inclusion in the courses as well.&nbsp; The courses titled, Applying Native American Culture to Natural Resource Management I and Applying Native American Culture to Natural Resource Management II, were developed during the grant period.&nbsp; Funding from the grant allowed for field trips that took students to culturally important destinations.&nbsp; Students learned the ecology of the areas, and obtained greater knowledge about how the natural resources in the areas were connected.</p>\n<p>Over 50 students enrolled in the two courses over the grant period.&nbsp; Although participation in the courses was low initially because the courses were both offered as courses that were \"elective\" within each student's curricular program, the number of students participating in the courses has continued to increase each year since their inception.&nbsp; The positive feedback from students has resulted in a proposed change in the Environmental Science curriculum, as SBC administration has asked for additional courses that combine Native American culture with STEM to be developed and implemented as required courses within the curriculum.</p>\n<p>To summarize, the COVID-19 Pandemic undoubtedly had a negative impact on the ability to accomplish all objectives of the grant.&nbsp;
