 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Introductory Physics for Life Science (IPLS) Portal will enhance the education of hundreds of thousands of life science students each year by providing engaging and effective IPLS instructional materials and helping IPLS instructors use these materials. This collaborative effort of the American Association of Physics Teachers and eight colleges and universities, including a community college and a Hispanic-serving institution, will create an open-source, peer-reviewed, and innovatively structured environment for IPLS content. Initially containing materials from multiple NSF-funded research and development projects, the Portal will become a development platform for IPLS curricula. The site will serve as both an archive and a dissemination tool, including a course-building interface for faculty. Instructors will be supported in creating innovative and individualized courses, mixing and matching from multiple sources tuned to their needs, offering a flexible and low-cost alternative to traditional textbooks.  \r\n\r\nMany of the objectives and features of the project are innovative.  Hence, the project also includes research components of four critical and interacting elements: IPLS content, IPLS pedagogy, the organizational structure of the site, including tagging and taxonomy of all elements for appropriate selection to meet the needs of individual users, and the user interface. Three overlapping research teams will carry out this work: the User-Centered Design team, the Instructional Content Design team, and the Community-Building and Professional-Development team. This project focuses on engaging and expanding three communities: (1) physics and biology education researchers, (2) IPLS contributors, and (3) IPLS adopters wanting to use and adapt existing IPLS materials.  Merging and expanding the efforts of these communities will occur through a combination of workshops, online support communities, and research to advance the understanding of faculty professional development for IPLS education. The IPLS-Portal infrastructure, once developed, could be used to provide a community-sourcing environment for other STEM disciplines.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nNancy Donaldson, Ph.D., a Professor of Physics at Rockhurst University, was a Co-PI on the NSF Award ?Collaborative Research:  Community Sourcing Introductory Physics for the Life Sciences.? Funding was completed in August, 2021.  Co-PI Donaldson?s role was that of a seed contributor to the online community sourced Living Physics Portal (LPP) developed under this NSF grant process.\n\nThe Intellectual Merit of this project was to bring together many research-based curricular materials in a new and creative way using the strengths of the project team, many of whom have been leaders in physics education research and Introductory Physics for Life Science students (IPLS).  As a Seed Contributor on the project, Co-PI Donaldson submitted NSF-developed Physics of Medicine (POM) Modules in Physics of the Respiratory System, Physics of the Cardiovascular System, and Fiber Optics in Medicine.  She conducted a Living Physics Portal Community Workshop with grant Co-PIs to bring faculty from around the country to experience hands-on work with the Physics of the Respiratory Module.  She presented multiple times at the American Association of Physics Teachers Meeting on various phases of work submitted to the Living Physics Portal.\n\nBuilding on the Intellectual Merit of this Community Sourced project, Donaldson received a separate NSF grant in 2019 (collaborative with Portland State University) to develop a full year of multimedia Biomedically Relevant, Active-Learning, Introductory Physics curricula for pre-health students.  All curricula developed in this new grant will be contributed to the Living Physics Portal, extending Donaldson?s involvement with the project past the final funding.\n\nBroader Impacts of this grant project were designed to bring quality curricular material in Physics for the Life Sciences to an open and flexible community-sourced portal.  As a Seed Contributor to the grant, Donaldson appreciated the ability for flexible submission of her active learning Physics of Medicine curriculum resulting in a wide dissemination of NSF grant developed material.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/07/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Nancy Donaldson"
