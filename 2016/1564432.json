 "awd_abstract_narration": "The \"STEM Scholars\" program at Johnson County Community College (JCCC) will provide 30 scholarships to students enrolling in the Associate Degree of Science at JCCC who have demonstrated financial need and an aptitude and interest in studying in a STEM field.  This project will develop a support network of student services and cohort-building activities necessary for students through an unprecedented program that brings together departments and offices across campus. The project team will lead a coordinated effort encompassing the JCCC offices of Institutional Research, Financial Aid, Admissions and Counseling, Student Services and regional STEM education organizations.  The project will focus on the impact that individual faculty have on helping community college students successfully transfer to universities.\r\n\r\nThe project will study the increase on recruitment, retention, graduation, and transfer rates for scholarship students, particularly women and underrepresented minority students in STEM majors. The project will contribute to the literature on STEM education by studying what works in helping STEM students persist to university graduation in a STEM major.  The project team will evaluate the effect that STEM-focused counselors, research opportunities for community college STEM students, and collaboration among community college and university STEM faculty can have on retaining students in STEM majors and aiding them in successfully continuing on for a four-year STEM degree.  This project will establish a replicable model for other community colleges so that they can achieve similar results.",

This was achieved through scholarship, academic and other relevant supports, and community-building activities which, all together, resulted in strong, self-assured university transfer-ready STEM students.</p>\n<p>We attribute the many achievements of the program to our original vision, to those who carried out the vision, to the outstanding support from different constituents within the institution, and to the quality and dedication of the JCCC STEM Scholars themselves. The resultant successes have strengthened the resolve of grant personnel to focus on \"what works\". We witnessed, first-hand, the transformative impact of the scaffolding support through mentorship, counseling, and cohorting activities&nbsp;on our student's self-validation, academic retention and persistence, and overall success in realizing their important place in chosen fields of endeavor.</p>\n<p>One of the unique aspects of the JCCC STEM Scholars Program was the intentional recruitment of students pursuing <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">any</span> STEM major. We provided the students with the same excellent resources and foundations regardless of their individual circumstances and/or educational goals. The diversity of the program students challenged the PIs to design broad cohorting activities, field trips to academic research labs, guest speakers who are professionals conducting research for regional businesses, and research opportunities that were relevant to the students' interests. In the end, it was this diversity that became a touchstone for the JCCC STEM Scholars Program.</p>\n<p>A major accomplishment of the JCCC STEM Scholars Program was the design and successful implementation of universal student participation in independent, undergraduate research projects. During their first year of the program, the students were prompted to begin thinking about areas of particular interest, discuss their thoughts with their faculty mentors, and conduct some preliminary background research. In the summer between their first and second years, the students were expected to continue gathering information while attempting to narrow down their topic(s). During the STEM Scholars' orientation just before the start of their second fall semester, the program brought in a university Research Methods instructor to help students develop their research design and refine their research question. The next step for each of the STEM Scholars was an individual meeting with a research librarian. The students then worked independently (with support when needed) to progress in their research. During this second year, there were many touchpoints provided to the students to ensure their progress and receive guidance. Often, these students were able to connect with researchers at JCCC, area universities and industries, and around the world.</p>\n<p>As is typical for many community colleges, JCCC does not have close affiliation with a single university, adequate physical amenities designed for research, faculty researchers, or research funding. Despite these limitations, the PI's were able to design a framework within which all students could successfully complete their research projects. Students from the fields of computer science, biology, civil engineering, cyber security, mathematics, physics, environmental science, as well as other STEM fields were successful in completing their own, individually-designed projects not affiliated with a particular course but which applied the knowledge gained from all their STEM courses. Students used various methods to generate/acquire data including simulations, publicly available data sets, requesting data from area organizations or government offices, or joining with a university researcher to gather their own data.</p>\n<p>All research projects culminated in student presentations for the JCCC community. Some of the most outstanding projects paved pathways for next level research including submission for presentations at national conferences, proposals for publication, or 3D printing of prototypical devices. These individual successes sometimes resulted in further scholarship awards but universally helped to build self-confidence and self-efficacy and continued to reinforce interest in the STEM fields. This was just one of the key aspects of enabling students to successfully transition from community college student to university student.</p>\n<p>The importance of building \"safety nets\" for&nbsp;our students was&nbsp;identified as a requirement for success and retention. One avenue of support for the scholars was an assigned faculty mentor. Purposefully pairing students with&nbsp;faculty mentors&nbsp;from a different STEM content area of expertise helped expose the students to the multitude of options available to them as they progressed through their undergraduate course work. Perhaps even more importantly, this structure provided opportunities for strengthening the&nbsp;mentor/mentee bond through learning about each other's areas of interest. This strong mentor-mentee relationship, when combined with regular visits with a STEM counselor, frequent cohort activities, study hours at the tutoring centers, and meaningful interactions with the program directors provided just the right amount of support and community-building that resulted in student success.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/28/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Beth&nbsp;Edmonds</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1564432/1564432_10439952_1635280853680_2SampleResearchProjectPrototype--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1564432/1564432_10439952_1635280853680_2SampleResearchProjectPrototype--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Student Research Project Prototype\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1564432/1564432_10439952_1635280853680_2SampleResearchProjectPrototype--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Student Research Project Prototype\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Cohort IV student demonstrates his prototype door locking mechanism.The device is designed to attach to the inside of a door and lock/unlock remotely via an app created by the student.
