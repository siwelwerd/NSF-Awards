 "awd_abstract_narration": "The study of oceanography requires seagoing research for collection of\r\ndata and at sea experimentation. However, for first time researchers the planning, organizing,\r\nlogistics and paper work involved in a major research cruise, especially one that involves\r\nwork in foreign waters (EEZs) can be daunting. Additionally, at sea research involves substantial\r\nadditional grant costs attributable to the ship operation. As a consequence, beginning in\r\n2011 the University National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) began a program of Chief\r\nScientist training cruises to introduce prospective early career scientists to the process\r\nof planning, acquiring, effectively utilizing, and reporting on time at sea for multi-disciplinary\r\nresearch and education. To date there have been 5 successful Chief Scientist training cruises,\r\nwith a sixth cruise, focused on Robotic Platforms, scheduled to take place this November.\r\nThis proposal would fund a sixth Chief Scientist Training Cruise training cruise to be conducted\r\naboard the R/V Thomas G Thompson. The training program is modeled on the proven successful\r\none that have already occurred. This would be the first training cruise conducted using a\r\nGlobal Class research vessel,\r\n\r\nWith this proposal funds will be used to conduct a general Chief Scientist Training Cruise in 2016.\r\nThe training cruise will follow the proven model of previous successful ones and provide a\r\nforum for early career marine scientists to learn how to plan, acquire utilize and report on at sea\r\nresearch for multidisciplinary research and education. The cruise will utilize the R/V T.G.\r\nThompson, and it will be the first Chief Scientist training cruise on one of UNOLS? Global Class\r\nresearch vessels. As such, the ship will be able to accommodate up to 20 trainees. In addition to\r\ninstruction on duties and responsibilities of a Chief Scientist, the cruise will offer new\r\ninvestigators opportunities to test compelling research areas that could be used for the basis of\r\nfuture proposals. Given the declining number of vessels in the UNOLS fleet and the tight\r\noperations budget, the need to teach early career scientists how to use our limited infrastructure\r\nresources effectively and collaboratively is more important than ever.",
