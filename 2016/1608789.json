 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Connecticut Summer School (August 8th - August 12th, 2016) is a program in number theory for advanced undergraduate and beginning graduate students. Events will take place at the University of Connecticut (Storrs, CT). The lectures during the summer school will expose undergraduate and graduate students to important ideas in number theory while, in the evenings, students will work in groups on problem sets and projects, both computational and theoretical in nature. This summer school is designed to prepare the students for research conferences in number theory, in particular the research conference on elliptic curves and modular forms (August 12th - August 14th, 2016) that will follow the summer school.\r\n\r\nFunding from the National Science Foundation will make it possible for undergraduate and graduate students to attend the summer school and conference, and provide an opportunity for participants who have no other federal support and participants who are members of groups that are under-represented in the mathematical sciences. The events will introduce undergraduate and graduate students to accessible topics that are fundamental to contemporary number theory, and will bring together faculty and students in a cooperative environment.",
