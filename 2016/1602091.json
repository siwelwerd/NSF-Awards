 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Jared L. Anderson of the University of Toledo is supported by the Chemical Measurement and Imaging (CMI) Program in the Division of Chemistry to explore the application of ionic liquids as separation media in chromatography and microextractions.  The project will provide new knowledge on how ionic liquids effect the differential extraction of analytes and their separation and analysis by various chromatographic techniques, and will expand the scope of applicability of ionic liquids in the analysis of real chemical and biological samples.  A major impact across fields other than analytical chemistry is in the development of techniques for the analysis of complex fluids such as oils and fuels derived from biomass. \r\n  \r\nProfessor Anderson and his research team will conduct three separate initiatives under the umbrella of ionic liquids in separation science.  Magnetic ionic liquids will be studied in the selective extraction and long term storage of deoxyribonucleic acid; polymeric ionic liquids, incorporating single-walled carbon nanotubes, will be developed and used as sorbent coatings for solid-phase microextraction; and ionic liquids will be developed and used as selective stationary phases for multidimensional gas chromatography.\r\n \r\nIn the course of conducting this research, graduate and undergraduate students will acquire valuable skills in separation science and chromatography, and Facebook-based social networking outreach programs will be developed to present scientific concepts to young children and the general public.",
