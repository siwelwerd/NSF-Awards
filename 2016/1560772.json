 "awd_abstract_narration": "CSBR: Living Stocks: Operation of a Culture Collection of Algae at the University of Texas - Austin.\r\n\r\nAn award is made to the Culture Collection of Algae at the University of Texas at Austin (UTEX), one of only a handful of very large and diverse public collections of living algae. Many kinds of UTEX algae are unique and irreplaceable. Every year UTEX distributes thousands of living algal cultures, at modest charge, to scientists, educators, and students throughout the U.S. and the world. The investigator plans to continue a tradition of service to the research and education communities by providing them cultures of living algae, among other services. The work proposed includes research on cryopreservation technology, biochemical characterization, genomic sequencing and taxonomic identification services. The great interest in microscopic algae as sources of transportation fuel, human food, animal feed, pharmaceuticals, and many other uses makes UTEX algae and services essential resources for hundreds of research projects. UTEX provides hands-on workshops on managing algal cultures, an informative interactive web site, species identification services, chemical composition analysis, and extensive correspondence with students engaged in algal research. UTEX personnel give presentations at public schools, conduct tours of UTEX facilities, assist teachers and students in conducting high school science projects, and provide presentations on the scientific importance of algae to hundreds of children every year at local open house events.\r\n\r\nUTEX currently maintains more than 3,000 accessioned strains of living algae representing all major taxa, including over 450 type specimens. The primary goal of UTEX is to provide cultures of living algae to users at modest cost. The user community is defined broadly to include anyone who requires living algae for research, educational activities, or technology development. Expanded goals of UTEX include serving as a permanent public repository of newly discovered and recently described algal species of potential value representing a broad range of genetic, morphological and biochemical diversity; serving as a source of information regarding algae to practicing scientists, other professionals, and the interested public; promoting and supporting local science teaching and hands-on scientific activities by school children; and providing  practical training services, support services, and supplies that facilitate culturing of algae at other sites. In order to fulfill these goals, UTEX offers a wide range of goods and services to the user community. UTEX provides living algae starter cultures, bulk cultures, growth media, photobioreactors, photometers, genomic DNA and digital images.  Services include identification of algae by morphological and DNA-sequence methods, physiological and biochemical characterization of algae, and cryogenetic storage of proprietary strains. Recurring workshops serve more than 30 professionals and students per year. UTEX maintains active research on cryopreservation technology, biochemical characterization, genomic sequencing, and taxonomic identification of accessioned strains. Algae-based research within the local institution is actively supported through the provision of cultures and by consultation with UTEX staff. Every year hundreds of published research articles reference the use of UTEX strains. In addition, many UTEX strains are used in research leading to the development of microalgae-based technologies for the production of biofuels and many other products. A comprehensive web site (www.utex.org) facilitates a secure means for ordering goods and services, provides links to resources elsewhere pertaining to algae, and includes diverse algae-related information.",

They are critical to the sustainability of life on earth and of considerable economic importance. Algae are widely used for basic and applied research, educational purposes, and technology development. The recognition that algae have enormous potential as sources of transportation fuel, human food, animal feed, pharmaceuticals, as well as many other uses has greatly intensified interest in applied microalgal research over the past twenty years. The Culture Collection of Algae at the University of Texas at Austin (UTEX) is internationally recognized as one of the most important sources for living algae and for information pertaining to microalgae culturing. Over the last 2 years, NSF support has allowed UTEX to facilitate hundreds of research projects throughout the U.S. During this time, nearly 5,000 orders of living algae and related materials have been sent at modest cost to academic scientists, high school and college students, national laboratory researchers, and to those working to develop algae for commercial purposes. UTEX personnel collectively spend an average of ~30 hrs./week through personal dialog, telephone conversations, e-mail correspondence, and social media outlets (Facebook, Twitter, and&nbsp; LinkedIn) assisting students and professionals who wish to learn to culture algae. UTEX maintains an extensive, regularly updated, public web site (<a href=\"https://utex.org/\">https://utex.org/</a>) that contains UTEX strain data and information on algal culturing methods. Outreach and education are central to the UTEX mission. UTEX provides and participates in many different local and national service activities. Hundreds of school children, especially from low-income areas, visit UTEX facilities every year for demonstrations and tours. For example, in the past year, UTEX provided tours and presentations for 60 middle school and high school students participating in science camps sponsored by the UT educational outreach program, UTEACH.&nbsp; UTEX provides algae-related materials, training, and living cultures to undergraduate students involved in educational projects such as the UT-Austin Freshman Research Initiative (FRI), the International Genetically Engineered Machine Competition (iGEM), NASA Internships and Fellowships Integrated Recruiting, and the Algae Technology Education Consortium (ATEC). UTEX employs 4 &ndash; 8 undergraduate students to work in the collection every semester, with financial need as a major factor in hiring. These students become well-trained laboratory microbiologists during their time at UTEX, providing them with work experience and professional job skills. UTEX supports local science-fair projects through consultation and the provision of cultures for local projects and by allowing students to visit and learn how to culture algae. An average of 5 local high school students per year actively engages UTEX personnel through short-term projects. The UTEX web site provides suggestions for science projects and kits are supplied for teacher and student use. UTEX supports local and national outreach events like Explore UT and AAAS Family Science Days by allowing hundreds of grade-school students to interact with algae and see them through microscopes, and by providing information regarding the importance of learning science. UTEX hosts graduate students and Ph.D.-level professionals every year who come for extended periods of time to learn how to manage algal cultures. In addition to these NSF-supported service activities, UTEX personnel conduct research projects in the areas of large-scale cultivation, cryopreservation, biochemical composition, molecular genetics, comparative genomics, and bioinformatics of microalgae.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 05/23/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: David&nbsp;R&nbsp;Nobles</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1560772/1560772_10416162_1527011888490_ExploreUT-2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1560772/1560772_10416162_1527011888490_ExploreUT-2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Seeing algae up close\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1560772/1560772_10416162_1527011888490_ExploreUT-2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Seeing algae up close\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Students at Explore UT enthusiastically examine algae under the microscope.
