Odom\r\nProposal Number: 1612861\r\n\r\nThis action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2016, Broadening Participation of Groups Under-represented in Biology. The fellowship supports a research and training plan for the Fellow to engage in research and training that will increase the participation of groups underrepresented in biology.  The title of the research plan for this fellowship to Karan J. Odom is \"Investigating elaborate trait evolution in female and male song across songbirds.\" The host institution for this fellowship is Cornell University and the sponsoring scientists are Drs. Mike Webster, Irby Lovette and Aaron Rice.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to reconstruct and understand the evolution of elaborate bird song in female and male songbirds. Bird song, an elaborate acoustic trait, is often thought to have evolved primarily in males to gain access to mates. However, previous research shows that female song is widespread in songbirds and has been lost in certain major lineages. Therefore, song likely evolved early in female and male songbirds and the current male-female differences in song must have resulted at least in part from the evolutionary loss of song in females. The fellow is using bird song recordings from the extensive collection of the Cornell University's Macaulay Library, to determine how song structure has changed over time in both males and females. The Fellow is developing quantitative methods to allow male and female song to be compared on a phylogenetic tree, assessing how gains and losses of song structure contribute to dimorphism, and comparing song dimorphism to a broad range of ecological and natural history correlates.\r\n\r\nThe Fellow is receiving training that supports her career goal to obtain a university faculty position in which she can develop an innovative and dynamic research program on the evolution of complex animal communication. The use of existing collections and other resources available through Cornell?s Lab of Ornithology (CLO) allows the Fellow to build strong computational bioacoustic and phylogenetic skills while conducting cutting-edge research within her field. The Fellow is also implementing a substantial outreach and citizen science component to promote use of biological collections. The Fellow is developing materials for observing and recording female song that are being disseminated through a project website that links to Macaulay and CLO?s resources for citizen scientists. She is also writing popular articles for wildlife magazines and participating in recording workshops to educate volunteer recordists and wildlife enthusiasts. Finally, the Fellow is also promoting involvement of girls in STEM by participating in local science fairs and career days.",

Bird song is one example. Bird song is thought to be sexually selected in males by females choosing males with the most elaborate songs. Females of many species also sing, yet we know a lot less about the selection pressures that shape female songs. Moreover, we now think that female song is ancestral and existed in the early ancestors of modern songbirds. Therefore, the absence of female song in many of today?s songbirds may be due to selection away from song in many lineages. Our goal was to use existing audio collections to compare male and female song structure throughout songbirds to determine when female songs are similar to male songs and when they are less than male songs. We can then compare male and female song to ecological and biological pressures that may be shaping when male and female songs are elaborate versus reduced. This gives us a better understanding of the multiple selection pressures that may be influencing these traits in both sexes and how this complex behavior evolved, overall.</p>\n<p>Our research suggests that both sexual and social selection pressures play a role in the evolution of complex bird song, but in even more nuanced ways than we expected. Across the fairywrens (family Maluridae), an Australasian lineage common in Australian and New Guinea, both males and females sing. Our research showed that in all fairywren male and female songs are fairly similar, but that in some species male and female songs are somewhat dissimilar (Figure 1). Therefore, there is dimorphism between male and female songs in these species. We are finding that some but not all patterns are consistent with sexual selection on males (complexity increases with extra-pair paternity and latitude, but song length decreases with brood size and male feeding rates). However, we also find strong relationships between the similarity of male and female songs and high rates of male feeding (care by both parents), but small group sizes and tropical latitudes. This suggests a primary driver of male-female variation in song is sex role convergence (when males and female share territorial responsibilities, behaviors and physical features) and the ecological pressures associated with it.</p>\n<p>We also investigated selection pressures that drive the evolution of tightly coordinated duets in the Neotropical wrens (Troglodytidae). Sometimes males and females combine their songs into duets and sometimes their songs are so tightly coordinated that it sounds like a single bird. This is common in the Neotropical wrens, but we have very little understanding of what drives such tight coordination. Hypotheses include the need for pairs to jointly defend territories year-round and the need for pairs to coordinate their breeding over long, tropical breeding seasons. We measured coordination using a newly developed metric and found that coordination is tightly correlated with breeding season length. Previous findings on the evolution of duets generally pin-point territory defense and year-round territoriality as being broadly responsible for the evolution of duets. Our results provide a finer resolution indicating that it is specifically something about the need to coordinate behaviors over long breeding seasons that selects for especially coordinated duets.</p>\n<p>Our research also resulted in a methods paper outlining best practices for analyzing song in a phylogenetically controlled comparative framework, which is broadly applicable to scientists interested to understand how animal vocal communication evolves. In addition, we published a perspectives paper in Biology Letters outlining future directions for studying female bird song, as well as a commentary for the Auk encouraging documentation of female bird songs for collections. An additional discovery of our research was that female bird song is under-documented in sound collections compared to male song. This is likely due to previous misconceptions of thinking of song as a male-only behavior, which has probably led to overlooking female song or in some cases mislabeling song as male. We also created a citizen science project (The Female Bird Song Project, <a href=\"http://www.femalebirdsong.org/\">www.femalebirdsong.org</a>) to raise awareness of this issue among birders and wildlife enthusiasts who contribute to these collections. We hope these tools and information will improve the quality and accuracy of sound collections for future use. We are still in the final stages of completing the across-songbird analysis comparing male and female song, but our results from these family-level studies suggest that a variety of selection pressures are likely at play in shaping overall patterns of bird song complexity.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 05/01/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Karan&nbsp;J&nbsp;Odom</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1612861/1612861_10436319_1556717848339_Slide6--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1612861/1612861_10436319_1556717848339_Slide6--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Male-Female fairywren song similarity\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1612861/1612861_10436319_1556717848339_Slide6--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Male-Female fairywren song similarity\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Male and female fairywren songs are similar in most species, with some differences in certain species.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Karan Odom</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Karan&nbsp;J&nbsp;Odom</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Male-Female fairywren song similarity</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1612861/1612861_10436319_1556717923829_Slide7--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1612861/1612861_10436319_1556717923829_Slide7--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Ancestral State Reconstruction of Duet Coordination in Neotropical wrens\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1612861/1612861_10436319_1556717923829_Slide7--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Ancestral State Reconstruction of Duet Coordination in Neotropical wrens\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Coordination score (upper left) and consistency of duet coordination (lower left) was correlated with breeding season length (upper right) but not clutch size (lower right).</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Karan Odom</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Karan&nbsp;J&nbsp;Odom</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Ancestral State Reconstruction of Duet Coordination in Neotropical wrens</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
