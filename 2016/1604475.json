In 2012, shale gas was the largest source of US natural gas, contributing 9.7 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, 40 % of the total natural gas production; however, this technique requires the use of large volumes of water combined with a variable combination of chemical additives, each composed of numerous constituents that are primarily organic-based. This project focuses on the characterization of fracking fluids and their potential to adversely impact both surface and ground water.\r\n\r\nThis study will be the first to determine a detailed molecular characterization of organic matter in shale well fluids and track carbon composition evolution during the first three years of operation at a scientific test well site in West Virginia using ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry. This unique opportunity will generate a comprehensive database of organic constituents entering an unconventional shale gas well drilled into the Marcellus shale and returning to the surface after increasing residence time within the formation. Additionally, the environmental fate will be assessed for potentially hazardous organic compounds present in shale wastewaters. This study will aid in evaluations of potential health impacts of spills during different stages of well operation. It will further guide evaluations of wastewater treatability and solutions for surface spill responses. The goals of the project are: (1) To characterize in detail the molecular composition of shale gas fluids throughout the first three years of a scientific well operation using targeted and non-targeted analytical methods; (2) To evaluate the photochemical and microbial degradation of organic constituents along with detailed molecular characterization of changes including the production of metabolites; (3) To undertake meaningful laboratory-based experiments to understand microbial degradation pathways and to evaluate a potential increase in toxicity, and, (4) To study the photochemical degradation of organic compounds in hydraulic fracturing fluids. The diversity, toxicity and persistence of organic constituents in shale wastewaters have a direct impact on communities relying on water resources in areas being developed for unconventional shale energy. Detailed analyses of the transformation pathways of organic chemical additives and organics leached from shale will guide a scientifically based discussion about the potential health impacts accidental surface spills and subsurface contamination may have to surrounding ecosystems. Graduate and undergraduate students will have the unique opportunity to participate in research and training during drilling and fracturing campaigns planned at the Marcellus Shale Energy Environmental Laboratory, located in West Virginia, over the coming years. This will engage students in direct communication, observation, and sampling efforts during different phases of unconventional shale gas development through the established university-industry collaboration. Research education will focus on a graduate student located at University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science, Chesapeake Biological Laboratory (CBL), a graduate student at Ohio State University as well as undergraduate internships over the summer months (Sea Grant Maryland Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU). The CBL Visitor Center will host displays about the importance of shale well fluids related water issues and wastewater treatment. In partnership with the CBL visitor center here in Solomons, Maryland, we will host a summer workshop for 7-12th grade school students.",
