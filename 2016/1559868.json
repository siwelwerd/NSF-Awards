 "awd_abstract_narration": "This REU Site award to Rutgers University - Camden, located in Camden, NJ, will support the training of 10 students for 10 weeks during the summers of 2016-18. This project is supported by the Division of Biological Infrastructure (DBI) in the Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) and the Division of Mathematical Sciences (DMS) in the Directorate for Mathematics and Physical Sciences (MPS).  Participating faculty from Biology, Chemistry, Computer Science, Mathematics and Physics will provide an interdisciplinary summer research experience to undergraduate students with a strong focus on the combination of experimental and computational approaches for the study of biological systems. Students will acquire skills in mathematical modeling, experimental setup and computational biology. The program will include enrichment sessions geared towards strengthening knowledge on the broad theme of scientific research. The program employs an eclectic and comprehensive approach to recruiting, including partnerships with community colleges. Individual project descriptions and an online application can be found at http://ccib.camden.rutgers.edu/reu/.  Selection will be made by the project leaders based on eligibility criteria that includes freshman, sophomore or associate's degree level status, a cumulative 3.0 GPA, completion of at least one undergraduate science course as well as interest and potential in research. Past cohorts have included diverse students from underrepresented groups, veterans, and community colleges.\r\n\r\nA total of 30 students from schools with limited research opportunities will be trained in the program. The projects will introduce students to an integrated approach to research in computational biology; develop academic, professional, and personal skills; foster a collaborative environment encouraging discovery and innovation; expose students to areas of relevance for scientific research and development such as ethical conduct and technology transfer; and finally, equip participants to make well-informed decisions on their academic and professional career. Students will learn how research is conducted, and many will present the results of their work at scientific conferences.\r\n\r\nA common web-based assessment tool used by all REU programs funded by the Division of Biological Infrastructure (BIO) will be used to determine the effectiveness of the training program. Students will be tracked after the program is completed to determine student career paths. Students will be asked to respond to an automatic email sent via the NSF reporting system. More information about the program is available at http://ccib.camden.rutgers.edu/reu/, or by contacting the PI (Dr. Benedetto Piccoli at piccoli@camden.rutgers.edu) or Co-PI (Dr. Joe Martin at joe.martin@camden.rutgers.edu).",
