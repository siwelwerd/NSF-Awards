 "awd_abstract_narration": "Objectives Research is proposed that will advance design and fabrication techniques relating to direct digital manufacturing (DDM), or additive manufacturing of three-dimensional, reconfigurable microwave microsystems.  DDM is a layer-by-layer fabrication approach which can combine structural, functional and sacrificial materials in a single build of arbitrary-shaped structures. The work will investigate devices that include new transmission line geometries, deployable 3-D antennas and tunable cavity filters. Mechanical reconfiguration based on DDM-produced shape-shifting surfaces will also be studied.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit DDM has enabled significant technical innovation in a wide range of fields, from bio-medical devices to fuel cells, but utilization in RF/microwave applications is in its infancy. To date, high frequency applications have consisted primarily of the deposition of conductors on conformal surfaces to create antennas and simple interconnects. This project will explore the integration of innovative electronic and mechanical design techniques that are compatible with a low cost, common manufacturing platform to produce 3D microwave systems.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts Reversing the loss of high-tech manufacturing jobs is of vital importance to the Nation?s economic security, and thus the outcomes of this project could have significant societal impact.  DDM is also a green technology that eliminates material waste associated with subtractive manufacturing and so has a positive impact on environmental sustainability.  The outcomes of the research will be integrated into undergraduate education through joint REU activities between the partnering institutions, and also into the graduate curricula at each school. Graduate student exchanges are planned along with summer internships at Sciperio to enhance professional development.",
