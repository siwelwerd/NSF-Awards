 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will explore how trees in eight tropical forests respond to an El Ni\u00f1o event. The 2015-16 El Ni\u00f1o is among the three strongest since 1950. Strong El Ni\u00f1o events bring climate anomalies worldwide, including increased temperatures, reduced cloud cover, decreased rainfall, and drought over a large portion of the Tropics. The eight forests in this study occur along a steep rainfall gradient from the wet Caribbean to the dry Pacific coast of Panama. The project capitalizes on previously mapped populations of seedlings and trees in each of these forests. Although the 2015-16 El Ni\u00f1o initially benefitted trees by reducing cloud cover and increasing light availability during the 2015 rainy season, the dry season began earlier than normal, which likely means a severe drought lies ahead. The project will test several hypotheses about how tree species in normally wet and dry forests respond differently to reduced rainfall. The net effect of drought and increased light on the health of seedlings and adult trees will determine which species regenerate, potentially altering long-term composition of the forests. This project is important because tropical forests play a vital role in global carbon and water cycles and are the most biologically diverse ecosystem on the planet. Also, a deeper understanding of how plant species respond to El Ni\u00f1o events will provide insight into how forests will respond to long-term climate change.\r\n\r\nDuring the 2016 El Ni\u00f1o event, researchers will survey an existing network of tree seedling plots within eight forests that span a pronounced rainfall gradient in central in Panama. Censuses will measure seedling recruitment, growth and survival across two size classes and (1) determine which forest sites and tree species are most affected by an extreme El Ni\u00f1o event, (2) examine the relative roles of reduced soil water availability and increased light on seedling performance, (3) evaluate the predictive value of functional traits for seedling responses to El Ni\u00f1o, (4) measure the size distribution of El Ni\u00f1o-related seedling mortality, and (5) provide a baseline for modeling the effects of extreme El Ni\u00f1o events on tropical forests through assessing minimum soil and leaf water potentials and their variation across forests and species. The project is among the most comprehensive studies of the effects of an El Ni\u00f1o event on tropical forest regeneration to date and will provide insight into variation of responses within and among species, seedling size classes, and forests. The research will improve projections for consequences of global climate change for these forests, as well as for vegetation-climate feedbacks, which will be important for forest management under current and future climate conditions. The project will also facilitate future research efforts both in Panama and in other tropical regions by providing research infrastructure and data from a relatively new set of plots in Panama and by gathering comparative performance data for a wide range of species.  Data will be made publically available online.",
