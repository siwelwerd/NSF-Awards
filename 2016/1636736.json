 "awd_abstract_narration": "Increasingly, the prosperity, innovation and security of individuals and communities depend on a big data literate society. Yet conspicuously absent from the big data revolution is the field of teaching and learning. The revolution in big data must match a complementary revolution in a new kind of literacy, through a significant infusion of STEM education with the kinds of skills that the revolution in 21st century data-driven science demands. This project represents a concerted effort to determine what it means to be a big data literate citizen, information worker, researcher, or policymaker; to identify the quality of learning resources and programs to improve big data literacy; and to chart a path forward that will bridge big data practice with big data learning, education and career readiness. \r\n\r\nThrough a process of inquiry research and capacity-building, New York Hall of Science will bring together experts from member institutions of the Northeast Big Data Innovation Hub to galvanize big data communities of practice around education, identify and articulate the nature and quality of extant big data education resources and draft a set of big data literacy principles. The results of this planning process will be a planning document for a Big Data Literacy Spoke that will form an initiative to develop frameworks, strategies and scope and sequence to advance lifelong big data literacy for grades P-20 and across learning settings; and devise, implement, and evaluate programs, curricula and interventions to improve big data literacy for all. The planning document will articulate the findings of the inquiry research and evaluation to provide a practical tool to inform and cultivate other initiatives in data literacy both within the Northeast Big Data Innovation Hub and beyond.",

At the outset, attaining these goals seemed straightforward. However, through a collaborative inquiry process that involved 20 professionals representing a range of data science sectors who participated in a cross-disciplinary workshop on developing of a community of practice, it became evident that there are many different perspectives on what it means to be data literate. Some participants from the corporate sector saw greatest value in workforce preparation, while those in academia looked to what would comprise content in coursework toward a degree. The process also revealed that there are also a range of different data literacy initiatives, most of which have been developed recently and do not appear to inform one another. What began as a process to distill a set of core ideas from broad discourse became a process of seeking alignment, common ground and language among disciplines, and required casting a much wider net to gather concepts and ideas related to data literacy. This in turn required bringing together communities of need, service organizations, libraries and others on the ?front lines? of data use in order to exchange ideas, discuss approaches to improving the living conditions of underserved communities, and gain better understanding of what it means to be a data literate person across income and cultural boundaries.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"Normal1\"><span>The outcome of this process is a draft set of principles that remain under discussion:</span></p>\n<p class=\"Normal1\"><span>1.
