The workshop will provide an opportunity for those leaders to think collectively about the scalability and long-term sustainability of their work, as well as support structures for long-term implementation and growth.  \r\n\r\nThe broad goals of the conference are to \r\n -- Inspire the project leaders to think beyond the development activities of their NSF-funded projects and to commit to taking steps that will lead to long-term growth and sustainability once NSF funding has ended;\r\n\r\n -- Educate the participants about key issues that should be considered now in order to facilitate scalability and sustainability of their work; provide models of potential routes to scalability and sustainability; and\r\n \r\n -- Strengthen the community of CS curriculum and professional developers; encourage collaboration and sharing of ideas and solution strategies.\r\n\r\nThe workshop represents a continuation of a series of NSF sponsored \"Gateways\" conferences where mathematics and science curriculum developers met annually to share experiences, discuss challenges, find and identify joint solutions, and build a community of educators and leaders focused on instructional material and professional development.",
