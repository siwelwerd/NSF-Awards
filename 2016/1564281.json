 "awd_abstract_narration": "Approximation defines our world. For example, the letters on this screen have smooth curves and bends. But zoom in and all you see are squares: pixels. The smaller the pixels (i.e., the finer the approximation), the smoother a curve looks. Add three colors and suddenly we can approximate a rainbow. In a sense, science is all about refining and improving approximations to reality. Take Newtonian physics, for example. It works great at medium scales, but breaks down when things are too big or too small. Einstein's relativity and quantum mechanics work much better at those scales. And these theories require sophisticated mathematics. This focused research group project addresses several outstanding questions in operator algebras and their analogies in other areas of mathematics.\r\n\r\nOperator algebras arose as a framework for quantum mechanics. Over the years many classical theories were extended to this noncommutative context: geometry, topology,  probability and more. The PIs will spearhead an international effort to capitalize on recent connections between operator algebras and other areas such as dynamics, measure theory, coarse geometry and K-theory. Specifically, the PIs shall push analogies between nuclear dimension and asymptotic dimension, two notions defined via approximation and encompassing a huge swath of examples, to address K-theoretic questions such as the Universal Coefficient Theorem and the Baum-Connes and Farrell-Jones conjectures.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOperator algebras were introduced in the first half of the 20th century to provide a mathematical foundation for quantum physics.  They remain important in the description of quantum systems, but have since found numerous connections with other parts of mathematics, particularly in the geometry of shape and space.  \n\nOperator algebras are intrinsically infinite-dimensional in almost all cases, which makes them difficult to approach directly.  The fundamental idea of the program of research was to approximate infinite-dimensional operator algebras by finite-dimensional analogues that could be directly approached.  This idea - of approximating something prohibitively complicated by a simpler object - permeates much of modern mathematics and its applications to the physical and social sciences.\n\nOur specific goals in this project centered around three problems, known as the Toms-Winter conjecture, the validity of the Universal Coefficient Theorem, and the Baum-Connes conjecture.  Of these, the first is now essentially solved: the key results are due to workers in Europe who we have collaborated with at various points throughout.  We have made, and continue to make, exciting progress on the second problem, often considered the most important open problem in the area.  Significant progress on the third of these three problems remains elusive for now, unfortunately.\n\nThroughout the period of the grant, we mentored over ten graduate students, some of whom were partly funded by the grant, in research and education in mathematics.  Five postdoctoral researchers were supported in part or in whole by the grant; four of these continue to have successful careers in academic mathematics, with three having attained permanent positions.  \n\nWe also ran several workshops with the purpose of bringing junior researchers from the diverse areas covered by the grant proposal together and educating them in techniques needed for cutting-edge work in the field.  The workshops also successfully involved many members of groups who have been under-represented in the field.  These workshops were viewed as very productive by the participants, and resulted in numerous new collaborations.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/13/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Rufus Willett"
