The Roadmap was first developed in 2008-2009 and helped contribute to the establishment of the National Robotics Initiative.  The Roadmap was subsequently updated in 2012-2013.  Much has happened in the field of robotics in the past four years, and it is prudent to update the Roadmap, once again.  The two-day workshops, to be held at Oregon State University and Georgia Institute of Technology, will bring together a diverse group of US robotics researchers to discuss issues related to the societal drivers and technical challenges ahead for robotics.  The outcome will be a publically available report on the future of robotics, which may serve to help formulate a national strategy for robotics.",
