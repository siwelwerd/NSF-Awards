 "awd_abstract_narration": "In healthy streams there is an extensive and on-going exchange of nutrients and sediment between the stream and its floodplain.  As a result, re-establishing this exchange is often a primary focus of river restoration.  Even in healthy streams, expected changes in the frequency and magnitude of extreme precipitation events, coupled with changes in land use, may alter the exchange of nutrients and sediment between the stream and the floodplain, possibly altering riparian ecology by changing the balance of nutrient exchanges between a channel and its margins.  If the floodplain sediments are contaminated, alterations of stream-floodplain exchanges may results in the export of contaminants previously sequestered on floodplains to downstream estuaries and terminal lakes.  The objective of this project is to better understand the hydrologic controls on the exchange of sediment between streams and their floodplains so that we can predict and prepare for possible impacts of climate change on riparian ecosystems.  In addition, we will build on an outreach project developed as part of an NSF-sponsored linking graduate students with K-12 science classrooms.  The graduate student supported by this project will work with a local middle school teacher from an under-resource rural district to develop an inquiry-based project designed to increase students' understanding of, and interest in, hydrology and water resources.\r\n\r\nUsing a recently-developed methodology that combines measurements of the fallout radionuclides 7Be and 210Pb and the stable isotopes of hydrogen (2H) in water to quantify fine sediment connectivity during individual storm events, the investigators propose to repeatedly assess fine-grained sediment sources and the factors controlling the magnitude and direction of net channel bed-to-margin sediment flux in a gravel-bedded tributary of the Connecticut River (USA). Given sufficient discharge to mobilize suspended sediment, the investigators hypothesize that there exists a critical discharge, below which the net transfer of suspended sediment is from the bed to the margins, and above which, the net transfer is from the margins to the bed or out of the watershed. The investigators seek to determine the seasonality of this critical discharge and the sensitivity of the net transfer of suspended sediment to departure from the critical discharge. They expect that currently in natural systems net deposition onto the floodplain during discharges less than the critical value is balanced by net erosion from the floodplain during high discharge events. Thus, an increase in the frequency of extreme precipitation events could result in an overall net erosion of sediment, nutrients, and particle-bound contaminants from the floodplain.",

In this project we showed that the fraction of carbon-rich suspended sediment exported from a headwater watershed varies seasonally, from 10% or less in the spring and fall to as much as 60% in the summer.  This exported sediment is derived from the in-channel decay of organic debris.  Once mobilized, the distance this sediment is transported before getting trapped on the channel margins increases with watershed area. This increasing transport length with increasing watershed area results in a systematic decoupling of the channel from terrestrial organic matter inputs.\n\nTo expand this study beyond our case study, we developed a methodology to determine suspended sediment concentrations using satellite observations.  We applied this methodology to estimate variations in suspended sediment flux for 436 major outlet rivers between 1984&ndash;present.  Despite notable increases in sediment yield resulting from land use change in some tropical basins, we estimate a 49% reduction in sediment flux to the oceans relative to pre-dam conditions, with the dominant sources of suspended sediment shifting from Asia to South America.  We have further shown that the dominant source of increased suspended sediment delivery to the ocean from South America is associated with artisanal gold mining in the headwaters of the Amazon.\n\nFinally, we showed that rivers in North American can be classified into one of 15 \"hydro-regions,\" each with similar seasonal streamflow characteristics. Analysis of seasonal streamflow records at these stations from 1910 to present indicated regionally coherent changes in the frequency of extreme high- and low-flow events.
