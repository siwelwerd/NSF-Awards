 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Ross Sea region of the Southern Ocean is experiencing growing sea ice cover in both extent and duration. These trends contrast those of the well-studied, western Antarctic Peninsula area, where sea ice has been disappearing. Unlike the latter, little is known about how expanding sea ice coverage might affect the regional Antarctic marine ecosystem. This project aims to better understand some of the potential effects of the changing ice conditions on the marine ecosystem using the widely-recognized indicator species - the Ad\u00e9lie Penguin. A four-year effort will build on previous results spanning 19 seasons at Ross Island to explore how successes or failures in each part of the penguin's annual cycle are effected by ice conditions and how these carry over to the next annual recruitment cycle, especially with respect to the penguin's condition upon arrival in the spring. Education and public outreach activities will continually be promoted through the PenguinCam and PenguinScience websites (sites with greater than 1 million hits a month) and \"NestCheck\" (a site that is logged-on by >300 classrooms annually that allows students to follow penguin families in their breeding efforts). To encourage students in pursuing educational and career pathways in the Science Technology Engineering and Math fields, the project will also provide stories from the field in a Penguin Journal, develop classroom-ready activities aligned with New Generation Science Standards, increase the availability of instructional presentations as powerpoint files and short webisodes. The project will provide additional outreach activities through local, state and national speaking engagements about penguins, Antarctic science and climate change. The annual outreach efforts are aimed at reaching over 15,000 students through the website, 300 teachers through presentations and workshops, and 500 persons in the general public. The project also will train four interns (undergraduate and graduate level), two post-doctoral researchers, and a science writer/photographer. \r\n\r\nThe project will accomplish three major goals, all of which relate to how Ad\u00e9lie Penguins adapt to, or cope with environmental change. Specifically the project seeks to determine 1) how changing winter sea ice conditions in the Ross Sea region affect penguin migration, behavior and survival and alter the carry-over effects (COEs) to subsequent reproduction; 2) the interplay between extrinsic and intrinsic factors influencing COEs over multiple years of an individual's lifetime; and 3) how local environmental change may affect population change via impacts to nesting habitat, interacting with individual quality and COEs. Retrospective analyses will be conducted using 19 years of colony based data and collect additional information on individually marked, known-age and known-history penguins, from new recruits to possibly senescent individuals. Four years of new information will be gained from efforts based at two colonies (Cape Royds and Crozier), using radio frequency identification tags to automatically collect data on breeding and foraging effort of marked, known-history birds to explore penguin response to resource availability within the colony as well as between colonies (mates, nesting material, habitat availability). Additional geolocation/time-depth recorders will be used to investigate travels and foraging during winter of these birds. The combined efforts will allow an assessment of the effects of penguin behavior/success in one season on its behavior in the next (e.g. how does winter behavior affect arrival time and body condition on subsequent breeding). It is at the individual level that penguins are responding successfully, or not, to ongoing marine habitat change in the Ross Sea region.",

Little is known about the effects of variability in sea ice extent, concentration, and timing on Ross Sea ecosystems. In this project, we continued research to better understand such effects using a widely-recognized \"indicator species\", the Adelie Penguin. Building on previous project results spanning 19 seasons at Ross Island/Beaufort Island colonies, we added a 4-year field effort to explore carry-over effects (how events during one part of the annual life cycle carry over to affect subsequent parts of the life cycle) and their impacts to penguin populations. We conducted retrospective analyses of existing data and collected new data to expand investigations of the factors affecting Adelie Penguin populations and their response to ecosystem and climate change throughout their annual cycle. Overall, the number of penguins breeding in the region grew (1996-2020), in contrast to previous work during the 1970's-90s which showed that sea ice expansion should lead to colony decrease, not growth; thus, we have had an interesting contradiction to explore.</p>\n<p>We found that the largest study colony (Cape Crozier) has doubled in size since 1996 and continued to grow rapidly during the 4 years of this study, but that the smallest colony (Cape Royds) remained roughly the same size (Fig. 1). We believe this is in part due to higher reproductive rates at Cape Crozier (Fig. 2), which in turn reflects overall better nesting habitat and lower impact of predatory South Polar skuas, which seem to have trapped Cape Royds at a small size. This pattern has implications for understanding population dynamics in other species, explaining in part why large populations can continue to grow despite apparent energetic constraints evident from our earlier work in addition to new findings showing the consistent seasonal expansion of the foraging area at Cape Crozier (Fig. 3).</p>\n<p>We deployed hundreds of newly invented Geolocating Dive Recorders to enable tracking of penguin movements and high-resolution dive behavior for 12 months at a time at both Cape Crozier and Cape Royds. This is the first study to collect such information, and while data processing will continue for months to come, results so far established four key details relevant to our goals: 1) Penguins from Cape Royds and Cape Crozier largely, but not entirely, use two different migration strategies and concentrate foraging in a relatively small part of the Ross Sea region, with implications to conservation measures (Fig. 4); 2) the precise timing, location, and sea-ice characteristics of penguin molt can vary significantly among years (Fig. 5); 3) Having a successful breeding season causes penguins to molt about 8 days later, on average, compared to penguins that did not breed or that failed after attempting to breed; 4) the three years that we collected GDR data (2017-2019) had unusually low sea ice concentration relative to the long-term trend for the molting area (Fig. 6).
