 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support activities of a research network of mathematicians working in computability theory.  This project will facilitate collaborative work of faculty and graduate students from the U.S., Russia, Kazakhstan and Bulgaria.  The research is in quickly developing areas of computability, and this  project has two broad goals: the first goal is more rapid scientific progress resulting from  a network of collaborators, from all four countries, enabling them to pool their ideas to solve fundamental problems. The second goal is to provide opportunities for students and young researchers to participate actively in the world community of scientists.\r\n\r\nComputability as a research area has blossomed in recent years, with many exciting new results that involve combining techniques from pure computability with sophisticated algebra, model theory, set theory, and/or probability. There are also stronger ties with computer science. The proposal named 20 senior participants, and students and postdocs will also participate in the activities supported by the grant. The proposed work includes a variety of problems. There are problems on the difficulty in building a copy of a structure (degree spectra), and on the relative computing power of structures (Muchnik reducibility). There are problems on the internal complexity of structures (Scott rank) and on the difficulty of describing a structure, measured by the complexity of a ``Scott sentence''. In particular, there are problems on Scott sentences for groups. Some problems concern uncountable structures such as the ordered field of reals. There are problems on ``jumps'' of structures and a strong notion of ``jump inversion''. There are problems on complexity of isomorphisms, and on automorphisms, in particular, for vector spaces. There are problems on degree structures (enumeration degrees, and ``continuous'' degrees). There are problems on ``numberings''. At least two problems, one on the ``Hanf number'' for Scott sentences of computable structures, and one on the relative computing power of the ordered field of reals and an expansion by an arbitrary continuous function, have been solved since the proposal was submitted.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis grant is the fourth in a series intended to facilitate collaboration and exchange of ideas among researchers in computability from several institutions in the U.S., Russia, Kazakhstan, and, more recently, Bulgaria.  The funds from the grant were budgeted for travel,.  Face-to-face meetings offer the best way to share big-picture ideas, to get past differences in terminology, and to begin joint work on specific problems.   \n\nBefore these grants, a researcher based in the U.S. would prove something and then learn that the result had been obtained earlier by someone in Novosibirsk or Almaty.  Getting the attributions right could take several years.  This was unsatisfying for everyone.  As a result of the grants, we have an international research network, which includes senior researchers and young people.  We know the people who share our research interests.  We have learned a great deal from each other, and we work together.  Progress is faster, and the results are stronger. \n\nThis particular grant has produced major advances in our understanding of enumeration reducibility and its degree structure,  There are also results on the elationships among familiar classes of structures such as groups and fields.  The pandemic caused cancellation of some planned visits.  Joint work that began during face-to-face visits continued electronically, but all travel stopped.  With the approval of the program director, some funds from the current grant were used to provide partial support for some graduate students.   \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/28/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Julia F Knight"
