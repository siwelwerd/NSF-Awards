 "awd_abstract_narration": "The outcomes of higher education are a consequence of individuals' personality traits and many\r\ndimensions of the university experience. The Caltech Cohort Study (CCS) will track the entire\r\nundergraduate student body of the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) over several years. It\r\nuses repeated, incentivized surveys to elicit behavioral proxies: risk aversion, strategic sophistication,\r\ncompetitiveness, social behavior, etc. The results will be married with objective outcomes: academic,\r\nsocial, and financial. The project will examine the evolution of attributes over college years, the\r\nformation of social interactions, and ultimately how certain attributes interact to produce educational\r\noutcomes. The CCS also serves as an ideal environment for answering fundamental questions about\r\nthe external validity of incentivized surveys and laboratory experiments.\r\n\r\nThe CCS has four unique features. First, Caltech's small size makes it possible to track nearly\r\nthe entire student body over time (90% of students completed the first three surveys). Second, the\r\nsurvey design allows measurement of a large set of behavioral traits for each individual. Third,\r\nthe repeated nature of the study makes it possible to track the stability of these traits across time\r\nwith minimal selection bias. Fourth, the array of behavioral traits elicited can be tied to real-world\r\nbehaviors and outcomes. The combination of these elements should be invaluable for a large battery\r\nof basic social science questions.\r\n\r\nThe proposed study has the potential to improve the educational process in US higher education.\r\nUnderstanding what impacts social and scholastic outcomes will help design certain aspects of college\r\neducation aimed at increasing well-being and academic performance, as well as furthering gender and\r\nracial equality.\r\n\r\nThe proposal focuses on three areas. First, the dataset's longitudinal nature will allow for a careful\r\ninspection of the stability (or lack thereof) of a wide array of behavioral attributes. Second, the rich\r\ndata on different layers of interactions over time (social, academic, and geographic) combined with\r\nthe comprehensive set of elicited attributes will allow us to study network formation processes. Last,\r\nthe data can be cross-checked against Caltech's experimental laboratory data to examine the impacts\r\nof selection into experiments as well as the differences in responses occurring in the lab and outside.\r\nThe survey will also allow for a comparison of responses across other platforms and populations.\r\nUltimately, the detailed longitudinal data that will be collected have the potential to uncover\r\npredictors of academic outcomes (chosen major, grades, and graduation), and the channels affecting\r\nthe evolution of different traits.",
