The research will examine how different governments evaluated the issue of squatting and framed it to the public; it will identify for whom and why states legalized squatting; and it will assess the effects of legalization, including compliance and resistance.  \r\n\r\n\r\nResearch will be multi-method, including archival research, quantitative analysis of community characteristics and state responses, and qualitative interviews. The co-PI will remain on-site in two locations for several months to collect these data. The research helps re-theorize state-building, contributes to the literature on symbolic governance, and identifies the effects of extending urban citizenship under differing conditions.",
