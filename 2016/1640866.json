 "awd_abstract_narration": "Through this project, US Ignite expects to accelerate the development and adoption of compelling next-generation wireless network technologies that will transform people's lives, by virtue of the creation of a Wireless Research Consortium composed of a diverse set of partners in industry, private foundations, research and education networks, cities and regions, researchers, venture capitalists, and software developers. The project will culminate in the national launch of the US Ignite Wireless Research Consortium, which will include announcements about the National Science Foundation-led deployment, partner commitments, and proposed long-term governance model of a series of advanced wireless research initiatives.\r\n\r\nThe proposed Wireless Research Consortium is critical to advancing wireless network knowledge and understanding, since no such coordinated partnership focused on the support of long-term research exists at present. The next-generation of wireless networks is changing the landscape for what networked applications can do. The proposed partnership anticipates significant impacts when transferring knowledge among partners from research to practice. Given the groundswell of interest in next-generation wireless network technologies, US Ignite will extend partnerships to numerous partners who can, in turn, give access to their diverse skill sets, expertise, and resources, with a view to share them with NSF-funded researchers. The current US Ignite management team brings 85 collective years of academic, industry, and government leadership and start-up experience to the project, and will leverage this experience to build the Wireless Research Consortium.",
