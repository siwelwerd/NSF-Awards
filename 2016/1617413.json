 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Amazon basin is the largest freshwater system in the world, providing critical ecosystem services to local populations, national societies and humanity at large. Today in the Brazilian Amazon, construction of more than 30 large hydroelectric dams, and approximately 170 smaller dams on tributaries of the Amazon River are underway as a result of long-term governmental plans geared toward increased energy security, economic growth, improved living standards and industrialization. Despite the long history of hydropower development in Brazil, the synergistic, cumulative and long-term effects of dams on rivers, forests, and social systems are still undervalued in planning and decision-making. Uncertainty about the social-ecological effects of dam construction is due in large part to the existing piecemeal approach to analyzing the impacts of dams.  This uncertainty highlights an urgent need for coordinated research. The Amazon Dams Network will bring together a diverse set of stakeholders, including fishermen, indigenous peoples, farmers, scientists, students, and decision-makers to address this need.  Working together, the network will integrate and coordinate research on how dam construction and operations affect people, their livelihoods, and the environment.  Sharing of knowledge, data and technology will occur through workshops, case-study modules, a bilingual website, maps, and published data and papers.  \r\n\r\nThe goal of the Amazon Dams Network is to advance inter- and trans-disciplinary research coordination, focusing on the transformation of social-ecological systems by hydroelectric dam construction in the Amazon and United States. The geographical focus initially includes the Tocantins, Madeira and Xingu River watersheds in the Amazon and the Colorado River watershed in the US. Network activities will focus on four critical integrative themes: a) governance and social actors (an overarching and cross-cutting theme that mediates interactions and outcomes in dammed systems); b) watershed hydrology and geomorphology; c) fish and fisheries; and d) land-use/land-cover change.  Focal intersections among these themes to be addressed by the network include feedbacks between hydrologic change and forest ecosystems; human geographic dislocations and land-use change; monitoring and mitigation approaches for Brazilian dams; and the relevance of local knowledge (fishermen, indigenous peoples, riparian communities) for the study and management of systems transformed by infrastructure development. The network will enable data discovery and synthesis, sharing of knowledge, and inter- and transdisciplinary and social learning among participants and the public through a series of activities held at research sites in Brazil and the US, the creation of web-based learning and case studies modules, and the archiving of publically available data.",

This project directly led to the production of over 40 peer-reviewed publications and 15 book chapters,&nbsp;&nbsp;book, and&nbsp;&nbsp;&gt;50 presentations at workshops, national and international conferences.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The project also had many broader impacts, including contributed to training and international exchange opportunities for many graduate and undergraduate students from US, Bolivian, Brazilian, and Peruvian Universities.&nbsp;&nbsp;Significant effort was made to provide safe spaces for discussion among a variety of actors, and to value the different knowledge systems and worldviews that were represented among ADN participants. Communication and dissemination strategies developed during this project ensured that results and events were shared in a number of formats and medias (e.g., you-tube videos, Facebook, What?sAPP, twitter, website) often in three languages (English, Spanish, Portuguese). The project also was able to provide insights and recommendations for decision-making related to existing and future hydroelectric dam construction and projects. These insights and recommendations were shared through dialogue and discussion at workshops and other events, pamphlets and technical reports to selected audiences, and an expert survey that synthesized lessons learned and best practices for hydroelectric dam planning and management.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/01/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Bette&nbsp;A&nbsp;Loiselle</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1617413/1617413_10450020_1669941925149_PalmasRCN--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1617413/1617413_10450020_1669941925149_PalmasRCN--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"2018 Palmas Meeting\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1617413/1617413_10450020_1669941925149_PalmasRCN--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"2018 Palmas Meeting\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Participants in 2018 ADN meeting in Palmas, Brazil</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">ADN</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Bette&nbsp;A&nbsp;Loiselle</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">2018 Palmas Meeting</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1617413/1617413_10450020_1669941819320_LajeadoDam--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1617413/1617413_10450020_1669941819320_LajeadoDam--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Lajeado Dam\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1617413/1617413_10450020_1669941819320_LajeadoDam--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Lajeado Dam\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Lajeado hydroelectric dam on Tocantins River, Palmas, Brazil</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Bette Loiselle</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Bette&nbsp;A&nbsp;Loiselle</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Lajeado Dam</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1617413/1617413_10450020_1669941734450_GlenCanyonVisit--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1617413/1617413_10450020_1669941734450_GlenCanyonVisit--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Glen Canyon Dam\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1617413/1617413_10450020_1669941734450_GlenCanyonVisit--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Glen Canyon Dam\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Study visit to Glen Canyon Dam in 2017 by ADN participants</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Bette Loiselle</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Bette&nbsp;A&nbsp;Loiselle</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Glen Canyon Dam</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1617413/1617413_10450020_1669942026947_GraphicRecording_Palmas--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1617413/1617413_10450020_1669942026947_GraphicRecording_Palmas--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Graphic Recording\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1617413/1617413_10450020_1669942026947_GraphicRecording_Palmas--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Graphic Recording\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Graphic recording at ADN Palmas meeting</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Karla Dilascio</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Bette&nbsp;A&nbsp;Loiselle</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Graphic Recording</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1617413/1617413_10450020_1669942149604_VideoRoom--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1617413/1617413_10450020_1669942149604_VideoRoom--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Call for Videos\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1617413/1617413_10450020_1669942149604_VideoRoom--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Call for Videos\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Call for Videos from ADN participants and stakeholders</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">ADN</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Bette&nbsp;A&nbsp;Loiselle</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Call for Videos</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
