The name PACIFIC, \"Particle Astrophysics and Cosmology Including Fundamental InteraCtions\" reflects the scope of the conference, which will target the rapidly developing field at the interface of particle physics, astrophysics, and cosmology and on their ramifications for understanding fundamental interactions. Thanks to the ample new data and a plethora of theoretical ideas, the field of astro-particle physics has become the source of excitement and discoveries. There will be sessions devoted to Astroparticle experiment/observations, Particle Theory, High-energy Astrophysics (theory and observations) and Cosmology.  The symposium will bringing together researchers from the United States, Asia, Australia, South America, and Europe.  It will be held September 14-20, 2016 at the University of California Richard B. Gump South Pacific Research Station, located on the island of Moorea in French Polynesia. \r\n\r\nThe symposium has a particular focus on early career scientists and graduate students, as it will provide participant travel support for them to be able to participate in the symposium. There will also be a continuing dialogue with the local residents about science.",
