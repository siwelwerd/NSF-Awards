 "awd_abstract_narration": "The meniscus is a soft fibrous tissue that helps protect the joint surfaces in the knee. Meniscal tears account for over 500,000 hospital visits per year in the United States.  The tearing of the meniscus and other soft tissues is not understood, making it difficult to predict when they will fail.  Without understanding the microscopic events that cause failure of the individual tissue molecules, methods to prevent the failures are hard to create.   This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program award will increase the scientific knowledge of failure in soft tissue when it is loaded either once or many times.   This research includes experimental, theoretical and computer prediction approaches, including simulations of soft tissue fracture using advanced methods. This project will use the imaging and predictions developed from the research to create a computer program for high school educators that accurately simulates injury to the knee that can be used in science classes to motivate a student towards a scientific or medical career.\r\n\r\nThe central technical objective of this research project is to build and validate a computational model that describes and predicts failure in human meniscus. The research team will perform quasi-static and fatigue failure experiments on cadaveric specimens to determine whether meniscal fractures are regulated by collagen fiber alignment and density. Researchers will measure the organization and composition of the extracellular matrix in mechanically tested specimens to directly link soft tissue microstructure to failure behavior. The team will also develop mathematical models to predict fracture behavior based on the strain energy of the collagen fiber network, and will use these models to predict the experimental failures observed in young and aged meniscal tissue.  This project will be the first to characterize the anisotropic fatigue behavior of human meniscus, and will be the first to visualize meniscal tears using an extended finite element method to split regions that exceed failure criteria.",

Meniscal tears are a debilitating and prevalent injury, accounting for over 500,000 U.S. hospital visits per year. Unfortunately, there are limited treatment options for this injury, and efforts to prevent meniscal tears are hindered by a lack of knowledge on the physical mechanisms that cause failure in young and older individuals. This project has addressed this knowledge deficiency by using novel experimental, theoretical and computational approaches to determine how single and repeated loads can cause failure and how aging influences this behavior. The INTELLECTUAL MERIT of this project is that we have gained a fundamental understanding of failure mechanisms in soft fibrous tissue. This includes using experiments to calculate the mechanical properties that define the ability of the human meniscus to resist single large loads (static failure) and repeated smaller loads (fatigue). We also developed and validated computational models that could simulate this experimental failure behavior. Notably, we found that older menisci were generally weaker and more susceptible to tearing from high-magnitude loads, but older and young menisci were equally resistant to tears at low-magnitude loads. We also found that continuum damage mechanics was an appropriate theory to model failures caused by static and fatigue loads. In total, this project resulted in 12 journal articles and 22 conference proceedings. This research has BROADER IMPACTS on engineering and health care technology. The findings from this study can help identify physical activities that are high-risk for knee injury, and thereby transform efforts to prevent meniscus injuries.
