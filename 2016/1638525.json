 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project explores the factors that influence state formation and urbanization. During its apogee in the first half of the first millennium CE, Teotihuacan arose to become the largest city of the pre-Columbian Americas.  The city was highly planned, with a monumental urban epicenter and densely settled neighborhoods that incorporated a multi-ethnic population of immigrants who arrived from other parts of Mexico and Central America.  Among the enigmas that still pertain to the study of this early American metropolis are (1) its tempo and processes of urbanization; (2) the principal factors that fueled its growing population; (3) its political organization; and (4) what architectural complexes served as seats of governance and administration.  These issues are critical for improving current understanding of the deep history of the Americas and the human creation of the earliest cities and states across the globe. The diverse makeup of the research team enhances interdisciplinary, international international scientific collaborations. And the project also trains students in methods of conducting rigorous and empirical scientific research.\r\n\r\nWith funding from the National Science Foundation, Dr. Saburo Sugiyama (Arizona State University), Dr. Nawa Sugiyama (Smithsonian Institution), and Dr. David Carballo (Boston University), will undertake three years of archaeological research in the Plaza of the Columns Complex, a likely palace or administrative center located between the ancient city?s two largest monuments: the Pyramids of the Sun and Moon.  The research involves close international collaboration between researchers from the US, Mexico, and Japan.  This multifaceted, interdisciplinary project will examine the economic, political, and ritual activities that sustained the city through its largest, unexcavated administrative complex.  The international team will conduct intensive excavation, geophysical prospection, floor-chemistry analyses, and chronological assessment through a combination of ceramic, C14, and archaeomagnetic analyses. Primary objectives are to define these structures as palatial-administrative complexes, record activity areas associated with their public and private functions, and identify who resided in these complexes and what role they played in governing Teotihuacan.",

Four major objectives were completed: 1) digital mapping of the city at two scales of analysis (the entire Teotihuacan Valley through the LiDAR map, and specific excavation areas through an AutoCAD map) (Figure 1), 2) delimiting major architectural elements and their occupational sequence, 3) identifying activity areas and the social identities of their residents, and 4) establishing a chronology for the Plaza of the Columns.</p>\n<p>In the 2018 field season, we have been able to complete feature detection of the 165 km<sup>2</sup> LiDAR map of the Teotihuacan Valley. The map encapsulates the accumulated record of land use across two millennia, including the long term legacies of the ancient landscape on the modern terrain. Over 600 topographic elements have been verified through field survey, and surface collections are being processed to assign temporality. The AutoCAD map of each excavation unit have been imported to ArcGIS to identify distinguishing architectural features and examine artifact densities across three-dimensional space. Both of these maps provide an important resource for archaeologists, especially as recent mining operations have transformed large sections of the Teotihuacan Valley. Our collaboration with the Salvage Archaeology sector of the National Institute of Anthropology and History will provide an important avenue to monitor, archive, and protect these ancient features into the future.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Not only were we able to excavate diverse architectural elements (plazas, structures, stairways, etc.), we have documented their occupational sequence in relation to major activity areas, hinting at the function of the Plaza of the Columns. Four distinctive deposits reflect how elaborate public rituals formed part of a major coordination strategy: 1) the residue of a large feasting event (Offering D1) in which over 10,000 ceramic vessels were smashed and set aflame alongside foodstuffs (Figure 2); 2) a layer of a large cache of human skeletal remains totaling over 2400 bones placed in the plaza floor (Offering A1) (Figure 3); 3) a cache of fragmented Maya-style mural paintings ritually \"killed\" and scattered into the plaza floor; 4) an offering placed on the northern limit of a substructure of Mound 25C containing a rich assemblage of fine statecrafts. Exotic commodities (tobacco, yucca), ceramics with distinctly foreign iconography, Maya-style mural fragments, and inclusion of non-local species (spider monkey) as sacrificial victims all suggest these events incorporated both local and non-local participants. A multi-disciplinary specialist team is presently analyzing these remains to assess places of manufacture/origin, production techniques, and the social identity of the individuals occupying the Plaza of the Columns. Many of these valuable artifacts and goods are considered cultural patrimony of Mexico.</p>\n<p>Based on these four research outcomes, we conclude PPCC was an important civic-administrative complex with a number of notable characteristics which set it apart from many of the other \"palatial\" compounds along the Avenue the Dead. First, it was primarily constructed as a public space dedicated to marshalling large public events, with little to no evidence of permanent residential facilities. Given the absence of residential burials, the skeletal remains recovered thus far have been interpreted as evidence of public ritual activities or offerings. The restricted individuals that would have occupied the space had ample power to coordinate grand public spectacles attracting a cosmopolitan audience that included foreign dignitaries.</p>\n<p>One of the broader impact statements of this project is a commitment to train and develop long-term collaborations with a diverse array of over one hundred students, outside specialists, and local community members. These project members represent a total of twelve institutions spanning the United States, Mexico, Japan, France, and Germany. A total of 34 students have participated in our project thus far. These include student undergraduate and graduate volunteers, as well as students earning laboratory RA credits towards their degree, fieldwork credit, as well as laboratory RA?s hired through the undergraduate OSCAR program. We pride ourselves in incorporating many underrepresented groups among our student participants, including Mexican (majority), female (over 50% of archaeologists and students), and other minorities (n=3). Two MA and two BA theses in the US and Mexico were completed on PPCC data, with others in progress. Our inclusive attitude towards professional training is evident in the lineup of 19 student co-authors for the 2018 session.</p>\n<p>Project results are disseminated through various media channels; primarily through our project website and Facebook page. Since the launch of our website well over 21,000 visitors from 112 countries have viewed our website, where we update the public on our progress and the schedule of presentations we hold in diverse venues. We publish blogs posted directly by our student participants in which they recount their experiences as members of this dynamic multidisciplinary project.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 04/25/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Nawa&nbsp;Sugiyama</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1638525/1638525_10379108_1556215984304_Fig1_PPCCmap--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1638525/1638525_10379108_1556215984304_Fig1_PPCCmap--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1_PPCC Maps\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1638525/1638525_10379108_1556215984304_Fig1_PPCCmap--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1_PPCC Maps\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Two types of maps generated by PPCC (left) detail of the ceremonial center on the LiDAR map, and (right) AutoCAD map of excavations.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Project Plaza of the Columns Complex</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (restricted use - cannot be shared)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Nawa&nbsp;Sugiyama</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 1_PPCC Maps</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1638525/1638525_10379108_1556216229250_Figure7_OfrendaD1_niveli--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1638525/1638525_10379108_1556216229250_Figure7_OfrendaD1_niveli--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 2_Offering D1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1638525/1638525_10379108_1556216229250_Figure7_OfrendaD1_niveli--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 2_Offering D1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Offering D1, example of a level during 2016 field season.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Project Plaza of the Columns Complex</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Nawa&nbsp;Sugiyama</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 2_Offering D1</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1638525/1638525_10379108_1556216950097_Fig3_OfferingA1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1638525/1638525_10379108_1556216950097_Fig3_OfferingA1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 3_Offering A1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1638525/1638525_10379108_1556216950097_Fig3_OfferingA1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 3_Offering A1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Offering A1, general view and close up of an articulated torso (Layer 20a level 3, EL-A080).</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Project Plaza of the Columns Complex</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (restricted use - cannot be shared)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Nawa&nbsp;Sugiyama</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 3_Offering A1</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
