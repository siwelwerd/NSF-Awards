 "awd_abstract_narration": "The increased demand for wireless communications over the last 25 years has led to the emergence of a new national priority: dynamic sharing of the radio spectrum among different stakeholders.  Users with different rights and priorities must now collaborate to share a common resource without interfering with each other.  A reliable enforcement regime that ensures rights is a way to make these rights meaningful and mitigate the associated risks.  As spectrum sharing becomes a more widely adopted paradigm for utilizing the spectrum, it will become necessary to deploy a systematic enforcement regime that can be automated to the maximum extent possible so that the enforcement processes can occur in near real time and at scale while incurring reasonable financial costs.  Much of the research and practice to date has focused on interference protection of the incumbents and on preventative (i.e., ex ante) approaches.  This research examines approaches to improving ex ante protections, detecting interference events, identifying the interfering parties, and determining how these events are best enforced and adjudicated using techniques that can be readily automated.\r\n\r\nStatic ex ante approaches (e.g., exclusion zones) are not readily adaptable to policy changes, and have high social costs.  Database-driven approaches can be more responsive to changes, but require constant connectivity with radios and may not be geographically fine-grained.  The investigators will develop the core components for enabling efficient policy-based spectrum access to reduce the social cost of ex ante enforcement. The investigators also aim to advance techniques to automate the enforcement of events after they occur, i.e., automate ex post enforcement.  This involves detection, forensic analysis and adjudication.  To automate the detection of events, the investigators will develop an efficient technique that uses mobile agents that have different roles in identifying, verifying and localizing a potentially enforceable event. The adjudication process involves identifying the non-compliant transmitters and ensuring that they comply with the necessary standards. To this end, the investigators propose to develop a transmitter identification scheme and a remote attestation scheme.  Finally, the investigators will examine the different institutional strategies for ex post enforcement (i.e., third party enforcement, self-enforcement, and cooperative mutual enforcement) with the goal of understanding under what circumstances each approach would apply to spectrum sharing. These approaches promise to improve ex ante enforcement techniques and to advance ex post enforcement processes in a way that can be used to construct a comprehensive, robust and cost-effective enforcement system.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe overarching goals of this project are to learn how the enforcement of spectrum rights can be automated.  This is important because radio spectrum is being shared more intensively over the past 15 years.  Automating the ex post enforcement of interference events promises to reduce the cost of enforcement, which will enable new forms of spectrum sharing.  We believe that the application context that is most amenable to automation occurs in situations where the spectrum users are cooperative in the sense that they expect to interact with each other again in future, either in the enforcement arena or in the commercial arena.  Thus, \"rogue\" users or \"hackers\" are excluded as an explicit target for this analysis, since these users would interact only once (or a small number of times) in an adversarial context.  That said, it is possible that the outcomes of this project may also be useful for these kind of users.  \n\nWe approached the topic of enforcement by breaking the problem into four phases.  Each phase was treated independently, though with full awareness of the findings of the other phases of the project.  The first phase involves the detection of potential interference events.  The second phase is a forensic process where we gather data about the interference event and the receiver causing the event.  The third phase includes connecting the collected information with the spectrum rights for adjudication (i.e., determination of cause).  The final phase involves determining the penalty or remuneration.  \n\nThe first phase develops a spatio-temporal database of radio transmissions in the region under study.  While this is nothing new, most prior approaches require the construction of a costly sensor network to detect radio transmissions.  We developed an approach that relies on the principles of citizen science to use volunteers to build the database.  This approach meant that we had to develop approaches to determine the trust of volunteers, to select the volunteers in a region to ensure adequate coverage, and to preserve the privacy of the volunteers and the database from external eavesdroppers.  Volunteer selection was based on an adaption of the Gayle Shipley matiching market algorithm.  Privacy of both data an volunteers were protected through the strategy of obfuscation.  While this does not provide perfect protection, it does raise the cost of intrusion. \n\nThe determination of interference occurs when a license holder claims harm.  When this occurs, the enforcement process uses the spatio-temporal database to discover transmissions that occurred at the time of the interference event and use geolocation to determine likely sources of the interference.  This evidence is provided to the adjudication process.\n\nTo understand adjudication, we studied 20 years of actions taken by the FCC's Enforcement Bureau.  This provided some insight into the centralized approaches to enforcement.  We also developed alternative approaches to enforcement as suggested by the institutional economics literature.  This literature suggests that self enforcement can be effective in some circumstances, mutual enforcement in others, in addition to the centralized approach embodied by the FCC's actions.  Our research showed that mutual enforcement could be a highly effective approach to adjudicating events.  We sought to validate this through interviews with private operators engaged in enforcement, but were unable to successfully obtain information that could be used in the public domain.  \n\nThe penalty or remuneration phase is intimately connected with the adjudication approach.  Again we relied on the institutional economics literature.  The work by Nobel prize winning economist Elinor Ostrom was particularly helpful because radio spectrum has many characteristics consistent with the commons that she studied.  Thus, the approaches to governance that she found to be successful for these kinds of systems also, we believe, apply to radio spectrum.  The agent based simulation models developed as part of this project showed that the polycentric approach championed by Ostrom was also effective in radio systems.  In fact, this approach was superior over a wide range of operating parameters.  This suggests that solving problems locally if at all possible was an effective approach to adjudicating interference. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/21/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Martin B Weiss"
