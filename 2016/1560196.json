 "awd_abstract_narration": "Earth Science on Volcanic Islands (ESVI) is a new Research Experience for Undergraduate (REU) Site hosted by the Department of Geology and Geophysics, School of Ocean and Earth Science and Technology at the University of Hawaii at M\u00e2noa.  Oceanic island formation, evolution, and sustainability are unifying themes that a group of 10 undergraduate students will explore during an exciting 9-week program.  The Hawaiian Islands, being of volcanic origin, are windows into the Earth's interior. Built by magma that has ascended roughly a hundred kilometers to reach the surface, the volcanoes subsequently experience deformation, erosion, flank collapse and eventually sink below sea level.  Oceanic islands are also sites of intense biological evolution and are ecological niches in a vast ocean.  The University of Hawaii is uniquely positioned to take advantage of these phenomena and our new program will provide cutting-edge STEM research opportunities for motivated undergraduate students, in particular traditionally underrepresented groups such as Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders, as well as students enrolled at undergraduate institutions that provide few opportunities to participate in cutting-edge research. During the first week, students will engage in a series of introductory, daylong crash-courses on quantitative analysis and modeling tools, which will enhance their abilities to conduct research. During the next eight weeks, students will work along-side individual world-class scientists (host mentors) who will guide the student through a modest yet challenging research project during an eight-week intense collaboration.\r\n\r\nFollowing the core theme of Earth science on volcanic islands, the student activities are expected to contribute to various fields of research, but more importantly, to engage motivated undergraduate students in the process of doing science and to energize them for future study in STEM-related endeavors.  The research goal of this REU is to advance the knowledge of the formation, evolution, and sustainability of ocean islands. Specifically, we will examine the growth and subsequent deformation of volcanic islands using state-of-the-art tools and methodology from petrology, geochemistry, volcanology, structural geology, seismology, and geophysics.  We will also study the hydrologic pathways for subaerial and submarine groundwater flow using geochemical tracers, as well as the biogeochemistry of marine organisms thriving in the proximity of volcanic islands.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe ESVI \"Earth Science on Volcanic Islands\" Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) has been a very successful REU Site program lead by the Department of Earth Sciences in the School of Ocean and Earth Science and Technology in the University of Hawaii at Manoa.  Our three summer programs (2017-2019) gave over 30 undergraduate students from all across the country the opportunity to visit Hawaii and engage in exciting research opportunities, many of which could only be done in Hawaii.  Each student was paired with a world-class scientist working in their field of expertise and undertook original research over a 9-week period.  In addition to the daily research engagement, the cohort had numerous experiences unique to the University of Hawaii.  We began each summer with a cohort-building geologic fieldtrip to the Big Island, led by an expert team of volcanologists.  These trips allowed for good cohort bonding plus exposure to the unique geologic setting of the Big Island where students learned firsthand volcanological principles.  We were also fortunate to be able to offer participating students a 3-day oceanographic expedition on the R/V Kilo Moana, surveying the seafloor near Oahu and engaging the students in sample collection, multibeam mapping, and geophysical data gathering at sea.  Some even found their sea legs by the end of the cruise!\n\nThe essence of our REU was to provide underrepresented STEM students a chance to see what a life in science entails, exposure to unique Hawaii\u2019s unique research environment, and professional development opportunities as well as one-on-one mentoring.  From the feedback we received from our 30+ students to date, we can confidently say that REU programs are watershed events in the life of young STEM students.  Prior to an REU, most have not made the connection between their studies and the opportunities that await them after graduation, especially those from institutions with limited opportunities for engaging in research.  The vast majority of our participants have chosen to continue their studies in Earth or Ocean science through graduate school and we are proud to have played a small role in setting them on their journey.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/05/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Paul Wessel"
