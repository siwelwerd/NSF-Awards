 "awd_abstract_narration": "Infants' limited ability to communicate makes it difficult to know what they are thinking. Researchers often measure babies' visual attention as a way to infer their understanding and interest. However, knowing that infants prefer to look at one display versus another does not necessarily indicate why they prefer it.   Some attentional preferences are driven by how much the infant seems to like the stimulus, referred to as its reward value. Other preferences are driven by infants' desire to take in new information and learn more about the world.  The goal of the proposed research is to study different patterns in babies' brain activity to determine which of these two reasons, reward value or information value, explains their attentional preferences.  \r\n\r\nThe proposed experiments will use functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to measure hemodynamic responses to neural activity in medial and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex while infants watch and listen to two different speakers.  In some experiments, the speakers will differ in how friendly and infant-directed their speech is (i.e., social reward), while in others they will differ in how richly structured the content of their speech is (i.e., information value).  All experiments will end by testing to which speaker the infants prefer to attend and/or how much they have learned about the presented speech patterns.  These experiments will test the hypotheses that activation in medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) is associated with social reward value and activation in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) is associated with information value.  Moreover, they will assess the extent to which activation in MPFC and DLPFC during stimulus presentation predict subsequent social preference and statistical learning, respectively. The project will also involve scientific training of students from underrepresented groups and underprivileged backgrounds, and conducting information sessions for new parents about infant brain development.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n \nIn the first two years of life, human infants make remarkable progress in understanding and interacting with the physical and social world.  This rapid development is likely only possible because infants are active learners, who attend more to informative scenes, and also active social partners, who engage more with responsive and friendly caregivers.  Thus, young infants\u2019 control of their own gaze is a central tool in their early learning and social development. Yet, fundamental questions about infant gaze remain unanswered.  How do infants decide where to look?  \n\nHere, we reason that distinct cognitive processes driving infant looking should correspond to activity in distinct brain regions.  The neural circuits responsive to social value and to novel, abstract information are at least partially distinct.  Social reward and close social partners elicit activity in cortical regions including medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) while new statistical associations elicit activity in regions including lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC).  If infant prefrontal cortex is similarly organized, then activity in infant MPFC may predict looking toward preferred social partners, whereas activity in infant LPFC may predict looking to novel information.  \n\n We used functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to measure prefrontal activation while 6- to 12-month-old infants watched movies of a person speaking to them. Some infants saw one friendly and one neutral speakers, both saying the same syllable over and over. Other infants saw two neutral speakers, but only one was speaking in patterns of syllables that the infants could learn.\n\nAs we predicted, different regions of the infants' prefrontal cortex were active, depending on which speakers the infants saw.  In left medial prefrontal cortex, there was higher activation to the friendly versus the neutral speaker. There were also systematic differences between infants: the more the activity in left medial prefrontal cortex during the videos, the more the the infant looked towards the same speaker later. \n\nA different brain region predicted longer looking based on the learned pattern of syllables. The more activity in left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex infants showed to the patterned speech, the more the infant looked, later, to new speech that violated the established pattern.\n\nThis double dissociation has three implications: it indicates that longer infant looking can be driven by diverse motives that map onto distinct neural systems; it identifies neural signatures that can be used to distinguish infants\u2019 interest in affiliating with versus learning from social partners; and it demonstrates behaviorally-relevant organization of prefrontal cortex function in the first year of life.\n\nOne implication of these results is that infants\u2019 active choices of where to look and for how long reflect distinct motivations, associated with distinct neural systems. We used neural activity to differentiate two of infants\u2019 motives for looking, but we expect that other motives also exist; for example, longer looking could also reflect vigilance towards potential threats. By contrast, contemporary artificial learning systems, even those designed to \u2018learn like a child\u2019, are typically designed to explore the world while pursuing a single overarching objective (\"curiosity\"). Our results imply that human-like learning relies on multiple, complementary systems for engaging with the environment.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/17/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Rebecca Saxe"
