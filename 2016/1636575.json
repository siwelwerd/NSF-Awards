 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ocean's midwater realm is the next frontier for underwater robots.  The mesopelagic or \"twilight\" zone encompasses depths from 200 to 1000 meters where sunlight is dim. This vast region plays a key role in regulating ocean chemistry and biology, which in turn strongly effects global climate. The mesopelagic zone holds much of our planet's fish populations as well as poorly understood processes that couple the ocean surface to the seafloor including vertical fluxes of plankton, organic and inorganic particles, bubbles, and droplets. Mesopelagic features are often mobile, patchy, and ephemeral, so surveys and sampling can be very difficult.  Recent studies have found that mesopelagic biomass including fish are dramatically underestimated, yet investigations of patterns and processes in this region are strongly constrained by available technology.\r\n\r\nThis program will produce a unique new robot that will enable unprecedented scientific access to midwater environments, complementing existing survey and sampling tools. The robot will use cameras, lights, and oceanographic sensors to autonomously track slow-moving individual targets such as migrating mid-water animals, descending particles, and rising bubbles and droplets without disturbing those targets. It will also have the ability to detect and follow fine-scale oceanographic features such as thin layers that hold critical nutrients. Finally, the robot will take samples utilizing on-board intelligence to determine precisely when and where to sample. Under this program, the robot will be built and tested under a collaboration between the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute, Stanford University, and the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley.",

We designed, built, and tested a new type of marine robot specifically to advance the scientific exploration of the midwater ocean. The midwater ocean or \"twilight zone\" hosts abundant animal life and plays a key role in the global carbon cycle, thereby regulating Earth's climate and the biogeochemistry of its oceans. Many midwater animals spend daylight hours at great depth (hundreds of meters), presumably to avoid predators, and rise to near-surface depths at night to feed on abundant life found in waters that are sunlit in the day. Our ability to study patterns and processes in this region are limited by our available technological tools. We conceived <em>Mesobot</em> to fill that gap.</p>\n<p>We began by reviewing existing underwater scientific exploration tools in order to identify clear gaps that our new robot could address. &nbsp;Our present set of tools &nbsp;include nets that are lowered or towed from a research vessel, a number of remotely operated and autonomous vehicles that can image animals, take samples, and make oceanographic measurements, and a variety acoustic sensors that can help characterize midwater life. We also identified a number of specialized camera systems that can photograph midwater animals such as zooplankton (jellyfish, squid, krill, etc). Each of these tools are effective but have limitations and biases. Most tools also influence the animals we are trying to study, for example underwater vehicles may cause some animals to flee while attracting others.</p>\n<p>We identified a clear need for a robotic system that could observe &nbsp;midwater animals for extended periods of time to enable behavioral studies. Such a vehicle should be remotely operated through a thin tether to enable skilled pilots to aid in locating interesting targets. After targets are located, the vehicle should be able to follow the animals autonomously using its cameras. The vehicle should be \"stealthy\" to avoid either causing some animals to flee or attracting others. Such a vehicle should also be capable of other types of surveys and should have the ability to take samples.</p>\n<p>In collaboration with our entire team of engineers, and scientists, we designed and built <em>Mesobot</em>. The 250 kg (500 lb) robot carries three cameras: a high-quality low-light video camera and a pair of stereo cameras interfaced to a high-performance embedded computing system. The vehicle can be controlled as an ROV using a very thin (3mm, 1/8\") diameter fiber-optic tether. After a target is located, the vehicle can track it automatically. The tether can be released and the vehicle can continue to track the target autonomously. We demonstrated this capability in a test tank and on two cruises in Monterey Bay. We demonstrated the ability to track a moving jellyfish (the \"dinner plate\" jellyfish <em>Solmissus)</em> and a drifting gelatinous animal called a Larvacean. Our efforts to observe the animals without disturbing them were largely successful. We identified areas for improvement, for example our tracking algorithms need to be better at maintaining tracking when other animals enter the visual field and those algorithms must regain tracking if the target is lost.</p>\n<p>We also used <em>Mesobot</em> for other types of surveys on two other cruises, one in the Gulf of Mexico and the other in the Northwest Atlantic. On these cruises the vehicle made video transects, collected environmental DNA samples, and measured oceanographic parameters as deep as 850 meters.</p>\n<p>The <em>Mesobot</em> project also served a foundational role in a major new initiative to study the midwater ocean. The Ocean Twilight Zone project at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution is funded by the Audacious Project housed at the TED foundation. The largest private grant in the history of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, this initiative builds on the results of our NSF-sponsored work, providing opportunities for <em>Mesobot </em>to go to sea, to advance technologically, and connect to other methodologies such as molecular ecology, projects to quantify biodiversity and biomass using acoustic surveys, and efforts to quantify the role of the midwater ocean in regulating climate.</p>\n<p>Our <em>Mesobo</em>t grant, WHOI's &nbsp;Ocean Twilight Zone project, and efforts of our collaborators and research partners have featured Mesobot in a number of public engagement products. &nbsp;We have released a series of videos and web-based articles presenting <em>Mesobot</em> to a lay audience, including both its technological evolution and its scientific utilization.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 06/10/2020<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Dana&nbsp;R&nbsp;Yoerger</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1636575/1636575_10461312_1591806032213_solmissus_tracking--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1636575/1636575_10461312_1591806032213_solmissus_tracking--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Image from Mesobot\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1636575/1636575_10461312_1591806032213_solmissus_tracking--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Image from Mesobot\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">This images shows a \"dinner plate\" jellyfish from Mesobot's video camera while the robot was actively tracking the animal</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute, Stanford University, University of Texas Rio Grande Valley.</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Dana&nbsp;R&nbsp;Yoerger</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Image from Mesobot</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1636575/1636575_10461312_1591804875155_mesobot_iso--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1636575/1636575_10461312_1591804875155_mesobot_iso--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"conceptual drawing of Mesobot\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1636575/1636575_10461312_1591804875155_mesobot_iso--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"conceptual drawing of Mesobot\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Mesobot is a 250kg (550 lb) robot designed to study midwater animals.
