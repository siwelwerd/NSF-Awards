Seeking to further understand the relationship between property and dignity, this research project extends the earlier analysis to the case of squatting.  Among other things, the research will help illuminate why some populations choose to squat instead of pursing alternative accommodations, and how these risky and illegal actions may enhance or degrade their dignity.\r\n\r\nThe field-based research will focus on a case study of squatters in Detroit.  Methods include semi-structured interviews, focus group interviews, and photo elicitation interviews.  The study will 1) expand research on property rights, property takings, and squatting; 2) contribute to and extend scholarly work on legal consciousness; and 3) deepen scholarship on how and why people navigate illegality.",
