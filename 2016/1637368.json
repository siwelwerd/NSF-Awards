This workshop, taking place in Berkeley, CA on September 13-14, 2016, will provide a principled scientific and interdisciplinary foundation for research directions in the perceptual and cognitive sciences with applications to speech communication. It is intended that this workshop provide a road map for advancements in technology and therapeutics that may eliminate barriers to effective speech communication between humans and machines for a broad spectrum of the world's population.\r\n\r\nThe primary objective of the workshop is  to explore a basis for a long-term research network that will enable communication among fields related to speech and hearing. It will bring together 40 researchers from a broad range of scientific and engineering disciplines associated with speech communication. Specific topics will include the possibility of techniques to bolster the listener's comprehension of auditory scenes and improve speech comprehension. Young researchers and researchers from groups underrepresented in science will be invited to participate.  The workshop is co-funded by the Perception, Action, and Cognition Program in SBE directorate and the Robust Intelligence Program in CISE directorate.",
