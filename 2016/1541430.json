The need for leadership and technical support to extend these CI resources to the greater community is the next challenge.  Consequently, UNH is building a CI Engineer as a permanent human resource to assist in the shift of responsibility from research individuals to the CI community services that extend the CI benefits campus-wide.  The CI Engineer is a focused key technical leader to champion the UNH CI Plan and encourage the integration of CI resources with UNH researchers, academics and administrators.  With a growing need to expand CI resources for collaboration on multi-party projects, the CI Engineer is defining the vision, model, and approach through the UNH CI Plan.   Researchers see the CI Engineer as a technical resource that can be annexed to their own research team rather than have to duplicate the CI resources and personnel that exist institutionally.  Beyond the technical expertise, the CI Engineer participates in statewide, regional and national CI organizations, including the New England Research and Education Network (NEREN), the Northern Crossroads (NoX) and Internet2.  The CI Engineer maintains the pulse of the CI activity on the UNH campus, reporting to the community on the efforts achieved annually and reflecting back to the community the opportunities for future investment that will benefit all.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nAfter an eight (8) year emphasis on the development of cyberinfrastructure (CI) to support the advancement of research, the University of New Hampshire is among the national leaders with large network pathways and Science DMZ resources.  The need for leadership and technical support to extend these CI resources to the greater community is the next challenge.  Consequently, UNH participated in the experimental design of a new human resource to support CI--the CI Engineer.  Designed as an asset to shift the responsibility for computation and networking deep knowledge for scientific research from research individuals to the CI community, the CI Engineer is a focused key technical leader to champion the UNH CI Plan and encourage the integration of CI resources with UNH researchers, academics, and administrators in all disciplines of the university.  With a growing need to expand CI resources for collaboration on multi-party projects, the CI Engineer defined the vision, model, and approach through the UNH CI Plan as a result of individual engagements across the campus.  Researchers see the CI Engineer as a technical resource that can be annexed to their own research team rather than having to duplicate the CI resources and personnel that exist institutionally.\n\nIntellectual Merit:\n\nThis CC*DNI project served as the catalyst in transforming the CI-enabled research collaboration paradigm from one that causes single researchers to build their own CI teams and resources to one that uses the CI Engineer model at the onset.  We discovered that two approaches to CI Engineer services exist.  Was it better to hire a technical person who needs to learn the skills of how to reach out to people and engage them on their research, or hire a person with natural skills for reaching out and engaging people while having a lower technical skillset that could rely upon a team of other individuals to support the technical needs?  We opted the latter and resulted in research engagement with scientists that we would not have normally seen. New best practices in requirements engineering for CI investments were discovered and communicated to the larger CI community to consider what makes the right CI team approach to advancing CI-enabled research.\n\nBroader Impacts:\n\nThis project has launched a changing operating model of CI-enabled research at UNH.  Researchers have started to view CI resources as commonly available tools that are supported by a team of CI expertise coordinated by a primary consultant. Researchers see the CI Engineer as a resource that can be annexed to their own research team rather than duplicating the CI resources and personnel that exist institutionally. This approach allows a focused investment in new areas of CI impact for research including High Performance Computing (HPC), storage, data analytics, system security, and other areas identified in the current and future CI Plans and already having been deployed in the last 24 months. Through the experience of the CI Engineer, independent researchers can use that commonality as a source of engagement to consider what new science research projects should be proposed to advance science through CI.\n\nOutcomes:\n\nDuring the period of project activity, the CI Engineer focused on reaching the campus researchers not in the usual set of CI-demanding personnel.  New users to campus CI came from social science, business, analytics, liberal arts, environmental science, natural resources, and health and human services.  Several researchers were provided demonstrations of available CI resources (HPC, DTN) and began to use those resources immediately.  Others required more technical and coding support, which was available only through a relationship between the College of Life Sciences and Agriculture (COLSA) and the Research Computing Center (RCC).  Two HPC Days were held in 2017 and 2018, coinciding with the grant operating period, and were so successful that a third event was held in 2019 post-award period.  Four (4) classes of students were impacted via the CI Engineer?s presentations on the use of HPC at UNH and via XSEDE, and the CI Engineer was a very active member of the XSEDE Campus Champion program, presenting at PEARC17 and in the ES.net CI Speaker Series. \n\nIn reaching out to the marginalized researchers on campus, the breadth of disciplines aware of CI resources has increased in ways we initially did not imagine for this project.  This discovery has led to an increase in on-premises HPC resource growth, with the number of CPU cores and GPUs tripling over two years through other research awards and through targeted internal investments.  The patterns and learning that RCC and the central IT groups follow to offer the best CI resources for data-intensive research is more effective than previous attempts.  Plans are underway to engage the EPOC (Engagement and Performance Operations Center), a NSF-funded collaboration project between Indiana University and ES.net, to expand the foundational work of the CI Engineer in creating our requirements gathering process.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/28/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Scott A Valcourt"
