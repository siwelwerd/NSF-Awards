 "awd_abstract_narration": "In many important situations, analytically predicting the behavior of physical systems is not possible. For example, the three dimensional nature of physical systems makes it provably impossible to express closed-form analytical solutions for even the simplest systems. This has made experimentation the primary modality for designing new cyber-physical systems (CPS). Since physical prototyping and experiments are typically costly and hard to conduct, \"virtual experiments\" in the form of modeling and simulation can dramatically accelerate innovation in CPS. Unfortunately, major technical challenges often impede the effectiveness of modeling and simulation. This project develops foundations and tools for overcoming these challenges. The project focuses on robotics as an important, archetypical class of CPS, and consists of four key tasks: 1) Compiling and analyzing a benchmark suite for modeling and simulating robots, 2) Developing a meta-theory for relating cyber-physical models, as well as tools and a test bed for robot modeling and simulation, 3) Validating the research results of the project using two state-of-the-art robot platforms that incorporate novel control technologies and will require novel programming techniques to fully realize their potential 4) Developing course materials incorporating the project's research results and test bed.\r\n\r\nWith the aim of accelerating innovation in a wide range of domains including stroke rehabilitation and prosthetic limbs, the project is developing new control concepts and modeling and simulation technologies for robotics. In addition to new mathematical foundations, models, and validation methods, the project will also develop software tools and systematic methods for using them. The project trains four doctoral students; develops a new course on modeling and simulation for cyber-physical systems that balances both control and programming concepts; and includes an outreach component to the public and to minority-serving K-12 programs.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe overarching goal of this project was to accelerate the virtual experimentation that is central to innovative cyber-physical system (CPS) design.  Special focus was given to robotic systems as represented by mechanical systems with hybrid dynamics&mdash;a domain that is highly representative of CPS design in general.  In this application domain, the scientific contributions centered around developing a mathematical framework for translating formal guarantees to hardware, their evaluation in simulation environments and the ultimate realization on multiple robotic testbeds.  The end result was a feedback loop between theory, hardware design, simulation and experiments.  This was evidenced by the implementation on robots of progressing complexity able to achieve increasingly dynamic behaviors, with the final outcome being the realization of dynamic walking on a humanoid robot and running on a bipedal robot. \n\nThe formal results of this project were focused on understanding the gap between theory and experiments.  In particular, the construction of a mathematical framework for translating theoretic results supported by theorems and proofs of correctness to experimental robotic platforms.  This involved understanding the synthesis of dynamic walking gaits and transitions between these gaits&mdash;this gives provably stable robotic walking gaits through the use of a novel form of control Lyapunov function (CLF).  To synthesize controllers on the hardware that mirror those in simulation, the framework of CLFs for hybrid systems was coupled with existing notions related to input-to-state stability (ISS), resulting in ISS-CLFs.   This framework guided the construction of onboard controllers that realize dynamic behaviors on robotic systems, even in the presence of uncertainty in the model and sensing.   The end result was the ability to practically translate mathematically justified CLF based control methodologies to hardware.\n\nTo demonstrate the theoretic results of this project, they were realized experimentally on a variety of bipedal walking robots of increasing complexity in design and function.  This began with the custom-built bipedal robots AMBER 1 and 2, in which the design process was combined with controller synthesis, virtual and experimental evaluation.  This process resulted in the ability to achieve dynamic walking and dancing.  The lessons learned on these platforms informed the design and control algorithm infrastructure for the spring legged DURUS humanoid robot and the planar DURUS-2D bipedal robot.  Dynamic walking realized on DURUS was evaluated through the framework of ISS-CLFs, which were used to guide the experimental realization of robotic running on DURUS-2D.  This was made possible through the formal results of this project, and their ability to bridge the gap between theory and experiments. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/09/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Aaron D Ames"
