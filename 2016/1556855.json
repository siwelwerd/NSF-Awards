 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study will examine how environmental conditions that alter patterns of gene expression and are passed to offspring can influence the process of evolution. Environmental conditions can cause changes in the characteristics of individuals, including their morphology, physiology, development, and behavior. Such environmental effects can be ephemeral, or they can persist for whole lifespans or even beyond a single generation. Studying such effects is central to our understanding of the process of evolution, especially as it might be affected by climate change. Epigenetics refers to mechanisms that alter how genetic sequences are translated into functional gene products, and certain epigenetic mechanisms have been implicated in environmental effects on the characteristics of individuals. It has been argued that epigenetic modifications that are stable across generations can be an important source of genetic variation upon which natural selection can act, and that such variation may even be non-random with respect to environmental context and adaptive value. This hypothesis raises a number of compelling questions. First, which epigenetic changes are environmentally induced, and do environment-dependent versus independent changes differ in their stability of inheritance? Second, is the stability of epigenetic alterations itself heritable? Third, is the stability of epigenetic modifications adaptive, and if so, under what conditions? Additionally, this project will train students from high school to graduate school and promote international engagement by graduate students and post-doctoral scholars.\r\n\t\r\nThe research program will use Arabidopsis thaliana to test for natural variation in the stability of genome-wide methylation states within and across generations, to test whether such stability depends on environmental conditions, and to test whether environmentally induced changes in methylation state are more or less stable than methylation that does not respond to environmental conditions. As such, it tests the prediction that environmentally-induced epigenetic changes can be an important source of heritable phenotypic variation that can contribute to adaptive evolution. Second, a QTL analysis of methylation states, their stability, and their environmental reversibility will test whether methylation stability has a genetic basis. It will also provide information on the number of methylation states that are regulated by a given QTL, and it will test whether loci that regulate methylation stability within and across generations are genetically associated with loci that regulate their environmental reversibility/stability. Finally, the research will test whether loci that regulate methylation states and their stability are also associated with adaptively significant phenotypes and with fitness itself under constant and variable environments. This research targets the stability of epigenetic changes as a key phenotype by testing whether epigenetic stability has a heritable genetic basis and whether it is adaptive under stable and variable environments.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nEnvironments experienced by recent ancestors can have persistent effects on traits of organisms in the present.  The molecular and epigenetic processes whereby ancestral environments influence present traits are diverse yet poorly characterized, and whether effects of ancestral environments are adaptive or maladaptive depend on modes of variation in environmental conditions.  This research program investigated the genetic and epigenetic mechanisms whereby effects of environments are transmitted within and across generations, and examined the phenotypic and fitness consequences of effect of present and ancestral environments.  \n\n\"Epigenetics\" refers to mechanisms that alter how DNA sequences are translated into functional gene products, and certain epigenetic mechanisms, such as DNA methylation and small-RNAs, have been implicated in environmental effects on phenotypes via their effect on gene expression.  It has been argued that epigenetic modifications that are stable across organismal generations can be an important source of heritable variation upon which natural selection can act, and that such variation may even be non-random with respect to environmental context and adaptive value.  This bold hypothesis raises a number of compelling questions.  First, which epigenetic changes are environmentally induced, and how stable are environmentally induced epigenetic changes across generations?  Second, does the stability of epigenetic alterations have a genetic basis, exhibit genetic variation, and therefore have the potential to evolve?  Third, is the stability of epigenetic modifications adaptive, and if so, under what conditions? \n\nThis research program documented that environments of individuals, their parents, and even their grandparents influenced plant phenotypes and development.  Effects of ancestral environments did not, in general, simply dissipate across successive generations. Instead, effects of ancestral environments were sometimes stronger or even in the opposite direction compared to effects of the environment experienced in the present generation.  Environments experienced in different generations, moreover, interacted to influence phenotypes; responses to ancestral environments depended on the present environment, and environments experienced by ancestors can either magnify or reduce responses to present environments. Quantitative-genetic analysis showed that the strength of the induction of an environmental effect within a given generation is not genetically correlated with the stability of that environmental effect across generations or across diverse subsequent environments, demonstrating that that the inducibility and persistence of transgenerational effects have independent genetic bases.  The additional finding that responses to ancestral and present environments differed among natural genotypes establishes that the intensity of the effect of an environment, and how long that effect persists over time and across different environments, exhibit genetic variation and therefore can themselves evolve. \nRegarding genetic and epigenetic mechanisms involved in the transmission of ancestral environmental effects, genome-wide gene-expression analysis showed that many genes respond to the thermal regime experienced in both present and past generations, indicating that some genes are responsive to environments regardless of when the environments were experienced.  However, a subset of genes responded only to environments experienced in the present, a different subset of genes responded only to parental environment, and a different subset of genes responded only to grand-parental environments.  As with the phenotypic analysis, the response of specific genes to environments did not necessarily dissipate over successive generations; instead some genes responded more strongly to parental environments than present environments, and they sometimes even responded to parent environments in the opposite direction as their response to present environments.  Therefore, although several genes appear to be involved in environmental responses regardless of the generation in which the environment was experienced, other specific genes and specific genetic pathways are involved in regulating responses to environments experienced in specific generations.\nIn plants, DNA methylation can alter gene expression, which in turn alters phenotypes.  To test whether effects of past and present environments involve DNA methylation, experimental manipulation of DNA methylation in different generations was conducted.  One study genetically and chemically altered genome-wide DNA methylation and found that disruption of methylation in maternal plants altered the effect of maternal environment on progeny traits, diminishing it in one genotype and reversing it in others.  Disruption of methylation in mothers also increased responses of progeny to their own environment under some conditions, suggesting that maternal methylation suppresses progeny responses to their own environment. Disruption of methylation in the progeny generation disrupted progeny responses to their own environment, but not responses to the maternal environment. Therefore, progeny trait expression is controlled both by parental and offspring environments and by parental and progeny epigenetic processes, specifically DNA methylation.\nCombined, this research program demonstrated that ancestral environments influence morphology, development, and fitness, and that effects of ancestral environments are not simply incidental dissipated effects of environments over time.  Instead, responses to past environment entail distinct genes and genetic pathways that appear to be actively regulated by epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation.  Moreover, genetic variation in the transmission of environmental effects indicates the persistence of ancestral environmental effects can itself evolve.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/29/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Kathleen Donohue"
