 "awd_abstract_narration": "Detecting the reflection of sound to identify the shape and structure of an object led to the discovery of ultrasound imaging systems, frequently used for medical monitoring and diagnosis. However, the use of this transformative technology in materials and engineering remains less explored. The new ultrasound imaging system acquired through the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program will enable NDSU and UND researchers to investigate the cross-talk between sound and object which, in turn, can reveal novel phenomena and interactions between biological and non-biological materials within their environment. The approach will significantly expand the multidisciplinary research conducted by the current faculty members, graduate students, and postdoctoral trainees. Above and beyond the conventional diagnostic monitoring, this NSF-supported procurement of the imaging system will be used to discover the symbiosis of biomaterials with their encapsulating structure, interactions of cells with their biological niche, and for the development of 3D-printed scaffolds for cell culture. In addition, the high-resolution ultrasound imaging instrument will be used to explore the small changes in the shape and size of nano- and micromaterials in response to biological and physical stimuli. The instrument will be used as a training and teaching platform to existing and prospective users across NDSU and UND campuses. Furthermore, the imaging system will be an essential addition to the outreach infrastructures of these universities, and will contribute to the dissemination of STEM education among Native American students of the region and high school and K-12 students.\r\n\r\nThe award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program provides support to North Dakota State University (NDSU) and the University of North Dakota (UND) to purchase a high-frequency, high-resolution, ultrasound imaging system for materials, macromolecular, and cell biology research and education. As a non-invasive modality to obtain high-resolution images of a variety of materials and microstructures, ultrasound outperforms Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Computed Tomography (CT) regarding cost, affordability, and safety. The proposed imaging system functions by calculating the difference of ultrasound impedance between the region of interest (e.g., polymer materials, cell spheroids, tumors, etc.) and the surrounding microenvironment (e.g., the scaffold for growing the cell spheroids, tissue matrix, tumor mass, etc.). The new instrument will strengthen synergy and initiate multidisciplinary collaborative research both at NDSU and UND in pharmaceutical sciences, chemistry, and engineering. The initial users of 13 faculty members, 31 graduate, and 31 undergraduate students represent a diverse ensemble of researchers with the common interest of exploring the cross-cutting capability of ultrasound imaging in materials and biological systems. We are expecting an increased participation of other researchers through the utilization of cyberinfrastructure for instrument scheduling and data transfer. Aside from advancing fundamental knowledge and understanding, the project will serve as a robust teaching modality by incorporating the results obtained via the use of this instrument into three graduate and two undergraduate courses. In addition, the project will reinforce NDSU and UND's outreach efforts that include recruiting meritorious Native-American students from North Dakota reservations to the graduate and undergraduate programs, as well as training aspiring high school and K-12 students in STEM education.",
