 "awd_abstract_narration": "Quantum information networks rely on light pulses comprised of single photons to transmit information and on quantum systems, such as electron spins, to process this information. This new technology opens the door to highly secure quantum communication networks and increased computational effi\u000eciency. Achieving these goals requires precise control of interactions between light and quantum systems. This award will investigate a unique system by combining control of individual electrons spins in a crystal and photons in a cavity, thus realizing an optical switch that can operate on single bits of information. Optical switches are an important component in quantum networks that can extend the range of communication. The researcher will work closely with Dr. Yun-Feng Xiao, a noted expert in micro-cavity photonics, at Peking University in Beijing, China. The collaboration provides access to theoretical work and training opportunities in nano fabrication as well as quantum science and technology.\r\n\r\nThis project highlights a special cavity QED system that couples negatively charged nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamond to the evanescent field of am optical mode in a microresonator via a resonant Raman Transition. This system can feature unique properties of strong coherent coupling between a photon and an electron spin, which are necessary to create photonic switches that can control the quantum state of single photons. These switches can enable the generation and distribution of quantum entanglement. The goal is to build a full quantum model for the proposed cavity QED system, which can then be scaled up to a general solution for multiple NV centers. The experimental component will fabricate and characterize asymmetric toroidal microresonators for use in future experiments. A solid-state platform can broadly impact the development of quantum networks and on-chip quantum information processing.\r\n\r\nThis award under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the Ministry of Science and Technology of China.",
