 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports research on how branch photosynthesis varies in four tropical tree species under drought and non-drought conditions. Tropical rainforests are some of the most productive and diverse biomes on Earth.  However, climate change is expected to increase the frequency and severity of droughts in tropical rainforests.  For plants to survive a drought they must continue to photosynthesize while minimizing water loss.  This study aims to understand how tropical trees utilize branch photosynthesis to minimize water loss and survive droughts.  While previous research has measured branch photosynthesis, little effort has gone into understanding or modeling branch photosynthesis under drought.  The research will be conducted at the Daintree Rainforest Observatory in Queensland, Australia, under the direction of Professor Lucas Cernusak, a world expert in branch photosynthesis.\r\n\r\nMost CO2 for photosynthesis is obtained through stomata, small pores in the leaves; however, this CO2 gain comes at the expense of water loss.  Drought severity and frequency in tropical rainforests is expected to increase with climate change, which in turn will lead to a decrease in photosynthesis and an increase in plant mortality.  Plants can minimize water loss while still photosynthesizing through branch photosynthesis, which recycles respired CO2.  The researcher will conduct field work at the Daintree Rainforest Observatory operated by James Cook University Cairns Campus.  Collaboration with Professor Cernusak, a world expert in branch photosynthesis, will be an essential component of the project.  This research will increase the knowledge of how tropical trees respond and adapt to drought stress.  Additionally, this research will provide mathematical models of branch photosynthesis that can be applied to other tree species.      \r\n\r\nThis award under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the Australian Academy of Science.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nTotal carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations in tree stems are ~30-750 times higher than current atmospheric CO2 concentrations.  In woody-tissue photosynthesis, also known as refixation, photosynthetic cells located near the bark surface utilize the high concentrations of CO2 in the stems and branches for photosynthesis.  Previous studies from trees show that refixation can contribute to net photosynthesis, and that refixation can help desert plants survive droughts.  However, refixation has only been measured in temperate and desert species.  Refixation is likely more important under drought stress and will likely become more important as the frequency and severity of droughts increase.  Additionally, refixation may influence and help control leaf photosynthesis.  This project focused on refixation and the influence of refixation on leaf photosynthesis in tropical rainforest trees at the Daintree Rainforest Observatory, Queensland, Australia.  This was accomplished by measuring rates of refixation in cut branches from four tropical tree species across a range of light-levels and by covering attached branches to prohibit refixation for between 4-6 weeks.  We found rates of refixation increased with increasing light and that branches were able to recycle up to 70% of the CO2 in the stem for photosynthesis.  We found inhibiting refixation in branches greatly inhibited leaf photosynthesis and in some cases caused branch mortality.  This study highlights the importance of refixation in tropical trees for both net photosynthesis and leaf photosynthesis.  As the frequency and severity of droughts increase in the tropics, it is important to understand how refixation may help tropical trees survive drought stress.  Additionally, this study highlights the importance of refixation to understand what controls and regulates leaf photosynthesis.      \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/21/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Samantha S Stutz"
