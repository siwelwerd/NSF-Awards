 "awd_abstract_narration": "Part 1\r\n\r\nThis proposal attempts to probe past Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) activity in galaxies. Even if the construction of complete histories of both star formation and AGN are not possible for individual galaxies, the large statistical sample will place important constraints on the changing (or lack thereof) history of galaxies and their AGN. The 3-dimensional galaxy information obtained from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) IV's Mapping Nearby Galaxies at APO (MaNGA) project will vastly increase our understanding of the interplay of AGN and galaxies.\r\n\r\nPart 2\r\n\r\nThe goal of this proposal is to better understand the relationship of central supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and their host galaxies through the SMBHs active phases. This analysis requires three key elements: 1) the ability to trace a galaxy's history; 2) the ability to trace an Active Galactic Nuclei's (AGN's) history; and 3) a spatially resolved view of these systems, since not all relevant information about galaxies (extended vs. centrally concentrated star formation, large-scale outflows of gas, motions of stars and gas, ionization regions, etc.) or AGN (jets, radio lobes) is contained in the central core. Fulfilling all three elements for more than a handful of objects is possible only now through the confluence of two new large surveys: the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) IV's Mapping Nearby Galaxies at APO (MaNGA) project for spatially resolved properties of 10,000 galaxies and the Tata Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope Sky Survey (TGSS) to provide low frequency radio data covering the entire MaNGA survey region that will reveal past radio AGN activity. By combining data from these surveys and adding state-of-the-art simulations of the radio AGN, we will be able to place statistical constraints on the time histories of galaxies and their AGN. Specifically, the PIs will investigate the following overarching questions: (1) Do the star formation histories of galaxies, and their AGN activity histories, suggest they are connected and change together over time? (2) Do the spatially resolved galaxy properties show signs of AGN feedback leading to the stopping of star formation in the galaxies?",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nMost stars visible in the night sky belong to our own Milky Way galaxy.  In a dark sky, a diffuse band of light is visible, which is the disk of the Milky Way.  Telescopes reveal vastly more distant galaxies, each home to billions of stars.  Some are disk shaped, bluer colored, and have some young very bright stars in them.  Others are rounder, redder colored, and mostly lack young stars.  There is evidence that the blue disk galaxies eventually transform into the red round ones.  How this happens is an area of active research around the world. \n\nIn this research, we explore the cause of this transition by investigating the role played by the supermassive black holes that live at the centers of most galaxies.  If these black holes are \"fed\" with gas, dust, or stars, they awaken.  The awake black holes, or active galactic nuclei (AGN for short), may profoundly impact a galaxy's life cycle by blowing out or heating up the gas -- the material from which new stars form -- thereby shutting off star formation in the galaxy or keeping it off for a period of time.  An image of an active galaxy is shown in Figure 1.  We conduct this work using radio telescope observations of the AGN (that tell us what the black hole has been doing now and in the past), visible light telescope observations of the galaxies (that tell us what the stars have been doing now and in the past), and finally supercomputer simulations to help us make sense of what all these data are trying to tell us. \n\nOur approach compares the activity timelines of both the supermassive black hole and of when stars formed throughout the galaxy.  Does the activity tend to happen at the same time, or do the timelines suggest that when one starts the other stops?  We are studying a sample of 39 galaxies that contain AGN, pictured in Figure 2.  The images in the left panel are the galaxies as viewed in visible light, while the images in the right panel are the same objects viewed in radio light.  The AGN launch radio jets that extend to scales far outside the galaxy itself.  It is the interaction of these jets passing through the galaxy that we expect may regulate the formation of new stars. \n\nFinal details of the research are still being completed, but two major outcomes have already resulted.  The first is an observation that the star formation shuts down in at least one galaxy when its supermassive black hole becomes active, shown in Figure 3.  The central panel shows the timeline comparison.  The horizontal axis is age, or lookback time in millions of years (Myr); present time begins at 0 Myr on the left and proceeds into the past toward the right.  The gray bars represent the ages of the AGN present in the ejected plasma of its radio jets.  AGN activity peaks around 50 Myr ago, decreases by around 25 Myr ago, and starts back up less than 5 Myr ago.  The symbols and dashed line represent the star formation history of the galaxy.  Star formation is rather low while the AGN is most active, dramatically increases after AGN activity dies down, then stops when the AGN wakes up again and becomes active in the most recent time bin.  Around the perimeter of the figure are maps of where stars are forming in the galaxy at a series of time steps throughout this period; the time in Myr is noted in the lower right of each panel.  Not much star formation is happening at the center of the galaxy when the AGN is active (15-33 Myr).  However, at 11.5 Myr, during the time when the AGN activity has diminished, new stars are forming at the nucleus of the galaxy.  Star formation begins to decrease at 8 Myr, is less at 3.8 Myr, and completely stopped by 1 Myr, when the AGN reawakened. \n\nThe second major outcome is a new way to estimate when the radio jet from the AGN turned off.  Our timeline tells us how long ago activity started, but not its duration.  By studying the spatially resolved ages of AGN jets simulated on a supercomputer, we developed an AGN jet timing diagram, shown in Figure 4.  The left panels show a radio image and our age analysis of it. The right panel plots the average of all the ages as a function of the spread in ages.  The black line is determined from simulations; the red triangles are observed objects analyzed the same way.  The object's distance from the line tells how long ago the jet shut down.  This knowledge significantly improves our ability to determine how AGN jets have interacted with the galaxy to regulate its star formation history.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/30/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Marsha J Wolf"
