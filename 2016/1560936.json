 "awd_abstract_narration": "This workshop will bring together researchers from around the world to identify and explore the grand challenges in experimental soft condensed matter science. The study of soft matter embraces a vast array of topics.  It includes, but is not limited to, liquid crystals, polymers, colloids, foams and other complex fluids, granular matter, fluid mechanics, rheology, pattern formation, meta-materials, self assembly, active matter, jamming and glasses, surfactants, some aspects of biological matter, membranes and nano-materials.  In essence, it includes any area in condensed matter that does not necessarily require for its investigation the use of quantum mechanics.  It has a home in physics, chemistry, chemical and mechanical engineering, materials science and applied mathematics.  It has implications for areas of science as far afield as astrophysics on the largest scales and nuclear physics at the smallest. This workshop, whose results will appear in a formal report, will capture the excitement and promise of this rapidly growing field of research.",
