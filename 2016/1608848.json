This program supports research that is focused on elucidating the properties of new class of electronic materials, called Weyl materials (semimetals and possible superconductors), and offer undergraduate students opportunity to learn about novel quantum states of matter through both a seminar course and hands on laboratory research experience. The research program uses advanced atomic scale imaging tools to probe Weyl materials with unprecedented resolution and will use these findings to test theoretical models of electronic behavior in these materials. Graduate and undergraduate students are trained to carry out the proposed research agenda using sophisticated state-of-the-art scanning tunneling microscopy instrumentation. Under this project, the PI is also developing a seminar class for freshman undergraduates to expose them to broad field of quantum materials, their potential application for advancing electronics, and their importance in discoveries of new phases of matter.\r\n\r\nTechnical Abstract:\r\nThis research project consists of using advanced scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy techniques to elucidate the key topological properties of bulk and surface quasi-particles in Weyl semimetals and to determining the nature of superconductivity in Weyl materials, introduced for example through proximity with a conventional superconductor. Demonstration of topological protection in Weyl systems is currently one of the key goals in studies of this new class of materials. Spectroscopic imaging with STM, as previously demonstrated on a wide range of topological materials, is a unique tool to achieve this fundamental goal. New type(s) of superconducting states may be realized in Weyl systems in their bulk because of the chiral nature of carriers or at their surface because of the unusually arced Fermi surface with spin texture. These studies will add considerable information to our understanding of topological phases of matter in materials. The freshman research seminar being developed as part of this program will introduce student to a wide range of quantum phases from those in cold atomic gases to novel topological phases discovered in recent years.",
