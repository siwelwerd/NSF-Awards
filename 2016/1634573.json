 "awd_abstract_narration": "Variations in the composition of seawater have important implications for Earth climate and biological processes in the ocean because of their relation to the carbon cycle. Specifically, the history of calcium concentration in the ocean over the Cenozoic (past ~65 million years) is tightly linked to chemical weathering of silicate and carbonate rocks on land and the precipitation and dissolution of carbonate minerals in the ocean, processes that control long-term changes in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration and thus strongly influence global climate.  Given the current acceleration of biogeochemical cycling due to the increase in greenhouse gases, these past processes may provide insights to future conditions that have no modern analogs. This research seeks to develop a new method of reconstructing variability in calcium in the oceans using comparison to seawater sodium concentrations, which are thought to be constant on timescales of many tens of millions of years. The project is funded through a special opportunity for U.S.-Israeli collaboration in ocean sciences. The project will train a U.S. post-doc and two Israeli graduate students who will spend time at both labs and will interact with the two principal investigators. The project also involves several undergraduate students who will be trained in various laboratory activities. \r\n\r\nSpecifically, this research will provide a new method to reconstruct Cenozoic seawater calcium concentrations ([Ca]) using foraminiferal Na/Ca. Culture experiments (led by the Israeli team) and core top calibrations (led by the U.S. team) will be undertaken to further validate preliminary observations and generate records of Na/Ca and other elemental ratios in benthic foraminifera as means for reconstructing Cenozoic seawater chemistry. Culture experiments of benthic (Operculina ammonoides, Ammonia tepida and Amphistegina lobifera) and planktonic (G. ruber and G. siphnifera) foraminifera will be used to determine the distribution coefficients of Na/Ca and the other elements discussed above at different seawater [Ca] and under variable and constant calcite saturation conditions.  The results from these experiments and core top calibrations will be used to generate a complete Na/Ca record for the last 55 Myr.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIn this proposal we have proposed that because of the long oceanic residence time of Na+ (&gt;&gt;50 Myr), variations in foraminifera Na/Ca could potentially offer a new approach to reconstruct seawater calcium through the Cenozoic.  Our culturing experiments both with shallow water benthic and planktic foraminifera confirm the principal hypothesis showing that Na/Ca ratios in the foraminiferal shells change proportionally to changes in seawater [Ca], thus lending support to the utility of this proxy for reconstructing seawater [Ca].  However, these experiments and the core tops calibrations indicate changes in salinity and [CO3] ion concentrations, exert additional influence on Na/Ca in the shells, albeit secondary to changes in [Ca]sw.  Core tops study of three species of deep-sea benthic foraminifera suggests that their Na/Ca is affected, to a small extent, by carbonate saturation state (&#8710;[CO32-]) but not temperature or salinity. Down core records of benthic foraminifera from the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, show consistently lower Na/Ca ratios in the past and increasing toward the present. We have examined the possibility that this trend is due to diagenetic effects (dissolution, recrystallization) and concluded that this is not likely the case.  Using an ad-hoc calibration for the deep ocean benthic foraminifera, we suggest that seawater [Ca] concentrations were higher in the past, decreasing from the early Oligocene through the Neogene to the present.
