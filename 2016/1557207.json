 "awd_abstract_narration": "General Audience Summary \r\n\r\nThis dissertation project uses a combination of archival and ethnographic research to examine the entangled processes of moving, making and saving plants at the Millennium Seed Bank of the Royal Botanical Gardens at Kew. The project asks how seed banking practices in a post-colonial era differ from movement of botanical specimens during earlier eras of science and governance. It will study the changes in laboratory and visualization techniques, through ten months of archival and ethnographic fieldwork in England and the United States. It will use theories from the fields of STS, environmental humanities, and visual culture, to contribute new concepts concerning agricultural innovation, food security, biodiversity preservation, and to challenge the frontiers on basic genetic science. The results of this research will be published in scholarly articles in peer-reviewed journals, and as part of a book project with an academic press; in addition, they will be disseminated to specific target communities via workshops and seminars. The results of this study will also be used to develop undergraduate curriculum that will bridge gaps between the humanities, the social sciences, and the biological sciences. In addition, new primary material such as the high resolution scans of plant patent drawings will be made available to scholars and the public via the web. \r\n\r\nTechnical Summary \r\n\r\nThe primary site of this project is Kew Garden's Millennium Seed Bank, the largest repository of cryogenically preserved plant genetics resources in the world. This project will bring to light how seed science is made at seed banks with the aim of adding value to the process and showing how it can be done better. It will do so by giving acute attention to the Seed Bank's relationship to the historical movement of plant bodies, debates around biodiversity, intellectual property, and agricultural applications. It will also examine various types of collaboration across many scales of activity, among different professions, disciplines, and scientific specialties that make seeds such widely shared objects of knowledge capable of transcending boundaries of major departments of formal scientific inquiry. The results of this project will contribute pertinent insights for important policy decisions about the fates of biodiversity, food security, and agribusiness, which all depend on the science of seeds. They will also serve in addressing pivotal questions being posed by scholars of agricultural and plant history, twentieth century US agricultural policy, intellectual property of biological materials, advocacy over rights to seeds, and visual culture.",

At the same time, all seed banking projects have been profoundly involved with state and industry interests, not just the protection of biodiversity. My central research questions are: how are seeds moved, made and stored in banks, and how do they come to have the scientific, political, and technological power to save biodiversity and by extension humanity? I focus on how ex-situ seed banking (outside of where the seeds are grown) in a post-colonial era differs in practice from earlier eras of science and governance. Understanding these differences in the practices of seed banking will shed light on changes in plant science, the law around the movement and acquisition of biological materials for science and industry, and technologies of visualization. Using a combination of ethnographic and archival research I contextualize the rise of cryogenic preservation as the conservationist technique against the backdrop of changes in environmental policy, IP law, and scientific knowledge.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\">&nbsp;After three years of coursework at UCDavis, I passed my qualifying exams and defended my dissertation prospectus in May 2014. Since then I have been conducting fieldwork to follow the collection, transport, cleaning, sorting, testing, and the final storing of seeds. My research was generously funded by a National Science Foundation (NSF) Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Research Grant, an Association of American University Women (AAUW) International Fellowship, and the Kathryn Conway Preyer Graduate Fellowship from Wellesley College. I conducted research largely within in the United Kingdom by; 1) following practices of scientists at the Millennium Seed Bank (MSB) at the Royal Botanical Gardens at Kew (the biggest bank in terms of both number of seeds and species stored), amateur seed hunters of the UK seed network, and archivists at the Kew Library; 2) reading archival resources at Kew Library, the British Library, and the University of Cambridge Library. During the last 18 months I have made short trips to other seed banks in India, USA, Norway, and Denmark to conduct interviews, go on collecting expeditions, and consult more archival sources in order to see the MSB in contradistinction to how seed banking is done elsewhere and under differing conditions and needs.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">This embedded experience in the sorting, classifying, and subsequent `saving' of seeds has made visible variegated power structures in the making of scientific knowledge with respect to species taxonomy and the future value that is ascribed to a seed. Now deeply in the thrall of dissertation writing, which will be completed by June 2018, my project will contribute to the knowledge about the investments that are being made to secure the future of humanity in an age of vulnerability and crises; both ecological, and political. As a feminist project my work serves to address some woefully underrepresented dimensions of the history of both plant and agricultural sciences, by paying attention to the practices of care at seed banks, which are both gendered and crucial to the field of seed conservation. After I publish my dissertation as a monograph, I plan to study the relationship that visualization played and continues to play in the gendering of the science of plants. I will study cases of scientific visualization ranging from watercolor paintings by women of moldy apples in the early twentieth century to contemporary Scanning Electron Microphotography (SEM) of wind-borne seeds, thinking with the growing field of new materialisms in feminist studies, disability studies, visual culture, and the history and philosophy of science, to understand the relationship between the way that visualization of plants has changed with respect to both the changing epistemic and political desires of science through the masculinization of `botany' to `plant science' and changes in technologies of visualization.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/03/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Xan&nbsp;Chacko</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1557207/1557207_10407667_1507052488143_2016-02-1214.40.14--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1557207/1557207_10407667_1507052488143_2016-02-1214.40.14--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Germination Test\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1557207/1557207_10407667_1507052488143_2016-02-1214.40.14--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Germination Test\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The Germination Test is a key feature to test the viability of seeds in the bank.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Xan Chacko</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Xan&nbsp;Chacko</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Germination Test</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1557207/1557207_10407667_1507052405982_2016-02-1215.09.07--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1557207/1557207_10407667_1507052405982_2016-02-1215.09.07--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Seeds being prepared for banking\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1557207/1557207_10407667_1507052405982_2016-02-1215.09.07--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Seeds being prepared for banking\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Seed Cleaning is a key step in preparing seeds for banking.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Xan Chacko</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Xan&nbsp;Chacko</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Seeds being prepared for banking</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1557207/1557207_10407667_1507052682599_2016-02-0216.43.04--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1557207/1557207_10407667_1507052682599_2016-02-0216.43.04--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Greenhouses\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1557207/1557207_10407667_1507052682599_2016-02-0216.43.04--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Greenhouses\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The viability and identity of seeds are verified at the greenhouses.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Xan Chacko</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Xan&nbsp;Chacko</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Greenhouses</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
