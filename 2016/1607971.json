 "awd_abstract_narration": "NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY: \r\n\r\nThis collaborative project project aims to prepare a novel class of polymeric materials that are derived from sulfur or selenium-based feedstocks.  These materials will afford advanced new polymers with special optical and thermomechanical properties that can be used as lenses, windows, or other device components for thermal imaging. in the mid-infrared range.  Infrared (IR) optical devices are widely used in optical communications, as well as in defense applications that require high-resolution imaging under conditions of pure darkness.  NSF support of this project will enable fundamental insights into the key parameters required to control the properties (optical, mechanical, thermal) of these materials that will be essential for use in IR imaging applications.  The advances from the project are anticipated to enable the creation of new IR devices and applications that are inaccessible with the inorganic materials that are currently used.  The close integration of fundamental scientific research with cutting-edge IR technological problems will serve as a broader framework to train the students working on the project and expose K-12 students to aspects of polymer science through educational outreach activities. \r\n\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL SUMMARY:\r\n\r\nThis collaborative interdisciplinary group will investigate the development of a new class of chalcogenide-based copolymers with very high refractive index (n greater than 2.0 in the visible and IR spectrum) and high IR transparency so as to afford a new class of optical polymers for use in mid-IR thermal imaging.  Infrared (IR) optical technology is widely used in optical communications as well as in military and defense applications that require high-resolution imaging under conditions of pure darkness.  Currently, synthetic polymers cannot be used as transmitting materials for mid-IR imaging applications as lenses or other device components since these materials strongly absorb IR radiation in the spectral window (3-5 micrometers) required for thermal imaging.  In the proposed research, the PIs will investigate the copolymerizations of molten elemental sulfur (S8) together with other chalcogenide comonomers to increase the refractive index of these materials.  Conversely, copolymerization of  chalcogenide monomers with trivinylic or halogenated styrenic comonomers will also be conducted to lower the C-H content in these copolymers and ultimately increase the IR transparency of the resulting optical materials in the 3-5 micrometer mid-IR regime.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe use of IR thermal imaging (i.e., ?night vision?) has long been used for a number of defense &amp; military applications.  The potential of infrared thermal imaging and detection for applications in consumer electronics, transportation, medical imaging, robotic and aerospace has also been known for decades.  However, the high cost of IR cameras &amp; detectors has impeded widespread use of these systems in consumer markets.  Research activities pursued under NSF-DMR 1607971 established the creation of the first class of synthetic polymers ever used for IR optics and retains the classical advantages of polymeric materials, which include low material costs, and favorable processing characteristics.  Our early findings demonstrated that a new class of polymeric materials, termed, Chalcogenide Hybrid Inorganic/Organic Polymers (CHIPs) possessed promising optical properties for use as inexpensive transmissive materials (e.g., lenses, windows) for IR thermal imaging.  However, there remained a strong need for fundamental structure-property polymeric materials research to develop CHIPs with enhanced refractive index, IR transparency, and improved thermomechanical properties, which was the focus of this research effort.  All of critical research targets were achieved by the creation of new variations of CHIPs IR plastics.  The success of this NSF-sponsored project was most readily evidenced by several high impact scientific publications, numerous high profile invited lectures and the training of excellent graduate and undergraduate students supported by the project.  Dr. Tristan Kleine received his Ph.D. in Chemistry at the University of Arizona while supported on this grant, along with Katrina Konopka, who while an undergraduate researcher on the project co-authored numerous scientific papers and has been widely recognized for her undergraduate research (1st Prize from American Chemical Society, POLY Division for Undergraduate Research in Polymer Science Symposium Award, 2020 recipient of NSF Graduate Research Fellow).  The impact of the project has also led to translation of this project into a joint collaboration of the University of Arizona and University of Delaware team with Raytheon Missiles Systems for a NSF-Partnerships for Innovation Program.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/10/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jeffrey Pyun"
