 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project, theory and applications of efficient approximations of the Channel State Information (CSI) in Wi-Fi networks, which describes the key characteristics of the wireless links, will be developed. The approximation will exploit the underlying structure of the CSI and will require very few parameters, resulting in highly effective CSI compression and measurement methods, as well as new data transmission techniques, which will significantly improve the efficiency of Wi-Fi networks and enable more applications and more opportunities in education, public health, and business that increasingly depend on the high speed and reliability of wireless networks. Fundamental issues that will be addressed include: finding the theoretical explanation of the approximation, designing fast CSI compression algorithms, designing more efficient CSI measurement and prediction methods, and designing novel data transmission techniques. The knowledge gained in this project will advance the research field by revealing important features of a large class of wireless channels that were previously unnoticed, and developing optimized methods for such channels. Results obtained in this project will be used in classes related to networking. Both graduate and undergraduate students will participate in this project, and students from underrepresented and minority groups will be actively reached out to and recruited. \r\n\r\nThis project is motivated by an interesting experimental discovery, which shows that the CSI vectors in Wi-Fi networks can be approximated very well in many case as the linear combination of very few, such as 3, sinusoids, even when the number non-negligible paths are much larger. Referring to channels with such SParse Sinusoid (SPS) approximation as SPS channels, the goals of this project include: 1) understanding the theoretical foundation regarding to the existence of the SPS approximation for MIMO channels by studying the mathematical properties of channel and designing fast CSI compression algorithms, 2) designing efficient CSI measurement and prediction methods by exploiting underlying structure of the SPS approximation, and 3) designing new data modulation techniques for SPS channels by exploiting the simplified representation of the channel. The proposed algorithms and techniques will be implemented in experimental platforms and tested in real-world wireless channels. By removing the bottleneck caused by the high overhead in CSI feedback and measurement, the outcomes of this research will be timely solutions for Wi-Fi networks for better supporting MU-MIMO or massive MIMO. The new data modulation techniques for SPS channels will likely improve the link speed while reducing the complexity.",

Zhenghao Zhang mathematically proved that the fundamental reason for the sparsity is that a sinusoid on any frequency can be approximated very well by the linear combination of a small number of base sinusoids which are on constant frequencies. Although the CSI is the linear combination of potentially a large number of sinusoids, each coming from a physical signal propagation path, all such sinusoids can be approximated by the same set of base sinusoids, hence, the CSI can also be approximated. With the discovery of this mathematical theorem, novel algorithms and techniques have been designed, covering CSI compression, CSI estimation, and data modulation, as planned in the project proposal.</p>\n<p>The first major result is a CSI compression algorithm, referred to as CSIApx. In wireless networks, such as Wi-Fi, the CSI is typically measured at the receiver, but is needed by the sender for choosing transmission parameters. The Wi-Fi protocol provides a compression algorithm to reduce the overhead of transmitting the CSI from the receiver back to the sender. CSIApx can be used to replace the existing CSI compression algorithms in Wi-Fi and other wireless networks alike to achieve higher compression ratio and accuracy. &nbsp;CSIApx is based the mathematical foundation mentioned earlier. It approximates the CSI vector as the linear combination of a small number of base sinusoids on constant frequencies, and uses the complex coefficients of the base sinusoids as the compressed CSI. CSIApx enjoys very low computation complexity, because key steps in the compression can be pre-computed due to the constant frequencies of the base sinusoids. CSIApx has been tested extensively with both experimental and synthesized Wi-Fi channel data, and the results confirm that CSIApx can achieve very good compression ratio with little loss of accuracy. A US patent was issued for CSIApx in 2019.</p>\n<p>The second major result is ParEst, which stands for Parallel Estimation, and is a method for the simultaneous estimation the CSI of multiple transmitters. In wireless networks such as Wi-Fi and LTE/5G NR, CSI estimation is a key step to ensure reliable communications, because data modulation and demodulation depend on the accuracy of the CSI. Typically, certain special symbols are transmitted at reserved resources to allow the receiver to estimate the CSI. With the advent of multiple antenna systems, it is preferable to estimate the CSI of multiple antennas simultaneously. ParEst estimates the CSI from all antennas jointly by solving an optimization problem. The complexity is very low, because the base sinusoids are on constant frequencies and many steps can be pre-computed. ParEst is much more accurate and efficient than the existing methods for estimating the CSI from multiple antennas.

The Zenith scheme modulates data on 2-Dimensional (2D) sinusoids, where the dimensions are the frequency domain and the antenna domain, respectively. The Zenith scheme is an open-loop scheme, i.e., does not need the receiver feedback; however, it achieves much better performance than the existing closed-loop solutions in certain types of channels, such as when the spatial correlation is high. The Zenith scheme is also motivated by the fact that typical wireless channels are sparse in the frequency domain, resulting in low correlations, hence better separation, between the CSI of data modulated on different 2D sinusoids.</p>\n<p>These research results will enable faster and more reliable wireless networks, which are playing increasingly more important roles in education, business, and everyday lives.
