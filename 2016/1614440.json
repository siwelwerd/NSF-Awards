 "awd_abstract_narration": "The overarching goal of the proposed research is to gain insight for the development of a bio-inspired plant root foundation. This will require the researcher to investigate how the roots of plants anchor the plant in the soil and how they resist external loads such as pullout from herbivores, compression from self-weight and rain or bending from high winds. Consequently, if a conventional building foundation can be enhanced to improve their efficiency in terms of volume of material used, the structure will not only cost less, but will require less concrete and steel, which has many environmental implications. This project will be conducted at the Port and Airport Research Institute in Yokosuka, Japan under the guidance of Dr. Satoshi Matsumura. \r\n\r\nIn particular, the research seeks to analyze the soil displacement field when a root analog, fabricated using 3D printing, is loaded under tension or compression. The disturbed soil zone will be characterized by using a particle tracking image analysis scheme, where 3D images will be acquired at set increments during the loading process. Additionally, knowledge of the surface failure during tensile loading and the region contributing to the bearing capacity of the soil during root compression will serve to inform analytical models to predict the capacity of the root foundations under the two loading conditions. Furthermore, this project seeks to develop a fundamental understanding of the mechanical behavior of buried plant root-type systems at the particle level, which can then be easily expanded to field-scale applications.\r\n\r\nThis award under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is funded jointly by NSF and the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science.",

For this particular award, the purpose of the research, conducted at the Port and Airport Research Institute in Yokosuka, Japan, was to analyze the global failure mechanism and soil displacement during uplift of a fibrous root system analog. Knowledge of the failure mechanism is mandatory for a robust prediction of the ultimate and residual pullout capacities of a root system; even more so, the pullout resistance serves as a metric to compare root system structures of varying geometry. For this experimental endeavor, root system analogs were embedded in sand, and at various increments of displacement in the pullout process, an X-ray micro-computed tomography (X-ray &micro;CT) scanner captured 3D image sets. Utilizing digital image correlation (DIC), maps of local shear strain within the soil were calculated, which elucidate failure surfaces since soil fails in shear. The failure surfaces were determined for four distinct root analogs in three different soil types. Analysis of the three-dimensional failure surfaces revealed the significance of soil arching to the ultimate uplift capacity for these low stress conditions. The research provides a novel three-dimensional dataset perhaps beneficial to both geotechnical engineers as well plant root researchers, such as agronomists and plant biologists. For example, the study corroborates with previous geotechnical research on the shape of failure surfaces in pullout tests in plane strain, yet offers new insight into the possible variances apparent only in three-dimensions. As well, for plant root scientists, evidence of actual failure mechanisms of root analogs, might assist in their effort to improve the resistance of crops to lodging and windthrow.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the award allowed for the initiation of a mutually beneficial collaboration between researchers at PARI and the PI as well as faculty at Georgia Tech. Furthermore, the PI has disseminated the results of the research to various audiences, including a presentation at the 2017 Geofrontiers Conference, a publication in the Journal of Structural Integrity and Maintenance, and various presentations to colleagues involved with the NSF-funded Center for Bio-mediated and Bio-inspired Geotechnics (CBBG). Additionally, the research offered the opportunity for the principal investigator to explore and enhance his skillset regarding contemporary experimental techniques, including 3D printing, X-ray &micro;CT, and DIC.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 06/01/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Seth&nbsp;D&nbsp;Mallett</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1614440/1614440_10439073_1496343258579_n6a30_2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1614440/1614440_10439073_1496343258579_n6a30_2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Failure Surface of Fibrous Root System Analog\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1614440/1614440_10439073_1496343258579_n6a30_2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Failure Surface of Fibrous Root System Analog\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Image of shear strain map superimposed on top of 2D X-ray slice (dark blue = lowest magnitude shear strain, red = highest magnitude shear strain)</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Seth Mallett</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Seth&nbsp;D&nbsp;Mallett</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Failure Surface of Fibrous Root System Analog</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1614440/1614440_10439073_1496342330678_Soilcontainer--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1614440/1614440_10439073_1496342330678_Soilcontainer--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Soil Container and Loading Device\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1614440/1614440_10439073_1496342330678_Soilcontainer--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Soil Container and Loading Device\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Image of soil container, constructed of clear acrylic, and loading device, instrumented with a LED-based displacement sensor and load cell</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Seth Mallett</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Seth&nbsp;D&nbsp;Mallett</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Soil Container and Loading Device</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1614440/1614440_10439073_1496342452273_X-ray--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1614440/1614440_10439073_1496342452273_X-ray--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"X-ray micro-CT scanner\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1614440/1614440_10439073_1496342452273_X-ray--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"X-ray micro-CT scanner\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Image of X-ray micro-CT scanner (flat panel detector on left, rotating stage in center, X-ray source on right)</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Seth Mallett</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Seth&nbsp;D&nbsp;Mallett</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">X-ray micro-CT scanner</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1614440/1614440_10439073_1496340464617_Japananalogs--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1614440/1614440_10439073_1496340464617_Japananalogs--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Fibrous Root System Analogs\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1614440/1614440_10439073_1496340464617_Japananalogs--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Fibrous Root System Analogs\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Image of the 3 3D printed analogs and the 1 additional analog (1) 6 branches, 45 degree splay, 2) 6 branches, 30 degree splay, 3) 3 branches, 30 degree splay, 4) unbraided rope)</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Seth Mallett</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Seth&nbsp;D&nbsp;Mallett</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Fibrous Root System Analogs</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
