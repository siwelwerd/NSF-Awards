 "awd_abstract_narration": "There is an emerging and imminent need for employees equipped with skills in advanced manufacturing and automotive technology in the area of lightweight materials. While some of these lightweight materials have been studied and used in prototyping for years, they are now being used more broadly in production. Consequently, there is a need to translate the theoretical findings related to these materials and how they are used in design and manufacturing into applications and implementation in production, finishing, and repair. In addition to educating technicians who will be directly applying these skills and knowledge in their work, this project at Washtenaw Community College (WCC) in Michigan is also designed to address the critical need to teach and train the high school teachers and college faculty who will pass that knowledge on to their students. It also tackles the sustainability of the advanced manufacturing industry by facilitating engagement and recruitment of youth into the talent pipeline by joining with Square One Educational Network (SQ1) to develop a pipeline into lightweight manufacturing starting with K-12 students\r\n\r\nKey activities for this project include (a) developing an introductory multidisciplinary and project-based course on lightweight materials around an existing vehicle design project for the SQ1 Full Scale Innovative Vehicle Design Challenge; (b) creating interdisciplinary community college faculty and K-12 teacher professional development centered on lightweight materials properties, optimization, and manufacturing processes; (c) establishing a talent pipeline extending from K-12 to community colleges and four-year universities; and (d) developing and contributing to a repository of light weighting curricula. The college is partnering with Wayne State University (WSU) to develop integrated curriculum in the emerging technologies surrounding lightweight materials properties, optimization and manufacturing processes. The goal is to also engage industry and educators in developing a talent pipeline and initial curriculum addressing the material properties as well as optimization and manufacturing processes associated with lightweight materials at the high school and community college levels to meet emerging industry needs for technicians in the manufacturing industry. A central element of this proposal entails the introduction of a new arrangement of course design and delivery. With the advent of lightweight materials and manufacturing processes, the manufacturing industry is shifting to a systems approach rather than the traditional silo manufacturing practices. WCC will utilize this project to create a model for community college curriculum development utilizing this systems approach. The overview course will be multidisciplinary, project-based and designed around specific lightweight materials or categories of materials (aluminum alloys, plastics and polymers, carbon fiber composites, etc.) rather than focused on specific manufacturing disciplines. For each material or group of materials, the course will be arranged so that an overview of the material properties, applications, design for manufacturability, and manufacturing processes will be presented. As an introductory course, this will facilitate students identifying specific areas of interest in which to continue their studies. It will also provide a broader context for these students to build a systems approach into their study of advanced manufacturing or advanced transportation.  A comprehensive evaluation is being developed to continuously enhance the project activities and provide opportunities for researching and evaluating the success of the project and its deliverables, as well as the sharing of best practices.",
