 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project the University of California-San Diego seeks to promote fluency with mathematics in science. A significant aspect of this project is the interdisciplinary team of mathematicians with expertise in statistics and science faculty who are functioning as a Community of Practice to develop, test, and refine videos focusing on rates of change and probability. The new videos will be unique as the development is informed by the research base. This important use of videos in teaching and learning is expected to move students from fragmented, procedural, and context dependent knowledge to a stage of having more integrated, conceptual and transferable knowledge.\r\n\r\nThe primary goal of the project will be to produce 40 short instructional videos with compelling visuals and clear explanations. The videos will address eight inter-disciplinary sub-topics within the two fundamental topic areas: rates of change and probability. The full scope of the project will include producing individual videos exploring the sub-topics of rates of change and probability across physics, chemistry, biology, and mathematics. A fifth video will provide an example of their relevance in research.  The external evaluator will collect qualitative and quantitative data testing the impact of the use of videos the team makes across four different disciplines. A report from the Pew Research Center indicates that broadband access among disadvantaged and rural populations while not ubiquitous provides by far the best tool for making education materials available. African American and Hispanic learners are more apt to have a handheld device. Cultural and pedagogical inclusivity will be achieved by adapting materials developed for the web to function on hand held devices.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe traditional undergraduate curriculum treats mathematics and science as separate entities, but these disciplines are inherently interdependent.  Many have called for greater integration of the teaching of mathematics and science, more exposure to real world applications and increased emphasis on ensuring that science majors develop a solid foundation in mathematics and the ability to reason quantitatively.  One crosscutting concept that causes widespread difficulty among students in high school, college and undergraduate courses is rate of change.  Examples of rate of change in introductory science courses are velocity and acceleration in physics, reaction kinetics in chemistry and population growth in biology.  The From Symbol Manipulation to Meaning Making project sought to increase curricular integration of these topics by bringing together an interdisciplinary team of instructors of mathematics, physics, chemistry and biology undergraduate courses.  The project had two aims: 1) Deepen mathematicians' and scientists' understanding of each other's disciplines; and 2) Work together to produce a series of videos that encourage meaning making in mathematics and improve students' understanding of challenging ratesof change concepts across the curriculum. \n\nConsistent with the first aim, the team explored how rate of change concepts are presented and applied in calculus, physics, chemistry and biology classes, and how terminology and conventions are used in the different classes.  Through our ongoing conversations over the course of the project, the team identified and documented specific terms, notations, units, rates, functions and sign conventions that are used differently across disciplines.  We developed strategies to communicate more effectively to reach shared understandings, and this work helped us better understand how cultural differences between disciplines impede students from applying knowledge gained in one class or discipline to other classes or disciplines.  Thus, the work provided foundational knowledge necessary for instructors to reduce these barriers.\n\nWith respect to the second aim, the team collaborated to develop videos for five themes (mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology and current research) on four rate of change subtopics (meaning of terms in differential equations, average versus instantaneous rate of change and sign, moving between graphical representations, and integration as accumulation).  The videos depict diverse, empowered learners in a wide variety of contexts that showcase the ubiquity of rate of change concepts in science and mathematics coursework, daily life and in cutting edge scientific research.  These videos are being used in undergraduate and college mathematics and science courses.    \n\nAs the team worked together to develop the videos, it became clear that, although a large body of education research is available to inform the design of instructional videos, it is fragmented across educational disciplinary traditions and STEM fields, and the practical lessons are not readily accessible.  Our experience with the literature and with video development inspired us to synthesize the relevant literature and translate it into recommendations for practice in the form of a user-friendly instrument.  The instrument is a 12-item checklist grouped into the categories of content and sequencing (concepts, logic, story and language), cognitive supports (visualizations, signals, synchronization, segmentation and streamlining) and affective considerations (relevance, rapport and accessibility).  The instrument is a valuable as an evaluation framework for designers of science and mathematics instructional videos.       \n\n \n\nPapers \n\nRabin, J. M., Burgasser, A., Bussey, T.
