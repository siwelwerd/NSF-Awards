 "awd_abstract_narration": "As researchers and developers move from digital to cyber-physical systems, a gap is emerging that is revealing challenges to performance and security in many different cyber-physical system domains. In particular, cybersecurity protections in the digital domain provide desirable protection and verification mechanisms that currently have no analog in the physical domain, limiting verification capabilities in cyber-physical systems. To illustrate this gap, suppose two devices are deployed in the same physical space where they should be allowed to coordinate despite any previous physical or digital relationship. Instead of relying on risky human involvement or specialized hardware, automating the pairing process using measurable and verifiable details of common context should allow them to bootstrap a trust relationship. Our project goals to enable this verification based on context measurement will fill an important gap in cyber-physical systems.\r\n\r\nThe concept of \"context fingerprinting\" is offered as an approach to bridge this gap without the need for computationally intensive cryptography.   It is a technique to allow two dissimilar devices to observe events,&#8232;process measurement data, and create and exchange contextual fingerprints to verify a shared property. This project explores the CPS foundations for context fingerprinting of devise.  The concept will be empirically evaluated, showing how to facilitate usable and&#8232;secure bootstrapping of trust among IoT devices.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nWith electronic devices increasingly interacting with each other and with the physical world around them, device behavior is becoming more and more like human behavior, namely reliant on experiences and not just data. Unfortunately, the increasing prevalence of electronic devices in our everyday lives also brings potential risks from malicious parties.  Combining with the fact that humans are typically not good at managing device security configuration, this complex ecosystem presents many significant challenges.  Our project thus focuses on how devices equipped with a variety of sensory devices can use this knowledge of the perceived world to benefit security and device configuration automatically, even in the presence of attackers.\n\nIn particular, we have developed a collection of techniques for \"contextual fingerprinting\", or learning about a device's surroundings and using this knowledge to automate configuration and security protocols.  Our work to date has included several application scenarios including home automation and Industrial Internet of Things; multi-vehicle coordination and cooperative driving; and management of federated devices in smart cities.  We have demonstrated that a combination of context-based event fingerprinting, device pairing, and verification can be used as a sort of \"proof of knowledge\" to facilitate physically-oriented group membership and other physical relationships.\n\nOur first major outcome was to demonstrate that IoT devices in a home can secure connect to the home network with no direct involvement of a human user by fingerprinting the activities within the home, providing a secure and usable mechanism for adding new devices to a smart home.  We next demonstrated that vehicles on a highway can use sensor measurements of road bumps to verify physical arrangement, which is useful for cooperative driving scenarios.  Third, we showed that sensor measurements from devices can be used to identify the individual performing actions involving the particular devices, which provides valuable attribution capabilities in a smart home.  Finally, we demonstrated that sensor data from vehicles can be used to supplement traditional location services, such as GPS and WiFi multi-lateration that are inaccurate in urban areas.  Each of these application scenarios demonstrates new sensor-driven capabilities that can have immediate impact on smart device technologies that are becoming commonplace today.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/30/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Patrick Tague"
