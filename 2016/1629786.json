 "awd_abstract_narration": "Collaborative Research: Mesozoic Tethyan paleocommunity dynamics: Modelling complexity and stablity during times of biotic escalation and community restructuring\r\n\r\nThe Mesozoic Era began in the aftermath of Earth's largest mass extinction 251 million years ago, ending 66 million years ago with another mass extinction. The current project focuses on ecosystems of an ancient ocean which covered much of western Europe during the Mesozoic and left behind a rich, well-documented fossil record. The groundwork for modern oceans was laid during this time with increasingly complex ecosystems. The relationship between the complexity and stability of ecosystems is, however, poorly understood. The project will examine that relationship by modeling the complex dynamics of Mesozoic marine ecosystems using food webs, which capture the interactions and energy transfer between species in biological communities. Food web reactions to environmental disturbances are informative of ecosystem resilience. Analyzing ancient food webs will be accomplished with a suite of mathematical and computational models. \r\n\r\nEcosystem responses to changes in biological complexity and environmental disturbance remain poorly understood. Anthropogenically-driven global biological change is currently resulting in catastrophic losses of biodiversity. To anticipate ecosystem responses and effectively manage resources, we must understand how ecosystems respond to extreme changes; yet there are no precedents in human experience to guide us. The fossil record documents extreme ecosystem changes and this project will provide analogs from the past to enable better forecasts for modern marine ecosystems. This information will be distributed to the public, educators and students through a variety of programs at the California Academy of Sciences.",

The science community has long believed that ocean food webs have seen little change over the last 540 million or so years. However, we revealed that ancient food webs were very different from today. The study used fossil data from museum collections, historical literature, and the Paleobiology Database to rebuild four different marine food webs from the days when dinosaurs roamed the earth over 65 million years ago. The data was then compared to the reconstructed network of a modern Jamaican reef community. The result? The four ancient food webs varied greatly from one another, and the youngest one was not the most similar to today&rsquo;s Jamaican coral reefs. The findings point to a need to better understand the ecosystem structure when looking at marine conservation and restoration plans, as huge changes or damage to these structures over time caused by humans can impact the ability to fix imbalances and ward off extinction of the species living within them. Learning how food webs work is very important for conservation because it helps scientists predict how ecosystems will respond to climate change. There is an interconnectedness and dependency between each member, which means when a stressor affects one species it will ultimately affect the rest of the web. If a species is removed from the structure, the food web has to adapt to continue fulfilling the function of the missing piece. This can make it difficult to reintroduce species down the road, as their functions may no longer fit into the structure. Using paleontology in this way can help us understand what we should be saving and how to save it, giving us a more informed way to look at conservation efforts. By studying these structures over time, we can find ways to promote more resilient communities now, and in the future. Community stability in underwater ecosystem structures is determined by which species are in it, what role they play in moving energy, how those functions interact with each other, and how strongly the animals at the top of the food chain affect the rest of the food web. We looked at how these systems respond to crises and whether or not the species and functions can persist through these stressors. By looking at things over a longer time scale, we can develop a more specific understanding of how human activity has affected these systems, which can help us approach restoration and conservation efforts more effectively.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 11/30/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Carrie&nbsp;Tyler</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"></div>\n</div>",
