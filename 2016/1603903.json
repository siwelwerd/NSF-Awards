 "awd_abstract_narration": "Observations made since the turn of this century indicate that the Arctic physical environment and associated ecosystems are undergoing remarkable changes and to predict future changes we need to be able to quantify how much of Arctic climate variability and change is linked to the ocean circulation, how the distribution of sea ice responds to the amplified Arctic warming predicted by climate models, and how primary productivity, species distributions and associated ecosystem structures will change with the evolving Arctic state. Our understanding of the driving mechanisms for these processes depends on our knowledge of the Arctic system and our ability to simulate its time-evolving state in a way that is consistent with observations. This project will employ an advanced approach for synthesizing oceanographic observations to develop a tool that establishes a baseline understanding of the Arctic system. Outcomes of the proposed research will include better quantification of the Arctic system's changes since the turn of the century, and improved understanding of the dynamical causes for these changes. It is likely that the resulting analyzed fields of ocean and sea ice properties will be widely utilized by the community in future research. \r\n\r\nThis project will bring together hydrographic observations obtained from ship, aircraft and autonomous instruments, sea ice data from in situ buoys, satellites and manned vessels, and boundary-layer meteorology within a state estimation infrastructure to develop a physical and dynamical description of the evolving Arctic Ocean during roughly the first decade of the 21st century. Taking advantage of a growing observational database, the project's two main objectives are: the creation of a dynamically-consistent and comprehensive synthesis of all available Arctic hydrographic and sea ice observations using the adjoint-based Arctic Sub-polar gyre sTate Estimate for the period 2002-present; and scientific investigations, using the synthesis products, of physical mechanisms driving the evolving Arctic system. The team will quantify four key science issues: the time-average, seasonal cycle, and interannual variability of the upper-ocean hydrography and circulation; the interannual changes in Arctic Ocean heat and freshwater (FW) content; changes in the sea ice state and air-sea fluxes; and connections between the Arctic and the Sub-polar gyre, focusing on heat and FW exchanges and feedback. Products generated will be the time-mean, mean seasonal cycle, and time-varying quantities in the Arctic Ocean, its neighboring seas and sub-polar North Atlantic of the full set of variables characterizing the coupled physical ocean-sea ice state, heat, FW, momentum and vorticity budgets, and inferred air-sea fluxes and time-mean oceanic turbulent mixing. These products will be made available to researchers and students, policy makers, industry, and the general public. \r\n\r\nA substantial outreach activity will be undertaken, in collaboration the MIT Museum, to assemble diverse multimedia projects that use scientific results, including those from this project, to visualize changes due to ongoing major shifts in the Arctic Ocean. The goal is to engage the general audience interested in the multimedia projects with actual scientific datasets to establish tangible links between the two perspectives. Exhibitions and accompanying events are planned with a goal of creating material that may be readily used for broader dissemination. The project will support two female early career scientists.",

Observations made since the turn of this century indicate that the Arctic Ocean?s physical environment and associated ecosystems are undergoing remarkable changes. Our understanding of the driving mechanisms for these changes hinges on knowledge of the mean state, variability, and uncertainties of the ocean?s layering and circulation, the impact of local surface forcing via heat, freshwater and momentum fluxes versus horizontal transport anomalies, remote teleconnections, and the ability of dynamically-consistent models to simulate a realistic Arctic ocean and sea ice state that is consistent with the observations.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Arctic Ocean, in particular its interior water column, remains notoriously under-sampled and seasonally biased by observations due to the presence of sea ice and its harsh environment during winter. This has hampered quantification of how much of Arctic climate (atmosphere, ocean, and sea ice) variability and change are linked to the ocean circulation, how the distributions of sea ice extent and thickness respond to the amplified polar warming predicted by climate models, and how will primary productivity, species distributions and associated ecosystem structures change with the evolving Arctic state.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Intellectual Merit</strong>: To overcome these limitations, the project has produced a coupled Arctic ocean-sea ice state estimate (a.k.a. ``reanalysis'') covering the early 21st century. The ``Arctic Subpolar gyre sTate Estimate'' (ASTE), the first of its kind for the Arctic and subpolar North Atlantic, is a regional ocean-sea ice model-data synthesis. To obtain such a formal synthesis, a coupled ocean-sea ice model (Figure 1) is constrained by an extensive (O(10<sup>9</sup>)) set of satellite and in situ observations (Figure 2) through a nonlinear least squares optimization, an advanced computational method often referred to as data assimilation. As part of the optimization, input variables of the model, including initial conditions, surface boundary conditions (related to air-sea fluxes) and model parameters are optimized such as to reduce the least-squares model-data misfit function. ASTE is a regionally refined version of the global Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean (ECCO) product. The virtue of the regional refinement is a better resolved circulation in the Arctic, a reduced misfit between simulated and observed ocean and sea ice properties, and a dynamically consistent interpolation (in space and time) of the ocean and sea ice state to places where no observations are available. The ASTE state estimate permits accurate calculation of a wide range of key oceanic metrics, such as the transport of mass and heat carried by the ocean circulation across a number of important Arctic gateways. Volume transports are summarized in Figures 3. An extensive set of time-varying three-dimensional state variables representing ASTE has been made available at NSF?s Arctic Data Center portal at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arcticdata.io/catalog/portals/ASTE\">https://arcticdata.io/catalog/portals/ASTE</a>, and mirrored at the Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC).</p>\n<p><strong>Broader Impacts and Outreach</strong>: As part of the project an art exhibit ``Exploring the Arctic Ocean'' was developed to introduce the general public to the Arctic Ocean environment and changes. The exhibit took place during the 2018 Fall semester at the UT Austin Visual Art Center&nbsp;</p>\n<p>(<a href=\"https://utvac.org/event/exploring-arctic-ocean\">https://utvac.org/event/exploring-arctic-ocean</a>). Curated by Ulrike Heine and co-designed by Patrick Heimbach and An Nguyen, a central piece of the exhibit was a wall-sized animation of Arctic Ocean circulation produced by Nguyen in collaboration with the Texas Advanced Computing Center's Visual Laboratory. In addition, the exhibit featured materials from established artists, photographers, and documentary producers, covering visual art works ranging from daily life of circum-Arctic communities to Arctic sea ice composition to ocean sea-floor resources (Figures 4 to 6). Artists included Olaf Otto Becker, Chris Linder, Armin Linke, Lize Mogel, John Quigley, ScanLAB Projects, and collective work by Ole Kristensen, Annesofie Norn, and Daniel Plewe. These works share an interest in the results and practices of scientific research in the Arctic. At the same time, they represent a broad spectrum of visual strategies. Some works document scientific observation and data collection; others visualize and represent the complex changes by which the remote, dynamic and fragile environment of the Arctic Ocean is currently being transformed. Some works unleash activist potential through global media distribution; others aim at triggering personal and individual contemplation. The exhibit was very well received. It was visited by 1,014 individual visitors; 502 group visits/tours; 928 visitors from VAC events and public programs (both for ``Exploring the Arctic Ocean'' and otherwise).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Arctic Circulation animation ``Arctic Atlantification'' featured during the exhibit also won the ``SC18 Scientific Visualization and Data Analytics Award'' at the International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage, and Analysis (Supercomputing 2018). Accompanying the semester-long exhibit was a series of talks and panel discussions by invited artists and speakers to highlight their works in the Arctic Ocean to the general public.
