 "awd_abstract_narration": "Additive manufacturing is a powerful technique for myriad applications ranging from product visualization to making three-dimensional (3D) engineered parts and devices. 3D nanostructures and devices are useful in many applications including energy, clean water, and health care. However, most additive manufacturing or 3D printing methods are extremely slow because they rely on layer-by-layer fabrication processes. A recent breakthrough has dramatically improved the speed of additive manufacturing. This novel technique demonstrates the fabrication of polymeric 3D parts continuously out of the resin at rates of hundreds of millimeters per hour with resolutions below 100 microns. The entire fabrication takes minutes as opposed to hours. This Scalable NanoManufacturing (SNM) award will develop methods for rapid 3D printing of nanostructures, with feature resolution of ~100 nm and printing speed orders of magnitude faster than any current nanoprinting technique. The project will also address many fundamental and engineering challenges for developing this 3D nanoprinter.  It is expected to generate a wealth of scientific and engineering knowledge that will advance the rapid 3D nanoprinting method of making structures and devices with nano-scale precision. In addition, the project will broaden participation of underrepresented groups through programs such as Purdue's Luis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation, increase impact on education, and increase public awareness of nanoscience and nanotechnology. \r\n\r\nIn typical 3D additive nanoprinting, a laser beam is used to polymerize a photo-curable resin in a point-by-point and layer-by-layer manner. The key objective of this award is to accelerate the polymerization process by developing a photoinhibition method to create a dead zone right below the polymerization zone. In this dead zone, photoexcited states needed for polymerization are depleted or terminated, hence the resin remains in liquid phase for continuous, rather than layer-by-layer printing. In addition, the method can be made scalable, i.e., hundreds of parts can be printed in parallel, by simultaneously utilizing an array of optical elements. The research will focus on investigations in novel manufacturing methods, advanced optical systems, high precision metrology tools, design and synthesis of functional photo-polymers, and 3D manufacturing system integration. Finally, the project will strive to develop low-cost 3D nanoprinting systems using commercially available low-cost light sources and low-cost optical and mechanical components. As a result, this project will realize an affordable, high throughput-high resolution 3D nanoprinting technology.",
