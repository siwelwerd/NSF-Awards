Power-sharing institutions, rules to apportion political, military, economic, and territorial power among former belligerents, are an increasingly prevalent feature of civil war settlements. Academics have posited that power-sharing institutions secure the commitment of elites and the masses to stability by providing key political goods: security for both elites and masses, inclusion for elites, and basic services for the masses. In the absence of data appropriate for testing those hypotheses, however, previous research has been unable to identify the exact causal mechanisms through which power sharing fosters stability after civil war. This study addresses this gap in our understanding of power sharing by collecting micro-level data on elites' and masses' knowledge about and perceptions of the effects that these institutions have on the delivery of political goods. Data collection in the form of interviews and surveys will be conducted in the Mindanao region of the Philippines, where efforts at civil war resolution have at times featured the use of power-sharing mechanisms.  The principal investigators will use these data to conduct statistical analyses of the effects that power sharing has on different groups' commitment to the peace. The information obtained from this study will serve to inform policymakers about the best practices for the design and implementation of power-sharing arrangements in the aftermath of civil war.\r\n\r\nTechnical Summary\r\n\r\nThis study seeks to better understand how power-sharing arrangements may foster peace in the aftermath of civil war. Powers sharing institutions, rules to apportion political, military, economic, and territorial power among former belligerents, are an increasingly prevalent feature of civil war settlements.  This research will critically examine the hypothesis that power-sharing arrangements promote peace by providing citizens with important political goods such as security and access to basic services. This will be accomplished by focusing on the Mindanao region of the Philippines, where efforts at civil war resolution have at times featured the use of power-sharing mechanisms.  Conducting open-ended interviews with key informants, semi-structured interviews with focus groups, surveys of the population in conflict-affected areas, and survey experiments, the principal investigators will gather micro-level data that make it possible to answer two key questions. First, do individuals residing in regions included in a post-civil war power-sharing arrangement have greater access to political goods relative to comparable populations excluded from power sharing? Second, is there a correlation between access to political goods and an individual's support for the post-conflict peace process?",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis study is motivated by an interest in understanding how power-sharing arrangements foster peace in the aftermath of civil war. Powers-sharing institutions, defined as rules to apportion political, military, economic, and territorial power among former belligerents, are a common feature of civil war settlements. Our research examines the hypothesis that power-sharing arrangements promote peace by providing citizens with important political goods such as security and access to basic services.  We anticipate that enhanced access to these types of government-provided resources should increase trust in the national government and support for the peaceful management of conflict. \n\nIn order to consider the relationship between power sharing, enhanced access to political goods, and stability, we conducted a survey of over 3000 respondents in the Mindanao region of the Philippines.  The survey was complemented by a survey experiment, a list experiment, open-ended interviews with key informants, and focus group discussions. \n\nWe selected Mindanao as the site for our analysis for three reasons.  First, this area has been the location of a long-standing civil war between its Catholic and Muslim populations.  Second, there have been two recent efforts to resolve the conflict through negotiations that yielded power-sharing arrangements.  These settlements take the form of the 1996 Jakarta Accord between the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) and the government of the Philippines, and the 2014 Bangsamoro Basic Law/Comprehensive Agreement on Bangsamoro negotiated by the government of the Philippines and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF).  Third, the prominent use of territorial power sharing as part of these settlements presents an opportunity to distinguish between those populations that experienced power sharing directly and those that did not.  Specifically, we identify a contrast between residents of the Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) and those individuals who live outside the boundaries of this autonomous arrangement.\n\nOur analyses of the data drawn from the survey offer support for a number of our original hypotheses.  The data suggest that those members of the marginalized Muslim community who have been the beneficiaries of power-sharing arrangements tend to report enhanced availability and access to political goods such as security, rule of law, inclusion, and access to basic services.  It also proves to be the case that those individuals who enjoy improved access to these political goods report a higher level of trust in the national government.  While it remains to be seen whether a similar dynamic is apparent in other states emerging from civil war, these results offer some support for the view that power sharing and the provision of political goods have potential to serve as a pathway towards promoting a durable peace.\n\nThe experiment that was embedded in the survey also provides insights into factors that might promote civil war resolution.  The experiment manipulates information the respondents receive regarding five treatments that are presented to them as potential peace agreement provisions.  Four of the treatments represent power-sharing provisions: political, military, territorial, and economic.  A fifth, focusing on aid from international organizations, constitutes a control measure. We find that one treatment, territorial autonomy, elicited a strong reaction from both Christians and Muslims who believe that the settlement is unfair, with individuals reporting a decreased level of trust in the government. This may indicate the particular salience of territory as a resource or form of power for groups, an interpretation in keeping with scholarship on the role of \"territoriality\" in international relations and conflict studies. In a result that should be encouraging to policymakers, our list experiment  indicates that neither divisions based on religion and perceptions of peace agreement fairness, nor our power-sharing treatments, correlate with an increased willingness by citizens to use violence against the national government.\n\nWe consider a further innovation and contribution of this study to be the use of a micro-level perspective for analyzing the impact that power-sharing institutions and political goods provision have on individual and group behavior following civil war. Recent scholarship emphasizes that violent conflict originates from micro-foundations - i.e., from the behavior of individuals and their interactions with their immediate environment.  Yet most research on the consequences of power sharing, up to point, has focused on cross-national data to reach its conclusions.  On the basis of this study we find that it is equally valuable to focus on micro-foundations in order to understand the conditions under which conflict is - and is not - successfully managed in the wake of civil war.\n\nThe data set generated by this research is available for public use.  It is archived and available from the Institute for Quantitative Social Science (IQSS) Dataverse Network at https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/public_sharing_political_goods_provision.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/23/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Matthew Hoddie"
