 "awd_abstract_narration": "Phase II I/UCRC U. of Alabama at Birmingham Site: Center for Health Organization Transformation\r\n\r\nPartnerships between university and industry can result in innovative solutions to the complex issues affecting the U.S. health care system. The University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) site of the Center for Health Organization Transformation (CHOT) represents a collaboration between UAB and industry partners to engage in applied industry research to provide evidence on innovations that can improve health care quality and access, while reducing costs.  Industry partners include a broad spectrum of health-related organizations (health systems, hospital, home health, rehabilitation) serving Alabama, Louisiana, and other states. The UAB/CHOT affiliation will facilitate and accelerate such research by our joining an experienced learning collaborative, and by leveraging the resources of UAB and its industry partners. Our projects have implications for the prevention of health conditions that disproportionately affect racial/ethnic minorities, particularly in the Deep South, such as diabetes, obesity, avoidable readmissions, and falls. \r\n\r\nThe UAB CHOT site?s mission/vision is \"to generate knowledge with respect to health care delivery innovations that may result in efficient, high-quality care that is patient-centered and equitable through collaborative research with industry.\" The UAB CHOT site's research focus includes organizational processes and the evaluation of health care delivery innovations, health information technology, quality improvement, and patient experience including care coordination. UAB will expand CHOT's existing research capacity, increase its geographic presence in the Deep South, and broaden industry partner types involved in changing the U.S. health delivery system. UAB's participation in the CHOT will enhance our diverse students' experience in the classroom and in the field, and provide faculty with opportunities for practice-based, multi-disciplinary research. Finally, the broader scientific community will benefit through the dissemination of our projects' findings through refereed publications, presentations at scientific meetings and CHOT sponsored communication venues - webinars, and newsletters.",
