 "awd_abstract_narration": "The selection of mates and subsequent production of offspring are key components of the evolutionary process, but what behaviors do animals employ to access mates? In this dissertation project, the co-PI will investigate the aggressive and affiliative strategies that young male chimpanzees use to mate with females and how these strategies change during development. Results of this research will clarify our understanding of the development of coercive behaviors in male chimpanzees and may provide a perspective on the evolutionary context of this behavior. In addition, this research will contribute to the conservation of endangered chimpanzees and other wildlife through educational outreach efforts at the research site. \r\n\r\nMale animals frequently compete for mates. As they do so, relatively large, strong, experienced, and old males are typically favored in competition and consequently sire offspring. Prior research conducted at Ngogo in the Kibale National Park, Uganda, however, indicates that young adult and adolescent male chimpanzees, who are socially and physically immature, father many offspring. Adolescent males father infants born to adolescent females, while young adult males sire the infants of adult females. In this project, the co-PI will collect behavioral and morphological data on an large cohort of adolescent and young adult male chimpanzees at Ngogo, to investigate the strategies young male chimpanzees employ to mate with females and how these strategies change during development. Specifically, she will examine whether young male chimpanzees use aggression to coerce females to mate with them and whether sex differences in body size affect their ability to do so. In addition, she will determine whether young males improve their evolutionary fitness by affiliating with adult females during infancy and juvenility when males are still dependent on their mothers or later during adolescence by forging strong social bonds with adolescent female peers.",

Offspring care requires so much time and energy that at any given moment, few females are able to mate and conceive, causing a shortage of mates that presents the greatest challenge to male reproduction. To reproduce, males must fight others to obtain matings. Males who win such contests are typically the biggest, strongest, and most-experienced individuals. However, relatively small, weak, and young males still manage to reproduce using &ldquo;alternative&rdquo; strategies that allow them to avoid direct combat with other males. In our closest living relatives, chimpanzees, multiple males and multiple females live together in large groups with up to 200 members. Males and females mate promiscuously, but males do not sire equal numbers of offspring. High-ranking males father the most offspring, and males achieve high status by challenging others in physical contests. Long before male chimpanzees are contenders in the dominance hierarchy, however, they can father offspring. Males become capable of reproducing at the start of adolescence (~9 y) when they are still physically and socially immature. At the end of adolescence (~16 y), males reach adult size, but they may be 20 before they integrate themselves into the male hierarchy. Despite these disadvantages, adolescent (9-15 y) and young adult (16-20 y) males father more than one-quarter of all offspring of known paternity in the Ngogo chimpanzee group that we study. In our research, we are investigating the alternative strategies young males use to mate females, and how these strategies change as males grow older.

Males also show aggression to the same females with whom they affiliate, shaking branches to intimidate them, charging and chasing them, and occasionally hitting, kicking, and biting them.
