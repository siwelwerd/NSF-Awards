 "awd_abstract_narration": "The movement from water to land was a critical evolutionary transformation for both vertebrates and arthropods (insects, spiders, millipedes, crustaceans, etc.).  Different groups of arthropods used different methods to enable breathing air, a critical requirement for life on land, a change that occurred separately in at least 7 groups.  The goal of this project is to investigate how an air-breathing respiratory system evolved separately in multiple arthropod groups.  Did evolution of aerial respiration involve alteration to the same anatomical structures and genes in each group, or does each arthropod group use a different solution to the problem of breathing air?  To resolve this question, the embryonic formation of respiratory organs in eight arthropod species will be investigated.  Genes and proteins will be tested to determine whether the same genes are used in the respiratory system of all arthropods.  Genome sequencing will further test and identify genes that create unique respiratory structures (e.g., the book lung of spiders).  The outcomes of this research will be integrated into a new laboratory-based course on invertebrate zoology, to be taught annually through the Department of Zoology, using live specimens.  A museum exhibit will be developed on the movement of arthropods onto land, and using evidence from fossils, genes, and developmental biology.  One postdoctoral fellow, one graduate student, and ten summer undergraduates will be trained during the work, emphasizing recruitment of women and underrepresented groups in science.\r\n\r\nInvestigating the parallel evolution of aerial respiration in Arthropoda has previously been limited to studies of functional morphology or expression data from a few taxa. Some developmental data suggest that mandibulate and chelicerate respiratory systems are directly homologous, whereas a separate set of data suggests that respiratory organs of arachnids arose independently from modified walking legs. Respiratory systems of Myriapoda have not been studied in a developmental genetic context at all. To resolve the origins of internalized respiratory systems of arthropods, the proposed work will examine positional, genetic, and serial homology of respiratory organs in eight emerging model arthropod systems. To establish the serial homology of arachnid respiratory organs, Hox misexpression experiments will be conducted to derepress appendages in posterior segments. To establish degree of conservation of the gene regulatory network (GRN) underlying tubulogenesis across Arthropoda, gene expression assays will be performed for candidate genes known to be required for establishment of the Drosophila melanogaster tracheal tubule system. To assess functional correspondence, knockdown experiments will be conducted in two chelicerate and three mandibulate exemplars for five critical genes in the Drosphila GRN. To investigate the patterning of the arachnid book lung, comparative transcriptomic data will be generated from book lung primordia of spiders and scorpions, toward identifying a set of novel candidate genes putatively involved in book lung morphogenesis for further functional screening. This work will directly address the two competing scenarios of arthropod terrestrialization that persist in the literature, using independent tests of positional, serial, and genetic homology.",

The body of work enabled by this award goes to the heart of long-held and conflicting hypotheses from various disciplines (paleontology, evolutionary morphology, and development) regarding the origins of respiratory organs across Arthropoda and the evolutionary history of terrestrialization in the group. Previous studies of developmental gene expression have suggested that respiratory systems of spiders, crustaceans, and insects are all serially homologous structures derived from the epipods (outer appendage rami) of the arthropod ancestor, corresponding to an ancestral gill. The internalization of an ancestral gill is thought to have given rise to terrestrial respiratory organs, such as book lungs and tracheal tubules.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>To test this hypothesis, research sponsored by this award focused on the gene regulatory network (GRN) responsible for establishing the tracheal placodes of the well-student model organism&nbsp;<em>Drosophila melanogaster&nbsp;</em>(fruit fly), with the aim of establishing whether the same GRN establishes the respiratory organs of non-insect arthropods. Through newly established genomic resources, toolkits, and functional datasets for non-model arthropod species, this investigation achieved several outcomes.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>First, it was shown that the respiratory primordia of insects and arachnids are not positionally homologous; the anlagen of arachnid book lungs and tracheal tubules occur in the Wingless-positive territory of the developing segment, in the same position as developing appendages on anterior segments. By contrast, insect tracheal placodes occur anteriorly of the Wingless domain, as Wingless represses tracheal inducers in the posterior compartment of the developing insect segment. Moreover, homologs of insect tracheal inducers (e.g.,&nbsp;<em>tracheal-less</em>) are not expressed in the developing tracheal tubules of arachnids like harvestmen. These data suggest that the respiratory organs of insects and arachnids do not share a common origin, contrary to the established ancestral-gill paradigm.</p>\n<p>Second, investigating other components of the appendage fate specification GRN, this research showed that the Sp6-9/Dll gene cassette, traditionally understood to be required for appendage patterning, has been coopted for patterning two head segments in spiders. A separate investigation of canonical Wnt signaling in a spider, as well as in hemimetabolous insects, showed a conserved role for the Wnt co-receptor&nbsp;<em>arrow</em>&nbsp;in establishing posterior segments, as well as appendage primordia.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Third, to accelerate the discovery of territory- and taxon-specific genes that may be responsible for patterning arachnid respiratory organs, RNA-seq data were generated for each appendage primordium of a spider and a scorpion. Functional screening of candidate genes in a spider using RNA interference resulted in the discovery of a new Iroquois family gene copy that is specific to arachnids and which is required for the establishment of the spider pedicel (?waist?); knockdown of this gene results in a discontinuous germ band due to a dorso-ventral patterning phenotype in the middle of the developing embryo.</p>\n<p>Fourth, fundamental outcomes of this award pertain to comprehensive reassessments of the phylogeny of Chelicerata, with downstream implications for the history of terrestrialization.&nbsp;Transcriptomic resources generated by this study have revealed the surprising outcome that Arachnida (the clade formed by terrestrial chelicerates) is not monophyletic; horseshoe crabs are nested within the arachnids and thus constitute arachnids that never left aquatic habitats.&nbsp;This series of studies has deeply transformed the modern understanding of chelicerate phylogeny, which has always inferred a single terrestrialization event in the common ancestor of a monophyletic Arachnida. Like the history of the mandibulate arthropods, the history of chelicerate terrestrialization is likely complex and encompasses multiple terrestrialization events.
