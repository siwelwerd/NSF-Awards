 "awd_abstract_narration": "Convergence of the North American tectonic plate with the Juan de Fuca, Gorda, and Explorer plates creates the Cascadia subduction zone, extending 1100 km from northern California to Canada's Vancouver Island in the Pacific Northwest.  Offshore where the tectonic plates meet, a thick wedge of sediment develops.  The sediment wedge forms as a result of erosion on land and transport of the sediment away from the coastline, and the wedge is thickened by the compression resulting from the two plates sliding by each other. Recent great earthquakes and tsunamis around the world have heightened the awareness of the natural hazards posed by the processes occurring along the Cascadia margin.  Many of these processes are linked to the sediment wedge, particularly the failure of sediment slopes that may lead to landslides and generate local tsunamis.  This project will help to identify the processes controlling the initiation of slope failure on the sediment wedge at the Cascadia margin. Understanding the paths and triggers for sediment slope failures is key to unraveling the history of past earthquakes and assessing the associated earthquake, tsunami, and submarine landslide hazards.  The project supports the training of graduate and undergraduate students.\r\n\r\n\r\nPreliminary examination of recent temperature, pressure and seismic data returned from the Cascadia Initiative program of Ocean Bottom Seismometer deployments off of the Cascadia subduction zone has shown that slope failures and sediment flows can be triggered not only by local great earthquakes, but also by the seismic waves from distant earthquakes, including the 2012 Mw8.6 event off the coast of Sumatra.  If this interpretation is substantiated by further processing and interpretation of the related data during this project, it will have a major impact on several current scientific issues, including (1) identification of megathrust earthquake recurrence intervals, (2) the amplification of surface seismic shaking by the thick sediments in the accretionary margin wedge, and (3) the transfer of organic carbon within sediment debris flows that originate on the shallow continental shelf and end with burial in the abyssal plain, a key marine component of the global carbon cycle. The end product of the project will be a new model to identify sections of the Cascadia margin that may be prone to slope failures.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nRecently, large, damaging  earthquakes and associated coastal flooding events around the world have heightened awareness of the inevitability of similar events occurring within the Pacific Northwest.  Previously, both earthquakes and tsunamis that are generated by muddy slope failures on steep coastal margins have occurred in both the distant and recent past and are certain to occur again.  These events cause  major destruction to coastal communities by surges of seawater flooding.   In this NSF project, we analyzed a wide range of several types of data from the seafloor off coastal Washington and Oregon that was recorded during the 2011&ndash;2015 Cascadia Initiative Community Experiment.\n\n Turbidites are marine landslides that occur on continental margins that have been previously known to be caused by nearby earthquakes. When triggered over a wide area by a nearby earthquake, these mud slides and turbidity flows can cause local tsunamis that inundate nearby coastal areas.   Recent data from 3 years of data obtained from ocean bottom earthquake detectors  deployed on the Cascadia margin in the Pacific Northwest demonstrated that these mud slides can also be triggered by distant  earthquakes, including passing seismic waves from a large earthquake on the Sumatra margin.  This triggering event was located over 13,000 km from the Pacific Northwest Washington and Oregon margins where the mud slides occurred.   The research in this study was the first to conclusively demonstrate the possibility of remotely generating  sediment-laden mud  flows.   Publication of the results of this study caused revisions of the seismic hazards experienced  by coastal communities.   This research outcome expanded the understanding of submarine slope failures and turbidity currents and the hazards they pose to coastal infrastructure and tsunami generation in regions that have steep marine slopes but are not likely to have local earthquakes. \n\n As a Supplement to this primary grant, the additional funding examined the possibility of earthquake-induced slope failures that were triggered by small earthquakes located near the margin slopes that were prone to failure, and included the Alaskan margin.  This initial supplemental funding led to a more comprehensive study of sensors placed on the Alaskan margin which was able to re-define the understanding of how very small micro-earthquake can trigger earthquakes. These results show how even very small earthquakes can be responsible for massive slope failures that in turn  produce tsunamis that are a threat to the continental margin of the United States.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/31/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Harlan P Johnson"
