 "awd_abstract_narration": "The growing demand for geoscientists must be met by increasing recruitment and retention.  Given the steady U.S. population migration to urban centers, recruits will increasingly need to come from students who were raised in cities. The issues involved with recruiting urban geoscientists closely parallel those for recruiting from underrepresented groups. Many students and their families are unaware of the growing opportunities in the geosciences for careers that use advanced technology to solve some of the most challenging problems facing society. Urban geoscientists work on a wide range of local problems including waste management, flood control, beach nourishment, transportation infrastructure, land subsidence, and the environmental impact of \"fracking.\"  To increase the size and diversity of the geoscience workforce and keep pace with demand in the 21st century, this project is testing new strategies, assessing what works, and sharing the model of an urban geoscience learning community with other universities.  New strategies include: developing materials highlighting career opportunities in urban geoscience, peer coaching in mathematics to assist students transitioning into science from other disciplines, and student apprenticeships to boost employment opportunities.  \r\n\r\nThe Career Paths for Urban Geoscientists initiative includes three main components. First, student recruitment is focused on developing career information for students and their parents to overcome misconceptions about opportunities. This information is being provided to prospective students during visits to the university, in general education and introductory-level courses in the department, and to the Alliance for Minority Participation on campus.  In addition to career information, service learning modules are being included in general education classes to inform students about applications for their new geology skills. Second, the Urban Geoscientists initiative is focusing on retention of new majors through a math-mentoring program. Math requirements are often a serious obstacle for students switching from non-science majors, and a reason many drop out of the science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) majors.  The Math Partners program is pairing junior and senior geology and environmental science majors who have completed at least one semester of calculus as mentors for newly recruited majors. New students are benefiting from one-on-one coaching by majors who have experienced their struggles and who can help them grasp the increasingly important connections between quantitative skills and careers in the geosciences. The mentors reinforce their own understanding of mathematics through teaching.  Working together also promotes camaraderie within the major. The third component of the project is focused on enhancing Career Paths for Urban Geoscientists through apprenticeship that prepare them for the workforce. This includes a new certificate program that teaches job skills, internship opportunities with local companies, and undergraduate research experiences working with graduate students and faculty. The creation of learning communities of urban geoscientists involving alumni, faculty, undergraduate students, and graduate students in both science and education strengthens the initiative and is an explicit goal of this project. Assessment tools are being employed to determine the efficacy and timing of intervention. Outcomes such as an increase in majors, fewer repeated math courses, and retention in STEM are being assessed by demographic groupings. Using Temple University as a model of urban geosciences, the findings of this project are expected to be important for nation-wide recruiting through application at other universities striving to recruit and retain students from diverse backgrounds and prepare them for successful geoscience careers.",

Urban geoscientists work on a wide range of local problems including waste management, flood control, beach nourishment, transportation infrastructure, land subsidence, and the environmental impact of \"fracking.\"  To increase the size and diversity of the geoscience workforce and keep pace with demand in the 21st century, this project tested new strategies, assessed what works, and shared the model of an urban geoscience learning community with other universities.

Assessment of each the recruitment, retention and apprenticeship components offered an understanding of how students engage with and become members of a scientific community. We tracked the effectiveness of the different activities as well as which ones are sustainable beyond the life of the grant.  A novel feature of our program was a Math Mentoring that paired upper undergraduates who have successfully completed the calculus courses with novice undergraduates.  The program persisted for all three years of the grant and then transitioned to a Peer Coach program that welcomed new students during COVID 19 when online learning created distance between students.  The benefit of the Math Mentoring program was that it created a culture of volunteering and mentoring in the department that has endured beyond the grant period.  A second outcome was an evaluation of citizen science projects in introductory classes.  While it was not necessarily a recruiting tool, surveys showed that students felt more positive about science when they contributed to a group project.  A third product was creation of an Environmental Professional certificate and associated workshops on career preparation.  Students engagement in career preparation and research increased over the course of the grant.
