 "awd_abstract_narration": "The team will assemble optical and infrared observations of hundreds of thousands of galaxies.  The observations pick out galaxies about 10 to 12 billion years back in time.  This period is known to be one of hectic change for galaxies.  The team will study how these changes depend on whether a galaxy has many neighbors, or no neighbors at all.  This important topic could not be studied before because not enough observations were available.  The team will release their assembled catalog to the public.  Senior team members will train junior members.  The team will give public talks, offer residential workshops to teachers and develop a three-dimensional show for a children's science museum.\r\n\r\nIn a tour de force, the team will combine data from five deep, wide-area galaxy surveys that include both photometry and integral-field-unit spectroscopy.  They will use the combined data to study galaxy evolution over the full range of galactic environments at redshifts z ~ 1.9 to 3.5.  These are key redshifts for galaxy evolution, as they probe the assembly of massive galaxies, the peaks in star formation and black-hole accretion, and the collapse of the largest proto-clusters of galaxies.  The team will amass photometry for about 600,000 galaxies and spectroscopy for about 260,000 galaxies.  Using this dataset, the team will conduct statistically meaningful analyses that were heretofore impossible.",

It combines data from ground-based telescopes (CTIO and KPNO) and space (NASA's Spitzer Telescope).   These data provide a census of galaxy properties over an enormous cosmic volume, permitting the study of galaxy build-up during the \"peak\" period of cosmic star-formation when galaxies are most active, and large scale structures are collapsing.\n\n\nIntellectual Merit\n\nThis project has demonstrated the how massive galaxies grow through star-formation, and how quench their star-formation, and how accreting supermassive blackholes (SMBHs) contribute to their emission, all during the peak period of activity at z~1.5 to 3.5.  This project also has identified galaxies at redshifts of z~4, and shown that their distribution in luminosity requires a population of accreting SMBH to explain the evolution at high luminosities.  This program has also identified candidates for quiescent galaxies in the very high redshift universe (z &gt; 4), which will be a subject of study for future projects.

These findings challenge our understanding of  galaxy formation in the concordance cosmology o cold-dark matter with dark energy, and inform next generations of simulations.\n\n\nBroader Impacts\n\n\nThis project has provided several multiwavelength catalogs covering a very large area of more than 20 square degrees.  These data coincide with spectroscopic catalogs from the Hobby Eberly Telescope Dark Energy eXperiment, which will be provide a lasting legacy for galaxy evolution studies.  The catalogs for this field include an mid-IR-selected catalog from the Spitzer data, a first generation optical catalog using deep DECam imaging from the Cerro Tololo Interamerican Observatory (CTIO), and a catalog using the NEWFIRM data from the Kitt Peak National Observatory and CTIO.
