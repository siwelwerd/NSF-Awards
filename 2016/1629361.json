 "awd_abstract_narration": "NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: In modern science and technology, semiconducting materials play an enormous role in solid-state lighting, photovoltaics, light harvesting, and electronics. The work performed in this project will help unlock the full potential of nano-engineered semiconductors currently hidden by the effects of disorder. The proposed work will develop new experimental and theoretical techniques that eliminate negative effects due to non-uniform particle size and shape. The nanoscale semiconductors developed in this project will be used for color enhancement and energy efficiency improvement of television and electronic displays, light detectors, solar cells, and printable electronic circuits. The program will attract undergraduate and graduate students, and post-doctoral scholars who will be trained and prepared for academic and industrial careers. The PIs will also continue to integrate outreach into local programs, taking part in science club initiatives and demonstrations that focus on hands-on science experiences for public school students. The PIs will create and make publicly available a series of lecture notes for graduate students explaining computational stochastic methods to reduce the language barrier frequently experienced by quantum chemists working with this formalism. \r\n\r\nTECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: This research program will focus on the chemistry and physics of colloidal semiconducting nanoplatelets (NPLs), a novel class of quantum confined semiconductors combining beneficial aspects of the electronic structure of quantum wells and quantum dots. NPLs represent a promising platform to enter a new regime of modular materials, resonant couplings, and coherent transport phenomena. Experimental and theoretical efforts will build upon each other to achieve a fundamental understanding of optical and electronic phenomena, the role of electron-phonon coupling at the single NPL, formation of superradiant states, and charge and exciton transfer at the ensemble levels. New synthetic techniques will be developed to fabricate unprecedented NPL heterostructures. Accurate computational tools based on the notion of stochastic orbitals will be introduced to uncover the interplay between moderate and strong electron-hole correlation effects. Theoretical models will be benchmarked to the optical and electronic properties of NPLs measured by steady-state and transient techniques. Charge and exciton transport in assemblies of NPLs will be iteratively predicted and measured in order to gain a deep understanding of the emergent phenomena. The collaborative effort will provide means to develop new functional materials, uncover their properties, and reveal emergent behavior in the regime of strong electronic coupling. Beyond NPLs, the anticipated development of synthetic methods, optical techniques, and large-scale developed computational tools will impact broad areas of nanomaterials (graphene, nanoribbons) where strong correlation-induced confinement governs emergent electronic properties.",
