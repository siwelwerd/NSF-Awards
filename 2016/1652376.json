 "awd_abstract_narration": "Consistent with NSF's mission to advance research and education, Research and Education (R&E) partnerships between the U.S. and China have contributed to the global exchange of knowledge in the advanced research/higher education enterprise for over 30 years. Since 1999, the Chinese American Networking Symposium (CANS) has played an integral part in these developments through annual meetings that are held in the U.S. and China in alternate years.  The 2016 CANS workshop takes place in Houston, Texas and engages selected participants from both countries to discuss topics of mutual interest that revolve around R&E networks, their engineering, and ways in which network utilization can enhance science and education.  In the tradition of prior workshops over the last nearly two decades, CANS 2016 fosters scientific communication between the U.S. and China, and brings together researchers from multiple scientific disciplines with network engineers and campus leaders in Information Technology to explore the most effective mechanisms to foster increased research collaborations. The project has the potential to broaden the dialogue between research and education communities as well as impact the next generation of researchers and network engineers by providing a better understanding of shared science goals, and engaging campus leadership on how best to support those science goals through high performance networking.\r\n \r\nTechnical areas of exploration include native IPv6 deployment and support end-to-end for driving science applications, as well as performance measurement based on active performance testing with Perfsonar.",
