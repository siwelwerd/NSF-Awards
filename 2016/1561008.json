 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-technical Abstract\r\nThe ability to create new magnetic semiconductors in which the \"up\" or \"down\" magnetic spin orientation of conducting electrons can be controlled and manipulated through \"on\" or \"off\" electrical charge at ambient temperature could lead to smaller spin-based electronics (spintronics) for faster data processing, ultra-high-density data storage and low power consumption. With the support of the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program, the research team will use a combination of experimental and computational techniques to create new ferromagnetic semiconductors with flexible crystal structure and to investigate the nature of interactions between magnetic spin of free-carriers and localized magnetic atoms within these compounds that enables stable spintronic properties at room temperature. The discovery of such compounds could pave the way to next-generation computing in which data storage and processing functionalities are integrated on a single chip. The multidisciplinary nature of this project enables outstanding training of graduate students, undergraduate interns, high-school students and high-school teachers.  \r\n\r\nTechnical Abstract\r\nEngineering the atomic structure of an inorganic semiconductor to create isolated one-dimensional ferromagnetic subunits embedded within the semiconducting crystal lattice can enable (1) electronic manipulation of the ferromagnetic coupling strength within individual magnetic domains and (2) magnetic control of electronic transport within the semiconducting framework. Such atomic-scale integration of ordered magnetic and semiconducting domains in the same crystal structure enables independent investigation and understanding of the interactions between free-carrier spins and localized magnetic moments within these new classes of ferromagnetic semiconductors (FMSs). In this project, the research team combines advanced growth and characterization techniques with first-principles calculations to investigate FMSs based on transition-metal chalcogenides. The goal is to elucidate the mechanism by which charge carriers mediate or induce coupling between localized magnetic substructures embedded in the same crystal lattice in order to achieve exotic combinations of properties such as large magnetic moments, large coercivity, high Curie temperature and high electrical conductivity within a single material. Such a result would significantly advance our knowledge about the nature of coupling between electronic properties and magnetism, which is of tremendous importance to further expansion of research on spintronic materials.",

Our results suggest that while there is a strong correlation between the overall magnetic moment and free carriers spin, the magnitude of the Curie temperature (Tc) strongly depends on the spatial separation between localized magnetic centers rather than the concentration of magnetic atoms or the density of itinerant carriers.  For example, we demonstrated in the study \"Engineering magnetic transitions in Fe1-xSnxBi2Se4 n-type ferromagnetic semiconductors through chemical manipulation of spatial separation between magnetic centers\" 1 that partial substitution of Fe by Sn in FeBi2Se4 structure leads to an increase in the separation between magnetic centers within the Fe1-xSnxBi2Se4 crystal lattice, which in turn results in a decrease in the Curie  transition temperature, Tc, from ~ 450 K for compositions with x &le; 0.15 to 325 K for compositions with high Sn content (Figure 1). Understanding the nature and origin of high temperature ferromagnetic-like ordering in complex semiconducting transition metal selenides, such as FeBi2Se4 is extremely important and could shed the light on novel approaches to develop high-Tc ferromagnetism in traditional semiconductors.\n\nIn another study, \"Charge disproportionation triggers bipolar doping in FeSb2-xSnxSe4 ferromagnetic semiconductors enabling temperature-induced Lifshitz transition\",2 we found that charge disproportionation arising from the substitution of Sb3+ by Sn2+ in the FeSb2-xSnxSe4 series triggers partial oxidation of Sb3+ to Sb5+, which is accompanied by the generation of both electrons and holes. The observed bipolar doping induces a very interesting temperature-induced quantum electronic transition (Lifshitz transition), which is manifested by the presence of an anomalous peak in the resistivity curve simultaneously with a reversal of the sign of majority charge carriers from hole-like to electron-like at the temperature of maximum resistivity (Figure 2). \n\nFerromagnetic semiconductors (FMSs) featuring high Curie transition temperature (Tc) and strong correlation between itinerant carriers and localized magnetic moments are of tremendous importance for the development of practical spintronic devices.
