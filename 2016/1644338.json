 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Division of Chemistry supports this workshop, entitled \"Needs and Opportunities for Mid-Scale Instrumentation in Chemistry.\" It will be held on September 29-30, 2016 in Arlington, Virginia. Prof. Robert Hamers of the University of Wisconsin - Madison has assembled a team to organize the activities. This workshop brings together a diverse group of approximately 35 faculty from a broad range of institutions and geographic areas to discuss if research and education in the chemical sciences is limited by lack of access to instrumentation in the \"mid-scale\" range. These discussions focus on the regional and cyber enabled tools that could fill the needs of the chemistry community. \r\n\r\nGoals of the workshop include: (1) identifying chemistry research areas where scientific progress is significantly limited or inhibited by lack of access to mid-scale instrumentation, (2) identifying research areas in which co-location of mid-scale instrumentation into regional instrumentation facilities would provide opportunities for transformative advances in chemistry research, (3) educating stakeholders on how mid-scale instrumentation could impact research in the chemical sciences, (4) preparing a workshop report summarizing the participants' views, (5) disseminating the report and findings to the broad scientific community via a publicly available, written report and a short video. The broader impacts are addressed by benefiting society in ways that maximize the effectiveness of public support of research and education in the chemical sciences.",
