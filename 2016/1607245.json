These two symposia are Safety and Sustainability of Nanotechnology (#404) and Interfacial Phenomena For Bubbles, Droplets, Films and Soft Matter (#403). The requested funding will be used to provide travel awards to outstanding graduate students and non-tenured junior faculty members. At the conclusion of this conference, the PI will work closely with co-organizers and speakers to publish a symposium proceeding and one review or commentary to highlight the state-of-the-art of surface sciences, nanosafety and major issues discussed in these symposia.\r\n\r\nThe symposium of Safety and Sustainability of Nanotechnology aims to bring together chemists, biologists, engineers, and legislators to discuss necessary precautionary approaches of nanotechnology and to stimulate cost-effective measures to prevent environmental and health degradation. The particular focus will be on safety and sustainability of nanotechnology. The symposium of Interfacial Phenomena for Bubbles, Droplets, Films and Soft Matter aims to explore fundamental colloidal and interfacial phenomena and their role in a variety of physical chemistry and biophysical areas, such as smart surface, self-assembly and bionanotechnology. Both symposia are multidisciplinary and have far-reaching impacts on multiple scientific disciplines. The symposium of Safety and Sustainability of Nanotechnology will outreach four interdisciplinary research themes, i.e., nanotoxicology, nanomedicine and bionanotechnology, sustainable nanotechnology, and policy/regulation of nanotechnology. The symposium of Interfacial Phenomena for Bubbles, Droplets, Films and Soft Matter will cover three research areas, including colloid and surface science, bio-related soft matter, and molecular assembly of biomimetic systems.",
