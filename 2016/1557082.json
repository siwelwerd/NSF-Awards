 "awd_abstract_narration": "SES-1557082\r\nBruce Hoffman\r\nOhio University\r\n\r\nThis project uses archival materials from the Presidents Commission on Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice (1965-67) and interviews with commission staff to investigate the use of empirical science and technologies of systems analysis to rationalize and reshape traditional criminal justice practice. Regarded as a defining moment in the organization of criminal justice and criminological science due to its creation of federal institutions to fund criminal justice research, other contributions of the commission have been less appreciated, including its impact on criminal justice education by creating a disciplinary field of criminal justice distinct from sociology and its use of systems analysis to create models of the criminal justice process as an integrated system whose varied components were coordinated towards the common goal of crime control. This project will conduct the first sustained analysis of the Crime Commission, investigating how diverse visions of crime prevention and criminal justice were introduced, negotiated, packaged, and enacted over the course of the commission and by other groups in its immediate aftermath; how knowledge production was shaped through organizational dynamics between commissioners and the staff of the commissions nine task force panels; and the specific impact of the Science and Technology Task Force, which brought systems analysis to the field of \"civil defense\" and the \"war on crime.\" \r\n\r\nThe project's focus on science and technology provides a nuanced challenge to interpretations of the commission as extending Great Society agendas in uncomplicated ways. It explores how initial commission concerns with poverty and social causation dropped out of the commission's mappings and models of the criminal justice process, anticipating and shaping subsequent approaches and policy, and helps illuminate the subsequent extension of criminal justice technologies into everyday life. The analysis of extensive transcripts of meetings spanning a sixteenth month period adds to our understanding of the construction of scientific advisory reports, showing how diverse understandings of scientific aims and political interests are negotiated and packaged for perceived audiences.  The project also serves as the last opportunity to preserve the memories and contemporary evaluations of justice practices by commission staff whose careers that began with the possibilities of the Crime Commission and witnessed unprecedented transformations in criminal justice practices. \r\n\r\nThe project is based in the empirical collection and analysis of three types of data.  First, the study will use the tools of contemporary science studies to engage in a careful textual analysis of the public documents of the crime commission, interpreting these technical reports as public performances through which scientific credibility is communicated and maintained.  Second, the analysis of official accounts will be complemented by the analysis of internal accounts collected at NARA sites and related collections.  The archives are believed to contain a variety of relevant documents, including transcripts from commission meetings, notes from advisory panels, internal letters and memoranda, drafts of reports, and early maps and models of the criminal justice process.  Both the public documents and internal documents will be coded using similar coding mechanisms enabling larger themes and developments to emerge.  Third, the investigator will seek to contact and conduct audiotaped or videotaped interviews of all available staff connected with the commission.  The goal of these interviews is to collect general perspectives of recollected operations, aspirations, and tensions within the crime commission across multiple organizational roles and standpoints, which can be cross-referenced with archival documents and other interviews.  The investigator will also seek to record and gain participants' insights into previously unrecognized connections between the systems model being set forth and the subsequent development of criminal justice and criminology, as well as their interpretation and evaluation of later developments.\r\n\r\nThe project will design an interactive website designed for classroom use. The site will use techniques of science and technology studies to translate the project's central themes concerning science and the origins of the criminal justice system. At a time of heightened interest and criticism of US policies of mass incarceration and institutionalized criminal justice responses to racial inequality and popular protest, the project and website serves as an important \"history of the present\" that contextualizes how contemporary configurations of criminological science and criminal justice practices emerged and illuminates alternative paths not taken. The study also trains a team of undergraduates in archival research, the organization and analysis of primary source documents, and the development and presentation of research at professional meetings.",

One of the greatest surprises was the extensive archival data available. I made 25 research trips to over 50 archives across the United States, collecting a wide range of materials that had previously not been brought together and that significantly expand our understanding of the Commission. Collections ranged from NARA repositories of official documents, and Congressional, state, and individual collections, to collections by legal and philanthropic organizations and FBI FOIA requests.\n\n\nOne key finding of my research reveals the Crime Commission as both a political and scientific process. Discussions in criminology about the Commission tend to focus on its products, treating the reports that the Commission produced as if they were peer-reviewed science detached from the politicized process that produced them. The archival materials, enabling focus on organizational dynamics, allow researchers to understand the politics and decisions that shaped and produced the work, including what was omitted, what was included for political or strategic purposes, and what was packaged to impact specific perceived audiences. What emerges is an understanding of the Commission as a process that at once constrains and legitimates scientific findings creating a certain kind of public scientific knowledge that is certified and usable from having resulted from a political process involving power and compromise.\n\n\nEspecially interesting is what the documents reveal about the tensions within the Commission between different groups of staff members. Staff tended to be youngerlaw students and social scientists recruited from universities. One of the tensions among this group included those who wanted the Commission to address crime prevention and social inequality and those who wanted to restrict the Commissions focus to the criminal justice process after a crime is detected. Interestingly, much of this highly charged debate played out in the medium of system analysis and throughout the life of the Commission, with different models being proposed and produced up until the publication of the major reports. My findings also challenge traditional accounts of how systems analysis was incorporated into the Commission, locating it far earlier in the process than previously understood, and introduced by a much broader range of parties than previously known.\n\n\nThere were also tensions between the staff and the commissioners, who were the public face of the Commission. Commissioners tended to be older, high profile, and most worked in legal professions. Several of the commissioners were revealed to be involved in oversight and revision of the staffs work to a surprising degree. Many had previous agendas relating to legal reform that played into the Commissions work, and many were concerned that they would be held publicly responsible for conclusions that sociologically trained staff were incorporating into the reports. Also surprising was the extent to which J. Edgar Hoovers FBI was involved in the process, especially in relation to issues of science, technology, and statistics, and often exerting surveillance and control over the commissions work through the commissioners themselves. While many of the commissioners lacked direct involvement in criminal justice issues prior to the Commission, for several of them, it was a transformative experience that significantly influenced their later careers.\n\n\nFinally, my research reorients the work of the Crime Commission, revealing it as a continuation and culmination of a broad movement of actors who were using science to promote and shape an agenda of criminal justice reform. Elite legal organizations and law schools were proposing research agendas and interventions increasingly grounded in empirical social science, operational analysis, and information technologies. Moreover, these projects were shaped and supported by philanthropic foundations. These projects helped shape the agendas and organization of the Crime Commission.\n\n\nIn addition to its findings, I was able to make contributions while conducting the research, including assisting archivists in processing and cataloging materials, and, in one instance, locating a large collection of undocumented material by a major legal theorist. I presented nine conference research papers based on the research, and assisted with the American Society of Criminologys Annual Meetings the year it was focused on the Commissions 50th Anniversary. The research also enabled the training of undergraduate students in archival research and data analysis through the Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program. On a personal level, the time and research access provided by this grant has been deeply transformative and has reoriented important aspects of my original research agenda. I am currently working on the first book-length study of the Crime Commission that places it within the broader currents of using science and technology for legal and criminal justice reform during the period.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/14/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: BruceHoffman\n"
