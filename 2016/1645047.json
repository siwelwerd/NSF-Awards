 "awd_abstract_narration": "Flaws and defects in structures evolve gradually over a structure's lifetime, and potential degradation must be evaluated periodically to make sound management decisions and set repair priorities. Human observation, still the predominant mechanism for such evaluation, is time-consuming and costly. Citizen science and crowdsourcing provide opportunities to collect large numbers of photos of certain structures, from many perspectives, at frequent intervals, and under many conditions. Such visual data reach across both time and space, enabling a detailed record of deterioration over time. This EArly-concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) project will exploit the latest knowledge in computer vision to automate many tasks related to lifecycle structural evaluation and management, reducing both lifecycle cost and risk. The methodology developed within this project will also launch new opportunities for structural engineers seeking to exploit data science to address a broad range of structural engineering problems. A streaming video demonstrating the methodology on our target structure will be developed for broad dissemination and student engagement. \r\n\r\nEveryday images from citizens, not trained as engineers, are very different than the types of images than engineers capture. Large portions of these images have information irrelevant for engineering purposes and automated processing of these images would generate faulty conclusions. Furthermore, these images are collected from random locations and perspectives, and lack scale and orientation information. However, these barriers can be overcome. This project will incorporate essential knowledge about the structural evaluation process to enable the use of these images for engineering purposes. Geometric relationships between each of the query images and the model of the target structure will be computed by matching their local features. Automatic localization of each of these images with respect to the target structure will be performed, and relevant portion of the images, called the region of interest, will be extracted for structural evaluation by human or machine. Experimental validation will be performed using images collected from active engaged citizens through social media. A quantitative evaluation of the capabilities of the methodology will be performed, targeting especially vulnerable regions of a structure. This project will overcome the inherent challenges in using visual data from citizen scientists, facilitating a transformation in how we perform lifecycle structural evaluation.",

Many such photos are taken of structures with historical significance or that have large numbers of visitors, and thus they contain valuable information that can inform periodic condition assessment, and can be useful to document the actual condition of a given structure over many years.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"BodyParCxSpMiddle\">In this project, we devised a realistic approach to visual lifecycle assessment of structural systems by enabling the active use of citizen science and crowdsourced images for such visual inspection. We developed a novel region-of-interest (ROI) localization technique that enables us to extract highly relevant and useful portions of citizen science images to conduct frequent and robust visual assessments. The technique was demonstrated and validated using a large volume of citizen science images (CIMs). Purdue University&rsquo;s Bell Tower, as shown in Fig 1, is used for our demonstration and validation. Vulnerable regions were identified and damage-like markings were temporarily placed on the structure, and images of those regions were extracted automatically to facilitate high quality inspection by trained engineers.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"BodyParCxSpLast\">Certain challenges needed to be overcome to make use of these images. When engineers collect images, the relevant regions of the structure (that need inspection) are contained in the image. The quality of the image is also high and the target of the image is the component being inspected. However, when these images are not collected by field engineers for the purpose of visual assessment, there are significant challenges in using these photos. The important regions of the images for inspection may be blurred (out of focus), the components that require inspection may not be in the central area of the image or may only occupy a small portion of the image, and the image may have occlusions covering the regions that may be most relevant for inspections. We automatically overcome these challenges to extract relevant and useful ROIs for inspection.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>There are several steps in the technique:&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Step 1 is to construct a robust baseline model of the structure (see Figure 2). 5,254 images were collected over several months under different conditions.</li>\n<li>Step 2 involves collecting CIMS of the Purdue Bell Tower at times when there are large numbers of people on campus, such as graduation (see Figure 1).&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Step 3 in the technique is to register each image to the baseline model. We find matches between the 3D points in the baseline model and the 2D features on each of the CIMs (see Figure 3).&nbsp;</li>\n<li>The next step is to localize and extract the relevant ROIs from each photo for three preselected target areas.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>The final step is to&nbsp;detect (crack) damage on the ROIs.
