 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation Program (MRI) and support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program (CRIF), Professor David Blauch from Davidson College and colleagues Durwin Striplin, Cindy Hauser and Nicole Snyder have acquired a liquid chromatograph mass spectrometer (LCMS) equipped with electrospray-ionization (ESI) and atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) sources coupled to the liquid chromatograph. Mass spectrometry (MS) is an analytical technique used to identify the chemical composition of a sample and to determine its purity by measuring the mass of the molecular constituents in the sample. Chromatography is an isolation technique that precedes the mass spectrometry analysis. It separates a mixture of components in a liquid into its several constituent chemicals which are then analyzed and identified by the mass spectrometer.  The electrospray produces an aerosol of ions by applying a high voltage to the sample. These are some of the most widely used analytical instrumentation techniques used to identify and quantify the chemical composition of a sample. The acquisition strengthens the research infrastructure at the University and regional area. The instrument broadens participation by involving diverse students in research and research training with this modern analytical technique and also and also supports research efforts from two other local universities, Queens University of Charlotte, a masters-level regional university, and Johnson C. Smith University, an HBCU.\r\n\r\nThe award is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels, especially in areas such as (a) developing chromophores and redox assemblies for solar energy conversion; (b) synthesizing and profiling complex carbohydrate constructs with proteins and other biomolecules; and (c) examining the reactivity of non-innocent ligand-metal complexes.",
