 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to organize a high quality workshop involving participants from United States and India to foster synergistic research collaboration on Smart and Connected Communities (SC2), a topic of national importance for both countries. The SC2 workshop will be held on June 9-11, 2016 at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Delhi. It  aims to bring together 12 thought leaders and visionary researchers from each of US and India to explore collaboration on developing scientific and engineering foundations, innovative information and communication technology (ICT) solutions to enable livable, workable, sustainable, and connected communities with a goal to improve quality of life. \r\n\r\nThe workshop will focus on the applications of ICT to healthcare, energy, and disaster response and recovery. These application domains pose unique challenges so far as physical environments, demography, social and cultural differences are concerned. By jointly investigating them, it is possible to leverage a broad set of distinct yet complementary scenarios, testbeds, and datasets critical for studying a wide variety of sustainable societies that integrate ICT solutions. This will help establish stronger US-India strategic alliance in research, education, technology innovation, entrepreneurship, and workforce development in order to be globally competitive.",
