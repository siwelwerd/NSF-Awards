 "awd_abstract_narration": "Patients with chronic illness require frequent and avoidable hospital visits. This project aims to develop a new class of battery-less, low-cost, disposable, wireless electronic patch sensors to monitor a variety of physiological signals and a custom smartphone app to monitor their health status and to elect to share their anonymized events-of-interest with their community towards a smart and connected community (S&CC). To achieve these aims, the interdisciplinary research team is collaborating with the non-profit McKendree District of the United Methodist Church located in the greater Memphis community to complete this work. This will empower users, permit the community stakeholders to assess population health status, reduce the need for frequent hospital visits, and help identify potential individual and community actions to achieve improvement in health status. The project also involves the training of undergraduate and graduate students in interdisciplinary research activities on emerging technologies, and is expected to impact public and private sector efforts to improve healthcare.  \r\n\r\n\r\nA smart and connected community (S&CC) will utilize distributed sensors and embedded computing to seamlessly generate meaningful interpretations that would be of greater benefit to individuals, the community, and society, in general, through improved health and safety, efficient public infrastructure, and better access to needed services. Although rapidly emerging mobile health technology is already tapping into widely used smartphone infrastructure, data collection using smartphone mobile devices is currently limited by few integrated sensors (e.g., Inertial measurement unit (IMU), camera, optical sensors, temperature sensor, and GPS). There are tremendous opportunities to advance the smart and connected communities by incorporating capabilities from external battery-less sensors into this framework to enable data collection and analysis for broader personal and community gain. Towards this goal, this research will (1) deliver a platform of fully-passive wireless electronic patch sensors for physiological data collection and to incorporate multimodal sensor data, (2) develop an open-source framework for meaningful and reliable Events-of-Interest (EoI) detection using a custom smartphone app for self-monitoring and communal sharing, and (3) deploy the sensors in a \"Living Lab\" for a pilot study to collect and classify these data in real-time to generate EoIs for various health conditions, such as arrhythmia, asthma, and sleep disorder.",

There are tremendous opportunities to advance S&amp;CC by incorporating capabilities from external wearables with mobile health (mHealth) into a framework that will drastically expand heterogeneous data collection, edge computing, and broader utilization for both personal and community gains. In this context, Dr. Morshed's research project titled \"Events of interest Capture Using Novel Body-worn Fully-passive Wireless Sensors for S&amp;CC\" has achieved the proposed research goals and produced substantial progress and outcomes. The accomplished project's goals were to develop new capabilities with inkjet printing (IJP) electronics to fabricate fully-passive wireless electronic patch sensors, to incorporate multimodal sensor data to detect events-of-Interest (such as disease severity) at the edge using low complexity machine learning algorithms within a custom smartphone app, to develop a custom webserver for spatio-temporal visualization of disease severity data, and to deploy the sensor suites to collect real-life data from \"Living Labs\" for various health conditions including COPD, OSA, and flu.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We have improved IJP fabrication process to develop single and multilayer flexible electronic circuits on paper and thin film PI substrate. Several functional circuits have been designed and tested. We have also developed fully-passive body-worn sensors (\"WRAP sensors\") and a portable scanner. We have developed multiple machine learning algorithms for disease severity classification with high accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. Best algorithms were implemented in our custom smartphone app (\"SCC Health app\"). We have also developed a webserver (\"SCC Health server\") for spatio-temporal visualization of the user submitted deidentified and aggregated disease severity data. During the pilot study, we recruited 11 participants through our community partner for a total of 16 sessions. The pilot study was conducted for over a year where each session constitutes of 1-month usage of the sensor suite by the participants at their home (\"Living Labs\"). Post-survey (N=16) results show that our sensor suite met expectations (4.62+/-1.63 in a scale of 5) of the users, were easy to use (4.75+/-1.53), and did not interfere with sleep (1.67+/-1.32). The results also show that participants were somewhat comfortable (68.6%) with sharing of identifiable data with physicians, while very comfortable (93.8%) with sharing of deidentified data to the study server for communal benefits.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The project will directly impact on various other disciplines such as public health, social science, and remote health. The project has provided research experience for multiple graduate and undergraduate students in Engineering and Public Health departments, two of whom are minority females. Outcomes have been shared with the community partner at multiple engagements, through the project web-portal, and Github. This project has produced 1 patent application, 4 journal articles, 16 conference papers, and 11 poster presentations. One of the conference papers received the first-place award at a prestigious conference.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 04/29/2020<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by:
