 "awd_abstract_narration": "Despite the enormous ecological and economic importance of insects, the majority of species are known only from a few museum specimens with little data on their behavior or ecological associations. Most insects also belong to large lineages that are difficult to study comprehensively because of their extreme diversity, the shortage of taxonomic expertise, and the difficulty of obtaining specimens suitable for detailed genetic study. This project will integrate multiple data layers for one such insect lineage, the plant-sap-sucking leafhopper subfamily Deltocephalinae, comprising >6,600 species and including many agricultural pests, invasive species, and species of conservation concern. Products will include a comprehensive and open-access set of digital tools for identifying leafhopper species and higher groups, a phylogeny showing the relationships among these groups, and an online database that organizes information on each species including geographic and seasonal distribution, anatomical traits, genomic information and associations with plants and microbes. These data will help facilitate identification and tracking of invasive species and contribute to improved knowledge of leafhopper biodiversity worldwide. They also will help identify genetic traits associated with the ability of leafhopper species to transmit plant disease pathogens, thereby enhancing prediction and management of threats to agriculture and food security.\r\n\r\nThis project will construct an open-access phylogeny for the leafhopper subfamily Deltocephalinae.  It also will create an online digital research platform that combines nomenclatural, morphological, ecological and distributional data from the previous literature and digitized collections to create a comprehensive set of identification tools and illustrated taxon pages for the leafhoppers.  It also will establish a genome bank and use efficient next-generation DNA sequencing technology to capture genetic data informative of phylogenetic relationships, microbial associations (including endosymbionts and plant pathogens), and ecological traits (diet breadth and host-plant associations).  It will provide intensive training for both students and established taxonomists to facilitate a global collaborative effort to fully document the biodiversity of leafhoppers and their plant and microbial associates.  Finally, the project will provide a robust cyberinfrastructure and model workflows to support research on other diverse groups of organisms.",

Results include (1) identification and extraction of DNA for &gt;2500 specimens representing &gt;700 genera and &gt;1700 species to create a genome bank to support future research; (2) compilation and analysis of DNA sequence data for &gt;650 gene regions to obtain a comprehensive evolutionary tree (phylogeny) for Deltocephalinae, trace the evolution of host plant associations, and estimate the time and place (region) of origin of the major lineages; (3) compilation of an Internet-accessible database comprising all deltocephaline species and including a web page for each species and higher group showing images of the insect, distribution maps and a list of relevant literature citations; (4) use of the database to create illustrated interactive identification keys for higher groups and species of deltocephaline leafhoppers. The project yielded the first comprehensive evolutionary tree for flavobacterial insect endosymbionts, showing how the symbiotic bacterial associated with different insect groups are related to each other and to non-symbiotic (feel-living) bacteria. The project also resulted in discovery of several new leafhopper-associated bacterial plant pathogens (phytoplasmas) and yielded the first molecular timetree for this group of bacteria, showing that the group first diversified during the Carboniferous (~300 million years ago), roughly coinciding with the time of origin of their insect vectors and seed plant hosts. More than 900 new leafhopper species, many representing new genera, were also discovered during the project. The project yielded 75 publications in refereed scientific journals. It enhanced scientific infrastructure by augmenting physical insect collections with &gt;3000 newly identified specimens and creating a genomic DNA archive at the University of Illinois with specimens representing a large fraction of the known diversity of Deltocephalinae. The project also contributed to training of three postdoctoral fellows, four graduate students and three undergraduates, the majority of whom are women and/or under-represented minorities.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/16/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Dmitry&nbsp;A&nbsp;Dmitriev</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImage\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation onePhoto\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1639601/1639601_10452690_1669153449694_Figure_1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1639601/1639601_10452690_1669153449694_Figure_1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Phylogeny of Deltocephalinae\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1639601/1639601_10452690_1669153449694_Figure_1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Phylogeny of Deltocephalinae\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Analysis of one of the largest insect phylogenetic datasets ever compiled, comprising 730 species and sequences from 685 genes, yielded this well resolved estimate of relationships among major lineages of deltocephaline leafhoppers.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Y.
