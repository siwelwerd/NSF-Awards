 "awd_abstract_narration": "Measuring the turbulence in the atmosphere at different altitudes or \"heights\" above telescope observing sites allows astronomers to correct for the blurring of images that this turbulence produces. This blurring occurs when observing stars and galaxies at night, but also when observing the star nearest to the earth, the Sun, during the day. The principal investigator (PI) of this proposal, along with a graduate student and a post-doctoral scholar, will build a portable unit that can be used to measure the turbulence \"profile\" above any observatory. The instrument will be used specifically with telescopes that observe the sun. The device will be tested at solar telescopes at the Sacramento Peak and Kitt Peak observatories, and eventually at the U.S.'s newest facility, the Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope, DKIST, in Hawaii. The PI's institution, California State University Northridge (CSUN), is an undergraduate teaching institution with modest internal support for research; it is also a Hispanic Serving Institution (HSI) due to the large fraction of under-represented minority undergraduates served.\r\n\r\nThe PI aims to develop a portable seeing profiler for use at solar observatories. The device will measure the profile of atmospheric turbulence as a function of altitude (up to 30 km) above the observing site. The instrument comprises off-the-shelf components and two small, 10 cm telescopes that can be transported to any solar observatory.   Knowledge of the atmospheric seeing conditions is crucial to the performance of solar adaptive optics (AO) systems. Existing seeing profiler techniques use large telescopes with diameters of 1.2 meters or more and need access to the sky over many months. The low-cost portable system proposed here should thus alleviate some of these issue. Currently, relatively little is known about the daytime seeing profile on many of the world's solar telescope sites. A prototype device has already been built and tested; for the new instrument modest funding is requested to purchase mechanical parts and two scientific CMOS cameras, to assemble the equipment, to develop the associated software, and finally to test the set-up at Sacramento Peak and at the DKIST site in Hawaii.",

Current solar seeing profile measurement is limited by the requirement of a large facility telescope with an aperture size at least 1.2 meters, which makes the seeing profile measurement impossible on a potential new observation site, where large facility telescope is not available. To remove this critical obstacle, we proposed the Advanced Multi-Aperture Seeing Profiler. Our A-MASP consists of two small telescopes, each with a small size on the order of 100-m only. The A-MASP is a portable system, in which the two-telescope assembly can be installed on an off-the-shelf tripod and is a low cost system. Therefore, it can be brought to any site to measure the seeing profile, including a potential new site where no large facility solar telescope is available.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Through this project, several potential daytime solar observational sites were considered for the seeing measurements, including the former National Solar Observatory (NSO) Sunspot (NM, 9,200' elevation), the Big Bear Solar Observatory (BBSO CA, 6,752&prime; elevation), Mount Wilson Observatory (CA, 5,715' elevation), the Pyramid Lake (CA, 2,579&prime;), Castaic Lake (CA, 1,280&prime;) and Malibu beach (CA, 50'). From our initial solar images taken from these sites, we found that both the BBSO and the Pyramid Lake deliver best seeing, since solar graduates can be imaged with almost diffraction-limited performance with a 125-mm aperture telescope. For the rest sites, graduate images are seriously blurred by the poor seeing conditions, although the Malibu beach and Castaic Lake are better than the NSO Sunspot and Mount Wilson Observatory. As a summary, we can conclude that for a good potential solar site, a high elevation and large amount of water from the ocean or lake are two critical conditions to deliver good seeing. The water helps to cool the air, which reduces the ground layer turbulence, while the high elevation is helpful to get rid out of most of the ground layer turbulence. This explains why the BBSO and the Pyramid Lake could deliver best seeing among them. The above conclusions are important to be served as a guideline to find a good site for future solar site surveys.</p>\n<p>Our A-MASP consists of two small telescopes, each with an aperture on the order of 100-mm, and can measure the seeing profile to an altitude up to 30-km. For the A-MASP, the maximum altitude or height that can be measured is determined by the separation of the two telescopes used for the seeing profile measurement. To demonstrate the proposed A-MASP system for the seeing profile measurement, we constructed a dedicated portable device, which could be brought to a potential site for instant daytime seeing profile measurements. Our A-MASP separation can be changed by replaced the frame that mounts the 2 telescopes. 3 frames with separation of 0.7, 1.0 and 1.2 meter are made respectively, which can be used to measure the seeing profile with a height up to 15km, 25km, 30km respectively. For reliable seeing measurements, a site with good seeing conditions is favorable, which allows us to resolve the low-contrast solar granule patterns of the guide star with high confidence. The system was tested for the seeing profile measurement in the 2019 and 2020, at the BBSO, where good seeing is available. Figure 1 shows the photographs of our 0.7-meter separation system being used for the seeing profile measurements at the BBSO in 2019. Our measurement results were compared with the results made with traditional differential image motion monitor. Figure 2 shows the overall seeing Fried parameter measurement results, made with our A-MASP and the traditional DIMM, and good consistency is achieved. Figure 3 presents the measurement results of the turbulence strength distribution made with our A-MASP, at the good seeing condition on October 8, 2019. Our measurements of the seeing profile distribution are consistent with the results conducted with the BBSO 1.6-meter Goode Solar Telescope. This work fully demonstrated that our A-MASP can reliably measure the seeing Fried parameter and the seeing profile distribution, and it paves the way for a portable optical device to be used for the future solar on-site seeing profile measurements and site surveys.</p>\n<p>Education is an important component for this NSF project. The measurement data and method is being designed as an individual module and is integrated into our popular online astronomical laboratory course ASTR-154L that the PI is teaching with large amount of students enrolled.
