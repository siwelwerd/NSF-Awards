 "awd_abstract_narration": "1605425\r\nPark\r\n\r\nThe opportunity to recover chemical energy from wastewater, while widely recognized, is hindered by two challenges: the lack of an effective method to harness this energy and the cost incurred, i. e., amount of energy required, for wastewater treatment. Innovation of wastewater treatment that is sustainable and can recover potential energy is, thus, urgent. The primary goal of this project is to further the understanding of an advanced newly developed system, the oxygenic photogranule-based process, which has the potential to turn wastewater treatment plants into energy positive water resource recovery facilities.\r\n\r\nThe proposed research is based on the discovery and invention in the PIs research group that activated sludge can naturally transform into self-aerating biogranules and be used for flow-through systems for aeration-free wastewater treatment. Since aeration is the highest energy demand in operating existing wastewater treatment plants, development of this new technology can bring substantial energy savings. Phototrophic assimilation of CO2 within oxygenic photogranules also opens opportunities to recover wastewaters chemical energy and solar energy in the form of high quality bio-feedstock. These features may lead to a paradigm change in how wastewater is treated. This research will also reveal the mechanism by which oxygenic photogranules are formed under both static and hydrodynamic conditions, which is a unique phenomenon for this microbial granule. Furthermore, the research will address key questions, such as system adaptability to the deep-tank reactor operation under natural or engineered light conditions, which must be answered to scale up the process, substantially advancing the new technology for industrialization. This GOALI application proposes international, multidisciplinary collaboration between academia and industry to: 1) improve fundamental understanding of the oxygenic photogranule granulation phenomenon, and, 2) engineer the key components of this new technology for commercialization. To accomplish these goals, the PIs propose three research aims: 1) to elucidate the granulation phenomenon in reactor operation; 2) to engineer the light pattern to advance the oxygenic photogranule process for industrial use; and, 3) to investigate the feasibility of the oxygenic photogranule process for municipal wastewater treatment. \r\n\r\nThis research will involve studies of advanced microscopy, deep-sequencing based microbial ecology, physiology of oxygenic photogranules, and reactor hydrodynamics to understand oxygenic photogranule formation, in reactor operation and its comparison to granulation occurring under static cultivation conditions. This project will also conduct substantial reactor studies to investigate the impact of light pattern on granulation and additional N removal by the biological nutrient removal mechanism. Finally, the project will carry out a pilot to investigate the feasibility of the oxygenic photogranule process for municipal wastewater treatment with development of the economic cost model for the oxygenic photogranule process; thus, the data generated during this research will be easily transferred to industry. This research is transformative because it will develop a new technology to change energy consuming wastewater treatment plants into energy positive facilities. Successful development and industrialization of the oxygenic photogranule process will therefore bring substantial societal and environmental impact. This project involves well-planned multidisciplinary research comprising collaboration among U.S.-based academia and industry and a research institute in France. Working with industry partners is essential for this project because its ultimate goal is to implement the process in municipalities. The project will use collaboration between the PIs at university and industry to mentor each other, industrialize the process, and disseminate the research at both academic and industry meetings. The project also includes international collaboration to promote oxygenic photogranule research and reach out to broader scientists and engineers around the world. The French researchers also submitted the proposal to their national funding agency, which will complement the oxygenic photogranule research to be done in the U.S. This GOALI will also enhance the PIs collaboration with researchers and students from a womens liberal arts college, to apply microscopy to understand the granulation phenomenon. During this project, the PI will continue to reach out to Kenyan collaborators to work together for sanitation in Kenya and to initiate an oxygenic photogranule pilot in Kenya in the future. Finally, the PIs groups will have continuous outreach to municipalities in the region, to spread awareness and incite excitement among municipal employees to be connected to and involved with academic research.",

The OPG biomass greater than 3 mm typically showed layered structure, which could support the development of anoxic conditions useful for removing nitrogen.
