 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal builds on surprising evidence from an earlier study by this group that perturbations in the equatorial electrojet (a narrow ribbon of strong dayside ionospheric current flowing along the magnetic dip equator) may actually be caused by bursts of auroral activity called substorms on the nightside at polar latitudes.  During substorms, strong currents are diverted from large radial distances in the extended tail of the magnetosphere along magnetic field lines into and through the ionosphere on the nightside.  The ionospheric segment of the current is seen as a strong auroral electrojet (AEJ) at polar latitudes.  The equatorial electrojet (EEJ), on the other hand, is generated as a result of the interaction between neutral winds flowing away from a region of strong solar heating while dragging ions across magnetic field lines, and the unique geometry of strictly horizontal magnetic field lines at the dip equator.   The association between these electrojets implies that electric fields are penetrating from the polar region as far as the dip equator during substorms. Even though weak by the time they reach the equatorial region, their signatures can be observed in the modulation of the intense equatorial electrojet.  This is a proposal to investigate more completely the response of the equatorial electrojet to substorms and determine its global closure.  The penetration of the auroral electric field to low-latitudes, and the shielding that inhibits or prevents this penetration, are open and compelling questions for understanding and more accurately predicting space weather, which ultimately has benefits to society.  Significant broader impacts include the participation of high-school teachers and students during the summer in research associated with this project.\r\n\r\nTo accomplish the goals of this project, the proposers will address two questions: (1) how does the auroral electrojet respond to substorms, and  (2) how is the substorm-related change of the dayside EEJ connected with the nightside AEJ.\r\nThey will use data from a network of ground magnetometers, which includes 7 ground stations around the dip equator and a meridional chain of stations, along with auroral images from the Polar and IMAGE satellites. To answer question 1, they will use publicly-available lists of substorms, along with these observations, to determine statistically how often the EEJ responds to substorm onsets either by intensifying or weakening, the magnetic local time dependence of the response, and whether it is changed by the preceding level of geomagnetic activity.  To answer question 2, they will examine the magnetic deflection (a measure of electric current intensity) as a function of solar zenith angle and magnetic latitude to test the idea that the EEJ and AEJ are connected by meridional currents that flow around the terminator.  This is a new idea and a unique aspect of this proposal.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nEnergy transported from the solar wind to the magnetosphere is deposited into the high-latitude ionosphere (auroral zone) through the formation of various current systems.  Ground magnetic disturbances have been studied for diagnosing such current systems, and especially disturbances observed in mid- and low latitudes are informative of large-scale current systems as the effect of small-scale current systems are mostly confined in the auroral zone.  However, electric fields also extend from the auroral zone to lower latitudes locally driving ionospheric currents, and for investigating the magnetosphere-ionosphere (M-I) coupling, it is critical to discern the remote effects to large-scale high-latitude M-I current systems form those of local ionospheric currents.  In this project we examined mid- and low-latitude magnetic disturbances observed during geomagnetic storms and auroral substorms, two major classes of M-I coupling processes, and how they characterize associated M-I current systems.\n\nIn this project we used geomagnetic indices and sub(local time)-indices, as well as data from individual ground stations, provided by SuperMAG, an NSF-funded facility for international collaboration of ground magnetic field data analysis.  Some indices are widely used as measures of various eastward and westward auroral currents, and other indices represent storm/substorm activity.  We conducted both event-based and statistical studies by examining correlation among those indices and global distributions of ground magnetic disturbances. \n\nThe following are major scientific outcomes of this project:\n\n1) During the development (main) phase of geomagnetic storms, a wedge-shaped current system, which consists of an enhanced westward auroral current closing with a pair of field-aligned currents, often forms at postmidnight and extends eastward covering the entire the dawn sector.  The current system causes large magnetic defections as well as enhancements on the dawnside.\n\n2) The dawn-dusk asymmetry of midlatitude magnetic depressions, which is a characteristic feature of the storm main phase and is often addressed in the context of the local time distribution of a magnetospheric current (i.e., the partial ring current), can be actually attributed to the above-mentioned dawnside wedge current system.\n\n3) The substorm current wedge is a coherent large-scale current system rather than an ensemble of meso-scale current systems named ?wedgelets?, which form as an earthward flow is decelerated in the near-Earth magnetosphere.\n\n4) During substorms, midlatitude ground magnetic field changes in correlation with the maximum intensity of the auroral electrojet not only on the night side but also on the day side.  This result also supports the idea that the substorm wedge current is a coherent large-scale current system.\n\nThese results suggest that storm/substorm-time mid-/low-latitude ground magnetic disturbances are largely remote effects (as expected from the Biot-Savart law) of M-I current systems in the auroral zone rather than those of local ionospheric currents due to the equatorward penetration of auroral-zone electric fields. \n\nIn addition to these scientific researches we made the following contributions to the geospace community;\n\n1) We created a list of storm intervals over 2 decades (1996 ? 2018), which is available to the public now.  Selection of events is usually a time-consuming step of research, and we expect that the science community will find this list useful for future studies of storm dynamics.\n\n2) The project members actively participated in GEM-related activities. The PI served as a Research Area Coordinator for 6 years as a member of the GEM steering committee.\n\n3) The PI co-supervised graduate students and junior scientists in Japan.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/18/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Shinichi Ohtani"
