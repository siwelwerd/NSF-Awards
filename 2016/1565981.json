 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanism B program of the Chemistry Division, Professors Hee-Seung Lee and Robert Hancock of the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at the University of North Carolina, Wilmington are developing new types of sensors that emit light in the presence of specific ions.  In particular, they are exploring a new design principle for efficient \"turn-on\" fluorescent sensors that exploits a fluorescent molecule competing with the anion for an interaction with a metal atom.  The project brings together various subfields of chemistry and provides many opportunities for undergraduate students to participate in high level research.  Fluorescent probes have become indispensable tools in modern biology and biotechnology because they provide real time information concerning the quantity of ions or molecules of interest within the living cell.  Thus, the anion sensors developed in this project may spur significant advances in our understanding of cell biology. \r\n\r\nIn tethered fluorescence sensors, a key factor in quenching fluorescence is metal-fluorophore pi-contact.  Disruption of these pi-contacts by coordination of target anions leads to restoration of fluorescence that can be exploited to develop efficient \"turn-on\" anion sensors.  New ligands are being synthesized and the complexes of these ligands with a variety of metal ions are being evaluated as the basis of anion sensors.  Different fluorophores are being examined to identify their ability to form pi-contacts with metal ions.  Anions of biological, biomedical, and environmental interest such as nitrate are being studied.  An integral part of this project is the use of density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT to understand the fluorescence quenching by metal ions and the ability of metal-ligand complexes to act as anion sensors.",

Of importance to our work is to use fluorescent molecules to selectively detect metal ions and anions in solution. An example of fluorescence is seen in Figure 1, where our sensor molecule is seen not to fluoresce under UV light, but does so when it binds either Zn(II) or Cd(II) ions.</p>\n<p>Our initial interest was to understand why some metal ions such as Zn(II) enhance fluorescence when it binds to sensors, while other metal ions such as Hg(II) or Pb(II), referred to as heavy metal ions, quench fluorescence. Sensing heavy metal ions is of great importance because of their toxicity. Our studies showed that heavy metal ions are more likely to form what are called &pi;-contacts with the fluorophore part of the sensor. We proposed that if it was a &pi;-contact that quenched fluorescence, then an anion that could bind to the metal ion would disrupt the &pi;-contact with the fluorophore, and restore fluorescence (Figure 2). It was indeed found that Cd(II), when complexed with adpa, could act as a sensor for anions (Figure 2). In this project, we explored this totally novel approach based on the role of &pi;-contacts to develop fluorescent sensors for metal ions and anions in solution.</p>\n<p>To briefly summarize some of the important outcomes of our research:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>(1) We have established from analysis of crystal structures of various metal ion complexes, and from density functional theory (DFT) calculations, that a general order of ability to form &pi;-contacts is Ni(II) &asymp; Zn(II) &lt;&lt; Cd(II) &lt; Pb(II) &lt; Hg(II) &lt; Pd(II)<sup> </sup>&asymp; Cu(II) &lt; Ag(I) for metal ions, and coumarin &lt; anthracene &lt; indole for fluorophores. Our finding will allow the deliberate design of fluorescent sensors for metal ions by an engineering approach, rather than trial-and-error approaches. An example is DC-18-ane-N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4 </sub>(Figure 3), which we developed as a turn-on sensor specifically for heavy metal ions based on the design principles we proposed.</p>\n<p>(2) A drawback of adpa complexes for practical use is that a metal ion could easily be lost when used as an anion sensor. We therefore decided to develop new sensors based on cyclen, which bind metal ions much more strongly than does adpa. The initial set of sensors we tested includes MB-, DB-, and TB-cyclen (Figure 4). These molecules were chosen with the anticipation of exciplex formation via intra-molecular stacking of fluorophores, which should be very sensitive to the metal-fluorophore &pi;-contact. It was indeed shown that exciplex emission of the TB-cyclen is enhanced by coordination to Cd(II) and Cu(II) only (Figure 5). We found that &pi;-contacts with these metal ions position two benzyl fluorophores at the right orientation to form an exciplex. In the case of MB-cyclen, the sensor allows for the selective detection of Zn(II), Hg(II), and Pb(II) with strongly enhanced emission peaks at very different wavelengths (Figure 5), which renders MB-cyclen as a multi-functional fluorescence sensor.</p>\n<p>(3) It was shown that the Cd(II)/DB-cyclen complex does not show a significant exciplex emission, but it strongly increases at higher chloride anion concentrations (Figure 6). More importantly, other anions do not produce a similar effect, which makes the Cd(II)/DB-cyclen complex as a highly selective sensor for chloride. Motivated by this finding, we synthesized possible cyclen-based anion sensors with different fluorophores, such as M1N-cyclen, and MC-cyclen (Figure 4), based on our understanding of the factors that control the strength of &pi;-contact formation. Interestingly, we found that the Zn(II) complexes of MC-cyclen and M1N-cyclen have very low fluorescence intensity, which is strongly increased in the presence of chloride anion. This can only be explained in terms of Zn(II) forming a fluorescence quenching &pi;-contact (Figure 6), which is weakened by coordination of chloride to the Zn(II). The DFT-generated structure of the complex (Figure 6) strongly supports this suggestion, where the metal ion is held above the plane of the cyclen. This allows &pi;-contact for Zn(II), which was not previously found to form &pi;-contact.</p>\n<p>Finally, our theory that&nbsp; &pi;-contacts between metal ions and the fluorophores of sensors quenche fluorescence is leading to a general understanding of such important phenomena as collisional quenching. Until now it was theorized that the fluorescence of many molecules in solution was quenched by collision with metal ions. What exactly happens in the collisions was discussed only vaguely. Our present research suggests that what quenches the fluorescence is most likely short-lived &pi;-contact formation during the collisions. Since collisional quenching can compete with the use of fluorescence sensors in solution, understanding thereof is of great importance.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 09/11/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Hee Seung&nbsp;Lee</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1565981/1565981_10419453_1629913612204_Figure2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1565981/1565981_10419453_1629913612204_Figure2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 2.
