 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) is a weather disturbance that emanates in the tropics but influences weather globally. This project will improve both the understanding and ability to predict the weather disturbances associated with the MJO. The focus is on how the disturbances move from west to east across the Maritime Continent, which is the region along the equator around and including Indonesia. The project will seek to understand how the presence of the Indonesian islands, as well as the mountains on those islands, influence the motion of the weather disturbances: what causes the disturbances either to move across the islands or not do so, and how that motion can be forecast better. \r\n\r\nThe project will do this two ways. First,  idealized sensitivity experiments will be performed using models. For example, the islands will be removed entirely, or retained with mountains removed. Second, weather forecast simulations which have already been carried out by weather prediction centers around the world will be analyzed. The project team will examine forecasts that compared well with what occurred, such as those in which the weather disturbances moved eastward across the Maritime Continent.\r\nThe project will improve understanding of the MJO. On a more practical level, the project will lead to improved long-range weather forecasts. A graduate student will also be trained. The results of this project will be communicated to the public through public lectures, blogs, and op-ed pieces.",

The MJO has significant impact on global weather prediction beyond two weeks. The project attempts to answer how long and how well the MJO can be predicted by the global numerical weather prediction models. We use the World Meteorological Organization Subseasonal-to-Seasonal (S2S) datasets produced by the leading numerical weather prediction centers around the world. We have developed a new approach to quantify the prediction and predictability of the MJO convection using the OLR (Outgoing longwave radiation)-based MJO Index, which we found is capable of tracking the intraseasonal oscillations across all the seasons. Our quantitative analysis shows that the MJO convection can be predicted up to five weeks ahead by the best model (Figure 1), exceeding the conventional estimate by more than one week. The prediction and predictability of the intraseasonal convection depends on seasons: it is more predictable in the northern winter seasons than in summer in the S2S models.</p>\n<p>The MJO cycles are closely related to the conditions at the earth&rsquo;s surface and the top of the MJO. At the surface, the Maritime Continent is the key pathway for the MJO propagating eastward from the Indian Ocean to Pacific Ocean. Above the MJO towering clouds, the stratospheric quasi-biennial oscillations (QBO) significantly modulate the MJO amplitude, and propagation, which is known as the MJO-QBO connection. We have investigated how these two conditions can impact the MJO prediction in the S2S models. We found that all the S2S models display large bias in predicting the MJO convection near the Maritime Continent, which is considered as a barrier for the MJO prediction. The MJO-QBO connection in the S2S models is qualitatively consistent with the observation. Further analysis indicates that this connection comes from two sources: persistence of initial MJO and QBO states in the model, and dynamically predicated MJO/QBO by the model. We have tested these two using a forecast numerical model by switching stratospheric conditions to different QBO states, and found that tropospheric MJO conditions still have a dominant effect in explaining the apparent QBO influence in the forecast model.
