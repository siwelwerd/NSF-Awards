 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intermediate (70-300 km depth) and deep (300-700 km depth) focus earthquakes of great magnitudes are common in subduction zones. Though many ideas have been advanced, the cause of earthquakes at these depths remains as one of the most significant unresolved problems in the earth sciences. Researchers from University of Akron, Texas A&M University, and Brown University are exploring a new mechanism that might explain these enigmatic events: magnesite, a magnesium carbonate commonly observed in altered basalts and peridotite (primary constituents of the subducting plates), could initiate deep focus earthquakes. In this project, the research team is carrying out laboratory experiments in which magnesite is deformed under very high pressure and temperature conditions. Their recent experimental work demonstrated that magnesite is considerably weaker than peridotite, which indicates that veins of magnesite could act as nucleation points for earthquakes. In this project, they will experimentally investigate how two fundamental parameters, grain size and pressure, affect the strength of magnesite and incorporate the results in a computational model of earthquake nucleation. The project would advance desired societal outcomes by potentially shedding light on the causes of earthquakes and providing research experiences for undergraduate and graduate students.\r\n\r\nThe grain-size sensitivity of diffusion creep and the pressure sensitivity of magnesite deformation mechanisms in all three creep regimes (diffusion, dislocation and low-temperature plasticity) need to be quantified in order to apply experimental flow laws to models of creep and shear instability. These parameters are critical considering that diffusion creep is the dominant deformation mechanism in magnesite at many natural conditions and may cause strain localization and possibly seismicity at high pressure in subducting slabs. In this project, the research team will: (1) quantify the grain-size sensitivity of magnesite strength when deforming by diffusion creep and limited plasticity mechanisms; (2) determine the pressure sensitivity of magnesite deformation mechanisms; and (3) model dynamic slip by ductile instabilities in magnesite, applying the shear-heating model. Hydrostatic experiments will be performed to investigate the grain growth kinetics of magnesite. Deformation experiments with different grain sizes over a wide range of pressures will be carried out to determine the grain size and pressure sensitivities of magnesite deformation mechanisms, as identified by scanning and transmission electron microscopy. This will be achieved using state-of-the-art high-pressure deformation apparatuses, such as the D-DIA coupled with X-ray synchrotron radiation for in-situ strain and stress measurements. The results will allow accurate determination of the rheology of magnesite, evaluation of its effects on the bulk rheology of subducting slabs, and prediction of conditions for shear instability where carbonates are subducted.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellecutal Merits\n\nDeep focus earthquakes of subduction zones, which are near population centers like Seattle, WA, can cause significant damage to the nearby people and infrastructure.  These earthquakes are observed from 50 to 670 km beneath the surface in subducting lithospheric plates.  Earthquakes from 50-200 km and 400-670 km depths are well explained by phase transformations of serpentine or olivine, respectively.  However, the cause of earthquakes from 200-400 km is not clear. \n\nThis project investigated the role of a common alteration product found in oceanic lithosphere, magnesite, on deep focus earthquakes.  We determined the dependencies of magnesite strength over a wide range of pressures (1-8 GPa) equivalent to those up to 220 km into the mantle and a large range of grain size (1-80 microns) by performing experiments on two natural magnesites from Nevada.  These results allowed us to modify flow laws determined at low pressures to account for changes in pressure and grain size. \n\nAfter modifying the flow laws, we created both simple models of strength vs. depth of the phases in subducting lithosphere and a more complex numerical model.  The first model predicts that magnesite is orders of magnitude weaker than olivine, the most dominant mineral in the subducting lithospheric plate, which indicates that strain will localize in magnesite inclusions (veins or layers) in the plate.  The second model uses the modified flow laws and simulates the loading of a magnesite layer in a lithospheric plate composed dominantly of olivine at a wide variety of pressures and temperatures.  This model predicts runaway strain localization (i.e. seismic displacement rates) at the range of temperature and pressures observed in subducting lithospheric plates such as the Tonga Trench and the double Benioff zone beneath NE Japan. \n\nBroader Impacts\n\nThis research indicates that the presence of magnesite in subducting lithospheric plates explains the occurrence of deep focus earthquakes observed at 100-400 km depths, which has significant implications to population centers near subducting lithosphere throughout the Pacific rim. \n\nThis grant supported the professional development of two graduate students (Mr. Joseph Millard and Mr. Caleb McDaniel), five undergraduate students (Ms. Danielle Anderson, Mr. Cole Blasko, Ms. Casey Braccia, Ms. Rebeccah DiPuccio, and Mr. Nicholas Jackson) and one postdoctoral scholar (Dr. Rachel Wells) at the University of Akron who worked with Dr. Caleb Holyoke.
