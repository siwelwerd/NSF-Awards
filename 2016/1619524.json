 "awd_abstract_narration": "This long-standing LSAMP activity was designed to support a strong and vibrant scientific and technological workforce through recruiting, retaining, and graduating scientists and engineers from currently underrepresented populations. The WASEO Alliance (one of the first projects sponsored by NSF?s Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation) utilizes a multi-contextual approach involving project activities in student research experiences, the establishment of peer networks, an emphasis on the social context of science, and development of a culture of professionalism in students, to name a few areas. This multi-contextual approach will be tested scientifically and documented for scaling up nation-wide in order to continue our drive to increase the number of B.S. degrees earned annually by underrepresented minority science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) students.  The project, in its final five years of NSF support (2016-2021), will seek to increase graduation rates in Arizona and Utah such that Alliance institutions will represent 33.8% of total bachelor?s degrees to minority STEM students in Arizona and Utah.  That percentage would be roughly equal to today?s percentage of underrepresented minorities in the general population of those states. \r\n\r\nThe WAESO and its 13 Alliance partner institutions will continue to make improvements to its innovative research, teaching, and academic support interventions on behalf of undergraduate minority STEM students.  These support interventions have been developed over the past 24 years and rated highly by external evaluation. In a very significant new addition, WAESO will initiate a major knowledge-generating, social science educational research project to scientifically study, test and evaluate the multi-contextual elements at work in order to determine their positive impacts on student advancement and faculty culture.  The results of this research will contribute to our understanding of the positive changes in WAESO institutions as a result of the LSAMP program; and how the program components of the WAESO LSAMP lead to minority STEM student success.  Project outcomes will, in turn, point the way toward a successful scaling of these best practices to a regional and national level.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nBroad Goals\n\nThe broad goals of the Western Alliance to Expand Student Opportunities (WAESO) program were: \n\nTo improve underrepresented minority (URM) science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) student annual bachelor of science graduation at WAESO institutions as compared with the URM general populations. \nTo scientifically determine, research, test, and evaluate the elements that have been contributing to the success of the WAESO students and programs.\n\n\nThe WAESO institutions spanned three states (Arizona, Colorado, and Utah), and included the following institutions in Arizona:  Arizona State University (Lead), University of Arizona, Chandler Gilbert Community College, Estrella Mountain Community College, Gateway Community College, Glendale Community College,  Phoenix College, South Mountain Community College ; in Colorado: Regis University; in Utah: Brigham Young University, University of Utah, and Utah Valley University.\n\n \n\nOutcomes\n\nIntellectual Merit of WAESO \n\n\n\nThe WAESO project consisted of a series of activities that can be divided into three broad categories of (1) improving STEM Knowledge, (2) preparing students for graduate school, and (3) social science research. To improve STEM knowledge, Peer Study Groups and Summer Bridge Programs were funded. Faculty directed undergraduate research programs, research presentations, and workshops were the primary activities that were used to prepare students for graduate school. The social science research component of the project consisted of training both students and faculty in the principles of Multicontext Theory (MCT) so that participants could be more aware of and perhaps intentionally tap into MCT to achieve success.\n\nThere are multiple notable outcomes from the funded project. In the 2016-2022 timeframe:\n\n1476 total students directly engaged within WAESO, with 71% Hispanic/Latinx;\n677 research presentations were made by WAESO students;\n352 awards were earned by WAESO students;\nover 83 publications that include WAESO students were published; and\n62 new faculty mentors participated in WAESO.\n\n\nAdditional analyses of WAESO research activities showed that the majority of student participants majored in the life and biological sciences as well as in the engineering fields. The Geosciences field was the least represented major within WAESO. \n\n \n\nBroader Impacts of WAESO \n\nSTEM Bachelor of Science degrees awarded annually to underrepresented minorities at WAESO participating institutions increased by 71.4% from the baseline at the start of the grant (i.e. from 2170 to 3720).
