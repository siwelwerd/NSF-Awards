 "awd_abstract_narration": "This National Science Foundation (NSF) Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (S-STEM) project is a collaborative effort between Arkansas State University, Southern Illinois University at Carbondale, and Murray State University in Murray, Kentucky. The Upper Delta Region Biodiversity program will provide scholarships and other support to 44 graduate students and 68 undergraduate students from these institutions. These academically talented and low-income students will participate in scientific research efforts involving the Upper Mississippi Alluvial Plain. Activities will include the collection and maintenance of natural history specimens and the use of these in ecological research for species discovery, patterns of genetic diversity and isolation, and impacts of habitat degradation and other environmental change.  Student participation in this type of research and associated academic collaborations with peers are known to improve retention and persistence. This project will seek to improve student success through scholarship-associated supports in a program focused on biodiversity and biodiversity collections. The project will also study how student identification with a research community and other groups, along with the development of academic peer networks contribute to student success. Scholarships and support for low-income and academically talented students, who may not otherwise be able to obtain STEM degrees, will help to produce a well-trained workforce that will contribute to the economic well being of the nation.\r\n\r\nIn addition to scholarships, the Upper Delta Region Biodiversity program will provide support in the form of a cohort curriculum, peer mentoring, faculty mentoring, professional development seminars, research participation and support, participation in professional society meetings, and summer opportunities including specialized coursework and participation in summer institutes. Network analysis will be used to map the extensity and density of student academic networks. A matched control group will be used.  The study will help determine the characteristics of student academic networks and group identification associated with retention and degree completion. Participating institutions are members of the Delta Research Consortium, and this project will help to establish a model for multi-institutional research collaboration helping to promote STEM degree attainment.  The findings from the program will be disseminated to the nation's STEM education community and will help to increase understanding of the attributes and practices of successful student scholarship and support programs for academically talented, low-income students.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\n\nFrom August 2016 through July 2023, a multi-institutional STEM scholarship program, including Arkansas State University, Murray State University, and Southern Illinois University, provided professional development, research opportunities, mentoring, specialized courses, and scholarships to undergraduate and graduate students completing STEM degrees and with a focus on biodiversity and biodiversity collections.\n\n\n\n\nThis program, formally named the Upper Delta Region Biodiversity Scholarship, but nicknamed SUPERB by its students (Students United in Preserving, Exploring, and Researching Biodiversity), aimed to ensure that its students excelled academically, graduated on time, gained research experience, and were prepared for the next step in their professional lives, setting them up for success in graduate school or the professional career of their choosing.\n\n\n\n\nDuring the six years with students in the program, SUPERBs support impacted 170 students, some for a single semester and others for the full three-year scholarship. A large majority stayed in the program for their full funding cycle or until their graduation: 87% at Arkansas State University, 88% at Murray State University, and 91% at Southern Illinois University- Carbondale.\n\n\n\n\nEach semester in the program, the Office of Behavioral Research and Evaluation at Arkansas State University surveyed all active students, asking questions related to the SUPERBs impact on students and the sense of belonging the program provided. In our final semester survey in spring 2023, when asked if they had gained the skills needed to become a scientist, 95% of the students agreed or strongly agreed with that statement.\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, in the same survey, when students were asked if participating in the scholarship program helped them become more confident in themselves as future scientists, 85% agreed or strongly agreed with that statement. Similar percentages were seen for these questions in previous years, with a large majority of participants agreeing that SUPERB had a positive impact on their abilities to be prepared and confident as future scientists. Two students in the program recently gave their thoughts on SUPERBs impact:\n\n\n\n\nSUPERB has been a wonderful experience. I was able to form connections\n with others in my field through networking opportunities. And was givenopportunities to improve my research.\n\n\n\n\n SUPERB has been a key factor in my success. Without this scholarship, I wouldnot have been able to get the research experience I have today. This will helpme obtain my future career goals and build an outstanding resume.\n\n\n\n\nBy the end of SUPERB, over $1,000,000 in scholarships had been awarded to participating undergraduate and graduate students at Arkansas State University, over $800,000 to students at Murray State University, and over $1,100,000 to students at Southern Illinois University. Additionally, across the three campuses over $435,000 was spent to help purchase materials and supplies for students research. Student research projects were mostly regional in scope, allowing students to explore grasslands, forests, rivers, streams, and swamps. Students were then able to share their research and present papers and posters at conferences around the country with the support of travel money from SUPERB.\n\n\n\n\nBetween 2017 and 2023, when students were active in the program, SUPERB-associated faculty and students at Murray State University and Arkansas State University published 28 papers to scientific journals and presented 289 oral or posters to local and national academic conferences. At Southern Illinois University, faculty and students published 36 papers and presented 85 oral or poster presentations.\n\n\n\n\nDuring the project, Arkansas State University has improved its natural history collections and public access to the collections. We now have 28,971 vascular plant specimens with images available on the SERNEC Portal (sernecportal.org), and we have 73,623 catalog records of animal specimens on the Arctos Database (arctos.database.museum). From 2017-2022, 877 additional specimens were cataloged and added to the fish collection, and in that same period SUPERB students also added 1,258 specimens to the frozen tissue collection. SUPERB students at Murray State University digitized 23,325 plant specimens from the Murray State Herbarium, making roughly 46% of the collection available on the SERNEC Portal. SUPERB students at MSU also helped inventory the 3,030 specimens of the Murray State Mussel Collection, and students helped organize the Murray State Herpetology, Fish, Mammal, and Bird Collections. During the project, Southern Illinois University has improved its natural history collections in the SIU Herbarium. As a result of SUPERB participation, SIU currently has digitized 85,000 vascular plant specimens with images; those records will soon be available on the SERNEC Portal.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/24/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: TravisDMarsico\n"
