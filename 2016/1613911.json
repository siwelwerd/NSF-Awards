 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nature and human societies offer many examples of collective dynamics that tend to self-organize into large-scale patterns.  The goal of this project is to study nonlinear transport equations, which give a mathematical description of diverse manifestations of collective dynamics, such as flocking of birds or movement of the population of microorganisms in response to a chemical stimulus (chemotaxis).  The principal focus of this research is on the persistence of global features of solutions of the corresponding transport equations, including their smoothing behavior, self-organization, and the emergence of patterns, such as large-scale clustering into consensus, flocking, and the emergence of leaders. The project involves graduate students and postdoctoral fellows in the research.\r\n\r\nThis research project comprises five parts: (i) A study of the ensemble of agent-based dynamics in order to predict how different rules of local engagement affect the large-time emergence of one or more clusters. (ii) A study of a new paradigm of collective dynamics, for which communication takes place along the projections of those agents that are \"moving ahead.\" (iii) It is known that smooth solutions of collective social hydrodynamics governed by nonlinear transport must flock. The question arises, when does the smoothness of these equations persist? The regularity of nonlinear transport equations in social hydrodynamics, and their dependence on critical thresholds in the space of initial configurations will be investigated. (iv) Chemotaxis is a canonical example for group dynamics driven by (chemo-) attraction and (volume-filling) repulsion. When a population of bacteria is overcrowded, there is a repulsion peak; this calls for a new incompressible model for chemotaxis. The vanishing viscosity limit of such a \"peaked\" repulsion will be studied. (v) A study of nonlinear transport associated with social hydrodynamics driven by degenerate local Laplacians will be undertaken. It is planned to implement the velocity-averaging techniques used to study the regularization of nonlinear conservation laws with degenerate diffusion.",
