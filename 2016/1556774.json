 "awd_abstract_narration": "Scientists can rapidly obtain the DNA sequence of an individual, and find sites in the DNA that affect one trait.  It is believed that many sites will affect more than one trait, a phenomenon called pleiotropy.  The proportion of sites that are pleiotropic is not known, in part because how to find such sites is unclear.  This project investigates the patterns of pleiotropy in a model organism to see whether those effects are typically restricted to one simple part of the body, or are likely to have effects on many different parts.  If the team finds that a DNA change generally affects many traits, then this will suggest that those studying human genomes will have to look at diverse traits to understand how DNA changes affect specific aspects of heath. This project makes a fundamental contribution to our understanding of how genotypes map onto phenotypes. Additionally, the PIs will provide research opportunities for undergraduates in computational biology and will develop statistical software for the research community. \r\n\r\nTo characterize pleiotropy, the scientific team will use the fruit fly because of its rapid generation time and low cost. They will develop methods to automate the measurement of multiple body parts, and then characterize these parts in a set of 200 fully sequenced fly stocks.  They will develop statistical techniques to quantitatively characterize pleiotropy using these data.   The data and statistical techniques will then be used to find the DNA sites that affect the shape of the body, and to determine whether those effects typically are restricted to one part of the body, or affect many parts.  The statistical techniques to characterize pleiotropy developed in this project will apply directly to other species, including humans. This project also includes active collaboration with Norwegian scientists, including international training for US graduate students and postdoctoral researchers, which was partially funded by the NSF Office of International Science and Engineering.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThis project addressed pleiotropy, in which one genetic change affects multiple aspects of an organism. Plant and animal breeders seek to improve our food supply, but when we change one aspect of an organism it frequently has unexpected side-effects. To help understand pleiotropy we studied variation in the legs and wings of the fruit fly. We might expect that changing the wing would affect legs (and vice versa) because they utilize the same genetic and developmental machinery. We developed a way to quickly measure the wings and legs of individual flies (Figure 1), and then used this system to study the relationship between these appendages.\n\n\nWithin a natural population, we showed that the variation that affects legs and wings is largely uncorrelated. In addition, individual mutations that cause variation in wings generally have small effects on legs.\n\n\nWe then performed artificial selection to change either legs or wings, and measured whether the other appendage changed as a side-effect. While we were able to change the selected appendage, side effects were virtually absent in the non-selected appendage. Furthermore, the rate of response to selection in the selected direction was not diminished when we also selected for the other appendage to remain unchanged, as shown in Figure 2. This suggests that most mutations affecting one appendage have small effects on the other.\n\n\nWe also characterized the rate of evolution of wings and legs among related species of fruit flies, and found that wing and leg evolution are modestly correlated. The absence of correlations in the population we studied, as well as the lack of correlated responses in the artificial selection experiments suggests that the evolutionary correlations are due natural selection, and not to the underlying genetics and development. In other words, when natural selection favors a change in wings, it also favors a change in legs.\n\n\nOur results suggest that variation in the way that genes are regulated is largely independent during wing and leg development. This makes it possible to use the same genes and developmental processes to achieve very different structures. If this is true in general of the products of development, we may be able to alter the physical traits of organisms with less worry that we will have nasty side-effects. In addition, this helps to explain the diversity of life on earth.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/17/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: DavidCHoule\n"
