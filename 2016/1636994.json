The focus of this symposium will is on recent societal challenges, including but not limited to energy, health, and environmental aspects. In addition, novel material design paradigms are needed to fabricate materials with multifunctional applications that can bring solutions to some of today's biggest problems. This symposium will bring together young researchers and scientists from around the globe to discuss new approaches and challenges in materials synthesis and to provide a platform for intensive exchange of ideas, knowledge, and networking. The award is jointly supported by the Materials Engineering and Processing (MEP) Program and the Office of International Science and Engineering (OISE).\r\n\r\nThe award supports participation in the Young Professionals Forum of early career scientists as well as students. The PIs will seek in particular to encourage participation by attendees from underrepresented groups. In addition to the exchange of scientific information and knowledge in the technical sessions, mentoring sessions for young scientists will be arranged.",
