 "awd_abstract_narration": "Combining data from living species and the fossil record provides a rich perspective for understanding the evolutionary processes responsible for generating the biodiversity observed in nature. Although methods for combining these data have made significant advances, these approaches still do not consider the completeness and sampling of the fossil record or the geographical distributions of living and fossil species. For this project, the investigators will integrate statistical models for describing how fossils are sampled over time and where species are found. These models for estimating species relationships will be developed in widely used software packages, making them broadly accessible to other researchers. These new methods will be tested using both simulated and real datasets. Specifically, two vertebrate groups with rich fossil records will be studied: penguins and crocodyliforms (crocodiles, alligators, gharials, and extinct relatives). This work will help to uncover how rates of speciation and extinction have changed over time for these species. The methods developed as part of this project will be taught in workshops for evolutionary biologists. Additionally, results from analyses of data from living and fossil penguins will be contributed to a public museum exhibit at the Bruce Museum in Greenwich, CT. \r\n\r\nIn recent years, advances in phylogenetic inference methods have provided ways to integrate fossil and extant taxa. These approaches allow simultaneous estimation of the divergence times and phylogenetic relationships of extant and fossil species, thus making full use of morphological and temporal data, rather than just molecular sequence data from living species. Approaches combining fossil and extant taxa have opened the door for fully integrative phylogenetic methods that use more sources of biological data, including stratigraphy, sampling, and biogeography. Thus, there is a need for comprehensive statistical models and methods that accommodate this information. The investigators will develop new, Bayesian statistical models, extensions of stochastic birth-death processes, that will integrate information about the fossil record and biogeography for use in phylogenetic methods that consider both extant and fossil taxa. The new models will be implemented in the program RevBayes. The performance and adequacy of new and previously described models will be evaluated using simulated and empirical datasets. New methods will be used to investigate macroevolutionary patterns in two exemplar clades: Sphenisciformes (penguins) and Crocodyliformes, addressing key hypotheses about phylogenetic relationships, lineage diversification, and biogeography.",

The results of these methods improve our understanding of the evolutionary relationships of these lineages, as well as how the dynamics of speciation, extinction, and sampling change over time. We focused on extending models in the fossilized birth-death family to include processes that account for fossil species with multiple specimens recovered from different time points in the geologic record. <br /><br />The new models we developed were implemented in the open-source software <a href=\"https://revbayes.github.io/\">RevBayes</a>, a collaboratively developed tool for applying complex statistical methods to understand evolutionary patterns in biological data. With the addition of new models for analyzing both modern and paleontological data, the activities of this award helped to expand the analyses possible in RevBayes, making this tool useful for answering a much broader range of biological and paleobiological questions. We evaluated the performance of new and existing macroevolutionary models in rigorous simulation studies, and showed that the fossilized birth-death models developed by this award produce robust and accurate estimates of speciation and extinction rates. One of the advantages of this model is that it can accommodate incomplete sampling of fossil specimens as well as incomplete sampling of lineages, both known to be issues in fossil datasets. Phylogenetic analysis under the fossilized birth-death models results in accurate estimates of species divergence times and our simulation analyses additionally show that these methods can also improve estimates of the ages of poorly dated fossil specimens. The advances to phylogenetic analysis of fossil and living species resulting from our project were applied to two focal clades, enabling us to shed light on the evolution of penguins and crocodilians. <br /><br />We assembled a large morphological and temporal range dataset for penguins, which we combined with mtDNA and genomic-scale molecular datasets to explore penguin macroevolution. Our analyses revealed strong support, derived from models directly including fossil taxa, that crown penguins radiated much later than previously proposed. This supports links between the Middle Miocene Climate Optimum and crown penguin origins, and suggests glacial-interglacial cycles drove speciation within extant penguin genera. We also found support for a New Zealand origin of total-group penguins and crown penguins. As part of this project we described several new species, including a new long-legged species of the giant penguin taxon <em>Kairuku</em>, the oldest crested penguin (<em>Eudyptes atatu</em>) and the only penguin species wiped out by human (<em>Eudyptes warhami</em>).<br /><br />We have also assembled a large molecular and morphological crocodilian data set. Phylogenetic analyses, biogeographic analyses, and combined-evidence analyses generally support a monophyletic Australian-Asian <em>Crocodylus</em> clade and a relatively recent migration of <em>Crocodylus</em> from Africa to the New World. Additional analyses incorporating partial mitochondrial genomes of the extinct \"horned\" crocodile, <em>Voay robustus</em> from Holocene deposits of Madagascar, suggests a sister group relationship between Voay and the true crocodiles. This is in stark contrast to prior morphological analyses that suggest a close association with the dwarf crocodiles and kin.<br /><br /><strong>Broader Impacts</strong><br />Because the development of scientific software was a major goal of this project, a significant part of our broader-impacts efforts was focused on educating and training researchers. This work involved developing extensive online materials--user guides and video tutorials--to enable anyone to set up analyses using their own data. Additionally, we developed, organized, and deployed several multi-day workshops on Bayesian phylogenetics, with particular emphasis on analysis of fossil and living species. <br /><br />This project also supported numerous museum-focused outreach efforts. We gave numerous public lectures on penguin evolution, created publically available videos and blog updates on the project research, and brought Hour of Code lessons featuring \"Kari the Kairuku penguin\" to 2627 second through fifth grade students. We also assembled nine taxidermied penguins and 3D prints of two dozen penguin fossils for a penguin evolution exhibition that will open in a 2,200 square foot gallery in the Bruce Museum in 2022 as part of the grand-opening of a new museum wing and will be seen by as many as 50,000 visitors.<br /><br />This award supported numerous early career scientists across three institutions, thus mentorship and training was a major objective of our Broader Impacts.

In addition, through the Weston Scholars Program we have exposed 29 high school students to the sciences, strengthening K-12 STEM education and motivating students to pursue careers in the sciences. Both the research and museum work conducted at the Bruce Museum supported the development of an early career museum collections specialist.
