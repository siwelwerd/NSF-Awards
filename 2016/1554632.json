 "awd_abstract_narration": "Magnesium, titanium and cobalt are included in a particular class of metals with hexagonal structure at the microscopic level.  A barrier to their widespread application has been the inability, based on the hexagonal structure, to design materials that have both high strength and high formability; these more often than not are mutually exclusive.  The basic research supported in this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award will discover and unravel the underlying mechanisms responsible for the formation of novel toughening features within the hexagonal structure, and enable processing methods to realize strategic metallic materials with unprecedented strength and formability.  By engineering metallic alloys that are stronger and tougher, the lightweighting strategies critical for developing vehicles and transportation systems that reduce our dependency on fossil fuels and decrease pollution can be realized. More so, the knowledge can be extended to make advancements in other industries, such as aerospace and healthcare, thus promoting further technological advancement and economic growth. This research will be inherently multidisciplinary in nature and provide research and education opportunities for the many students from underrepresented groups at University of California Riverside.\r\n\r\nWhile planar boundaries such as nanotwins have shown the ability to concurrently strengthen and retain ductility in nanocrystalline metals with body center cubic and face center cubic crystal structures, they have not proven feasible in hexagonal close-packed materials based on the difficulty in twinning as the grain size decreases. Literature clues and preliminary observations by the PI have shown that nano-spaced stacking faults may afford synergistic strengthening and ductility for hexagonal close-packed materials, but there are no experimental studies that systematically investigate the intrinsic ability for these materials to form such features, nor the factors that lead to their formation, spacing and density.  Thus, the objective of the research supported by this award is to explore and unravel the effects of grain size, texture, stacking fault energies and deformation conditions on the fault nucleation and growth kinetics that govern size, spacing and density.  Next, the magnitude and mechanisms of mechanical property improvements achievable will be investigated.  Lastly, new theoretical constructs will be developed to explain the formation, strengthening and ductility observed in these novel materials.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nMagnesium alloys are amongst the lightest metals used for structural applications, however they have historically suffered from an inability to process them to complex shapes while retaining their strength due to their hexagonal close packed crystal structure and the resulting asymmetric deformation modes. The high temperature that are needed to shape the Mg alloys result in strength degradations that make the alloy unacceptable for many applications.  This award supported the fundamental study of the processing of Mg alloys that are specifically alloyed with elements that lower their stacking fault energy and after roll-processing produce nano-spaced stacking faults, a type of defect that results in extreme strengthening.  \n\nMagnesium-Yttrium and Magnesium-Lithium were the target materials for probing the effect of roll processing on stacking fault generation and strengthening, however the materials were contaminated (Mg + yttrium hydride and Magnesium-Lithium-Calcium), and recent studies in the community pointed to grain refinement as an approach to increase uniform deformation.  Therefore the studies were initiated on studying the grain-size relationships on strengthening in the Mg-YH nanocomposite, and the nanocrystallization and grain size stabilization mechanisms in the MgLiCa alloy.  In the former study, the limitations of the Hall-Petch method to predict strength from grain size were identified, along with approaches to correct predictions based on the presence of the nanoparticle phase.  In the second study, processing of the MgLiCa resulted in the highest reported hardness for a MgLi-based alloy, and excellent thermal stability against grain growth at elevated temperatures.  The intellectual merit of this work lies in the identification of new fundamental microstructural control mechanisms enabled by novel processing of Mg-based nanocrystalline materials, and will lead to better informed approaches to control microstructure through novel alloying and processing. \n\nThe broader impacts of this project lie in advancing the knowledge that is needed to harness Mg-alloys and other HCP metals like Ti for lightweighting applications that will be more sustainable and lessen our dependence on fossil fuels.  These will be critical to the transportation, defense and energy sectors.  This interdisciplinary research provided opportunities for the support of one female Ph.D. student to pursue her education, collaborate with other universities and national laboratories, and line up a full time engineering position in industry.  The research directly raised public interest in science and engineering through creative outreach initiatives integrating materials science and engineering at K-12 schools and Comic-cons.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/16/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Suveen N Mathaudhu"
