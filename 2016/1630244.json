Such flows are found all around us, in the atmosphere, in oceans, in rivers and in the chemical process industry. Recent developments in mathematical analysis, laboratory techniques and numerical approaches generate the need to have this symposium five years since the last one in Rome (2011).  The symposium aims, in addition to the dissemination of the most recent research findings, include bringing together researchers across the world to discuss future needs in this field and to educate the next generation of young scientists. Travel and participation costs for about 20 US participants are expected to be funded with the NSF support to this conference, with priority given to younger scientists who would otherwise be unable to attend.",
