 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) through Targeted Infusion Projects supports the development, implementation, and study of evidence-based innovative models and approaches for improving the preparation and success of HBCU undergraduate students so that they may pursue STEM graduate programs and/or careers. The project at Norfolk State University seeks to raise the passing rate of pre-calculus by actively engaging students through implementation of the flipped classroom. As HBCUs produce the vast majority of African Americans entering the STEM workforce, these efforts will not only help this trend but also produce STEM graduates who are better prepared. These efforts will have a big impact on bolstering students' completion of STEM degrees, thus increasing the number of STEM majors entering graduate schools and the work place. In addition, this course structure will also be presented to secondary education professionals in workshops in the community.\r\n\r\nThe overall goals of the project are to increase the success rate in the STEM pre-calculus course and to deepen math connections to boost student learning. The specific goals are to: 1) increase the passing rate in pre-calculus; and 2) to provide a strong foundation in pre-calculus to bolster an increase in STEM major retention. Through the more hands-on approach via the flipped model, this project will strive to strengthen quantitative abilities, reasoning and critical thinking skills. The benefits to STEM education and NSU in achieving these goals include greater retention of undergraduate majors in STEM fields with a stronger foundation in STEM topics and development of autonomous learners which leads to a higher rate of students obtaining degrees and entering the workforce.",

The project was implemented in Pre-Calculus courses that were identified as high-risk or critical courses at NSU due to the number of students who earned a grade of D or F in the course or withdrew from the course (aka DFW). The overall goal was to increase the pass rate in Pre-Calculus to provide a strong foundation to increase retention in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM).</p>\n<p class=\"xmsonormal\">The overall findings from six (6) semesters of data collection on students&rsquo; grades indicated that students enrolled in the Flipped classes completed the Pre-Calculus course with higher grades than those in the non-Flipped classes. Specifically, students enrolled in the Flipped classes during fall 2017, spring 2019, fall 2019, and spring 2020 had statistically significant higher Pre-Calculus end-of-course grades than those enrolled in the non-Flipped classes during these semesters. The course grades during the spring 2018, fall 2018, and spring 2021 semesters were still higher for those in the Flipped classes, the differences were not statistically significant.
