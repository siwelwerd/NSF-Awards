 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports research that will advance the science behind the emerging discipline of gravitational wave astronomy -- an area which the US is deeply invested in through the NSF LIGO project that recently made the first ever direct detection of gravitational waves, confirming Einstein's 100 year old prediction. This research area has had breakthrough advances, generated significant spin-off technologies, and generated strong public and youth attention towards STEM disciplines. This project focuses on the calculation of gravitational waves emitted from merging objects such as black holes or neutron stars.  It includes undergraduate students in research and therefore directly contributes to student mentorship, traineeship and retention in a STEM area. The computational skills that students develop are highly portable, and open them up to a variety of career options, including in areas of great national need. Previous research projects by the PI have been discussed in the general media, and thus this work has great potential at being successful for outreach to the general public.\r\n \r\nThis proposal is about the development and application of a time-domain model for the gravitational wave emission from a large mass-ratio black hole binary system using point-particle perturbation theory. The planned work will significantly advance the approach with the goal of not only making major improvements to the capabilities of the time-domain model, but also contribute towards various scientific applications. Significant contributions will be made to the development of effective-one-body models and gravitational waveform generation, that will ultimately positively impact the data analysis of current and future detectors (such as LIGO and future space-borne missions). In addition, the planned work will bring about a better understanding of the plunge phase radiation and quasi-normal ringing in the context of decaying binary systems due to gravitational wave emission.",
