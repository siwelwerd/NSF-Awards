 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Cyberlearning and Future Learning Technologies Program funds efforts that support envisioning the future of learning technologies and advance what we know about how people learn in technology-rich environments. Development and Implementation (DIP) Projects build on proof-of-concept work that shows the possibilities of the proposed new type of learning technology, and PI teams build and refine a minimally-viable example of their proposed innovation that allows them to understand how such technology should be designed and used in the future and that allows them to answer questions about how people learn, how to foster or assess learning, and/or how to design for learning. Educating the next generation of design innovators is essential for ensuring U.S. economic and social prosperity. To prepare students for this critical work, design innovation instructors rely on project-based learning where learners construct and iterate on preliminary solutions to real-world problems and try to acquire feedback from stakeholders who depend on the outcomes. This project aims to create a scalable method for obtaining formative feedback in the classroom by leveraging online crowds through social media and crowdsourcing platforms via a new online learning platform called CRAFT (CRowd Aided Feedback Technology).\r\n\r\nThe CRAFT project involves an integrated social science research and technology design plan. Studies will examine how to optimize the acquisition of feedback, how learners do sensemaking of provided feedback, and how and when they can reflect on the feedback in their own learning process. The technology design will utilize an iterative rapid prototyping strategy based on XML templates that will allow quick reconfiguration of interface elements and functionality. Pilot usability testing will be done with face-to-face volunteers, students in courses, and via Amazon's Mechanical Turk. Students in courses on product design, graphic design, and interface design will serve as participants in a series of studies. A 3x2 experiment will examine the relationship between types of incentives for feedback (intrinsic, financial, and social), design stage (early- or late-stage design), and impact of the feedback on learners. A second, 3x2 within-subjects experiment will examine the relationship between different types of rubrics, early- and late-stage design, and learner impact. A third experiment will compare individual use of scaffolded crowd feedback tools, paired dialogue with annotation tools, and crowd use of annotation tools, and a control condition to examine qualitatively the differences in learner outcomes. The fourth experiment will be a between-subjects analysis of the impact of the tool on design outcomes using both an analysis of the designs themselves and an analysis of a reflective essay submitted by the participants. The CRAFT tool will be iterated and refined on the basis of each of these experiments. A final, summative evaluation will test the final version of the CRAFT environment using a mixed factorial design with independent variables including scaffolding and early- vs. late-stage of design.",

This included an examination of socio-psychological factors that influence online feedback exchange (Foong 2017) and an analysis of challenges related to grappling with large amounts of community input on civic projects (Mahyar 2019).&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\" dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: #000000; background-color: #ffffff; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">EXPERIMENTS:&nbsp; We conducted a range of experiments to unpack empirical questions related to crowd-based feedback exchange. We learned that different types of crowds affect feedback; learners benefit from using online communities to gather process-oriented feedback and using social media to acquire emotionally supportive feedback (Yen 2017). Our experiments also indicate that, generally, peers provide better feedback than crowds; crowds typically lack context, but can serve as a good supplement to peer feedback by reaching specialized audiences (Wauck 2017).&nbsp; We experimented on how the source and sentiment of feedback affect uptake, and found that positive affective language and source anonymity improve critique reception and work outcomes (Nguyen 2017). We have preliminary evidence showing learners can better prepare for feedback exchange by preparing effective feedback guiding questions (Cook 2019).</span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: #222222; background-color: #ffffff; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: #000000; background-color: #ffffff; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">We developed interventions that aid the interpretation of a collection of feedback written by multiple users and experimental results showing the effectiveness of encouraging reflection (see Yen 2017 and Cook 2020). We also explored how designers currently request feedback from public online forums and studied how specific request strategies impact the quantity and quality of community feedback; we found several key, but undervalued strategies: signaling as a novice, critiquing one's own design, and providing design variants (Cheng 2020).</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\" dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: #000000; background-color: #ffffff; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">SOFTWARE: The project led to the development of crowd-feedback systems that embody the interventions and results from this project.

  "por_txt_cntn": "This Cyberlearning DIP Award project advanced fundamental knowledge and technologies to scaffold a crowd feedback loop for design education.  In project-based design education, students often struggle to acquire formative feedback due to their limited social capital, financial resources, and time. To meet this educational challenge, the PIs are pioneering a new scalable method for obtaining formative feedback by leveraging online crowds on social media, online communities, and micro-work platforms to overcome limitations in classroom-only feedback exchange. \n\n \nThrough this award, this project explored four major intellectual goals:\n1. Contribute empirical knowledge that will help learners in design innovation courses understand how to effectively allocate their financial resources, social capital, and time for acquiring design feedback from online crowds.\n2. Produce user interface designs and empirical knowledge that will help learners interpret large quantities of noisy feedback received online.\n3. Produce user interface designs and empirical knowledge that will help learners more effectively reflect on and develop an action plan for the feedback received.\n4. Develop and disseminate crowd feedback tools that embody the results from our design research and empirical studies..\n\n \nIn total during the timeframe of the grant, 2017-2021, the project published dozens of papers at the top international conferences on human-computer interaction (CHI), computer-supported cooperative work and social computing (CSCW), designing interactive systems (DIS), creativity and cognition (C&amp;C) and other venues. Our papers can be found on our ProtoLab website (protolab.ucsd.edu) and in public repositories for science publications (see https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ywTbDsQAAAAJ). Highlights include:\n\n \nFRAMEWORKS:  We contributed conceptual papers to frame challenges related to feedback exchange and scaling up feedback exchange with crowds. This included an examination of socio-psychological factors that influence online feedback exchange (Foong 2017) and an analysis of challenges related to grappling with large amounts of community input on civic projects (Mahyar 2019). \n\n \nEXPERIMENTS:  We conducted a range of experiments to unpack empirical questions related to crowd-based feedback exchange. We learned that different types of crowds affect feedback; learners benefit from using online communities to gather process-oriented feedback and using social media to acquire emotionally supportive feedback (Yen 2017). Our experiments also indicate that, generally, peers provide better feedback than crowds; crowds typically lack context, but can serve as a good supplement to peer feedback by reaching specialized audiences (Wauck 2017).  We experimented on how the source and sentiment of feedback affect uptake, and found that positive affective language and source anonymity improve critique reception and work outcomes (Nguyen 2017). We have preliminary evidence showing learners can better prepare for feedback exchange by preparing effective feedback guiding questions (Cook 2019). We developed interventions that aid the interpretation of a collection of feedback written by multiple users and experimental results showing the effectiveness of encouraging reflection (see Yen 2017 and Cook 2020). We also explored how designers currently request feedback from public online forums and studied how specific request strategies impact the quantity and quality of community feedback; we found several key, but undervalued strategies: signaling as a novice, critiquing one's own design, and providing design variants (Cheng 2020).\n\n \nSOFTWARE: The project led to the development of crowd-feedback systems that embody the interventions and results from this project. The grant has also led to new areas of research that build on the idea of leveraging past projects and feedback as a resource for future learners. We release our tools as open-source on our lab?s GitHub account (https://github.com/creativecolab/).\n\nParagon: feedback exchange platform that includes galleries of examples to support more principled feedback (Kang 2018) \nCommunityCrit: platform that structures micro-activities to facilitate discussion for urban design proposals (Mahyar 2018) \nProbMap: scaffolding for writing problem statements via constructing design galleries through feature extraction and semantic clustering (MacNeil 2021) \nIdeateRelate: an online gallery of design examples that visualizes prior ideas in relation to new ideas (Xu 2021) \n\n\n \nPEDAGOGY:  The research outcomes of this project have enabled new pedagogies in design innovation education (e.g., teaching learners new methods for collecting and interpreting user feedback for innovation projects) and these pedagogies have been implemented in design courses taught by the PI and other teachers. \n\n \nCAREER SUPPORT:  The proposal supported career advancement for a number of postdocs and PhD students who moved on to take tenure-track faculty positions, including Narges Mahyar, Amy Cook, and Stephen MacNeil. The award has created research opportunities for dozens of masters and undergraduate researchers from diverse backgrounds, including at least 60% that are women or under-represented minorities. \n\n \nBROADER IMPACT:  In terms of broader impact, the research opportunities and pedagogical advances enabled by this award have contributed to a U.S. workforce that is better equipped to develop and use technology for design innovation.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/16/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Steven Dow"
