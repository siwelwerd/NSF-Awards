 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Southern Ocean in the vicinity of Antarctica is a region characterized by seasonally-driven marine phytoplankton blooms that are often dominated by microalgal species which produce large amounts of dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP).   DMSP can be converted to the compound dimethylsulfide (DMS) which is a molecule that can escape into the atmosphere where it is known to have strong condensation properties that are involved in regional cloud formation.  Production of DMSP can influence the diversity and composition of microbial assemblages in seawater and the types and activities of microbes in the seawater will likely affect the magnitude of DMSP\\DMS production. The proposal aims to examine the role of DMSP in structuring the microbial communities in Antarctic waters and how this structuring may influence DMSP cycling. The project will leverage the Antarctic research to introduce concepts and data linking microbial diversity and biogeochemistry to a range of audiences (including high school and undergraduate students in Maine).  The project will also engage teacher and students in rural K-8 schools and will allow a collaboration with a science writer and illustrator who will join the team in the field. The writer will use the southern ocean experience as the setting for a poster and a book about the proposed research and the scientists studying extreme environments.  \r\n\r\nThe project will examine (1) the extent to which the cycling of DMSP in southern ocean waters influences the composition and diversity of bacterial and protistan assemblages; (2) conversely, whether the composition and diversity of southern ocean protistan and bacterial assemblages influence the magnitude and rates of DMSP cycling; (3) the expression of DMSP degradation genes by marine bacteria seasonally and in response to additions of DMSP; and, to synthesize these results by quantifying (4) the microbial networks resulting from the presence of DMSP-producers and DMSP-consumers along with their predators, all involved in the cycling of DMSP in southern ocean waters. The work will be accomplished by conducting continuous growth experiments with DMSP-amended natural samples during field sampling of different microbial communities present in summer and fall. Data from the molecular (such as 16S/ 18S tag sequences, DMSP-cycle gene transcripts) and biogeochemical (such as biogenic sulfur cycling, bacterial production, microbial biomass) investigations will be integrated via network analysis.",

DMSP may be used by some phytoplankton to help balance their internal osmotic pressure with that of the environment. Large amounts of DMSP are produced by phytoplankton in polar oceans, where cells are exposed to extremely low temperatures and DMSP may serve, additionally, as a cryoprotectant. When these DMSP-rich phytoplankton die, their intracellular DMSP provides an important source of carbon and sulfur for broad groups of marine microbes ? as revealed by a growing list of genes involved in DMSP metabolism. A portion of this newly released DMSP is metabolized by some bacteria and phytoplankton, resulting in formation of the biogenic gas Dimethyl Sulfide (DMS). Globally, large amounts of DMS (&gt;10<sup>12</sup> g y<sup>-1</sup>) diffuse from the ocean into the atmosphere, where it undergoes chemical transformations that may contribute to the process of cloud formation. Despite the importance of DMSP to global biogeochemical cycles, relatively little is known about its role in structuring microbial communities and its influence on the expression of genes involved in the DMSP degradation process. Additionally, the diversity of genes involved in DMSP degradation pathways and the organisms expressing these genes are not well documented, particularly in the Antarctic marine environment. We investigated the role of DMSP in structuring the diversity and gene expression of Antarctic plankton communities by controlling the rate of DMSP supply during several Ecostat incubation experiments (<strong>Fig. 1</strong>).</p>\n<p>Plankton communities were sampled in coastal waters off the US Antarctic Program?s Palmer Station (Anvers Island, Antarctica) during the Austral summer (December 2016 ? January 2017) and Austral fall (March ? April 2018) of two successive field seasons. Although some parts of Antarctica are dominated by blooms of the DMSP-producing phytoplankton <em>Phaeocystis antarctica</em>, colonial forms of this species are relatively rare along the Western Antarctic Peninsula, where diatoms dominate the Spring-Summer phytoplankton bloom dynamics. Nevertheless, we were able to cultivate <em>P.</em> <em>antarctica</em> in its colonial form along with its bacterial microbiome (<strong>Fig. 2</strong>). A substantial portion of the <em>Phaeocystis</em> microbiome included the Alphaproteobacterium, <em>Sulfitobacter</em>, a known contributor to DMSP degradation via pathways that result in DMS formation. Sequencing the DNA from natural and incubated Antarctic seawater samples revealed that the bacterial community was dominated by this same genus of DMSP-degrading bacteria ? suggesting a major role for <em>Sulfitobacter</em> in the coastal Antarctic environment. In general, Ecostat incubation experiments revealed low concentrations of dissolved DMSP and high concentrations of DMS after 1.5 to 3 weeks of experimentation, indicating active microbial processing of DMSP in both seasons. Overall, the genetic diversity of the bacterial community was lower in the Austral summer compared to the diversity detected in samples from the following year, during Austral fall. It is likely the elevated bacterial diversity in the fall is a result of the active growth through the summer period when phytoplankton-derived organic compounds like DMSP are in greater supply.</p>\n<p>The most surprising aspect of our work was the identification of nearly 150,000 gene transcripts (mRNA sequences) that had a high degree of homology to the amino acid sequences of DMSP degrading enzymes. Sequences were detected with homology to many of the major groups of bacterial DMSP lyases including <em>dddD</em>, <em>dddL</em>,<em> </em>and <em>dddP</em> plus the DMSP demethylases in the <em>dmdA</em> family, which were particularly diverse (<strong>Fig. 3</strong>, red branch labels on <em>dmdA</em> tree). In addition, we detected a diverse group of putative eukaryotic DMSP lyases, with homology to the <em>Alma</em>-family of lyases. Some of these eukaryotic mRNA sequences were similar to <em>Alma</em>-like sequences from <em>Phaeocystis antarctica</em> (<strong>Fig. 3</strong>, red branch labels on <em>Alma</em> tree). Although the total number of DMSP-affiliated mRNA transcripts was relatively small in comparison to the total number of sequences generated, the breadth of their diversity was unexpectedly high. This is revealed by the large number of sequences from our study (red branch labels) that are not adjacent to known reference sequence (black branch labels). These data suggest that DMSP metabolism is widespread and highly diverse in coastal waters of the Western Antarctic Peninsula. In the future, our new mRNA sequence data will permit more-directed, process-based studies that focus on particular DMSP degradation pathways via quantitative molecular approaches. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Throughout our project, we have been assisted in communicating our science to broader audiences with help from an author and illustrator, who was invited to join our expedition to Palmer Station in 2018 (<strong>Fig. 4</strong>).
