 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation Program (MRI) and support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program (CRIF), Professor Michael Pluth from the University of Oregon Eugene and colleague Ramesh Jasti have acquired a high resolution liquid chromatograph mass spectrometer (LCMS) with electrospray ionization (ESI) and ultra performance liquid chromatograhic (UPLC) capabilities. This instrument is  placed at the open access CAMCOR (Center for Advanced Materials and Characterization in Oregon) facility at the University of Oregon.  In general, mass spectrometry (MS) is one of the key analytical methods used to identify and characterize small quantities of chemical species embedded in complex mixtures. This highly sensitive technique allows detection and determination of the structure of molecules in a complex mixture. An instrument with a liquid chromatograph provides additional structural identification power by separating mixtures of compounds before they reach the mass spectrometer. In an ESI source, a high voltage is applied to a liquid to produce an aerosol that facilitates the production of ions. The acquisition strengthens the research infrastructure at the University and regional area. The instrument also broaden participation by involving diverse students in research and research training using this modern analytical technique. It also provides training opportunities to a large number of undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral students as well as high school students through a variety of internship programs. The new capabilities in CAMCOR offer great opportunities to both academic and industrial users. \r\n\r\nThe proposal is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels, especially in areas such as (a) studying the bottom-up organic synthesis of single-chirality carbon nanotubes; (b) using indenofluorene and expanded quinoidal analogues as electron-accepting scaffolds for organic electronics; (c) using molecular probes for small molecule/ion recognition; (d) synthesizing iron-phosphine macrocycle complexes for use as liquid phase adsorbents in the purification of natural gas; (e) synthesizing precision engineered nanoparticles; (f) understanding biological sulfur dihydride and (g) using platinum(II) reagents in ribonucleic acid (RNA) biochemistry.",
