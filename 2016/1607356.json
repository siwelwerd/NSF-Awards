 "awd_abstract_narration": "A new window on the universe opened recently with the detection of gravitational waves by the LIGO gravitational wave observatory. Other telescopes observe electromagnetic waves (that includes visible light), and this new window will give us quite different and complementary information. The work described here seeks to understand better how to get the most information from these gravitational wave observations. In particular, we study the very violent merger of neutron stars and black holes to determine how the properties of these systems are encoded in both gravitational and electromagnetic waves. \r\n\r\nThe goals supported by this award are to study the dynamics of compact objects and the radiation they emit to capture the most science possible from aLIGO and similar detectors. We will do so through computational studies of binary systems incorporating magnetized matter with resistive effects, realistic equations of state, electromagnetic and neutrino emission, and r-process nucleosynthesis. Our efforts will include the following: (i) We will determine gravitational waveforms from these binaries, with a focus on observable imprints from the neutron star equation of state, mass, and radius. (ii) We will investigate the construction of analytic and phenomenological gravitational wave templates. (iii) We will study outflows from merging binaries as an indicator of events with characteristic electromagnetic and neutrino signals. (iv) We will study the global behavior of magnetic fields and the electromagnetic emissions, such as jets, that originate in the magnetosphere of coalescing binaries.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nAs we have entered the era of gravitational wave astronomy, we are experiencing a revolution in our understanding of some of the most energetic and dynamic events in the universe.  The purpose of this proposal has been to study some of the dynamics of merging  binary compact objects at the frontier of our current computational capabilities.  Our work has focused on expanding our ability to model a wider variety of possible mergers and will eventually help us to  better understand these high-energy phenomena as well as possible new physics that lies beyond our current gravitational models.\n\nOur results during the period of the grant have included the following:\n\nWe have developed new computational abilities to determine gravitational waveforms for binary compact object inspirals and mergers with sufficient accuracy that they can be used in new waveform catalogs.  This has included an investigation of binary black hole inspirals and mergers with large mass ratios.\n\nIn particular, we have developed a highly-scalable framework for numerical work in relativity and astrophysics, Dendro-GR.

This allowed us to probe possible deviations from the predictions of general relativity, explore the stability of black holes in these theories and to to examine new radiative degrees of freedom.  We have also investigated how future observations of gravitational radiation from binary neutron star mergers may provide constraints on new, finite-range forces arising from an alternative theory of gravity which extends general relativity.\n\nThis work has contributed to undergraduate and graduate training in multiple STEM fields including computer science, mathematics, and physics.
