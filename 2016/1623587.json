The conference will be held in Toronto, Canada on July 17-23 2016. Supporting student travel to attend professional conferences and workshops is a very important mission of the NSF. Verification technology is being rapidly deployed in a variety of areas both in academic research as well as in industrial systems. Thus the broader significance and importance includes fostering the next generation of researchers in this research area, as well as providing international experiences to build a globally-aware workforce. In particular, students will have the opportunity to learn state-of-the-art methodologies, be exposed to novel techniques, and interact with senior researchers in their areas of expertise.",
