 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ecosystems develop and change through interactions between living organisms and their physical environment. A shift in vegetation is one of the most important changes an ecosystem can experience, because it can alter exchanges of energy (originating from sunlight), water, and elements such as carbon and nitrogen, among air, plants, and soil. In the Arctic, a widespread shift from tundra to shrub-dominated vegetation appears to be occurring. This research project will discern whether, through complex interactions, this transition to shrublands in the Arctic is likely to result in the release of more carbon into the air (as either carbon dioxide or methane, which are both greenhouse gases). Vast amounts of carbon are stored in Arctic and northern soils, so reduced carbon storage in the Arctic may affect weather and climate in other parts of the world. \r\n\r\nThis project will assess the contributions of different shrub feedbacks to carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling. Snow depth will be manipulated with existing snow fences across a natural gradient of shrub density and height, and a new snowfence experiment will be established in alders. Shrub-induced changes in soil C over the longer term in one ecosystem will be examined in an 18-year-old species removal experiment. Shrub growth, primary production, and biomass will be measured. Long-term effects of added snow on ecosystem N partitioning and shrub N uptake will be measured in a 15N tracer experiment. N fixation will be measured in alder populations and moss communities associated with shrubs. The relative strengths of different shrub feedbacks to N availability and uptake by vegetation will be evaluated. This project will improve prediction of the consequences of shrub expansion in the Arctic, and its potential impacts on regional and global climate. Results will contribute to training of graduate and undergraduate students, to public outreach and training of K-12 teachers and students, and to development of a web-based resource for education.",

As the Arctic warms, both soil nutrient availability and mycorrhizal host shrub abundance are increasing. The resulting changes in mycorrhizal community and function are likely to affect not only nutrient, but also carbon (C) dynamics. We studied how mycorrhizal-associated nutrient cycling may change with future warming, increased nutrient availability, and shifts in host plant abundance.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We tested the effects of long-term experimental warming and fertilization on ectomycorrhizal (EcM) fungal community and root enzyme activity. This fungal group is the dominant symbiont on deciduous shrub species that are expanding most rapidly with climate warming. We found that while warming increased enzyme activity, fertilization decreased activity. Though these responses were partially explained by changes in EcM fungal community, key fungal species responded strongly to environmental manipulations and their abundance predicted enzyme production. Our results suggest that the functional response of shrubs to warming may depend upon intimate relationships with a few key fungal species. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>To better understand how deciduous shrubs and their EcM symbionts gain dominance over other mycorrhizal shrub species, we examined how nutrient limitation affected both EcM and ericaceous shrub abundance and root enzyme activity, measuring non-linear responses across a long-term experimental soil fertility gradient. Ericaceous shrubs make up ~40% of net primary productivity in unmanipulated tundra at these sites.&nbsp;&nbsp;We found that&nbsp;EcM shrub&nbsp;cover and height linearly increased with increasing soil fertility. In contrast,&nbsp;ericaceous shrub&nbsp;cover initially increased, but decreased at high levels of soil fertility. Its height did not change. Enzyme activity did not respond to soil fertility on EcM-colonized&nbsp;deciduous shrub<em>&nbsp;</em>roots, but sharply declined on&nbsp;ericaceous shrub<em>&nbsp;</em>roots<em>.&nbsp;</em>Our results indicate that under moderate increases in soil fertility, Arctic shrub expansion may not only include deciduous EcM shrubs, but ericaceous shrubs as well. Regardless of plant community shifts aboveground, changes in root enzyme activity belowground point to EcM playing a more influential role in tundra soils; as EcM roots remained steady in their liberation of soil organic nutrients with heightened soil fertility, degradative enzyme activity on ericaceous roots dropped?in some instances?instantaneously.</p>\n<p>Finally, we explored drivers of root enzyme activity and N fixation on Siberian alder, a deciduous EcM shrub that is expanding across boreal and Arctic Alaska. Host to ectomycorrhizal EcM fungi and di-nitrogen (N)-fixing actinobacteria Frankia, alder not only facilitates the addition of new N to its ecosystems through fixation, but it may also alter phosphorus (P) availability and transform soil organic matter (SOM) via the exudation of EcM degradative enzymes. To understand alder?s potential for overhauling nutrient dynamics in northern biomes as it expands, we identified drivers of root enzyme activity and N fixation across a latitudinal gradient boreal and Arctic Alaska. We paired measurements of enzyme activity and fixation, testing for relationships between each symbiotic root process and environmental and alder properties. We found mean annual temperature was the largest driver of root enzyme activity. Warmer, southern sites had high activities dominated by hydrolytic enzymes while colder, Arctic sites had low activities dominated by phenol oxidase. In contrast, fixation was best explained by depth of the soil organic layer and foliar d13C, an index of plant drought stress, rather than by temperature alone. The relationship between fixation and enzyme activity depended on nutrient limitation (indicated by foliar N:P value). When N was more limiting than P, high fixation rates were associated with lower phosphatase activities relative to phenol oxidase. When P was more limiting, high fixation rates were associated with higher phosphatase activities relative to phenol oxidase. Our results suggest that as alder expands, its heightened influence on ecosystems will be mediated by local edaphic conditions. As warming stimulates nutrient releases, the resulting changes in N limitation relative to P will control whether inputs of fixed N are accompanied by EcM-induced increases in soil P availability or the degradation of lignin-rich SOM.</p>\n<p>This project supported three PhD dissertations and two MS theses.
