 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves laboratory studies to assess the chemical composition and optical properties of small atmospheric particles created from biomass burning. The investigators are focusing on common East African biomass sources including eucalyptus, banana trees, acacia, and animal dung. They are building an indoor smog chamber that will be connected directly to the output of a burner that will be used to generate biomass aerosols. This project will lead to a better understanding of pollutants generated from the common use of biomass for cooking and burning in developing countries.\r\n\r\nThe project is using a combination of Cavity Ring Down Spectroscopy (CRDS), nephelometry and a Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer (SMPS) to measure aerosol optical properties at a wide range of wavelengths to determine absorption cross sections as a function of wavelength. Optical properties are also being measured as a function of composition and degree of atmospheric aging as the chamber is designed so that additional gases of relevant organic compounds and nitrogen oxides can be added to prepare mixtures to simulate atmospheric aging of the aerosols. Ultra-Performance Liquid Chromatography (UPLC) coupled in-line to both a Diode Array Detector (DAD) and high-resolution quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer equipped with an electrospray ionization source is being used to chemically characterize aerosol samples produced in the chamber experiments.",

Savanna fires are the largest source of biomass burning regarding the amount of burned biomass in Africa. Many of the scientific challenges in atmospheric chemistry are global in nature and affect individuals from a wide array of backgrounds. It has also been shown that the long-range transport of pollutants emitted from BB can affect air quality thousands of kilometers away from the source making the importance of long-range transport evident. There have been several laboratory studies on the optical properties of biomass fuels from North America and very few for African fuels that only focused in south Africa. The scattering and absorption properties define the optical properties of these aerosols and values of these properties determine whether these particles contribute to warming or cooling effect of the atmosphere. Most of the studies reported are done at a single wavelength of the solar spectrum, but there is a need to study the optical properties at wide range of wavelengths. Furthermore, these optical properties are influenced by burning conditions, burning temperature and aging conditions (environment the particles are placed and how they change with time). The chemical composition of these particles is also a factor that influences their optical properties.</p>\n<p>In these project, we constructed a 9 m<sup>3&nbsp;&nbsp;</sup>indoor smog chamber for a systematic and controlled study of the change in the optical properties of biomass burning aerosols emitted from fuels common for domestic use in east Africa. The studies were done for dark aged, photo chemically aged and photo chemically aged with volatile organic compounds common in polluted environments. The wood samples were combusted at two different temperatures in a tube furnace where the flow of air and temperature are controlled. Carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide emitted during combustion were measured to determine modified combustion efficiency. We collected filter samples of these particles for a chemical analysis and identified the chemical composition of the particles under all aging conditions and combustion temperatures. We used transmission electron microscopy images of the filter samples to model the optical properties theoretically and by fitting the theoretical results to the experimental values we could determine the refractive indices of the particles. This is the first such study for east African biomass fuels and the only one measured at a wide range of solar wavelengths. The results led to five peer reviewed publications (two published and three under review) and nine conference presentations at the American Geophysical Union, American Physical Society, and American Association of Aerosol Research.</p>\n<p>The low numbers of African-American, Hispanic, and Native-American students graduating with either undergraduate or graduate degrees in the geosciences is the lowest within all the STEM fields. There are only very few HBCU?s that have programs in atmospheric sciences (Only three graduate and two undergraduate program in the country). NCAT has both undergraduate and graduate programs. This project enhanced the capability of NCAT to conduct competitive research in atmospheric chemistry and produce minority atmospheric scientists. Over the life of the project two MS, one PhD and six undergraduates received training and conducted research in through the funded proposal. Two MS thesis, one PhD dissertation and four undergraduate senior research projects resulted from this research.</p>\n<p>This project further enhanced the research capability and infrastructure of the institution that helped open more collaborations with major research institutions including Colorado State University, University of North Carolina Chapel Hill, RTI and NCAR. This project has increased the prestige of the university. The research program supported by this grant has been broadcast in a podcast by the American Scientist magazine.
