(See https://bayesian.org/content/isba-2016-world-meeting.) The International Society for Bayesian Analysis (ISBA, www.bayesian.org) was established in 1992. Its mission is to promote the development and application of Bayesian statistical theory and methods useful in the solution of theoretical and applied problems in science, industry and government. The ISBA meetings are important venues for the exchange of research ideas in Bayesian statistics. This award will provide funding for US Ph.D. students to attend and participate in this meeting.\r\n\r\nThis meeting on Bayesian analysis will be held June 13-17, 2016, in Sardinia. The conference will include short courses, oral presentations, and poster sessions. The oral presentations include the De Finetti Lecture by Persi Diaconis (Stanford University) and the Susie Bayarri Lecture by James Scott (University of Texas). NSF funding will allow US Ph.D. students to attend and participate in this meeting.",

The conference was held in Sardinia on June 13-17, 2016.  I apologize for being tardy.\n\nThe Scientific Committee of the ISBA 2016 World Meeting received a total of 52 applications for travel support from graduate students at U.S. institutions. \n\nThe applications were reviewed and ranked by a selection committee, which consisted of the chair of the Scientific Committee of the ISBA 2016 World Meeting (Michele Guindani, Associate Professor, Deparment of Statistics, University of California, Irvine, USA), the ISBA 2016 program chair (Chris Hans, Associate Professor, Deparment of Statistics, The Ohio State University, USA) and the ISBA 2016 program chair-elect  (Clair Alston-Knox, Statistician, Griffith Social and Behavioural Research College, Queensland, Australia).  The committee members were asked to identify all women and minority  applicants who were judged to be within the top 50% of the applications. The final allocation aimed at funding  all women and minority applicants who were judged to be within the top 50% of the applications.\n\nA total of 49 applications were deemed fundable using funds obtained from Federal agencies (NSF and ONR), as well as contributions from public companies (Google, STATA and RStudio), in addition to funds put forward  directly by ISBA.  No applicant was fully funded; rather, the committee's purpose was to supplement support from advisors or universities or other sources, thereby spreading the available money among as many applicants as possible to ensure maximum attendance.\n\nAs a result of the funding provided specifically by the NSF, we were able to provide supplemental support for 34 applications from graduate students at U.S. institutions.  Of the 34 applications directly supported through NSF funding, 14 were from female researchers. In terms of race ethnicity, 18 recipients identified themselves as White, 13 as Asian, 1 as Black African-American, 1 as Hispanic Latino, 1 as Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander. \n\nTables 1, 2, and 3 summarize the funded applications by gender, race ethnicity, and amount given to the recipient, respectively, for all of the US PhD student applicants funded by ISBA.
