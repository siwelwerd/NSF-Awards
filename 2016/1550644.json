This conference is part of a long-standing series of conferences devoted to probability an stochastic processes. Past conferences have had major impact on the field, and broad participation of graduate students and early-career researchers, including future fields medalists and many world-leading experts in early stages of their research careers. The conference will be advertised through the Bulletin of the Institute of Mathematical Statistics and the Notices of the American Mathematical Society, and the conference website is presented at http://depts.washington.edu/ssproc/. \r\n\r\nThe conference will feature current research in the area of probability and stochastic processes. Researchers will present their new results and there will be time for open discussions to explore unsolved problem in the field, as well as a poster session. The format of lectures at the conference is strongly based on the success of the format of recent Seminars on Stochastic Processes. Five one-hour lectures and two 90 minute lectures will be delivered by distinguished speakers.",
