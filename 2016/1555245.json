 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award, the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms (CSDM-A) Program of the Division of Chemistry is funding Professor Joshua Vura-Weis at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) to investigate the mechanism of light-induced processes where the electronic spin state changes.  After certain iron and iron-cobalt complexes absorb visible light, they undergo a rapid rearrangement (spin flip) and become trapped in a long-lived state that may be useful for practical applications. The experimental technique used in this project is tabletop extreme ultraviolet (XUV) spectroscopy.  Two workshops designed to foster deep and sustained undergraduate engagement in spectroscopy research are established in association with the International Symposium on Molecular Spectroscopy (ISMS) at UIUC. A weeklong \"Spectroscopy in the Snow\" intensive winter course gives sophomores the foundational knowledge required for physical chemistry research and allows them to begin high-level work in their home institutions one year ahead of schedule.  A two-day ISMS pre-conference for undergraduates, analogous to the Gordon Research Seminar series for graduate students, builds a community of young researchers and raises the level of undergraduate presentations at the main conference. The new spectroscopic methods demonstrated in this proposal are applicable for a wide range of problems in physical and inorganic chemistry, from photocatalysis to solar cell design.\r\n\r\nExtreme ultraviolet (XUV) transient absorption spectroscopy at femtosecond resolution is used to resolve the details of the spin relaxation process in a series of transition metal complexes. The Vura-Weis group further extends its capabilities to measure vibrational dynamics during the spin crossover. The interplay between electron transfer and spin dynamics is a key factor in the photophysics and reactivity of complexes containing open-shell transition metals. The Vura-Weis group uses the spin-state specificity and femtosecond time resolution of XUV transient absorption to measure the relaxation cascade of iron polypyridyl complexes, specifically focusing on the potential role of a short-lived metal-centered triplet state. The interplay between electron transfer and spin crossover in Prussian Blues is being measured in a series of discrete cyano-bridged iron-cobalt systems. In this case, the element specificity of XUV absorption allows the dynamics of each metal to be independently probed.  The particular molecular motions that gate the electron dynamics are identified by element-specific XUV impulsive coherent vibrational spectroscopy.  To make research in physical chemistry more accessible to undergraduates, a winter school on spectroscopy takes place at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, in connection with the International Symposium on Molecular Spectroscopy (ISMS).  In addition, a two-day undergraduate meeting preceding this conference develops a supportive community of young researchers.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOver the course of this grant, we developed the science of transient M-edge X-ray Absorption Near Edge Spectroscopy.  This tabletop laser-based technique probes the 3p?3d transitions of metals such as iron and cobalt, and we showed experimentally and computationally that the shape and position of the spectra are element specific, oxidation state specific, and spin state specific.  We used this new spectroscopy to understand the light-induced behavior of iron and cobalt complexes relevant to light harvesting for solar energy conversion.  In applications as wide-ranging as solar cells and pharmaceutical synthesis, light capture is most commonly performed by molecules containing ruthenium and iridium.  Both of these metals are rare and expensive, so there is a widespread desire to replace them with earth-abundant metals.  However, substitution with iron or cobalt results in molecules that rapidly release their absorbed energy as heat, making them unsuitable for these important applications.  We showed that for a common Fe chromophore, the initial photoexcitation of a metal-to-ligand charge transfer state causes a rapid cascade between metal-centered excited states.  This cascade is so rapid that the photon energy is transferred into specific coherent molecular vibrations, which we measured using the ligand field specificity of M-edge spectroscopy.  In a related cobalt complex, we identified a short-lived charge transfer state that was hidden to previous experiments.  As a whole, this project showed that tabletop extreme ultraviolet spectroscopy can uncover hidden states and resolve the rapid conversion of light to electronic energy to vibrational energy.  The vibration-specific information revealed by this new technique will allow researchers to design new light absorbers with long-lived excited states capable of performing catalysis or powering next-generation solar cells.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/26/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Joshua Vura-Weis"
