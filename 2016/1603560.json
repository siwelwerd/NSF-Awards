 "awd_abstract_narration": "Small mammals graze on the vegetation of the Arctic tundra. Although this grazing may influence many aspects of tundra ecosystems, current models do not include grazing by small mammals. In this project, the abundance of voles and lemmings will be varied experimentally using fenced plots.  The investigators will observe the responses in the plots, especially focusing on changes in the cycling of carbon and nitrogen. To understand how the current climate controls the importance of grazing by small mammals, the investigators will conduct their studies at three sites in Alaska located in the Seward Peninsula, the foothills of the Brooks Range, and on the Arctic coastal plain. The natural abundance of voles and lemmings will be studied at these sites to provide background for applying the experimental results throughout the Arctic. The results will be used to expand a mathematical model of tundra ecosystems to include grazing by small mammals, which will improve the predictions that can be made about how the Arctic may change in the future. The research will involve a number of undergraduate students and investigators will integrate their research into classes and other educational programs. In addition, they will present a radio program in Barrow, AK. \r\n\r\nThe investigators will investigate the importance of herbivory by small mammals in controlling the cycling of carbon and nutrients in the rapidly changing Arctic tundra. Through studies at three sites along a latitudinal gradient, the investigators will employ both observations and experiments to quantify the role of grazing by rodents (voles and lemmings) in the functioning of tundra ecosystems. The observations of rodent population dynamics along with ecosystem function will provide key new information relevant to understanding the feedbacks of the Arctic tundra to the global climate. The manipulation of rodent density through exclosures and enclosures will show how potential changes in rodent populations may influence the tundra ecosystem response. In corporation of the observational and experimental results into a quantitative ecosystem model will enhance predictions of future changes and feedbacks with climate. \r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n            The population numbers of several mammal species in the Arctic cycle with outbreaks where populations reach high densities for one or two years followed by a crash and several years of low density.  For many years, scientists have studied these population cycles to try to understand what drives them.  Less is known about the effects of these cycles on other aspects of ecosystems like their effects on plant productivity, nutrient cycling, and carbon stored in soils.  However, in one study, it was found that the cycle of small mammal populations in Scandinavia was correlated with how green the arctic tundra looks in satellite images.  These earlier studies were the motivation for the current study. \n\n            This project is a collaborative study involving both faculty and students at five institutions, Columbia University, the University of New Hampshire, Towson University, the University of Texas at El Paso, and the Marine Biological Laboratory.  The project was designed to address two main questions: (1) is there a cause-and-effect relation between small mammal cycles and the productivity and carbon sequestration of arctic tundra?  And (2) what effects do small mammals have on the responses of arctic tundra to elevated carbon dioxide and climate warming?  To address the first question, the researchers set up fenced areas on the tundra in northern Alaska where they can manipulate the density of small mammals.  To address the second of these questions, the researchers incorporated the effects of small mammals into a computer model that simulates vegetation growth, nutrient cycling, and carbon sequestration in soils. They found that it was important to explicitly represent small mammals in the model rather than lumping their effects in with the effects of bacteria, fungi, and cold-blooded animals like insects because the response of small-mammal respiration to warming is opposite to respiration in these other organisms.  Respiration in most non-mammal organisms increases with warming because their metabolism increases.  In contrast, for mammals in the Arctic warming means that less energy needs to be expended to maintain their warm body temperatures.  Thus, warming for mammals results in a decrease, rather than increase, in metabolism.  Thus, warming decreases respiration in small mammals, resulting in less carbon lost to the atmosphere as carbon dioxide. In their modeling study, the researchers found that the increase in carbon stored in arctic ecosystems over the next 100 years was underestimated by 50 to 80% unless small mammals were explicitly represented in the model.   However, the model also indicates that the effects of small mammals depend mostly on their average abundance over several years and that the cycling in population density was less important.  The effects of cycling are nonetheless detectable in plant productivity and abundance, and hence in the greenness of the tundra.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/27/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Edward B Rastetter"
