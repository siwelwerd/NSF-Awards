 "awd_abstract_narration": "Stars form out of giant clouds of hydrogen, but the details of the collapse are still unclear.  The investigators will use computer models to simulate the collapses of clouds to form stars.  The investigator seeks to answer three important questions concerning star formation.  (1) How much of a cloud turns into stars?  (2) How fast does this happen?  (3) Are magnetic fields the most important force on collapsing gas?  The investigator will produce a series of synthetic observations to hunt for the very first signature of collapsing gas. Star formation of takes millions of years. Astronomer's observations of many clouds in our galaxy are snap shots of the history of star formation.  The computer models allow astronomers to organize all these observations into a single story of the birth of stars.\r\n\r\nThe investigator will produce a sequence of synthetic, all-galaxy, maps of molecules and hot gas in our galaxy. The numerical models use adaptive mesh refinement and include the effects of magnetic fields, radiation feedback, and models for the chemical composition of the clouds.  The open source code ENZO will be used for the simulations.  The simulations have a physical scale of 1000 pc and resolution of 100 astronomical units.  The investigator will start with initial conditions similar to those seen in the stratified galactic disk.  At higher linear resolution, the simulation will be concentrated on molecular clouds and the dense cores that harbor young stars. The complete assembly history of forces and observational signatures will be produced.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nStars are some of the most important objects in the Universe, providing the\npower source for all known life in the universe.  They are responsible for most\nof the elements on the periodic table, and their explosions drive the structure\nof the Galaxy.  In order to understand the rate at which they die, we must first\nunderstand the rate at which they are born.  Stellar birth occurs over a million\nyears, shrouded in nearly opaque gas, in a chaotic environment.  There are many questions to answer.\n\nStars form in clouds of molecular hydrogen that are barely supported against\ntheir own self gravity by magnetic fields and kinetic energy that fill the\ncloud.  Kinetic energy (the flow of the gas) has a complex role, as converging\nflows drive high density and enhance star formation, but they also can disrupt a\ndense knot, suppressing star formation.\n\nIn order to develop a complete picture of star formation, one must understand\ntwo things; what portion of the cloud will collapse, and how fast it does so.\nTo this end, we have performed several simulations of collapsing molecular\nclouds.  What makes our simulations special is the inclusion of particles that\nfollow the gas history.  This allows us to form stars, and then run the\nsimulations backwards to see where they came from and how they got dense.  We refer to the gas that will become stars as preimage gas.\n\nOur simulations begin with turbulent molecular clouds that have been stirred in\na manner similar what a cloud experiences being in a galaxy.  Colliding streams\nof fluid create many density fluctuations that can potentially form stars.\nFrom this turbulence, we turn on gravity and allow the gas to collapse to form\nstars.  Once the stars are formed, we extract the\nparticles that ended in the star and run them backwards to see what gas\ncontributed to the object and how it got there.  We refer to gas that will\nbecome a star as the preimage gas.\n\nWe find that the preimage gas is distributed in a fractal manner throughout the\nparent cloud, and that the gas that contributes to a star comes from a large\nvolume, about a light year on a side.  Many density fluctuations are necessary\nfor one star, but only one or two velocity streams.  This is in stark contrast\nto other models of star formation that typically only consider a single\nfluctuation that is not a fractal.  For binary stars, we find that the gas from\nboth stars is initially intermixed in the parent cloud.\n\nWe find that the collapse of each star proceeds in roughly three phases;\ncollection, hardening, and singularity.  The assembly phase sweeps low density\ngas to moderate density and a roughly round object.  The hardening phase brings\nkinetic and gravitational energies into equipartition.  Some stars begin with\nmore gravitational energy than kinetic, in these cases the gravity accelerates\nthe gas until the kinetic and gravitational energies are equal.  Other stars\nbegin with more kinetic energy than gravitational, in which case the convergence\nof the flow drives high density, which in turn makes more gravitational energy.\nIn a curious near paradox, the velocity decays to near subsonic values, while\nthe kinetic energy continues to increase.  After a period of time in the\nhardening phase, the singularity takes over and the density of the object\nincreases by a factor of 100-10,000 in a very short period of time; this\nsingularity forms the star at once in a very rapid assembly of gas into a very\nsmall volume.  This three phase behavior has never been seen before.\n\nThese simulations have shed light on the star formation process in a new way\nthat allows us to understand the physics and chaos of the collapse, and will be\nused for future models of galaxy formation.\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/31/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: David C Collins"
