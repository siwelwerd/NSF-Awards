This effort will enhance the current Neotoma platform by: 1) maximizing rates of data ingest through on-going data mobilization campaigns, recruitment and training of new data stewards, and development of facilitation software; 2) expanding the Neotoma data model to facilitate new proxy acquisition and secondary data including organic biomarkers, isotopic data from faunal specimens, and faunal taphonomic information; 3) developing new tools for data visualization and scientific exploration; 4) fostering engagement and growth of the Neotoma research community through support for a series of workshops intended to train data users, data stewards, and teachers, and by development of an on-line blog.\r\n\r\nThe Neotoma geoinformatics platform will promote integrative studies of the biotic impacts of climate change over the past five million years by allowing greater access to previously collected geoscience data sets of relevance and the tools to support analysis at marginal cost.  The project will promote community engagement, support ease of data set ingestion, address PI team succession and promote educational module development.  This award directly addresses OMB Memo M-13-13 ?Open Data Policy-Managing Information as an Asset.?\r\n\r\n***",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOverview\n\nIn an era marked by changing climates, the past offers valuable information about how species and ecosystems have responded to environmental change, but global-scale analyses are challenged by high data variety and dispersal. The Neotoma Paleoecology Database supports global-change research by providing an open, sustainable, community-curated repository for multiple kinds of fossil data. Neotoma achieves high data quality by working closely with expert contributors and stewards. Neotoma specializes in records spanning the last few centuries to million years - a time that covers the spread of humans worldwide and multiple large and repeated climate changes. By consolidating many kinds of data into one centralized resource, Neotoma lowers costs and enhances sustainability while offering paleoecologists a high-quality data resource.\n\nData Volume\n\nDuring the lifecycle of this project, Neotoma has become the standard repository for Quaternary fossil data in North America and, increasingly, globally. Neotoma now holds over 9.7 million observations from 46,979 datasets, 21,118 sites, 8,305 publications, and 8,045 authors.\n\nGovernance\n\nCommunity data resources require well-developed governance structures. During the project, Neotoma formally adopted bylaws, established the Neotoma Leadership Council as the governing body, developed an annual election mechanism, and established Data Use and Code of Conduct policies. All Neotoma data are freely available to all under a Creative Commons license, with customizable citations for individual Constituent Databases. Over 100 scientists are trained as Data Stewards, who can upload and curate data. Neotoma co-founded the Earth-Life Consortium, a non-profit association with the mission to support the free and open access of paleobiological data.\n\nSoftware and Services\n\nWe released a new generation of Neotoma's application programmatic interfaces (APIs), which enable other developers and scientists to write their own software to access Neotoma data. The Neotoma database was migrated to open-source software (Linux/Postgres), a major effort that improves sustainability and access. Database snapshotting services were created so that Constituent Databases could periodically receive copies of their own data, thereby enhancing access and preservation redundancy.

All Neotoma datasets are now assigned unique identifiers (DOIs) and individual websites, to facilitate discovery by search engines. We have set up Google Analytics to better track usage.\n\nEducation, Training and Communications\n\nThis project has supported the training of both graduate and undergraduate students at the intersection of the geosciences and data sciences, a top-priority area for workforce training. Neotoma data are of particular interest to early career scientists. As one said, \"I'd like to give a shoutout to open-access databases.
