 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Global Learning and Observations to Benefit the Environment (GLOBE) program is a cooperative international science program that engages students in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) learning, with a focus on environmental processes and student research. Now in its 20th year, GLOBE continues to engage a vibrant community of scientists, educators, and students through operations in more than 115 countries worldwide.  GLOBE's fundamental approach of providing students with inquiry-based, authentic scientific research experiences that are often locally-relevant builds on an extensive STEM education research base regarding effective approaches for engaging students in learning STEM concepts and pursuing careers in STEM.  The cultural diversity of the global community engaged in GLOBE, and the ability to interact with that diverse community, positions GLOBE as a compelling platform for demonstrating that ALL students have the potential for participating in and succeeding in STEM activities.  Building capacity to leverage GLOBE resources, with the goal of increasing student engagement and diversity in STEM, is a major focus of this award.\r\n\r\nThis award provides support to the GLOBE Implementation Office at UCAR to conduct two comprehensive training workshops for ~40 existing and new GLOBE Partners. Training of local educators on GLOBE protocols has traditionally been undertaken by the GLOBE Partners, but the resources have not been available to bring on many new Partners - especially in areas that are underserved in STEM education - or enhance the abilities of existing Partners in the use of new tools that have become available to the program.  In the five years since the last large-scale, comprehensive U.S. Partner workshop was offered, 40 new partners have joined the program and they have only received abbreviated one-on-one training.  To address new priorities within the GLOBE program related to broadening participation of traditionally underrepresented students in STEM, these training workshops are being designed to model and disseminate best practices for implementing GLOBE within especially high minority population communities.  The SCALE Immersion Model for Professional Learning (SIMPL) professional development strategy is being used during the workshops to both deliver content regarding GLOBE program resources and provide an example of how Partners might improve the pedagogical training of GLOBE educators in their local communities.  The workshops are being held in April and May 2016, with one workshop being held in New Mexico for Partners from the 3 western GLOBE regions and the other being held in North Carolina for Partners from the 3 eastern GLOBE regions.  Within 12-16 months following the training workshops, the participants are expected to convene local workshops on broadening participation through GLOBE in their communities, thereby amplifying the impact of the workshops.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual Merit: Various research studies have shown the need for a more diverse STEM workforce and that many challenges still exist, especially for minorities. GLOBE is creating a new focus on inclusion of students of color and high need students.  The assistance of a knowledgeable and trained U.S. partner network is required, and essential, to successfully address this new focus.  Members of the network need training in the GLOBE protocols as well as exposure to STEM Equity and Inclusion and other educational strategies (PBL, inquiry-based teaching, SIMPL model of facilitation).  Partners will leave the workshops with a heightened awareness and a broader skills base to meet the needs of, and engage with, teachers in high need and high diversity districts.\n\nFeedback from the two original and the additional bootcamp indicate that the participants did leave the workshops with an increased awareness of STEM Equity and Inclusion issues. Many considered that the conversations about these topics were held in a respectful way and in a comfortable environment.  In addition, many participants had not considered or known the language associated with STEM Equity and Inclusion and for them this experience was an awakening to a new perspective on STEM.   Participants felt that they did leave the bootcamps with a new understanding and some new skills to use GLOBE as a way to increase STEM Equity and Inclusion.   \n\n \n\nBroader Impacts:  As the K-12 student demographic changes, GLOBE is focusing more on students of color and high need populations as part of STEM education.  GLOBE has over 100 partners in its U.S. network and while these workshops will focus on 20 partners, each partner is expected to host a workshop with this focus within 12-16 months.  In addition, a session will be held at the 2016 GLOBE annual meeting to brief the larger community about this initiative. A report documenting and assessing the workshops will be placed on the GLOBE website. \n\nGLOBE Partners continue to offer training workshops for in-service teachers and integrate GLOBE into their science education courses for education majors.  Partners have begun to integrate information from the bootcamps into their workshops and GIO continues to encourage them to do this.  A session was held at the 2016 GLOBE Annual meeting to brief partners and teachers on the initiative, as well as advertise the additional bootcamp that was being offered.  In addition to the six or more proposals that were written and/or submitted to the NSF as a result of the first two bootcamps, another three are being finalized to be submitted to NSF?s DRK-12 and AISL programs. In total almost 70 GLOBE partnerships across all six U.S. regions attended the bootcamps, over 30 more than originally planned. \n\nA final report will be created and placed on the GLOBE website. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/07/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Anthony P Murphy"
