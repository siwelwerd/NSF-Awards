The award will support participation (via lodging and registration subsidy) by 30 individuals who would otherwise be unable to attend the meeting, with a particular emphasis on broadening participation by junior researchers and groups traditionally underrepresented in astronomy and astrophysics. \r\n\r\nThe SnowPAC workshop is an international meeting that reviews recent developments in particle astrophysics, dark matter, dark energy, astronomy, and cosmology. It seeks to establish new connections between these disciplines and establish new collaborative ties between individuals working in these research areas. \r\n\r\nThe SnowPAC 2016 conference is a topical conference on \"The Galaxy-Halo Connection,\" and will bring together members of the observational, theoretical, and numerical simulation communities.  This conference will provide a venue to compare the results of the latest simulations to analytic models, and to the observed clustering of matter.  It will provide direction for future efforts in the field of galaxy evolution and clustering of large-scale structure.",
