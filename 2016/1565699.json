 "awd_abstract_narration": "New forms of technology and media have made it easier than ever to disseminate false information, which can have adverse consequences on businesses, the financial sector, science, and beyond.  Fact-checking is thus critically important to increase accountability, improve discourse, and minimize socioeconomic disruptions.  A key challenge is that, in light of the new forms of communications, human fact-checkers have difficulty keeping up with rapidly emerging false data and information.\r\n \r\nThis I-Corps team aims to commercialize ClaimBuster, an automated, live fact-checking system that finds claims, matches them with claims that have already been checked by professionals, and, for new claims not yet checked, provides analysis of relevant data to help check their validity.  The team?s technology leverages novel research advances in databases, data and text mining, machine learning, etc.  By participating in the I-Corps Teams program, the team?s goal is to clearly identify target customers and their needs, which will enable the team to prepare a viable commercialization plan and further develop necessary components for deploying their technology.",
