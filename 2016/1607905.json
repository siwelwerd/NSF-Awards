 "awd_abstract_narration": "NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION:  The goal of this project is to synthesize materials of the type Eu(S,Se) and (Eu, Sm)Se.  The host material, EuSe is a special semiconductor that can exhibit one type of magnetism (ferromagnetism) under high magnetic fields and a second type (antiferromagnetism) at low fields.  In the first system, incorporation of sulfur, should shift the magnetic ordering from antiferro- to ferromagnetic, which will allow a study of the relationship between the electronic structure and magnetic ordering in order to understand the mechanism behind magnetic refrigeration (magnetocaloric effect). In the second system, substitution of samarium for europium will enable the understanding of the relationship between the electronic structure and the charge on the rare earth element. The research will target these materials in both the bulk and as nanoparticles, providing a synergistic understanding of the role of morphology and size on the magnetic and electronic properties. \r\n\r\nTECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: The project involves the synthesis of both bulk and nanoparticles of lanthanide monochalcogenides, which are intrinsically semiconducting and magnetic.  The role of anion solid solutions of Eu(S,Se) will be investigated to determine the consequences of the anion changes to the electronic structure and how this changes the magneto-caloric effect.  In addition, magnetic circular dichroism will be used to probe the excited states of these alloys.  The second project involves probing the role of the lanthanide in solid solutions of (Eu,Sm)Se, to understand the lanthanide oxidation state as a function of the electronic structure.  Although EuSe has been found to contain divalent europium and SmSe has divalent samarium, low doping levels of samarium inject samarium in the trivalent state.  These variations will be investigated through use of L-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe goals of this proposal were to investigate two systems: EuS1-xSex, and Eu1-xSmxSe, as bulk solid-state materials and as nanoparticles.  Developing new synthetic methods that take advantage of the differing reactivity of S and Se under nanoparticle synthetic conditions, we were able to prepare nanoparticle alloys of EuS1-xSex for a full range of x.  These materials had tunable band gaps, which to date has been very difficult to do using particle size.  It was of significant interest to understand how changing the electronic structure affected the magnetic coupling, and we found that Magnetic Circular Dichroism was an excellent method to probe this.  Using MCD, we discovered there is giant conduction band splitting in very small nanomaterials.  The MCD was quite sensitive to both field and temperature, allowing us to probe changes in the magnetic structure.  It also allowed us to observe field effects in the magnetic phase diagram of EuSe nanoparticles.  For the second goal, to elucidate phase stability, we synthesized Eu1-xSmxSe both as solid state powders as well as single crystals, and discovered using synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction that these alloys phase separates forming EuSe and Sm2Se3 at high temperatures.  In an effort to stabilize the alloy under lower temperatures under nanoparticle conditions, we focused first on Sm-Se nanomaterials.  Using a divalent precursor for samarium, SmI2, in our nanoparticle synthesis and we have discovered the stabilization of a new divalent lanthanide chalcogenide nanoparticle (Sm2+)(Sm3+)2Se4, which we are currently investigating.  The studies have highlighted the role of single source precursors in the synthesis of europium chalcogenides, and the conduction band splitting is fundamental to spintronics (spin transport electronics) of interest for new device development.  It also extends our knowledge of phase stability of divalent lanthanides in materials prepared at low temperatures.\n\nThe project has also helped support a course at Georgetown called, Shaping National Policy, providing undergraduate science students with an opportunity to learn about Science Policy.  Our outreach efforts have included bringing STEM activities to broaden future participation.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/30/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Sarah L Stoll"
