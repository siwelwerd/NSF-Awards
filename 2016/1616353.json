 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mathematical approaches are playing an increasingly important role in the biological sciences. This ranges from the development of new models and theories that provide insights into biological processes, to the development of new analytic tools and software that are useful in experimental design and in the analysis of experimental data. In cell biology, lipid bilayer membranes can be thought of as effectively two-dimensional materials comprising of a heterogeneous mixture of lipids, proteins, and other small molecules. The individual and collective dynamics of these molecules are fine-tuned to carry out complex cellular processes ranging from signaling to synaptic transmission to the regulation of shapes of organelles. The effective two-dimensional fluid-elastic nature of cell membranes yields interfacial phenomena and complicated geometric shapes effecting both molecular interactions and dynamics that can be very distinct from their bulk three dimensional counterparts. To gain a deeper understanding of cellular processes in curved protein-lipid bilayers, there is a need for new approaches for incorporating the important roles played by geometry. This research develops new mathematical approaches and software for handling complicated geometries in investigations conducted through laboratory experiments and computational simulations of membrane-protein systems. The educational activities of the project will further enhance the training of both undergraduate and graduate students in new quantitative approaches to the biological sciences. \r\n\r\nThe research of this project will develop new mathematical approaches to capture diffusive transport of proteins within curved membranes arising from both active collective motions and passive thermal fluctuations, hydrodynamics and viscoelastic deformations of curved surfaces, and discrete heterogeneous interactions between inclusions incorporating stochastic kinetics. Mathematical approaches will be extended for both continuum mechanics and coarse-grained molecular descriptions so as to provide insights into the emergent mechanics and dynamics of inclusions within bilayer membranes. To perform computational simulations, a general class of numerical methods based on exterior calculus will be designed to address the challenges associated with solving differential equations on curved manifolds. The research of this project advances the next generation of theoretical models and analysis tools for investigating membrane-protein systems. Societal impacts of the work derive from fundamental contributions to the understanding of membrane-protein systems in cell biology, which may give insights into processes relevant to membrane-related technologies such as drug delivery through permeation or design of antimicrobials such as membrane disruptors.",

The research work resulted in the development of mathematical theory and numerical methods based on differential geometry and stochastic analysis for modeling and simulating protein transport phenomena and kinetics within curved membrane structures.  For modeling hydrodynamic coupling, this included using approaches from the exterior calculus of differential geometry to formulate fluid mechanics descriptions and numerical methods for incompressible fluctuating hydrodynamic flows within curved fluid interfaces and membranes.  Mathematical approaches were developed for formulating stochastic models and simulation methods including using mesh-based and meshless numerical approximations.  A modeling framework and software was also introduced for modeling and simulating general fluid-structure interactions for proteins and other microstructures to incorporate the roles of geometry, hydrodynamic coupling, and thermal fluctuations within curved membrane structures.  The computational methods were used to investigate hypotheses about how cell membrane geometry can augment hydrodynamic flow responses, coupling, and fluctuations within fluid membranes, phase separation in heterogeneous membranes, and collective protein drift-diffusion dynamics and kinetics.  The project also resulted in interdisciplinary collaborations on problems in cell biology, including investigating neuronal dendritic spines and the roles played by phase separation and geometry in protein kinetics.
