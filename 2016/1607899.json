The meeting will have 13-14 technical\r\nsessions covering recent advances in membrane research, development and applications. Some \r\nexamples include the nexus of nanotechnology, biotechnology and membrane separations, as well\r\nas wastewater reclamation, gas and liquid separations and purifications, and energy issues.\r\nA poster session is also an integral part of the meeting. Supported students will be asked\r\nto present at the poster session. The meeting will feature a number of internationally renowned\r\nand up and coming researchers. The anticipated attendance for the meeting is 100 membrane\r\nresearchers from all parts of the world representing industry, government and academic facilities.\r\nMembrane technology is an important part of the separation technology. Topics were selected\r\nbased on providing an update from the previous meeting, marking specific areas for special\r\nattention, and showcasing recent advancements related to water production, the environment\r\nand special needs. The conference will highlight the following four topics:\r\n(1) Environmental engineering through sessions that will highlight the use of membranes to\r\nremove emerging contaminants, such as endocrine disruptors and algal toxins (e.g. microcystin,\r\nas the issues facing Lake Erie and numerous world countries). Another session will have presentations\r\non lowering membrane fouling.\r\n(2) Sustainability through two sessions that will discuss sustainable water treatment, such\r\nas water reclamation and recycling; and will discuss membranes for energy applications, such\r\nsaline water gradient.\r\n(3) Advances in nanotechnology for membranes, which will highlight the use of metal nanoparticles,\r\ncarbon nanotubes, graphene and other nanomaterials for the improvement of membrane operation.\r\n(4) Scalable nanomanufacturing of membranes, which will highlight the mechanisms that can\r\nlead to failure during the scale up of nanocomposite membranes.\r\nGiven the scope of this meeting, its more intimate meeting structure and diverse internationally\r\nrenowned attendees, the ECI Advanced Membrane Technology VII Conference provides an exceptional\r\nintellectual training opportunity for graduate students and young faculty.\r\nThe potential to improve advanced membrane technology rests on our continuing ability to harness\r\nresults from basic science and engineering, of the kind supported by",
