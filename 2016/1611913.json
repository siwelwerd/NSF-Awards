The fellowship supports a research and training plan for the Fellow to increase the participation of groups underrepresented in biology.  The title of the research plan for this fellowship to Dr. Emily Lescak is \"Effects of Chronic Exposure to Low Levels of Antibiotics on Development of Threespine Stickleback Fish.\" The host institution for this fellowship is the University of Alaska Anchorage, and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Milligan-Myhre.  \r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to study short- and long-term effects of chronic exposure to low levels of antibiotics on microbial community diversity and host development in a genetically variable fish species, threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus), a model organism for understanding the impact of environmental contaminants on vertebrate physiology. Vertebrate host/microbe interactions are crucial for nutrient absorption, somatic growth, and immune system development. Disruptions to the microbiota, such as those caused by antibiotics, can therefore have both immediate and long-term effects on host physiology. Low levels of more than a dozen types of antibiotics have been detected in waterways in the United States and Europe. However, little is known about how chronic exposure impacts host-microbe interactions in aquatic vertebrates, like fish, or how host genetic background influences the response of the microbiota to disruption. The Fellow is testing the hypotheses that 1) the levels of antibiotics found in the environment are sufficient to disrupt microbial community composition, which will result in changes to timing of organ development, growth, behavior, and inflammatory state, and 2) that there will be individualized responses to antibiotic exposure due to differences in host genetic background. The Fellow is rearing stickleback from two genetically distinct populations at low levels of antibiotics and in a control (untreated water). Microbial diversity, inflammatory state, and physiological and behavioral development are being compared at a series of key developmental time points until reproductive maturity is reached. Results will help elucidate how gut microbial communities respond to chronic disturbances, how critical aspects of vertebrate physiology may be disrupted by antibiotic exposure in the environment, and how host genetic background influences susceptibility to short- and long-term changes in microbial diversity and development. \r\n\r\nIn terms of training, the Fellow is 1) learning new techniques in bioinformatics, histology, and microbiology; 2) developing immune response assays; 3) mentoring students. The Fellow is giving presentations on her research and career training to K-12 students in Anchorage, Alaska. Furthermore, she is training high school students through the Anchorage School District's mentorship program and identifying undergraduate and graduate trainees through the Alaska Native Science and Engineering Program and BUILD EXITO. By establishing the University of Alaska Anchorage's first postdoctoral association, the Fellow is organizing professional development for postdoctoral fellows and graduate students. Thus, the Fellow is engaging trainees of all levels from diverse backgrounds in research important to ecosystem health.",
