 "awd_abstract_narration": "All forms of computation are on the near horizon as necessary to learn as well as incorporate into learning of science. The STEM+C (STEM + Computing Partnerships) program has as its goal the integration of computation and science. This specific project will build and pilot a Community Center Afterschool Program (CCAP) model for integrating computation across K-12 disciplines at three community centers and their three affiliated Kid City Programs (6 locations) serving high needs, Title I schools in Boise, Idaho. Motivation for this project is based on the national urgency of integrating computational thinking (CT) in K-12 STEM education, a lack of qualified K-12 computing teachers, and local needs of quality STEM+C programs for high needs students. The CCAP model focuses on student learning and teacher professional development (PD) through pre-/in-service teacher-led, project-based, integrated STEM+C hands-on inquiry projects. \r\n\r\nAfterschool programs provide opportunities for thoughtful, reflective engagement in complex, integrated projects that require combined knowledge across STEM disciplines and applications of computational thinking (CT), which are needed for computational integration. The CCAP model uses STEM+C inquiry/projects as a bridge between informal and formal learning and as a means of teacher PD. Not only will this project address student learning and teacher PD in CT, it will connect informal and formal learning and extend teacher PD to classroom practice. Project goals include: 1) design and implement a CCAP model; 2) explore how to integrate CT in project-based, integrated STEM inquiry for 4th-6th grade students in afterschool programs; and 3) examine how engagement in such inquiry impacts students and teachers. The project teams will: 1) design at least four project-based, integrated STEM+C inquiry projects aligned with standards via iterative design-based research; 2) implement them in small groups of six students paired with two teachers; 3) train 24 pre- and 24 in-service Title 1 school teachers with 144 students.",

First, it provided first-hand knowledge of integrating computational thinking (CT) in a complex project-based learning (PBL) environment<strong> </strong>that provides opportunities for thoughtful, reflective engagement via unique and integrated STEM learning requiring combined knowledge across STEM disciplines and applications of CT for students to solve problems (e.g., Yang et al., 2018; Yang et al., 2021). It also provides an example of an integrated STEM curriculum embedded with CT as well as the knowledge and insights of student-centered inquiry and CT practice guided by PBL. Second, the project created and enacted a comprehensive Community Center Afterschool Program (CCAP) model that takes the advantage of a synergetic effort and resources from various stakeholders such as schools, a school district, a higher education institution, and community centers to tackle the challenge of integrating CT in K-12 education. The outcomes of this collaborative partnership were shared via project final competitions/showcases, conference presentations and peer-reviewed publications with regional, national and international audiences. Third, the CCAP module involves both in-service and pre-service teachers facilitating CT integration in an informal learning environment, and helps transform teachers' professional learning into effective teaching practice in formal classroom settings. This module results in the knowledge on how to bridge informal and formal learning (e.g., Baek et al., 2020; Feng &amp; Yang, in press). Last, but not least important, this project provided an example of and insight on how to identify students' CT applications and practices in a PBL learning environment for teachers and practitioners in terms of assessing their CT integration (e.g., Yang et al., 2018; Yang, Snelson &amp; Feng, under review).</p>\n<p>Our STEM+C project has achieved the following broader impacts. First, the project provided an eight-week opportunity to more than 140, 4<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade students, from seven Title I schools served by community centers who otherwise would not have had the opportunity to access a high quality PBL-guided STEM+CT curriculum designed by an interdisciplinary project team. Second, the project provided professional development on CT and PBL to 24 in-service teachers and more than 20 pre-service teachers via their facilitating a STEM+CT curriculum alongside the subject content experts including a retired NASA astronaut and STEM educational researchers. Third, more than half of the 24 in-service teachers have adopted the STEM+CT curriculum with the help of the project team and have introduced hundreds of students to CT and PBL- guided STEM learning in their classrooms or via after-school STEM clubs (e.g., Baek et al., 2021; Feng &amp; Yang, in press). Fourth, the PBL-guided STEM+CT curriculum has been publicly available online via the project's website, and has been reviewed and partially adopted by some teachers in New Jersey and Arkansas as far as the project primary investigator (PI) has known. Additionally, the project has also contributed to STEM educational research in terms of infrastructure building. Via the community partnership with the Boise's Parks and Recreation Department and the Boise School District and its schools, the iterative process of designing the STEM+CT curriculum and its implementation has brought the higher STEM educational researchers and practitioners and teachers together in curriculum design and implementation as well as research. The design, piloting and implementation process has provided those teachers and STEM practitioners for the first time an opportunity to take part in a rigorous research process toward evidence-based practice and curriculum design. As one of the participating teachers has put it, \"Now, I know what STEM means. It's not just giving students some materials to keep their hands busy. We have to purposely plan, evaluate [research] and revise it [lesson plan or curriculum].\"</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/23/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by:
