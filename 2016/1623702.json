 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Cyberlearning and Future Learning Technologies Program funds\r\nefforts that support envisioning the future of learning technologies\r\nand advance what we know about how people learn in technology-rich\r\nenvironments. Cyberlearning Exploration (EXP) Projects explore the\r\nviability of new kinds of learning technologies by designing and\r\nbuilding new kinds of learning technologies and studying their\r\npossibilities for fostering learning and challenges to using them\r\neffectively. Most online courseware helps teach facts and concepts,\r\nwhile a different type of online learning software called intelligent\r\ntutoring systems can effectively teach skills in a way that is\r\ntailored to each learner. Unfortunately, these two tools are rarely\r\nintegrated because of the expense and specialized expertise required\r\nto create intelligent tutors. This project will close this gap by\r\nbuilding and testing a new scalable technology that will allow\r\nteachers without years of specialized training to author adaptive\r\nonline courses that combine the best of both these approaches.  This\r\nscalable cyberlearning platform will provide students with effective\r\nonline instruction, provide learning engineers with an efficient\r\nauthoring environment to build adaptive online courses, and provide\r\nresearchers with a sharable corpus of big learning data that they can\r\nuse to develop and refine theories of how students learn in adaptive\r\nonline-course learning environments.\r\n\r\nThis project will build a web-browser-based authoring environment that\r\nsupports the creation cognitive tutors and their seamless integration\r\ninto online courses and will measure how well the resulting adaptive\r\nonline courses promote facets of student learning such as synergetic\r\ncompetency and engagement. The central hypotheses are: (1) that the\r\nSimStudent technology -- a machine-learning agent that learns\r\ncognitive skills from demonstration -- can be a practical authoring\r\ntool for cognitive tutors that can be easily embedded into online\r\ncourses; (2) that this technology can represent a tight connection\r\nbetween learners' procedural competency and conceptual competency by\r\ncombining knowledge-tracing (a standard method used by existing\r\ncognitive tutors) and text-mining (data-mining latent skills from\r\ntraditional online course instructions) into an innovative\r\nstudent-modeling technique; and (3) that adaptive online courses\r\ncreated with this technique can produce robust student learning by\r\npromoting connections between their procedural and conceptual\r\nunderstanding (synergetic competency). As part of the overall research\r\nprogram, the project will: (a) develop a genetic application\r\nprogramming interface (API) for an existing web-based authoring\r\ntechnology to build cognitive tutors for online course integration;\r\n(b) develop an adaptive instructional technology as a generic control\r\nmechanism for adaptive online courses; (c) build new adaptive online\r\ncourses on Open edX and also convert an existing OLI course into an\r\nadaptive online course; (d) conduct in-vivo studies using the adaptive\r\nonline courses to test their effectiveness; (e) test the efficacy of\r\nthe proposed adaptive online courses in supporting students to achieve\r\nthe aforementioned synergetic competency. Successful completion of the\r\nproject will yield the following expected outcomes: (i) a scalable\r\nonline course architecture with efficient authoring tools for building\r\ncognitive tutors and integrating them into online courses in order to\r\nmake those courses adaptive; (ii) a practical technique to identify\r\nrelationships between procedural competency and conceptual competency;\r\nand (iii) an expanded theory of how students learn with the adaptive\r\nonline course, and in particular of how students achieve robust\r\nlearning with synergetic competency.",
