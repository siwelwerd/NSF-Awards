A key challenge for practical implementation of distributed quantum network lies in the technical difficulty in realizing multifunctional integrated quantum photonic circuits that are not only able to perform diverse quantum functionalities, but are also able to share and exchange quantum information between disparate and/or physically separated parts of a network system. \r\nThe proposed research aims to address this challenge, by exploring and developing integrated hybrid quantum photonic circuits on the silicon carbide (SiC) platform for high-fidelity and energy-efficient quantum information processing, which interface seamlessly with fiber-optic communication links for secure communication and distribution of quantum information. The ultimate goal is to realize a versatile chip-scale multifunctional integrated hybrid quantum photonic processor with robust operation at room temperature that forms the fundamental building blocks to construct a scalable integrated quantum photonic interconnect. \r\nThe proposed research promises a transformative avenue towards integrated quantum photonics that may ultimately transform the complexity and capacity of quantum information processing for secure communication, metrology, sensing, and advanced computing. The proposed research is expected to result in a new class of device technologies with previously inaccessible attributes and merits that may eventually have profound commercial impact on the industrial sectors. The development of SiC photonics may open up a novel avenue for the roadmap of the recently installed American Institute for Manufacturing Integrated Photonics (AIM Photonics). Findings in the fascinating device physics and system integration will generate extraordinary educational materials and inspiration for education of students from K-12 to graduate students.  The team PIs have established strong records and sustained creative efforts in broadening the participation from underrepresented and economically disadvantageous groups. The PIs will incorporate the educational efforts with the educational workforce development of the AIM Photonics Academy.\r\nTechnical Description:  The proposed research aims to explore and develop a fully integrated scalable quantum photonic interconnect that consists of chip-scale integrated silicon carbide (SiC) quantum photonic processors functioning as localized quantum nodes for high-fidelity manipulation, processing, storage, and transduction of quantum states, which interface seamlessly with fiber-optic quantum channels for secure communication and distribution of quantum information between quantum nodes. The proposed research utilizes a design and fabrication methodology that recognizes and leverages the fact that outstanding material properties and unique defect characteristics of SiC, together with innovative device designs and advanced nanofabrication, offer a promising chip-scale platform for broad quantum photonic applications. With the synergetic research effort among a team of world-leading experts, we propose to carry out innovative device/circuit/system engineering to realize strong photon-defect and photon-photon interactions that would enable efficient generation and manipulation of photonic quantum states and scalable quantum bits, and chip-to-chip distribution of quantum information over fiber-optic communication links, aiming to realize a versatile chip-scale multifunctional integrated hybrid quantum photonic processor with robust operation at room temperature that forms the fundamental building blocks to construct a scalable integrated quantum photonic interconnect. The strong expertise and extensive experiences of our team position us uniquely for achieving this goal.",
