 "awd_abstract_narration": "Three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting technology is giving rise to new methods and innovation in multiple fields across the biomedical and biotechnological industries.  On-going progress is generating growth in the bioprinting market creating demands for new job skills in the near future.  To address industry needs, schools must ready themselves with the right tools and equipment to train next generation students.  Moreover, increased accessibility of technology in education can help to empower students and expand their scientific creativity.  However, current 3D bioprinting instrumentation are primarily designed for industry use and expensive.  Technical barriers further prohibit many schools from gaining access.  To truly democratize technology innovation for next generation scientists and engineers, a sustainable solution catered to the education market is necessary.  This SBIR Phase II project is aimed at addressing this opportunity gap and will create an affordable 3D bioprinting equipment and educational toolkit catered to high schools and colleges.  The proposed bioprinting equipment will be multi-functional so that teachers can use it for a variety of classroom applications.  In addition, the educational toolkit will include student-friendly software tools facilitating experiments in 3D bioprinting, bioreagent kits, and curriculum to support teachers in using the bioprinters in the classroom.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to create a highly functional and versatile bioprinting equipment and educational toolkit for the high school and college education market.  The motivation behind this work is to increase accessibility of new and cutting-edge tools to next generation students who will not only benefit from gaining industry-relevant skills they need in the near future but provide them with the opportunity to innovate.  The proposed multi-functional bioprinting equipment will facilitate increased hands-on learning activities in the classroom, a key component in learning science and practice engineering, and project-based learning.  To this end, the development of curriculum to support use of the 3D bioprinter is critical in manifesting adoption in the classroom.  From the hardware engineering perspective, the project will focus on engineering design to achieve integration of multiple functionalities in the proposed bioprinting equipment.  Software tools that facilitate design and creation of bio-experimentation, and evaluation of experimental results through imaging tools will be developed to support activities spanning across the entire bioprinting process.  Finally, bioreagent kits will be created to support consumable needs for the 3D bioprinter.",

This work involved the development of a bioprinting educational toolkit comprising of hardware, reagent kits and curriculum to support the use of bioprinting in a classroom. To this end, SE3D has successfully introduced 2 bioprinter platforms, r3bEL X and r3bEL mini, that would fit the needs of K9-16 schools. The r3bEL X bioprinter with multi-tool head functionality was an ideal and versatile platform for higher education institutions with a focus on research exploration whereas the r3bEL mini bioprinter with a simple design was ideal for training purposes especially for K9-12 schools. To support effective use of the hardware, SE3D developed 8 different bioprinting kits that paired with the curriculum to enable students to conduct a variety of experiments in biotechnology, green technology and biomaterials using the bioprinter. This curriculum developed is a high school curriculum that is NGSS-aligned and now recognized by the University of California Reagents as a ?g? elective course. These accomplishments represent a significant milestone for the STEM education community especially for teachers in the biotechnology and biomedical science fields, as they are now able to provide for the very first time, access to a cutting-edge tool with the support necessary to successfully implement technology in the classroom. SE3D?s r3bEL bioprinters and educational toolkit is the first of its kind to provide students especially at the high school level with access to bioprinting technology. In addition, SE3D?s online educational portal is providing students and teachers access to a wealth of resources in learning this new technology at the convenience of their locations, at any time.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 01/31/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Mayasari&nbsp;Lim</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1632042/1632042_10458844_1548995000395_r3bEL_mini--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1632042/1632042_10458844_1548995000395_r3bEL_mini--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"r3bEL mini bioprinter\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1632042/1632042_10458844_1548995000395_r3bEL_mini--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"r3bEL mini bioprinter\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Compact classroom bioprinter r3bEL mini</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">SE3D Inc.</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Mayasari&nbsp;Lim</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">r3bEL mini bioprinter</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1632042/1632042_10458844_1548995040138_r3bEL_X--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1632042/1632042_10458844_1548995040138_r3bEL_X--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"r3bEL X bioprinter\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1632042/1632042_10458844_1548995040138_r3bEL_X--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"r3bEL X bioprinter\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Research friendly desktop bioprinter</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">SE3D Inc.</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Mayasari&nbsp;Lim</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">r3bEL X bioprinter</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
