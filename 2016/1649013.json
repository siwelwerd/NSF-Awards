 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports international participant travel to a workshop to be held at the University of California, Santa Cruz, September 9-14, 2016. The workshop will bring together researchers who are studying the effects of contemporary developments in food production.  Throughout the world, a multitude of factors such as intellectual property laws, genetic engineering, soil health, water scarcity, climatic disruptions, governance and technological change are altering the food provisioning landscape. While each of these factors have been studied in isolation or in relation to one or two others, little is known about how they all come together and whether there are common patterns despite the diversity of societies, governance structures, and environments. This workshop aims to begin to fill that gap, with a particular focus on how the changes filter down to the local level. The workshop is important because it provides a holistic perspective across scales on issues that affect food security everywhere, including in the United States.\r\n\r\nThe workshop is organized around three themes: (1) regulatory systems; (2) local farming practices; and (3) farmer and owner participatory mechanisms. Workshop participants will prepare and circulate papers in advance. The four days of the workshop will be devoted to cumulative discussion, identifying common patterns and processes, and  identifying information gaps and future research needs. Findings from the research will be of interest to policy makers, as well as to researchers trying to understand how global trends affect food provisioning at local levels. The award also supports international research collaboration and therefore an improved learning experience for participating graduate students.",

The contributors pushed the boundaries of an institutional approach to examine paradoxes of private and public governance: the role of farmers in actively embracing the governance structures that came to control them, their role in dismantling or transforming cooperative structures into private corporations, the public relations strategies of multinational corporations and their attempts to divide and rule rural communities and cooperatives, the impact of private contracts that farmersvoluntarily entered into. The ethnographic details showed the limits of the laws, regulations and&nbsp;certifications, their paradoxes, non-enforcements, the spaces of subborn refusal. We considered the question: is there a space outside state and markets, a space of commons, of cooperation or solidarity? Participants then looked at the tensions and contradictions within these spaces, at&nbsp;their overlapping boundaries. The third day focused on soils and their relationships with humans from different perspectives: from natural science, big data, diverses communities of soil organisms, nationalist nativist farmers practicing natural farming. We examined the diverse forms of knowledge and knowing linked to soils, clean science versus messy science, big data accumulated about soils, through GPS systems and computers mounted on farm equipment. The questions we discussed concerned how new agricultural data would be used, who are its curators, how is it traded? The notion of the techno-soil, the abstracted soil, clashes with other forms of problematic attachment, where the care for the soil is linked to nationalist and nativist sentiment.

We looked at the complex interrelationship of dependence that control over seed establishes, when landlords gift high yielding varieties to their tenants, when husbands claim control over seeds that women selected and of course when intellectual property rights that lay dormant are suddenly enforced or seed standards become \"second nature\".
