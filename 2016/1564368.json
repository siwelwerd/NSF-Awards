 "awd_abstract_narration": "Understanding scientific and technical progress requires measures of both the rate and direction of resources directed to innovative efforts and the outputs produced.  This project leverages advances in computational power to map the evolution of research fields based on researchers? project portfolios in idea spaces.  The research takes advantages of shocks, such as changes in policies and research costs, to use empirical research techniques to understand the factors that affect the directions into which science and technology evolve.  This work has important implications for understanding the rate and direction of technological change.  \r\n \r\nSpecifically, the project uses techniques based on machine learning and natural language processing that measure the incidence and configuration of keywords in published research to quantify the similarity of groups of such articles to define idea space and to subsequently measure the ways in which idea space evolve in response to shocks in research costs and public policies. The research applies these techniques to three contexts: (a) how changes in the costs of research materials affect research trajectories in motion-sensing technology, (b) how researchers in quantum computing change their project portfolios in response to a controversial approach that differs from an established research paradigm; and (c) how pharmaceutical firm research trajectories change in response to news about rivals' drug discovery projects.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIn this project, we have developed a series of techniques, including machine learning and Natural Language Processing tools, to analyze drivers of the direction of innovation and we have applied these to a number of research contexts.  We have conducted mainly causal analyses that measure the ways in which innovation evolves in response to shocks in automation, information, and public policies.  To do this, we have leveraged advances in computing power and empirical research techniques that enable us to map the evolution of research fields and researchers\u2019 project portfolios in \"ideas space\" and pharmaceutical firms\u2019 drug development research trajectories.\n\n \n\nThe empirical analyses in our projects are enabled by our having developed text-based tools that enable researchers to document changes in the direction of innovation.  One of these builds upon an unassisted machine learning technique, Hierarchical Dirichlet Process (HDP), which flexibly generates categories from a corpus of text and enables calculations of the distance and movement in ideas space.  A second involves using a metric known as a \"Tanimoto score\" or \"Jaccard coefficient,\" which reflects the chemical similarity of molecules in order to document biopharmaceutical firms\u2019 research directions and which has been used by firms to inform investment choices.\n\n \n\nWe use these tools to make a number of contributions to research on the rate and direction of innovation.  First, we document that the automation of research tasks that previously required substantial human labor presents opportunities for scientists to expand their research portfolios and for policymakers to accelerate the rate and broaden the direction of knowledge accumulation.
