 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Geoscientist Development (GEODE) Program: Recruiting and Engaging the Future Geoscience Workforce is a program designed to draw high school and community college students in Riverside County, CA into geoscience majors and careers. This program represents a collaboration between the University of California, Riverside (UCR), Riverside Community College (RCC), and the Riverside Unified School District (RUSD), with engagement opportunities for additional community colleges and public school districts in the region. The American Geosciences Institute predicts that the geoscience workforce faces a potential shortfall of ~135,000 by the year 2020 unless recruitment rates are improved. The GEODE Program addresses this potential shortfall by focusing recruitment on communities that are historically underrepresented in the geosciences and thus represent an untapped pool of intellectual capital. Riverside County, located east of Los Angeles County in Southern California, is densely populated (2.3 million), highly diverse (47.4% Hispanic), and home to a wide range of geoscience career opportunities, and is therefore an ideal region in which to recruit new geoscientists.\r\n\r\nThe GEODE Program has two goals: (1) To create a range of programs designed to increase the number of underrepresented minority students in the geosciences and successfully usher them into the geoscience workforce, and (2) To test the efficacy of these programs in order to determine which programs should be used to increase recruitment and retention of new geoscientists from underrepresented minorities in other regions and by other institutions. The GEODE Program is increasing the recruitment and retention of a highly diverse and academically prepared workforce by increasing awareness of career opportunities in the geosciences and improving students' transitions through three critical educational junctures: (1) High School to College (2-Year and 4-Year), (2) Community College to University, and (3) University to Workforce. At each critical juncture, the GEODE Program is creating opportunities for students to be exposed to the wonders of the natural world through a multitude of field and research experiences.  The program also provides students with mentors, academic support and professional development programs to ensure retention and success. By leveraging the success of existing support programs at UCR for science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) students from underrepresented backgrounds, the GEODE Program is creating a geoscience network throughout its collaborating institutions.",

This shortfall, though driven primarily by high rates of retirement, is also compounded by our field's failure to successfully recruit young scientists from historically underrepresented communities, which are the fastest growing communities in nation. The &ldquo;Geoscientist Development (GEODE): Recruiting and Engaging the Future Geoscience Workforce&rdquo; program was designed to draw high school and community college students from severely underserved and historically underrepresented communities in Riverside County, CA into geoscience majors and careers.&nbsp;&nbsp;Riverside County is the ideal region in which to launch a geoscientist recruitment program such as the GEODE Program because of the highly diverse pool of students in the region and the proven success of the University of California, Riverside in recruiting and educating STEM students of color.

This additional focus on not just teaching our undergraduates geology but also helping them be better prepared for working in the field will have both current and future impacts on the success of our students.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The most important outcome of this grant is a significant increase in the number and diversity of undergraduate geology majors at UCR.&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, a considerable number of interns transferred to UCR or other four year colleges or universities and a number of the high school students involved in the program went on to study geology in college. Because the demographics of the Inland Empire in Southern California reflect the future of our nation, the success of the GEODE Program can be considered as a pilot program for future engagement and recruitment programs across the nation. Furthermore, the GEODE Program impacted thousands of high school, community college and university students, and while not all of these students will ultimately pursue a career in the discipline, all of them were introduced to the geosciences. The GEODE Program will increase understanding and awareness of some of the most important scientific issues facing society today: global climate change, earthquakes and natural hazards, mass extinctions and the history of life.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 11/11/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Mary&nbsp;L&nbsp;Droser</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1600284/1600284_10442573_1668209688051_DVbadwater--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1600284/1600284_10442573_1668209688051_DVbadwater--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"High School students at Badwater, DV\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1600284/1600284_10442573_1668209688051_DVbadwater--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"High School students at Badwater, DV\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">High School students at Badwater, Death Valley learning about evaporation and salts</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Mary Droser</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Mary&nbsp;L&nbsp;Droser</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">High School students at Badwater, DV</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1600284/1600284_10442573_1668209769717_DVGEODE--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1600284/1600284_10442573_1668209769717_DVGEODE--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"hiking to Zabriskie Point\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1600284/1600284_10442573_1668209769717_DVGEODE--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"hiking to Zabriskie Point\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Students hiking up to Zabriskie Point in Death Valley</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Mary Droser</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Mary&nbsp;L&nbsp;Droser</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">hiking to Zabriskie Point</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1600284/1600284_10442573_1668211091757_GEODE-Bridget,SophiaandGwynnie--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1600284/1600284_10442573_1668211091757_GEODE-Bridget,SophiaandGwynnie--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"GEODE interns working in the lab\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1600284/1600284_10442573_1668211091757_GEODE-Bridget,SophiaandGwynnie--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"GEODE interns working in the lab\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Interns Sophia Bautista and Gwynnie Hernandez working with graduate student Bridget Kelly examining what oyster growth can tell us about climate change.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Chrissy Hall</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Mary&nbsp;L&nbsp;Droser</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">GEODE interns working in the lab</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",

These trips introduced students to the general field of geology from the science of earthquakes to career potential.  Many students had never camped or spent any significant time outside.  Over 100 students participated each year. \n \nGEODE also worked to establish closer relationships between UC Riverside and our local community colleges.  Over the period of this grant, geology classes and geology clubs of five different community colleges were visited each year, most several times a year. During these visits, topics discussed included 1) the value of a 4-year degree, 2) transferring to University of California campuses (what classes were needed), and 3) jobs in geology and related sciences.   UCR transfers from 2YC led these conversations where possible.   Over the course of this grant, GEODE personnel spoke to over 3000 2YC students.  Additionally, over 20 Riverside Community College and Chaffey college students were research interns at UCR.  Many of these interns transferred to UCR.  \n \nHighlights of activities developed for our undergraduates at the University of California, Riverside, include a full year (three quarters) undergraduate development course that is now is permanently on the books.  This class is open to all majors of any year and students are encouraged to take this one credit class every year for at least, one quarter.  In the fall, this class focuses on developing a CV, relevant coursework for local job opportunities, California Professional Geologist certificate, NSF GRFP applications etc.  During Winter and Spring quarter, students are connected with professional geoscientists from various disciplines within the overall Geosciences.
