This conference draws on the expertise of a wide range of organizations, professional associations, K-20+, community based organizations, industry and museums.  The intent is to strengthen the network among participants and leverage learning on how to engage youth in the biosciences.\r\n\r\nThe results of this first conference will be a white paper that will be disseminated to several professional societies that outlines a backbone infrastructure for addressing both short-term and longer-term aspects of an NSF INCLUDES alliance centered on bioengineering, biomechanics, biomedical engineering and biomaterials.",
