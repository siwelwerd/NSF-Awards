It will include ten researchers from universities in Kansas and West Virginia with expertise in energy and water treatment technologies, natural resources management, and aquatic ecology.  Unconventional oil and gas has become an increasingly significant industry in the United States, including in Kansas and West Virginia, motivating efforts to minimize the associated environmental impacts. This provides an opportunity for cross-regional collaborations with the potential for broader national impacts.  The project?s work will focus on minimizing freshwater use and wastewater production in oil and gas recovery, the treatment of produced water for beneficial reuse and safe disposal, and understanding the impacts of oil and gas exploration on aquatic ecosystems.  The research focus aligns with national priorities to develop more sustainable energy and water systems.  The project will also support the recruitments and development of diverse early-career faculty and will develop career-focused curriculum in water and energy systems at the participating institutions.\r\n\r\nTechnical Description \r\nThe research team will conduct several studies related to the use of water in unconventional oil and gas production.  Polyelectrolyte-stabilized carbon dioxide foams will be examined as alternative hydraulic fracturing fluids that will reduce the demand for freshwater resources in oil and gas production.  An improved approach for reservoir pressure management will be examined that balances deep-aquifer produced water injection with brine withdrawals, with the goal of reducing induced seismicity.  New methods will be investigated to effectively treat produced water for reuse and/or safe disposal.  Treatments methods to be studied include polyelectrolyte complexes to remove scale-forming cations, biodegradation of organic contaminants using fluidized aerobic granules, and removal of organics using microbial desalination cells.  Finally, the impacts of oil and gas production on aquatic ecosystems will be studied to understand the capacity of these ecosystems to sustain development.",

Extracting oil and gas from the ground can also produce large quantities of wastewater- an average of 10 barrels of water per barrel of oil in the United States as a whole. This wastewater, known as produced water, contains dissolved salts, hydrocarbons, metals and other compounds potentially dangerous to human health and the environment. Because of its poor quality and large volume, disposal of produced water can create risks to the environment. Therefore, finding ways to treat produced water and reclaim it for agricultural, industrial, or municipal use solves two problems at the same time by reducing the impacts of continued oil and gas production on human health and the environment while increasing fresh water availability.</p>\n<p>The goals of this five-year project (Improving Water Management, Treatment and Recovery and Oil and Gas Production) were to reduce freshwater use and wastewater production during oil and gas development, develop new methods for produced water treatment, and understand the impacts of oil and gas production on streams in Appalachia. This project was conducted by researchers at the University of Kansas and West Virginia University. These researchers combined methods and ideas from multiple different academic areas (Engineering, Geology, Chemistry, and Wildlife and Fisheries Management) to produce research outcomes and tools that will improve how the oil and gas industry manages, treats, and reuses or disposes of this wastewater.</p>\n<p><strong>Intellectual merit: </strong></p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>We developed two methods for improving oil extraction while reducing freshwater use. The first uses a carbon dioxide foam mixed with nanoparticles that behaves like a liquid at high pressures, releasing trapped oil and storing excess CO<sub>2</sub> in the rock. The second method takes produced water with salt content similar to seawater and uses it to recover oil from formations with much higher salt content. This reduces the total amount of produced water created per barrel of oil.</p>\n<p>We also developed new treatment methods to clean produced water to make it usable for other applications by removing residual hydrocarbons, scale-forming cations, and toxic elements. Removal of harmful and scale-forming elements such as strontium and barium has been assessed using several treatment approaches. The most promising method utilizes electrodialysis for desalination, also producing a high-pH solution that can be recovered for softening of the produced water, reducing the chemicals required for treatment.&nbsp; For hydrocarbons and other organic contaminants, we have adapted biological treatment technologies from wastewater treatment to develop bioreactors able to perform well while treating highly saline produced waters. These bioreactors use a combination of activated carbon and microbial biofilms to remove contaminants under changing produced water compositions. In addition, an electro-coagulation treatment process has shown promise for removing boron, an element that can harm crops and limit the ability to reuse produced water for irrigation.</p>\n<p>We have also assessed the environmental impact of produced water generation and reuse.
