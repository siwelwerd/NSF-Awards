 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research Initiation Awards provide support for junior and mid-career faculty at Historically Black Colleges and Universities who are building new research programs or redirecting and rebuilding existing research programs. It is expected that the award helps to further the faculty member's research capability and effectiveness, improves research and teaching at his home institution, and involves undergraduate students in research experiences.  The award to Virginia State University has potential broader impact in a number of areas. The goal of the project is to develop new variational methods to investigate orbits of unusual star system, such as quadruple star systems. New teaching materials with advanced mathematical tools, such as symbolic computation, will be developed in the field of celestial mechanics. This project will also enhance the research experience and training of undergraduate students at Virginia State University. \r\n\r\nThis project seeks mathematical solutions to some questions on the central configurations, the new variational method with Structural Prescribed Boundary Conditions (SPBC) and the existence of some new periodic orbits in celestial mechanics.  The Star Pentagon choreography has been numerically discovered and theoretically proven by the variational method in the Newtonian planar four-body problem. The project now aims to build a complete mathematical and computational framework for the new variational method with SPBC for this system. General criteria will be established for SPBC which can generate classical solutions without singularities.\r\n\r\nThe second goal of this project is to use the variational method with SPBC to search for new periodic solutions.  The application of the method to search for periodic or quasi-periodic solutions to systems with three unequal masses was inspired by the 2011 discovery of the existence of a planet with two stars. The numerical solutions may guide the understanding of why such an unusual system exists. These computational techniques can then be applied to search for periodic and quasi-periodic solutions for any n-body problem. The results in developing and applying the new methods promise exciting examples and practical techniques to advance the understanding of the dynamical behavior in celestial mechanics.",

The N-body problem concerns the motion of celestial bodies such as sun, earth, and moon etc., which is governed by a system of second order differential equations. Instead of considering the whole path in some loop space with some topological or geometric symmetric constrains, we consider the boundary value problem with appropriate boundary configurations. A two-step minimizing process is proposed to find some appropriate pieces of orbits which are proven to be assembled out to a periodic solution (or a quasi-periodic solution). The finding of star pentagon choreographic solution is a significant and major contribution to the ken of celestial mechanics in particular and physics in general. The analytical existence of the star pentagon choreographic and other periodic solutions and their numerically determined linear stability ends the suspicion that the only linearly stable choreographic periodic solution in the N-&shy;Body problem was the Moore-&shy;Montgomery-&shy;Chenciner figure eight orbit in the equal mass planar three &shy;body problem. It opens the possibility that linearly stable choreographic periodic solutions may be more the norm than the exception in the N&shy;-Body problem.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The variational method with SPBC is extended to study the star pentagon solutions with two-pairs of equal masses. The fact that the unequal mass variants of the stable start pentagon seem to be just as stable as the basic equal mass choreography makes the beautiful star pentagon orbit all the more remarkable. This method is also used to discover and classify the periodic solutions in planar four-body problem.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The variational method with SPBC is further developed to study the long standing open problem: existence of Broucke-Henon orbit (1975), which gave a new way to handle the variational method over a domain with boundaries.&nbsp;A general coercivity of the Lagrangian action functional under SPBC in the N-body problem is proved. Under an appropriate topological constraint, the action minimizer must be either the Schubart orbit or the Broucke-Henon orbit. One of the main challenges is to prove that the Schubart orbit coincides with the action minimizer connecting a collinear configuration with a binary collision and an isosceles configuration. A new geometric property of the action minimizer is introduced to overcome this challenge.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The most exciting part of this grant is to provide an opportunity for the PI to work closely with students and to watch their progress in research projects. With the support of this grant and other financial resources, the PI and his collaborators had run three summer undergraduate research programs in the grant period. Thirty-four undergraduate students and one high school student participated in the summer program and some of them continued to work in the academic year. &nbsp;Five students received external travel awards to present their research in a national conference and one student receive an oral presentation award. Fourteen projects are conducted in applied mathematics including N-body problem, infectious disease model (Ebola 2014-2015), food chain model, and detection of moving objects. Every student submitted a final written research paper and gave an oral/poster presentation. One paper written sole by students was submitted to a journal for publication but the second revision was rejected. Three papers coauthored with undergraduate students are in progress. In summer 2015 and 2016, the PI had co-organized a Summer Undergraduate Research Mini Joint Conference VSU and CWM. All summer research students in those two years gave an oral presentation in the conference.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The PI discovered a new phenomenon: the existence of super central configurations in the collinear three-body and four-body problem. Central configurations play a particularly &ldquo;central&rdquo; role in the study of the Newtonian n-body problem. With the support of this grant and other financial resources, some talent undergraduate students and a high school student are recruited as research assistants and into an intensive summer undergraduate research program in 2017. Students work in a team on the inverse problem of central configurations and super central configurations in the collinear five-body problem. &nbsp;In general, we identify regions in the configuration space where it is possible to choose positive masses that will make the configuration central. In the symmetric case, it is surprise that any symmetric configuration could be a central configuration for some positive masses, which is different from the symmetric case for the collinear 4-body central configurations.&nbsp;Mathematical software Geogebra, Maple, and SageMath have been used to compute and plot the regions. An important property of non-existence of super central configurations is discovered in the study of super central configurations in collinear five-body problem. This property could be extended to the general collinear N-body problem. A group of students study the stacked central configurations for 6-body problem which consists of two equilateral triangles.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 09/28/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Zhifu&nbsp;Xie</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1661203/1661203_10314298_1506569064636_AM5_3--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1661203/1661203_10314298_1506569064636_AM5_3--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Star Pentagon Solution\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1661203/1661203_10314298_1506569064636_AM5_3--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Star Pentagon Solution\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Star pentagon orbit for 4-body equal mass problem</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Zhifu Xie</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Zhifu&nbsp;Xie</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Star Pentagon Solution</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1661203/1661203_10314298_1506608442387_Vm1_5A4f5--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1661203/1661203_10314298_1506608442387_Vm1_5A4f5--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Star Pentagon Orbit with Two Pair of Equal Masses\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1661203/1661203_10314298_1506608442387_Vm1_5A4f5--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Star Pentagon Orbit with Two Pair of Equal Masses\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The mass ratio is 1:1.5 and orbit is linearly stable.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Zhifu Xie</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Zhifu&nbsp;Xie</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Star Pentagon Orbit with Two Pair of Equal Masses</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1661203/1661203_10314298_1506608579559_Vm1A6f7--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1661203/1661203_10314298_1506608579559_Vm1A6f7--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Stable Choreographic Orbit\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1661203/1661203_10314298_1506608579559_Vm1A6f7--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Stable Choreographic Orbit\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Stable Choreographic Orbit of four-body problem with equal mass.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Zhifu Xie</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Zhifu&nbsp;Xie</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Stable Choreographic Orbit</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
