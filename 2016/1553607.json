 "awd_abstract_narration": "NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: Portland cement manufacturing accounts for 5-8% of global anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions, and with concrete utilization set to double over the next few decades there is a pressing need for sustainable concrete alternatives. One such alternative is alkali-activated materials (AAMs), a class of cement whose manufacture emits less carbon dioxide than Portland cement. However, the long term durability of new cementitious materials must be understood and optimized prior to employment in the construction industry. This project investigates the chemical reactions that occur during degradation of AAMs due to exposure to atmospheric carbon dioxide, a form of degradation that plagues both Portland cement and new cementitious materials. The ability to arrest the degradation reaction(s) is being explored by exploiting the stabilizing effect of magnesium on the carbonate-based reaction products (amorphous calcium carbonate). The development of durable and sustainable cementitious materials will lead to the implementation of sustainable products in residential and commercial construction industry, which will significantly reduce the associated carbon dioxide emissions. The project promotes and encourages underrepresented minorities and women in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) through outreach components centered on the new applied science/engineering curriculum that is being instituted in high schools in New Jersey.\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL DETAILS: This project will provide a deep understanding of the complex phase formation processes that occur during carbonation-induced degradation of slag-based AAM pastes. Key objectives include (i) obtaining a fundamental understanding of the role of magnesium in stabilizing the precipitated amorphous carbonate phase and (ii) determining the short and long-term stability of the disordered phases, including calcium-(sodium)-alumino-silicate-hydrate gel and amorphous carbonates. Highly carbonation-resistant slag-based AAMs are being developed through this research, which have the potential to supplant existing cement technologies. To obtain this understanding a suite of state-of-the-art experimental techniques are being used, including training the next generation of scientists (undergraduate and graduate students) in cutting-edge research. Techniques include: micron-resolved atomic structural information obtained using X-ray pair distribution function analysis combined with micro-tomography, nanoscale elemental mapping using nano-fluorescence, X-ray diffraction, infrared spectroscopy, thermal analysis and synchrotron X-ray absorption fine structure.",

Increased resistance to accelerated carbonation (resistance to CO<sub>2</sub>-induced degradation in CO<sub>2</sub>-rich environments) is required for concrete that will be used in emerging CO<sub>2</sub>-focused industries such as geological carbon sequestration. As part of the project, a suite of materials characterization techniques was employed to uncover the atomic, nanoscale and microstructural features of slag-based AAMs before and after exposure to concentrated levels of CO<sub>2</sub>, including spatially resolved pair distribution function analysis combined with X-ray computed microtomography (PDF-CT) and nano-X-ray fluorescence (nano-XRF). Nano-XRF showed that the low MgO slag-based AAM (slag with 7% MgO) suffered from more extensive decalcification of the binder gel phase (removal of calcium atoms) due to CO<sub>2</sub> exposure compared with the high MgO counterpart (slag with 13% MgO), and thus the low MgO slag-based AAM had a lower degree of carbonation resistance. Concurrently it was found using nano-XRF that, for both slag types (low and high MgO content), silicon atoms were incorporated into the calcium carbonate regions that formed during exposure to elevated levels of CO<sub>2</sub>. From PDF-CT the crystallinity of the calcium carbonate regions was quantified, where the low MgO slag-based AAM exposed to CO<sub>2</sub> possessed a higher relative amount of (micro)crystalline carbonates than the high MgO counterpart, and a larger ?nanocrystallite? size of 1.2 nm compared with 1.1 nm for the high MgO slag-based AAM. Hence, PDF-CT explicitly showed that high MgO slag-based AAM formed more disordered calcium carbonate phases after exposure to accelerated carbonation conditions than low MgO slag-based AAM. As part of the research a suite of data analysis approaches were employed and evaluated for PDF-CT and nano-XRF, where logic tree analysis, least-squares refinement, and hierarchical cluster analysis were found to be effective at analyzing PDF-CT data, while for nano-XRF careful correction of the data for self-absorption was found to be necessary.</p>\n<p>From these findings we propose an updated mechanism for the carbonation resistance of slag-based AAMs in elevated CO<sub>2</sub> environments. For a more resistant slag-based AAM, both magnesium (originally from slag) and silica (from the activator) are incorporated into an amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC) phase that initially forms upon carbonation, which stabilize this amorphous phase and hinder subsequent crystallization. The pore solution within the cement-based material then maintains a relatively high calcium concentration because it is in equilibrium with the higher energy metastable ACC rather than the most stable crystalline polymorph, calcite. This high calcium concentration reduces the driving force for decalcification of the binder gel phase (removal of calcium) during carbonation, thereby reducing the overall extent of CO<sub>2</sub>-induced degradation. As part of the project, the use of external sources of MgO in low-MgO slag-based AAM was explored as a means to increase carbonation resistance. From the MgO sources tested (MgO, Mg(OH)<sub>2</sub>, and MgCO<sub>3</sub>) all were generally found to be ineffective compared with high-MgO slag system, although the MgCO<sub>3</sub> addition did show a slight improvement compared with the neat low-MgO slag system.</p>\n<p>Education formed an integral component of this project, where four graduate students (three female) and two undergraduate students (both female) were involved with the day-to-day research.

Furthermore, the project involved development and dissemination of undergraduate/high school teaching modules on materials for sustainability (e.g., introduction to climate change, solar energy, energy efficient buildings, carbon capture and storage, electrochemical energy storage, water purification, and life cycle assessment).
