 "awd_abstract_narration": "This RCN-UBE project will investigate the function of unknown genes in the model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Baker's or Brewer's yeast). The genome of this yeast was sequenced 20 years ago, yet nearly 10% of the genes have no assigned function; these genes are called orphan genes. Determining the function of the complete set of genes in this simple model organism will meaningfully contribute to the understanding of how cells function. The goal of the Yeast Orphan Gene Project is to organize a consortium of undergraduate student researchers and faculty to coordinate resources and design experimental strategies to assign functions to orphan genes in yeast.\r\n\r\nBased on analysis of available bioinformatics data sets, students will design and execute experiments for defining gene function. The network will facilitate collaboration between students at different institutions so that students can share strategies and technique solutions while developing experience in on-line collaborations. Scientifically, the project will contribute to a more detailed understanding of the biology of yeast and the structure of the yeast genome. Ultimately, the yeast orphan gene project aims to use the process of determining orphan gene function as a tool to teach undergraduate students key concepts in bioinformatics, genomics, molecular biology, and genetics and impart valuable experience in scientific collaboration and leadership. The network will provide tools for faculty to expand research experience for undergraduates and incorporate research experiences into undergraduate courses. It will also be a mechanism to distribute a tested model of an authentic course-based research experience to a diverse set of institutions by providing workshop and assessment support. Through sharing of resources, the network will develop a model for online course modules to be shared among institutions. The networking activities will expand the expertise of faculty, as well as provide undergraduates tools and resources for collaboration.\r\n\r\nThis project is being jointly funded by the Directorate for Biological Sciences and the Directorate for Education and Human Resources, Division of Undergraduate Education as part of their efforts to address the challenges posed in Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology Education: A Call to Action (http://visionandchange/finalreport/).",

The study of genes and proteins in yeast have led to significant discoveries and has increased our understanding of how cells function, including how cells divide and become cancerous, how proteins are sorted by cells, and how cells regulate when genes are turned on and off. Yet, despite decades of intense study by scores of scientists, nearly 10% of the genes in yeast are still of unknown function. The ORFan gene project introduces undergraduate students to the process of science, as students in undergraduate courses explore the available yeast resources to study a selected gene of unknown function. The federally funded <em>Saccharomyces</em> genome database (SGD) pulls together, in one resource, the results of thousands of yeast experiments. The network has developed a series of bioinformatic modules to guide students through the process of ?mining? the rich field of bioinformatic data available through SGD to gather clues and formulate hypotheses about the function of their selected uncharacterized yeast gene. Students are then taught the laboratory techniques needed to go to the lab bench and test their hypotheses.</p>\n<p>The Yeast ORFan Gene Project network provided funding for in-person workshops for over 80 undergraduate teaching faculty, accompanied by undergraduate students, from institutions across the US to learn modules for the classroom, including bioinformatics and using molecular tools to alter the yeast genome. Faculty members, from community colleges to large universities, used this content to develop courses that have trained thousands of undergraduate students to understand gene function and to perform gene editing in yeast. Assessment data collected over the six years of the grant shows that students not only gain knowledge about bioinformatic tools and how gene functions are categorized; students also gained confidence in thinking independently, collecting and analyzing data and their ability to use computer modeling in studying gene processes. The Yeast ORFan Gene Project network, with currently over 100 members, is successfully sustainably teaching students the concepts and skills needed to become effective scientific researchers.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/26/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Jill&nbsp;B&nbsp;Keeney</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1624174/1624174_10449976_1671720393593_IMG_2971--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1624174/1624174_10449976_1671720393593_IMG_2971--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Yeast ORFan workshop 2\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1624174/1624174_10449976_1671720393593_IMG_2971--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Yeast ORFan workshop 2\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A workshop participate plates yeast cells to perti dishes with different types of selective media to test growth conditions of varying strains of yeast</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Juniata College</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Jill&nbsp;B&nbsp;Keeney</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Yeast ORFan workshop 2</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1624174/1624174_10449976_1671719651214_spotassay--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1624174/1624174_10449976_1671719651214_spotassay--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Yeast growth assay\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1624174/1624174_10449976_1671719651214_spotassay--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Yeast growth assay\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">wild type yeast and yeast cells with an ORFan deleted plated on media containing copper to assay growth (spot assay)</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Jill Keeney</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Jill&nbsp;B&nbsp;Keeney</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Yeast growth assay</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1624174/1624174_10449976_1671720612540_IMG_3345--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1624174/1624174_10449976_1671720612540_IMG_3345--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Yeast ORFan project workshop\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1624174/1624174_10449976_1671720612540_IMG_3345--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Yeast ORFan project workshop\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A faculty member and undergraduate student work together to plate yeast strains at an ORFan workshop</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Jill Keeney</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Jill&nbsp;B&nbsp;Keeney</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Yeast ORFan project workshop</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1624174/1624174_10449976_1671719244150_MaryMillerstrainwithcalcofluor--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1624174/1624174_10449976_1671719244150_MaryMillerstrainwithcalcofluor--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"yeast cell fluorescence microscopy\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1624174/1624174_10449976_1671719244150_MaryMillerstrainwithcalcofluor--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"yeast cell fluorescence microscopy\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A yeast cell visialized wth fluoresence microscopy.
