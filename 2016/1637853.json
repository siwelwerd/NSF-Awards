 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dexterous manipulation is a Grand Challenge in robotics today.   Dexterity is required for robots working in the home, in space, for medical applications, disaster scenarios, and flexible manufacturing.    Robots in these environments must be able to maneuver, lift, and handle objects, use them as tools, and competently transfer objects from one secure hold to another in a wide variety of uncertain situations.   Such operations are very difficult for robots and present a barrier to their wider adoption.    Recent advances in rapid prototyping and digital manufacturing have made it possible to design, manufacture, and test custom robot manipulators at a very rapid pace.    One aim of this project is to explore and understand how these new technologies may be used to design a radically different type of robot manipulator that is customized for dexterous maneuvers.  A second aim of the project is to increase our fundamental understanding of dexterity itself.   The end goal is to enable robots to live up to their potential. In so doing, robots will begin to play an increasingly important role in our daily lives, and will inspire young students to prepare for, and pursue STEM careers.\r\n\r\nThe key research goal of this project is to formalize novel mathematical models and computational approaches to co-design mechanical structures and control policies for dexterous robotic manipulation tasks.   Through this approach, control policies can be made significantly simpler, and mechanical features such as joint stops and compliance can passively improve the robustness of the manipulation tasks while reducing sensing and actuation requirements. Grasp nets, which capture specific families of manipulation capabilities observed in human performances, focus the efforts of this project and guide the design processes that are developed.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOne of the grand challenges of robotics is dexterous manipulation.    Truly dexterous manipulators will make it possible for us to employ robots in many applications that can improve our quality of life but are not possible today;  think of robots as first responders in disaster scenarios, working alongside us for home health care, helping us to communicate remotely, and providing a protective and restorative role in our environment.    Dexterous manipulators can contribute to more flexible, custom manufacturing.   They can serve as prosthetic devices for those who have lost limbs or limb function.  \n\nThe goal of this project was to develop a pipeline for creating custom dexterous robot hands to perform specific sets of tasks.    The main insight is that much of the \"intelligence\" of the hand can be built into its form and function, and that its form and function can be exactly customized if it is known ahead of time what a specific hand should do.\n\nThe primary project outcome was an optimization framework for designing hand topologies best suited for manipulation tasks given high level objectives as input.   Utilizing this framework, custom hand designs can be created based on high level user input alone.     For example, a user can simply specify a collection of in-hand manipulations to be achieved with a collection of objects and the algorithm will produce a customized hand to perform exactly those tasks, including specifying number of fingers, placement of fingers on the palm, joints per finger, location of joint axes, and trajectories and/or control algorithms for task execution.   The resulting hand design can be 3D printed, assembled, and controlled to perform the desired tasks.\n\n More specifically, this project outcome utilizes a mixed discrete / continuous optimization framework for bottom-up hand design from a collection of input tasks.   The discrete portion of the optimization selects parameters such as number of fingers, number of joints, number of actuators, etc., and the continuous optimization tunes continuous elements such as link lengths and control parameters.    The algorithm has been used to successfully create a wide variety of hand designs for varied tasks, as shown in the accompanying figures.   It has been extended using domain randomization to ensure robustness and improved translation from simulation to the real world.    Elements such as joint limits are shown to produce improved robustness in some designs.\n\nA second major project outcome is the introduction of novel fully soft foam robots actuated by tendons routed through a fabric glove. Because these hands are constructed only of foam, they are lightweight and compliant.   Simple molding and casting techniques ensure accessibility.  They are also extremely low cost and have been shown to perform reliably through the course of a year's travel, demonstration and frequent operation.  Tendons can be routed anywhere along the surface of the hand, allowing for complex families of deformations and facilitating dexterous in-hand manipulation.  The project demonstrates the capability of foam hands by showing power and precision grasps and in-hand dexterous manipulations on several different robot hand geometries.\n\n Intellectual Merit:   (1) Novel optimization algorithms for robot hand design utilize a mixed discrete / continuous search process to create optimal robot hands bottom-up from a description of the desired tasks.   (2) Experiments demonstrating that techniques including domain randomization and joint limits can make the resulting designs robust to uncertainties.   (3) A novel type of robotic hand made of solid foam and actuated by tendons, which is demonstrated to be accessible to manufacture, extremely customizable, highly dexterous, and low cost.\n\nBroader Impact:   Taken together, these outcomes push forward the ability to manufacture accessible, low-cost dexterous robotic hands and to optimize these hand designs with specific manipulation goals in mind.   These results contribute to ubiquitous dexterous manipulation capability, such that robots in the home, workplace, disaster scenarios, prosthetics can all have dexterity designed in from the concept stage.    Areas of broader impact include personal robots that can eventually manipulate objects in much the way people do, robots that can actively assist people in health care, more realistic and functional prosthetic hands, and robots that can be teleoperated more naturally to enable remote telecommunication, remote machine operation, remote surgery, or disaster response.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/08/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Nancy S Pollard"
