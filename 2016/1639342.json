This project will identify potential interventions for reducing household FEW consumption, test options in participating households in two communities, and collect data to develop new environmental impact models. It will also identify household consumption behavior and cost-effective interventions to reduce FEW resource use. Research insights can be applied to increase the well-being of individuals at the household level, improve FEW resource security, reduce climate-related risks, and increase economic competitiveness of the U.S. The project will recruit, train, and graduate more than 20 students and early-career scientists from underrepresented groups. Students will be eligible to participate in exchanges to conduct interdisciplinary research with collaborators in the Netherlands, a highly industrialized nation that uses 20% less energy and water per person than the U.S.\r\n\r\nThis study uses an interdisciplinary approach to investigate methods for reducing household FEW consumption and associated direct and indirect environmental impacts, including GHG emissions and water resources depletion. The approach includes: 1) interactive role-playing activities and qualitative interviews with homeowners; 2) a survey of households to examine existing attitudes and behaviors related to FEW consumption, as well as possible approaches and barriers to reduce consumption; and 3) experimental research in residential households in two case-study communities, selected to be representative of U.S. suburban households and appropriate for comparative experiments. These studies will iteratively examine approaches for reducing household FEW consumption, test possible intervention strategies, and provide data for developing systems models to quantify impacts of household FEW resource flows and emissions. A FEW consumption-based life cycle assessment (LCA) model will be developed to provide accurate information for household decision making and design of intervention strategies. The LCA model will include the first known farm-to-fork representation of household food consumption impacts, spatially explicit inventories of food waste and water withdrawals, and a model of multi-level price responsiveness in the electricity sector. By translating FEW consumption impacts, results will identify \"hot spots\" and cost-effective household interventions for reducing ecological footprints. Applying a set of climate and technology scenarios in the LCA model will provide additional insights on potential benefits of technology adoption for informing policymaking. The environmental impact models, household consumption tracking tool, and role-playing software developed in this research will be general purpose and publicly available at the end of the project to inform future education, research and outreach activities.",

Our multidisciplinary team of social scientists, engineers, computer scientists, and climate scientists included more than 50 researchers from six universities and one federal agency in the U.S., as well as collaborators at universities in Australia, New Zealand, and the Netherlands. We also collaborated with industry, non-profit, and local government partners on education and technology transfer initiatives.\n\n\nTo study household FEW consumption, the team first interviewed 45 homeowners to learn about perceived opportunities for, and barriers to, conserving FEW resources. Next, we conducted a national-level online survey with 1,200 respondents. We also developed a computer role-playing game in which players make spending decisions related to FEW consumption. Results from these activities informed the projects next phase, in which we collected data on food purchases, energy use, water use, and consumption behavior from more than 150 suburban households over an 18-month period. Participants used a web-based tool developed for this project that automatically tracked household electricity use and provided a convenient user interface for entering water, natural gas, and food purchase data. A life cycle assessment model developed by the team then translated the consumption data into environmental impacts, including greenhouse gas emissions and total (direct and indirect) energy and water use, which were reported to the participants. (Indirect energy use, for example, includes energy used to produce food and deliver clean water.) The web-based tool was also used to send messages to users about their consumption and suggest ways to reduce environmental impacts, as well as to conduct surveys on household demographics, home structural characteristics, and viewpoints and behaviors that may affect consumption levels. Participants were also surveyed about topics such as food security, environmental awareness, political views, responses to projected climate impacts, and intended conservation practices following the study.\n\n\nStudy results provided new insights for evaluating FEW consumption behaviors and promoting sustainable practices. For example, homeowner interviews revealed that consumption patterns and habits are closely connected to lifestyles and energy infrastructures, and thus consumption can be difficult to shift without greater awareness of those connections. This was particularly true of higher-income households, which had greater per capita FEW consumption but were also more likely to make investments to improve energy efficiency. In addition, surveys revealed that when people are aware of making sustainable energy choices, they are more likely to see themselves as environmentally conscious, which motivates them to act sustainably again in the future. Throughout the study, the role of relationships in residential life was a recurring theme in participants responses, indicating the need to account for these social influences in promoting conservation practices. This is an important finding for researchers who study consumption, as they tend to focus on individual values and behaviors, but this project suggests that dynamics with family members and others sharing residences can be more impactful than considerations at the individual level. Regarding specific messages aimed at promoting conservation, a game experiment with university students showed that comparing players consumption levels was an effective strategy for reducing food and energy consumption in the game.
