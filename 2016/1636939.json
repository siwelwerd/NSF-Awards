 "awd_abstract_narration": "Breast cancer is the second most diagnosed and second largest cause of cancer-related deaths in women. Current treatments for invasive and metastatic breast cancer rely on non-specific drugs that destroy both cancer and non-cancer cells such as drugs used in chemotherapy. Such drugs also have limited efficacy and severe side effects. Thus, there is a need to develop drugs that specifically destroy only cancer cells. This I-Corps team has discovered a human protein that is made in large amounts in breast cancer cells. When this protein is present in breast cancer cells, it makes cancer more deadly. For this reason, the team has developed a drug that specifically kills breast cancer cells by targeting the protein. Early studies using this drug in the treatment of aggressive breast cancer in mice has shown great promise because when mice with breast tumors are given the drug, their tumors stop growing and spreading. In addition, the use of this drug on breast cancer patients who do not have metastasis will eliminate the need for surgical removal of breast tissue and the subsequent reconstructive surgeries. \r\n\r\nThis I-Corps team has developed a biologic drug lead resulting in inhibition of (I) cancer cell clustering in vitro and (ii) tumor growth in vivo when administered to tumor bearing mice. Therefore, the overall goal of this project is to learn how to transfer this biologic drug lead (B49) from the PI?s laboratory to the marketplace for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer.  This team intends to establish the current unmet needs in the metastatic breast cancer treatment space by exploring potential for product development through customer discovery, development, and risk assessment. During customer discovery, the team will conduct interviews with oncologists and all physicians involved in breast cancer treatment, biotech/pharmaceutical companies, patients, hospital administrators, insurance companies, and FDA regulators. The team will also network with other teams, investors, and partners. At the completion of this project, the team will have a clear go or no go decision regarding the viability of B49. If the decision is to move forward with developing B49, the team will draft a transition plan that includes a mission statement, objectives, products/services, keys to success, and management plan.",
