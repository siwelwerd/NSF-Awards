 "awd_abstract_narration": "The automotive industry is undergoing a giant transformation as vehicles are gearing up to take control of driving away from humans. This will lead to reduced chance of accidents, stress-free driving, increased passenger comfort, increased fuel-efficiency and reduced travel time. One of the most critical pieces of information for enabling this vision of autonomous vehicles is accurate determination of locations of nearby vehicles. The overarching goal of this project is to develop robust approaches that are practically implementable for fine-grained relative localization of nearby vehicles with no support from the infrastructure. In particular, on-board sensing capabilities and RF (radio-frequency) communication between vehicles will be leveraged. The key distinguishing features of the project are as follows: 1) a comprehensive approach to the problem of fine-grained vehicular localization while considering legacy vehicles which is the most critical hurdle in rolling out autonomous vehicles; 2) innovative physical layer techniques to achieve high accuracy relative localization; and, 3) techniques to use noisy data collected by various sensors and still robustly derive the locations of the vehicles. The project is potentially transformative as it addresses the key question of accurate relative localization of vehicles while considering practical challenges, which is crucial for the autonomous driving technology. The broader impacts include enhancing undergraduate and graduate curriculum. In addition, existing collaboration with the automotive industry will be effectively leveraged for obtaining guidance on the objectives and understanding the feasibility of our solutions throughout the project.\r\n\r\nThe specific inter-related research thrusts are as follows. 1) Frequency-Pair based Analysis for Single Antenna Vehicles: The key innovation is an approach that can robustly tackle the distance estimation error and the vagaries of a real driving environment using analysis of frequency-pairs. 2) Exploiting Spatial Diversity in Multi-Antenna Vehicles: The key innovation of this thrust is that it uses the spatial diversity offered by multiple antennas to increase robustness. 3) Collaborative Vehicle-Map Construction in Presence of Legacy Vehicles: The key innovation is to robustly fuse noisy information obtained through cameras mounted on the participating vehicles.",

Localizing neighboring vehicles has significant impact on wireless communication between them and safety. We have explored multiple techniques that improve relative location accuracy. These techniques are applicable to vehicles that have wireless capabilities either built-in to them or added by the user after purchase. We have developed approaches that quickly spread safety messages between vehicles such that accident or other dynamic road conditions can be quickly conveyed to drivers and their cars. We have also explored using battery-less tags to detect approaching vehicles. We fitted multiple such tags on the windows of an existing car to enable detection of cars that are coming too close to our car. Thus, our approach turns an ordinary car in to a smart car that is aware of its surroundings. We have developed techniques that allow a car and its driver to detect an approaching speed bump and allow tracking of potholes on the roads. We have used battery-less tags that are attached to the bumper of an existing non-smart car to enable early detection. This can be valuable to not just the drivers but also for Department of Transportation since they can use this information to track road conditions beyond traffic. Thus, our techniques have implications beyond academia. Furthermore, we have adopted one of our relative localization techniques that uses Bluetooth for relative localization of people.
