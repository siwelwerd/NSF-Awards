The Graduate Research Seminar will proceed the GRC and will focus on understanding and controlling material and process interfaces including flow and reactive transport in porous media with well-known senior mentors. The GRC will cover a diversity of common issues in porous media systems and will have broad international attendance. \r\n\r\nGordon Research Conference is an intensive, dedicated meeting that will critically define not only challenges in the subsurface flow and transport but also approaches that have the potential to provide significant progress. The GRC will focus on nine research themes with invited speakers for each theme will come from different disciplines, but will address the questions so as to cut across the various disciplines. These research themes will cover a diversity of common issues in porous media systems, including scaling from pore to field systems, different flow regimes, new thoughts and ideas on relative permeability in multiphase modeling, process identification in diverse porous-media systems, coupling of porous media to free fluid flow systems, characterization of reactive and biological systems, storage of mass and energy in the subsurface, bio-fluid mechanics and life in bio-porous media. This GRS will focus on understanding and controlling material and process interfaces including flow and reactive transport in porous media. Topics of the GRS will therefore cover the influence of interfaces between rocks and fluids, pairs of immiscible fluids, high- and low-conductive zones, and between porous media and the atmosphere or sea, on length scales ranging from micrometers to kilometers.",
