ATC is considered one of the premier forums for advanced professionals from academic and industrial backgrounds to meet and discuss the latest research in systems software. USENIX ATC16 will be held in Denver, CO from June 22-24, 2016 and will consist of 3 days of the expanded ATC technical program. Co-located workshops available for student participation include: HotStorage, HotCloud, and SOUPs.\r\n\r\nIn addition to attending the conference events, students receiving assistance may serve as scribes for the conference sessions to write summaries for a later issue of ;login: magazine, will be invited to sessions to interact with senior members of the research community specifically interested in meeting students in a casual and informal atmosphere, and will be strongly encouraged to present posters and works in progress as part of the selection process.\r\n\r\nParticipation in conferences is a valuable and important part of the graduate school experience providing students exposure to senior researchers and leading edge work in the field.",
