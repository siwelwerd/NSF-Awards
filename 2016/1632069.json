 "awd_abstract_narration": "Oil leakage from underground cable systems leads to environmental damage and economic loss. World-wide, the impact is estimated at $2 billion in direct economic losses. When environmental and productivity costs are considered, the total harm from underground oil leakage is estimated to be much higher. The goal of this project is to develop a cost-effective, scalable, smart underground oil leak location system that can be modified to serve a host of applications in leak detection and pollution measurement including applications in gas leak detection, water leak detection, and pollution monitoring. The techniques developed through this project have the potential to improve future generations of distributed networked sensors through application of cloud computing technologies.  This new smart system, when implemented to detect underground leaks, and more generally, pollutants is expected to make significant, positive environmental impacts. Given the team's past successful work in underground oil leak detection and mitigation, an immediate impact in scaling oil leak detection is expected. At the same time, the mini-mass spectrometers can in the future be configured to monitor many contaminants, thereby addressing a variety of environmental challenges. \r\n\r\nProject objectives are: 1) build the core smart system components, 2) develop core algorithms and build the smart system test bed, and 3) validate the test bed functionality in the field. First, mini-mass spectrometers will be fabricated, and a dynamically configurable cloud computing network will be developed with the goal of connecting multiple mini-mass spectrometers into an analytical system to collect leak source data. Collected data will be analyzed and leakage locations will be identified based on distributed sensor readings using an algorithm developed to dynamically optimize sensor positioning and identify leak location. Finally, the smart system will be implemented in the field to monitor a controlled, low-level, perfluorocarbon tracer leak. The expected outcome of this program is a low cost, self-configurable, highly flexible, mobile system that can locate leaks and contaminants with minimal human intervention. \r\n\r\nThe team consists of faculty at Duke University (Pratt School of Engineering, Nicholas School of the Environment, and Psychology and Neurosciences), and staff at UNC's Renaissance Computing Institute (Chapel Hill, NC) as well as industry partners, PFT Technology, LLC (Bellmore, NY; small business). Duke's team combines material science, computer engineering, mass spectrometry, behavioral science and commercialization expertise. RENCI brings expertise in the latest cyber tools and technologies. Our industry collaborator, PFT Technology, LLC is recognized internationally as the leader in the field of perfluorocarbon-based leak detection, demonstrating successful leak detection programs for utilities in both the U.S. and the U.K.\r\n\r\nThe project will impact multiple levels of students.  Two PhD students (Duke) will be employed by the project.  Professional Masters and PhD students in the Nicholas Environmental Innovation and Entrepreneurship Certificate Program (Duke) will, through their coursework, actively follow the progress of this research program to learn important aspects of translational research activities. Undergraduate students in Duke's Pratt School of Engineering Pratt Fellows and Grand Challenge Scholars programs will be offered opportunities to work on the project through these programs. This project will also engage students and faculty at Jordan High School by offering engagement opportunities such as independent study or science fair projects.",

With age and use, these HPFF cables degrade and can leak petroleum-based dielectric fluid (DF) into the surrounding environment (see https://talkofthesound.com/2021/07/20/con-edison-oil-spill-clean-up-at-new-rochelle-marina-continue/). Maintaining adequate DF in these cables is required for safe and reliable operation. Currently, detecting and locating underground DF leaks is challenging, time intensive, and inconsistent. One leak location method exists utilizing perfluorocarbon (PFC) tracer molecules and a mobile gas chromatograph. This instrument is sensitive enough to detect the atmospheric background levels of PFC ppqv (parts per quadrillion by volume, 10<sup>-12</sup>) range; however, this instrument is not fully portable, real-time, and is prone to analyte saturation.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In this project, we designed, constructed, and qualified the performance of a mobile instrument capable of detecting PFC tracers with high resolution, sensitivity, and selectivity. The cycloidal coded aperture miniature mass spectrometer for perfluorocarbon tracers (PFC-CAMMS) integrates three core technologies ? a cycloidal mass analyzer, aperture coding, and a focal plane array detector ? to overcome the throughput versus resolution tradeoff that has historically hampered the miniaturization of mass spectrometers. The cycloidal mass analyzer utilizes perpendicularly-oriented overlapping electric and magnetic fields to linearly separate ions by mass-to-charge ratio (<em>m/q</em>). Aperture coding increases throughput without sacrificing resolution, enabling a miniature instrument.

The efficacy of this design roadmap is demonstrated by designing the PFC-CAMMS instrument for the specific use case of PFC tracer detection and location.</p>\n<p>The design knowledge was implemented to create a PFC-CAMMS instrument with a large mass range, high resolution, high sensitivity, and small form factor. PFC-CAMMS achieved a resolution of 0.071 u at <em>m/q</em> 69 and 0.27 u at <em>m/q</em> 331 and demonstrated an overall mass range of <em>m/q</em> 29 ? 502. Additionally, using PMCH (C<sub>7</sub>F<sub>14</sub>) as the test molecule, the PFC-CAMMS instrument achieved a detection limit of 20 ppbv (parts per billion by volume, 10<sup>-9</sup>) with a response time of less than 5 s from sample introduction using a capillary inlet. There is no evidence of a hysteresis effect when detecting PFCs for this benchtop (66 x 46 x 30 cm<sup>3</sup> and ~50 kg) laboratory prototype. This work enhanced the understanding about designing electromagnetic components for a PFC-CAMMS, and also furthered the fabrication, alignment, and assembly process that enabled this improved baseline performance. The reproducible procedure for developing a cycloidal mass analyzer with an array detector facilitates improved hardware designs that produce a more consistent system response function across the intended mass range.
