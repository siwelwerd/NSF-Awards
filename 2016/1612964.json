 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will provide support for the attendees and invited speakers for the fourteenth Annual NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics Postdoctoral Fellowships (AAPF) Symposium, to be held in conjunction with the winter meeting of the American Astronomical Society (AAS) in January 2016, in Kissimmee, Florida. The purpose of the AAPF Program is to support integrated research and educational activities at the postdoctoral level to better prepare Fellows for positions of distinction and leadership in the scientific community. The Annual Symposium provides a forum for the Fellows to discuss their research and educational or outreach projects while increasing their visibility within the astronomy and astrophysics community. The Symposium represents a key component of the AAPF Program and is a very effective mechanism to facilitate the transfer of knowledge from experiences that the Fellows have acquired through their postdoctoral training to a broad audience. \r\n\r\nAs with previous symposia in this series, the 2016 AAPF Symposium will promote interactions among astronomers with very different research interests and backgrounds. By creating a forum in which discussions can occur across conventional research boundaries, the Symposium will provide a great opportunity to gain new insights and pursue interdisciplinary collaborations. The Symposium will also provide a venue for discussing major issues that are important to early-career astronomers. In addition, the Symposium will (1) provide a forum for discussing integrated research and educational activities, (2) facilitate collaborations between Fellows on both research and education, and (3) provide greater exposure for the Fellows and the AAPF program within the astronomical community.",
