The workshop advances the development of the research community focused on understanding more fully the nature of production of societal value. The workshop introduces new data and research-based insights into policy debates about the future of work. The workshop nurtures a new data and structure rich analysis that have the potential to improve science and innovation policy.\r\n \r\nThe production algorithm refers to the processes for turning ideas into goods and services. A culinary recipe is an example: it is a means for turning ingredients into a meal. The advance of the algorithmic frontier refers to improvements in production algorithms that occur over time.  This workshop brings together a multi-disciplinary team of researchers involved with the relationship between the advance of the algorithmic frontier, the changing nature of human work and the potential for inclusive opportunity.  \r\n\r\n\r\n",
