 "awd_abstract_narration": "Animals have evolved a variety of chemicals defenses against predators. A premier example is the toxic chemicals in the skin of poison frogs. Because these frogs are brightly colored, predators such as birds and snakes learn to avoid them. These toxins are alkaloids, found in many animals and plants. The frogs acquire these chemical defenses by eating ants and other arthropods that contain the alkaloids. These frog alkaloids (e.g., tetrodotoxin, batrachotoxin) are pharmacologically important and cause muscle paralysis, and disrupt breathing and cardiac function. At the cellular level, alkaloids affect ion channels, which control the transmission of nerve impulses. Surprisingly, the ion channels of poison frogs are are not affected by their own toxins; thus, deciphering how this evolved has important broader impacts that translate to human health. This research will use evolutionary trees to guide the activities: fieldwork to acquire and characterize natural alkaloids and collect ecological data on the species, molecular evolution of ion channel resistance to alkaloids, and neurophysiological effects of alkaloids on ion channels. The research will provide opportunities for students from the University of Texas and Indiana State University to jointly participate in international fieldwork, acquire new skills in bioinformatics, molecular modeling, genomics, and neurophysiology, as well as promote interactions between the two universities.\r\n\r\nThe project will use Next-Generation DNA sequencing of transcriptomes, targeted sequencing of hundreds of genes, and bioinformatics methods to reconstruct evolutionary trees that will guide the research program with an experimental framework for explaining the origin of resistance, which has evolved multiple times in the poison frogs (family Dendrobatidae). Sequencing will also be used to identify novel amino acid replacements that may confer resistance to alkaloids. Computational modeling and in vitro assays of mutated ion channels will determine if these novel replacements provide resistance to natural and synthesized alkaloids. Fieldwork will focus on acquiring genetic samples, skin alkaloids, and color photographs from multiple populations of frogs, using natural history collection standards data collection and voucher specimens preparation. The combination of approaches will provide novel insights in the systematics of Dendrobatidae poison frogs, and also the evolution of auto-resistance to toxic alkaloids within the group.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project at Indiana State University (DEB 1556982) was part of a collaborative project with the Cannatella group at the University of Texas at Austin (DEB 1556967) to investigate the genetics, neurophysiology and chemistry associated with poison frogs to identify mechanisms by which the frog tolerates the toxic/noxious compounds they use for defense.  The ISU objectives of this subaward were to identify alkaloids in the skin extracts of poison frogs collected by the Cannatella Group (Tarvin) and determine profiles for correlation with the above-mentioned genetic traits associated with the autoresistance model.  In year 2 we proposed to build a searchable database of frog alkaloid data to handle the large number of alkaloids which had been found and to facilitate automation for identification and quantitation.\n\nIntellectual Merit:\n\nThe collaborative part of this project has to date identified 532 possible alkaloids in the frog extracts collected by Cannatella group.  Of these 502, were reliably identified as known alkaloids in one of the 20 known structural classes or in one of the structurally undefined groups reported in the literature.  Of these, 226 appear to be new isomers of known alkaloids or new alkaloids entirely.  Tarvin and Fitch are working on 3 separate manuscripts describing the general survey of alkaloids, a specific study of Epipedobates species and the identification of alkaloids in presumed ?non-toxic? species.  The use of skin lipids as an internal standard for frogs is of interest because of their ubiquity but lipid abundance and composition appear to vary significantly across and even within species so their value is as yet uncertain.\n\nThe database construction part of this project involved the correlation of published frog alkaloid data with actual archival instrument files containing original chromatographic and spectral information to begin building a database which will be publicly accessible.  From the latest review of &gt;800 alkaloids (nearly 1,100 including all isomers) almost 2/3 have been linked to instrument files and incorporated into a searchable NIST formatted library.  Combining this with the new compounds from the Cannatella collaboration will give a library of over 1,300 individual compounds and isomers. In addition, all entries have been retention indexed using the alkane method (Kovats) and cross-referenced to background silicone peaks that are often seen as background impurities.  This allows more consistent and reproducible comparisons than retention time alone, which can vary across instruments and laboratories. The silicone cross-referencing allows for indexing of archival data run without alkane standards because of the ubiquitous nature of these impurities.  Sometimes what we think of as garbage is actually useful.  Fitch and collaborators are working on an updated literature review with the complete library to be included along with data from other collaborators.\n\nBroader Impacts: \n\nA total of 19 undergraduate students participated in this work over the grant period either during the academic year or as part of our Summer Undergraduate Research Experiences (SURE) program at ISU. Six of these continued past their initial experience period (summer or academic year).  These students learned elements of chemical ecology, analytical chemistry including gas and liquid chromatography and multiple types of mass spectrometry using instruments funded by the NSF (DUE 0942345 and CHE 1531972).  They also gained experience with the ?big data? aspects of building databases of chemical information from large, complex and information-dense instrument output files combined with relevant collection information.  These students have presented their work at internal symposia as well as national meetings of the American Chemical Society.  The PI has also presented work at meetings of the American Society of Pharmacognosy to the broader natural products community.  These students will also become co-authors on the papers described above as they are published.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/29/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Richard W Fitch"
