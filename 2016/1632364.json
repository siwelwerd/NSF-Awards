 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main goal of the International Conference on Computational Mathematics and Inverse Problems is to bring together an international collection of established specialists as well as junior researchers in the area of computational mathematics and inverse problems. This type of scientific gathering and interaction can have long-lasting impact on junior researchers and graduate students. A significant broader impact will be to bring young researchers into the field, and establish new connections between disparate groups. The conference will also build a bridge between computational mathematics and inverse problems. The exchange of ideas will be beneficial to researchers in both areas. In addition, there will be a significant attendance of graduate students. The conference is a great opportunity for them to access the cutting-edge research, find interesting research topics, learn from world leading researchers, and build the network/collaboration for future academic careers. Geographically, Michigan Technological University is a little isolated from major cities. The conference will provide a boost to the research activities and give the department more visibility in the mathematical sciences community.\r\n\r\nOn the basis of current research trends and the wide spectrum of applications, the conference focuses on the following topics: iterative methods for large sparse eigenvalue problems with applications in big data sciences, finite element methods for eigenvalue problems, computational electromagnetic, direct techniques in inverse scattering theory, full wave inversion. The conference will feature plenary talks given by international experts on the aforementioned topics, invited talks from junior researchers, and contributed talks mainly from graduate students. The topics of the conference involve rapidly developments at the frontiers on today's research in computational mathematics and inverse problems. On one hand, the demand of computational methods in inverse problems is ever increasing. On the other hand, the computational mathematicians can find interesting new problems in inverse problems. Applicability of the conference topics extends to many real world applications including big data sciences, high performance computing, medical imaging, non-destructive testing, underground imaging and exploration.",
