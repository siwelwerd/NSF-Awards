REU students participating in the Sustainable RIVER project will examine the functioning and management of the Missouri River as a lens through which to study complex, interdisciplinary systems. Through individual research projects with faculty mentors from USD's multi-disciplinary Missouri River Institute, students will address the question of how invasive elements in the Missouri River and its uplands affect the sustainability of the river and the humans who depend on it. Students will also meet as a team weekly to integrate knowledge gained from the individual projects to create a team project to address the question of how a more resilient Missouri River, which meets the needs of multiple stakeholders and sustains diverse, functioning ecosystems, can be cultivated.\r\n\r\nIt is anticipated that a total of thirty students will be trained in the program.  Active recruitment efforts will focus on Native American students, students in sustainability programs across the US, and students attending 2- and 4-year institutions in South Dakota.  There will be an explicit focus in the Sustainable RIVER project on the critical pedagogy of place, where students learn how to live sustainably in places that have been disrupted while learning to recognize and address the causes of such disruptions.  The Sustainable RIVER project will create student scientists who will become leaders in interdisciplinary research and leaders in creating a more sustainable society through their development of a multi-perspective, systems-thinking approach to understanding and addressing complex challenges.  \r\n\r\nA common web-based assessment tool used by all REU programs funded by the Division of Biological Infrastructure (Directorate for Biological Sciences) will be used to determine the effectiveness of the training program.  Students will be tracked after the program in order to determine student career paths.  Students will be asked to respond to an automatic email sent via the NSF reporting system.  More information about the program is available by visiting http://SustainableRIVER.org or by contacting the PI (Dr. Meghann Jarchow at Meghann.Jarchow@usd.edu). This REU site is co-funded by the Division of Biological Infrastructure (Directorate for Biological Sciences), and the Division of Earth Sciences (Directorate for Geosciences).",

Native Americans represent only 0.8% of the U.S. population based on 2017 data from the U.S. Census Bureau. In the Sustainable RIVER REU, Native American students made up 18% of participants. Of the six Native American students who participated in the Sustainable RIVER REU, three are pursuing graduate degrees and a fourth student has indicated that they intend to pursue a graduate degree in 2021. Native Americans earn only 0.4% of all STEM M.S. degrees and 0.2% of STEM Ph.D. degrees in the U.S. Those numbers are the lowest for any underrepresented group in STEM.  Two thirds of Sustainable RIVER Native American students are pursuing or intend to pursue a graduate degree. \n\nThe Sustainable RIVER REU research made important contributions to multiple disciplinary fields.  Below are examples of some of these contributions.\n\nTree species, surrounding vegetation, and year all affected the nesting survival of the 31 bird species that were monitored in 744 nests in riparian forests along the Missouri River.  The invasive tree species Russian olive was the mostly commonly chosen nest tree among the bird species studied.\nAlthough the Upper Missouri River Basin is a large geographic area, we found similarities in the land uses that resident generally found to be most and least desirable with native landscapes and agriculture identified as being highly desirable and energy production/extraction and development identified as being less desirable.  \nThe loss of backwater and related off-channel habitats along the Missouri River was found to reduce the production of emerging aquatic insects, which are important food sources for riparian consumers in terrestrial food webs.  Under the conservative assumption that riparian birds obtain 10% of their annual energy budget from adult aquatic insects, the amount of insect loss was estimated to be enough to subsidize more than 3,000,000 riparian woodland birds annually. \nBelow the Gavins Point Dam on the Missouri River, we found that the tributaries located in South Dakota contribute ~80% of the Missouri River's suspended load, while the Nebraska tributaries contribute &lt;5%.  The remaining sediment is likely supplied by bank and bed erosion within the Missouri River.\nThe building of dams on the Missouri River flooded lands of numerous tribes in the region.  This forced the members of these tribes upland of the floodplain, which are generally more infertile, making agriculture to support populations difficult.\n\n\nIn order to address society's most pressing challenges, upcoming scientists will need to be trained in how to conduct interdisciplinary research with diverse groups of people on complex systems.  Most of the students believed that the Sustainable RIVER REU increased their ability to make connections among scientific disciplines, made them more comfortable working collaboratively with others from diverse backgrounds, and increased their ability to do research and contribute to science.
