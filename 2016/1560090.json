 "awd_abstract_narration": "NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: Applied Physics is a diverse and interdisciplinary area that is critical to technological and societal advances that affect our national competitiveness on the global level and lead to improvements in the quality of human life. This REU site in Applied Physics will strive to nurture the next generation of scientists and engineers who will work in areas of critical importance such as energy, environment, medicine, micro and nanoelectronics, information technologies, and other key enabling technologies.  The primary goal of the NSF REU site is to provide high quality motivational research experiences in Applied Physics for students from undergraduate institutions to enter this important area of research, and continue their careers in Science and Engineering as graduate students. Main objectives are: (1) To provide research experience to students from predominantly undergraduate institutions, including minority and female students; (2) To facilitate learning of research methods, laboratory skills, critical thinking, organizational, oral and written communication skills; (3) Involvement in cutting-edge research where REU students can present their results at professional meetings and publish in peer-reviewed journals; (4) Engage students in projects with innovative concepts with potential to affect technology, to educate them on steps required to transform research ideas to commercial products, and to kindle the entrepreneurial spirit in some students that may help to propagate American ingenuity; (5) Make the research experience available to Community Colleges students who have not been engaged fully in higher education, but have the potential for achieving higher academic goals. \r\n\r\nTECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: Students have the choice of working with one of 16 faculty mentors in diverse areas of research in Applied Physics that include: (1) materials for renewable energy, (2) magnetic and ferroelectric materials for sensors, (3) metamaterials, (4) nanocomposites, (5) bio-biomedical physics, (6) computational physics, and (7) atomic-molecular-optical physics.  In addition, research experiences will be enriched by several special professional development programs such as weekly REU-wide seminar programs, a weekly lecture series in \"Advances in Applied Physics\", and workshops to develop oral and communication skills.  At the end of the program students will present their work in a university-wide REU symposium, and a selected group of students will present their research results in national conferences. Students involved in application-oriented projects will learn the steps involved in transforming basic research into commercial products.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe funds available for this reporting period was from two consecutive no-cost extensions due to the program interruptions brought on by the pandemic.  No new students were recruited for the 2020 or 2021 summer programs.  Three participants from a previous program were sent to the American Physical Society (APS) meeting in 2022.  The APS meeting was held in Chicago, IL from March 14-18, 2022.  Following are the details of their projects.\n\nDanisbel Herrera, participant from New York University worked with Prof. Jacob Gayles on a computational research project on Magnetic Oscillations in Co2MnGa Nanoparticles.  The project focused on investigating magnetic nanoparticles of Heusler of this recently discovered compound that shows unique topological electronic structure.  The electronic structure properties of these materials promise applications in biomedicine, optical sensing, and energy harvesting. \n\nAddison Hornsey, participant from Johns university, worked with Prof. Manh-Huong Phan on an experimental project on Surface Magnetic Switching in Lower Dimension Ferromagnetic Films.  The focus of this project was to investigate the ferromagnetic (FM) and optical properties of 2D layers of transition metal dichalcogenides on FM films.  Students were exposed to the techniques of optical Kerr effect, magnetic force microscopy, and vibrating sample magnetometry of Fe/WS2/MgO samples.          \n\nEthan Henry Fleming from Middlebury College worked with Prof. Ghanim Ullah on a computational biophysics project on Modeling Calcium Controlled Neurotransmitter Release.  Focus of the project was investigation of stochastic fluctuations in cytosolic Ca2+ in spontaneous release of ATP and other neurotransmitters by neurons.  This research introduced the students to the effect of Ca2+ impairments in neurons to different neurological diseases. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/01/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Sarath Witanachchi"
