 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program in the Division of Chemistry, Professor Baldelli at the University of Houston and Professor Kelly at Rice University are developing a new type of microscope that is able to see molecules on surfaces faster and with higher sensitivity than regular microscopes.  With cameras, pictures can be taken that show colors to help identify objects; for example, grass is green and sky is blue.  However, to look at molecules, more specific information is needed about the \"colors\" that molecules absorb. For many molecules, this absorption occurs in the infrared region of light.  To look at these infrared colors, traditional cameras are not very good so methods that can obtain pictures without cameras are necessary.  Professor Baldelli and Professor Kelly are developing a new type of microscope to figure out the surface image of surface molecules.  The results of this new microscope are useful to all researchers interested in surfaces related to biomaterials, energy, and environmental topics. For example, it can be used to study the distribution of lipid molecules on cell membranes that controls proteins moving in and out of cells, which in turn regulate cell growth and signaling. It can also be used to look at chemical dopants on a thin film that accelerate the oxygen reduction reaction in fuel cells, an important step in efficient energy conversion. The research project also presents a valuable opportunity to learn and experience collaborative multidisciplinary research -- a current emphasis of science and engineering education.  The topics and research project have many components to encourage undergraduate and high school students into the research, including instrument building, data analysis and interpretation, and research presentations.  This later point is an important aspect since it builds much confidence in the younger students and scientist.\r\n\r\nProfessors Baldelli and Kelly are developing a new state-of-the-art surface spectroscopic imaging microscope to study the molecular, spatial, and temporal evolution of patterns and chemical heterogeneity present in many fundamental and technologically important systems. This new CS-SFG (compressive sensing-sum frequency generation vibrational spectroscopy) imaging technique utilizes a digital mirror device (DMD).  The DMD is the heart of the DLP projector and flat screen displays.  It is a 2-D array of mirrors that reflects the SFG image onto a detector.  Using computer control and a random pattern generator, the signal intensity changes depending on which mirrors are reflecting toward the detector.  Each pattern results from 50% of the randomly chosen mirrors being turned on for each measurement.  After many such measurements, the image is reconstructed based on the signal and the known mirror pattern.  CS allows for efficient image acquisition where only a few percent of the total information is necessary to faithfully reconstruct the surface features.  Two configurations broad-band and narrow-band IR are set up to evaluate the effect on the image reconstruction.  In addition the detection system incorporates heterodyne detection to extract phase information forth monolayer signal.  This new capability allows for alternate imaging schemes and orientation analysis.  The effect of compression algorithms and quantitative analysis ultimately aid in the interpretation of heterogeneous monolayer films on surfaces. The CS-SFG microscope will be a significant improvement over current approaches that either use probe areas on the order of a millimeter or acquire the full hyperspectral data cube but at considerable expense in sample throughput. Once demonstrated, Professors Baldelli and Kelly are to employ this microscope to investigate the molecular-level static and dynamic details of chemical patterns (such as lipid domains) formed under the control condition of lithography and the transfer of films to solid substrates via the Langmuir-Blodgett technique. The research project provides both graduate students and local high school students with highly interdisciplinary training in chemistry, physics, engineering, and computer science.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nProject outcomes\n\nThe development of new energy sources is of significant importance for our society, especially non-polluting types. Many chemists create new materials for fuel cells, solar cells, and batteries to make progress in this field.  However, just as important, new techniques are needed to understand how and why this functions; this understanding is essential if progress is to be made.  This project succeeded in developing a new microscopic and spectroscopic method to study fuel cell reaction under realistic conditions and to investing films of a phospholipid, which are a significant component of a cell.  Both these studies take advantage of the new instrument/technique developments for molecular-level interrogation with microscopic resolution.  Students on the project gain unique experiences in experimental design, data collection and analysis, and presenting their work.\n\nInvestigation on the surface chemistry of energy-related materials and Investigation on biologically related surfaces were two main themes of the project.  Each of these topics is related to materials chemistry, bio-physical, and fundamental surface chemistry.  The study of structured surfaces is also related to controlling surface chemical reactions to produce the desired outcome,  such as high reactivity, high selectivity, or surface energy control. In this study, the microscope investigates these systems and probe the chemistry at the molecular level based on the vibrational spectroscopy of the adsorbate.  Further, since the surfaces are heterogeneous, the SFG provides a chemical map of the surface with information on liquid interactions, local structure, chemical reactivity, and speciation.  This information is invaluable to researchers who design surfaces with specific functionality in mind.  A primary goal of this project is to determine how the different regions of the surface are coupled and present an average surface response based on the components of the ensemble regions.  The electrocatalyt for fuel cells determined that the different crystals on the platinum surface area coupled by electronic effects that we imaged by the microscope.  Similarly, in the phospholipid study, the monolayers were found to vary in heterogeneity across different length scales.\n\nMicroscopy development: in the course of this project is realized that the microscope and technique should have mich wide applications in other studies such as molecular electronics and environmental systems.\n\nStudent results:  Members of the team, students, and other scientists have become experts in constructing and implementing this new sophisticated microscope.  They were able to gain valuable experience in optics, spectroscopy, electrochemistry, and materials handling.  Furthermore, the construction of apparatus to make the project successful. The students were also able to teach others the use of the instrument, which helped to bring about other possible benefits of this microscopic method.  Finally, as the students on the project progressed in their research, significant discoveries were achieved, bringing satisfaction and contributing to their degrees.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/14/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Steven Baldelli"
