 "awd_abstract_narration": "The explosion in wireless data usage across the world has been one of the great economic drivers of the last decade, and the global need for cheap, high-data-rate wireless access is expected to continue to grow rapidly for at least another decade. Non-reciprocal components, such as circulators and isolators, enable new wireless communication paradigms such as full-duplex wireless that are otherwise not feasible and promise to significantly enhance wireless data capacity. However, non-reciprocal components today are almost exclusively realized through the magneto-optic Faraday effect, requiring the use of ferrite materials that are expensive, bulky and incompatible with the silicon-based integrated circuit technologies that power the wireless and computing revolutions. This proposal will devise, analyze and experimentally demonstrate new multi-physics approaches based on spatio-temporal modulation that enable the breaking of reciprocity at radio frequencies (RF), and the realization of compact and low-cost RF non-reciprocal components integrated in commercial silicon-based technologies. Broadly, this research will have a direct and critical impact on the societal need for enhanced access to wireless data by expanding the range of accessible RF spectrum, enabling new schemes for more efficiently sharing existing spectrum, and reducing the size and cost of nonreciprocal components, making wireless devices accessible to a larger portion of the population. In terms of outreach, this project will also provide opportunities for the education and engagement of students across the educational continuum from kindergarten through graduate school (K-12, undergraduate and graduate), leveraging existing programs at Columbia and Cornell, in collaboration with the Liberty Science Center in NYC and a number of coordinated outreach and diversity programs.\r\n\r\nRecent research has revealed that introducing time variance into a material or system enables the breaking of reciprocity. While there are no fundamental performance limits associated with time-varying non-reciprocal systems and components, existing spatio-temporal modulation approaches for the realization of non-reciprocal components such as circulators have been fraught with challenges in insertion loss, size or linearity. While traditional spatio-temporal modulation approaches have relied on the variation of permittivity in dielectric media, the key insight in this proposal is the fact that semiconductor systems offer another material property that can be more powerfully modulated ? namely conductivity. Based on this insight, this project will pursue various multi-physics approaches to achieve non-magnetic RF non- reciprocity in silicon-based integrated circuit technologies. Blending electronics with acoustics and optics in an integrated setting, this project will demonstrate high-performance non-reciprocal circulators and isolators at RF, millimeter-wave and terahertz frequencies. This project will also investigate synthetic RF media supporting topologically protected non-reciprocal modes of propagation from both a theoretical (i.e. mathematical) and experimental perspective, with applications in non-reciprocal antenna interfaces for emerging wireless communication paradigms such as large-scaled phased arrays and massive Multiple-Input-Multiple-Output (MIMO) systems.",
