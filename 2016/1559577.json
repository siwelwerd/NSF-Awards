 "awd_abstract_narration": "Despite decades of affordable housing policies, stable and sustainable housing for low-income households is scarce and inequality is at an all-time high. Traditional models of low-income ownership have often led to financial losses, foreclosure, a return to renting, or negative home equity. Relocating low- income households to higher income communities has proven difficult to do and successful only under limited conditions. Missing from these models of low-income housing policy is an understanding of the formal economic and institutional arrangements that connect households to economic and social capital. Community Land Trusts (CLTs) present an alternative policy model that provides quality affordable housing through shared equity and institutional arrangements that directly and indirectly provide access to economic, social and cultural capital. CLTs also stabilize the housing market for communities and steward the land so that its uses serve the needs of people who live there. This study investigates the extent to which CLTs bring about improvements in residents' economic, cultural, and social capital and how they affect communities. The underlying hypothesis is that asset accumulation needs to be accompanied by \"ontological security\" -- the sense that the material and social worlds are trustworthy and constant -- if poor households are to advance. Looking beyond the individual, this study examines the extent to which CLTs are associated with increased community stability and well being. It aims to enlighten debates about how to balance public and private interests in housing, how to make the most of public subsidies, and how to integrate housing provision and community development. \r\n\r\nThe theoretical assumption of decades of low-income housing policy presumes that either market rate homeownership or relocation to more capital rich locations will facilitate the accumulation of economic, cultural and social capital. This study proceeds from an alternate analysis of the requirements for increased accumulation of different forms of capital. The institutional supports and obligations of CLTs and their community benefits are seen as critical in creating the conditions for the accumulation of economic, cultural and social capital by introducing stability into the lives of poor households and producing communities permanently accessible to and supportive of these households. Homeowners in two geographically dispersed CLTs serving ethnically and economically diverse low- and moderate -income populations will be surveyed along with comparison groups of other similar households seeking homeownership. The survey and CLT verified data will be used to examine how CLT homeownership affects household finances (economic capital), educational levels (cultural capital), community engagement (social capital), and sense of stability, safety and ability to move one's life forward (ontological security).  Using multi-level models, individual and census data will be analyzed to better understand the community contexts of CLT and non-CLT households and to see how communities are affected by the presence of CLT homes. Census, housing and school data at the census tract level will be used to spatially examine the efficacy of CLT place-making and positive neighborhood effects by comparing previous respondent addresses to CLT and non-CLT present locations.",

CLTs are a form of shared-equity homeownership where land is collectively owned by members of the CLT and stewarded by a local non-profit while households own the home on the land. CLTs provide affordable homeownership opportunities in perpetuity by mitigating the impact of land value on the cost of housing and restricting the price of the home upon resale. Thus, CLTs have the unique ability to provide affordable homeownership opportunities in perpetuity. The hypothesis of this project was that because CLTs act as local stewards of both collectively-owned land and the households that live in homes on the land, CLTs are able to address the barriers to accessing and sustaining homeownership and in doing so interrupt the reproduction of social and economic disadvantage for both neighborhoods and households. Previous research has demonstrated that CLTs provide such benefits to their residents, but these studies did not include comparable market-based homeowners and renters. This project attended to this gap between CLT theory and CLT research by including comparable groups.<br /><br />This study was an interdisciplinary collaboration between two universities: The Graduate Center, City University of New York and Georgia State University. The research was the first large-sample survey of CLT homeowners with comparable market-based homeowner and renter groups drawn from CLTs and homeownership education and counseling (HEC) program participants in Portland (OR) and Minneapolis (MN). An additional comparison group was drawn from the waitlist of the CLT in Portland. The online survey was administered by the participating organizations from mid-May 2018 through mid-July 2018. The survey consisted of seven broad topics: 1) current and prior housing experiences; 2) household finances; 3) children&rsquo;s educational outcomes; 4) neighborhood conditions; 5) work and education of household adults; 6) mental health; 7) demographics. The sample included 216 CLT homeowners, 142 market-based homeowners, and 130 market-based renters. We also obtained administrative records from each of the CLTs and HEC organizations. These records included financial, demographic, and other household characteristics that were used to establish the population from which participants were drawn and establish measures for our analysis.<br /><br />Analysis is ongoing but three key findings have been identified. First, CLTs provide stable, secure, and affordable housing for those marginalized from market-based housing forms. We found that CLT homeowners were more likely to be women-headed households of color than market-based homeowners. Although CLT homeowners were demographically and financially similar to study renters, they reported experiences of financial well-being and housing stability, security and satisfaction that were no different from market-based homeowners and higher than study renters. CLT owners also reported that they have more time and resources to pursue activities that interest them than both market-rate homeowners and renters. Our second key finding is that CLT owners report no significant difference from market-rate owners, and perform better than similar renters, along three indicators of social capital: social network resources, social cohesion, and civic engagement. Social network resources include the people respondents could rely in their neighborhood for help or assistance. Social cohesion refers to the degree that respondents felt part of their local communities. Civic engagement measured involvement in local organizations. This finding demonstrates that social capital can accrue to lower income households who are CLT owners. It also complicates prevailing theorizations of higher social capital for homeowners that posit an economic motive (i.e. property value) for this outcome, which is lessened for CLT owners due to the limited returns gained upon resale. Finally, our research finds that CLT owners experience higher rates of psychological well-being than study renters and are similar on this measure to market-based homeowners. Because housing circumstances, mental and physical health are interrelated, this finding provides support for increased focus on providing stable, secure and affordable housing opportunities that are often hard for lower-income households of color to realize.<br /><br />The impacts of this research exist along three dimensions. First, the breadth of the study provides the basis for further inquiry into the effects of alternative housing tenures on household and community outcomes. For example, our findings from a cross-sectional approach can be used to inform the design of longitudinal research that would provide more insight into how the effects of housing tenure may change over time. Second, the findings from this study contribute to housing policy development by offering support for the more efficient use of subsidies that CLTs, and social housing generally, provide over individual support for traditional homeownership.
