Spin-transfer is a mechanism by which a spin-polarized current can reverse the magnetic orientation of a nanomagnet and induce magnetic excitations such as spin-waves. Understanding the nature of spin-transfer induced spin excitations is a very active area of present day research. The proposed research seeks to advance the understanding and application of two types of collective spin excitations that are generated by the spin-transfer interaction: magnetic solitons, which are localized spin excitations excited in nanometer scale electric contacts to magnetic thin films, and superspin currents excited in easy-plane magnetic layers. Fundamental questions regarding the lifetime, dynamics and degree of coherence of magnetic solitons will be addressed experimentally in samples in which soliton dynamics can be controlled with external perturbations (e.g. applied fields and currents). Scanning transmission x-ray microscopy will be used to image the magnetization dynamics to provide direct information on the nature of the current-induced spin excitations. Parallel theoretical work will explore the effects of temperature and other perturbations, as well as the effects of confined geometries, on soliton lifetimes and dynamics, and will explore transitions between nontopological and topological states. Superspin currents will be explored in samples consisting of proximal nanocontacts for the injection and detection of spin-currents. These experiments will aim to demonstrate and evaluate the efficiently of this newly proposed mechanism of spin transport. Graduate and undergraduate students involved in this collaboration will gain experience by interactions between academia and industry and through student exchanges between NYU and IBM. Their education will be enriched through this integrated experimental and theoretical project, as well as the variety of perspectives, expertise and techniques present in an industrial setting. High school students will also be encouraged to participate in this research project.",
