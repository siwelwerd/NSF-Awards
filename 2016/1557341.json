 "awd_abstract_narration": "The shapes and sizes of their body parts are the most important features by which different species of animals are recognized and defined. The shapes and relative sizes of body parts, however, change continually during development. As a result, individuals with different final adult body sizes typically differ in the proportions of sizes of their body parts. This phenomenon is called allometry. Although allometry has been extensively described and studied for more than a century, those studies have been largely descriptive and have made simple and unrealistic assumptions about how different body parts grow. This is in part because the physiological processes responsible for producing allometries are still poorly understood and because the theoretical tools used to analyze and interpret allometries cannot deduce growth processes correctly.  As a result, the mechanisms that control size, shape and the relative sizes of body parts remain among the great unsolved puzzles in Biology. The proposed work will develop new practical and theoretical tools for the analysis of how, and why, the relative sizes of body parts vary. Understanding how organs grow to their correct size and shape has profound implications for understanding the causes and mechanisms of normal development and of developmental abnormalities.  User-friendly software will be developed and freely distributed that will allow students and researchers to implement the equations developed in this research and analyze allometries in novel and more productive ways. This project will provide interdisciplinary training in biological mathematics and physiology for a graduate student and a diverse group of undergraduates. Outreach to local schools and regional science museums, with talks and hands-on exercises on insect biology, laboratory visits by junior-high school students from underserved schools, and continuing participation and mentorship with the North Carolina Museum of Life and Science on the biology of insects are integral parts of the Principal Investigator's commitment to disseminating science and making the resources provided by NSF more broadly available to the local community.\r\n\r\nThe proposed research has three principal aims: (1) to develop an improved theory and new equations for static allometry, (2) to test and validate the theory against rich and diverse data sets from insects and mammals, and (3) to investigate the physiological factors that give rise to allometric relationships. The experimental work will focus on wing-body allometry in Lepidoptera, where the control of growth and size is best understood. Growth and size are controlled by developmental hormones and by the timing and duration of hormone secretion. This work will use several genetic strains of Manduca sexta that differ in body size and that can be reared under different environmental conditions of temperature and nutrition, which also affect size and allometry. This will produce a rich data set that will permit a functional interpretation of the effects of genes and environment on growth patterns and on the resulting allometries. The results of this work will allow researchers to analyze the causes of complex non-linear allometries, and deduce the underlying growth patterns that give rise to those allometries. This work will also provide new insights into the physiological mechanisms by which variation in genetic background and environment alters size, shape and allometry.",

The overarching aim of this research program was to obtain a deeper functional understanding of the mechanisms that lead to the observed sizes and shapes of animals. The study and quantitative analysis of the sizes and relative sizes of body parts, how they are affected by genetic and environmental factors, and how they differ between species is called allometry.&nbsp; The focus of this research program was on the physiological and developmental causes of body size and allometry in insects, the most numerous and diverse group of animals on earth. Several parallel investigations addressed specific questions on the physiology, development and evolution of size, shape and allometry in different systems. Overall adult body size in insects is controlled by the time at which metamorphosis begins. Adult insects do not grow, so the size a larva has achieved when it begins metamorphosis determines the size of the adult. We discovered that this size, called the threshold size, is monitored by the level of a growth factor called myoglianin (also known as Growth Differentiation Factor 8, GDF8). Myoglianin is produced by the muscles that line the body wall of the larva and when it rises above a threshold value it induces the hormones that control metamorphosis.&nbsp; When we chemically inhibited myoglianin production we found that such larvae never metamorphosed, although they could live and continue to feed for several months.&nbsp; We also researched the mechanism by which insect wings grow to a specific size and shape. Wing size is determined by a hormone called ecdysone, which stimulates cell division. The duration of ecdysone secretion during a developmental stage called the prepupa determines the size to which the wing will grow. Small-bodied animals secrete ecdysone for a briefer period than large-bodied animals which causes their wings to grow in the correct proportion to body size. The duration of ecdysone secretion is, in turn, affected by the same growth factor, myoglianin, by which larvae monitor their body size in relation to metamorphosis. Thus, myoglianin is an indicator of body size that controls when an insect will stop growing, and also controls the growth of wings in proportion to body size. Insects have a broad diversity of wing shapes. We discovered that the wing is divided into four compartments that are characterized by differences in the expression of several growth controlling genes.&nbsp; Growth in each of those four compartments is semi-independent of each other, and the particular degree of growth in length and width of those compartments determines the shape of a wing. The different wing shapes of different species come about by different degrees of growth in the four compartments.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"EndNoteBibliography\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"EndNoteBibliography\">We also studied the effect of nutrition on size and shape in insects and rats. In both cases, undernutrition slowed growth and also had significant effects on final size, and on the proportions of body parts. In insects we found that undernutrition and temporary starvation resulted in adults that were smaller than normally fed animals. Starvation also temporarily inhibited cell divisions in the growing wing. The wings of such small adults were not only smaller, but also differed in shape from those of normally fed individuals. We found that the changes in wing shape were specific to the time when starvation occurred, and it appears that starvation temporarily blocks growth in the wing compartment where cell divisions are taking place, and this alters the size and shape of the wing in a compartment-specific manner.
