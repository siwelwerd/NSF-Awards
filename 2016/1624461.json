 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mohonk Preserve is New York State's largest non-profit nature preserve with outdoor recreational and educational activities. Located 90 miles northwest of New York City on the Shawangunk Ridge in the Mid-Hudson Valley, the Preserve serves a regional and international set of researchers, educators, students, and recreationalists. The Preserve's research collection includes a unique body of materials spanning natural and cultural history, geology, archaeology, climatology, ecology, and land-use history in the Hudson Valley. Long-term datasets comprise one of the most extensive natural history (phenology), weather, and lake sampling records in North America.\r\n\r\nMohonk Preserve, in partnership with The Cary Institute and the State University of New York at New Paltz, will lead a community strategic visioning process for Mohonk Preserve's Daniel Smiley Research Center for the benefit of science, education, and outreach. The planning process will draw regional as well as international scientists, students, and citizens to participate in four workshops to explore ideas and methods by which the Preserve can build on the successes of its long-term data monitoring and collecting program to better serve an ever-expanding and more diverse network of research and educational stakeholders.  This process will catalyze new collaborations, syntheses, curricula, sharing of resources, and infrastructure investments in alignment with mission and strategic goals of Mohonk Preserve and partner institutions. The resulting expansion of research activities will benefit researchers of all academic levels, extend the scope of the Preserve's Daniel Smiley Research Center from local to regional and global, provide new learning opportunities for K-12 and undergraduate students, community recreationists, and citizen scientists, and increase outreach to visiting recreationalists.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nMohonk Preserve?s Daniel Smiley Research Center  (DSRC) strives to conduct and facilitate a broad range of scientific research.  In its role as a biological field station, the DSRC enables scientists from a diverse set of institutions and disciplines to conduct research.  The DSRC engaged in a strategic planning process to help identify strengths, opportunities, and challenges in better supporting the scientific community.  This stakeholder-driven process engaged research community members, educators, and field station leaders  through a series of workshops and site visits.  \n\n \n\nOne of the most important attributes identified by stakeholders is the DSRC?s long-term data holdings, the majority of which has been housed in an archival facility but not digitized.  Researchers and field station staff identified access to data, through digitization and publication in online open access sites such as the Environmental Data Initiative, and specimen curation portals such as those supported by iDigBio, as the primary and most urgent objectives.  The majority of workshop participants felt that making these extensive datasets easier to access would substantially increase their value to the research community as well as to the general community.  While developing protocols to accomplish digitization objectives, DSRC staff identified infrastructure needs and upgrades to the DSRC facility that would enhance the value of the field station as well as facilitate access to these data holdings.  \n\n \n\nWorkshop participants also recognized that, in order for the DSRC to better support research activities and engage with educators and community members, an upgrade to laboratory facilities and housing is needed.  These infrastructure improvements were deemed less urgent than the need to improve access to data, but Mohonk Preserve and the DSRC hope to upgrade laboratory space within the next five years.  Drawing on the existing strengths of the DSRC research activities, these laboratory upgrades will consist largely of providing space for field-based work as well as space for small field-based courses and workshops.  \n\n \n\nA repeating theme that emerged from these planning workshops is the DSRC history of engaging members of the community in Citizen Science activities.  This was identified as one of the major strengths of the organization, not only in regard to facilitating research, but also by providing ongoing education and engagement opportunities to members of the regional community.  These activities should be supported and enhanced wherever possible.  \n\n  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/12/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Kathleen C Weathers"
