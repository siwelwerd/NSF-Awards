 "awd_abstract_narration": "A membrane is a selective barrier that enables some small particles, molecules or ions to pass through but rejects others.  Membrane-based separations offer a number of advantages over conventional processes used in chemical separations.  They are often more energy efficient, more environmentally friendly, easier to scale-up for manufacturing, and more compatible with process streams, and thus provide lower-cost separation in a wide range of critical applications including sea water desalination, food and beverage production, pharmaceutical processing and blood dialysis.  The University of Colorado Boulder site of the MAST Center is focused on providing more advanced membranes for future separations needs as well as leading the development of new separations processes.  This work addresses critical national economic competitiveness, defense and health needs.\r\n\r\nThe MAST Center is a multi-campus industry-university collaborative research Center with the University of Colorado Boulder (UCB) as one of the three sites that (1) conduct fundamental and applied research in the field of membranes via innovative materials and processes to facilitate the use of membrane technology for current and emerging industrial applications; (2) sustain U.S. technological leadership in membrane materials and membrane-based separation processes and accelerate commercialization by Center industrial sponsors of novel, sustainable and innovative technologies; and (3) provide undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral researchers with a superior educational and research experience that will enable them to become productive and effective professionals.  Research at the UCB site is focused on the development of novel membrane materials and structures, innovative membrane characterization techniques and the generation of fundamental and applied knowledge regarding selective molecular transport mechanisms and membrane fouling.  The technical expertise represented by participating UCB faculty from five academic departments is focused on important membrane applications in water, energy, and barrier materials.",
