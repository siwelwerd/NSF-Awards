This conference brings together a diverse group of scientists from a wide variety of disciplines: physics, chemistry, biology, engineering, and medicine. The focus of the conference is on the merging of science and engineering using active and smart matter platforms. Examples of issues that will be addressed include how active and smart matter can help drive self-assembly to build self-replicating objects, and what physical interactions lead to observed patterns in systems whose constituents can communicate with each other. NSF support will enable the participation of 100 contributors, who might not otherwise be able to attend. Approximately one-third of the participants will be young researchers, graduate students and postdoctoral researchers, who will also benefit from mentorship activities during the conference.\r\n\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\n\r\nhe Division of Materials Research, the Division of Physics, and the Division of Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental, and Transport Systems contribute funds to this award that provides support for an Institute of Complex and Adaptive Matter conference on active and smart matter to be held at Syracuse University in June of 2016.
