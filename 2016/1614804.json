 "awd_abstract_narration": "The extraordinary successes achieved in the last years by bioinformatics, structural biology,\r\nand functional studies of proteins have produced an unprecedented amount of data that holds\r\npromise to shed light on the workings of these molecular machines. Paradoxically these successes\r\nhighlighted the fact that sequence, structure and function are linked together in a more subtle\r\nand complex way than previously thought. Specifically, protein families with recognizable\r\nsequence homology and strictly conserved architecture can show a huge functional heterogeneity,\r\nas in the case of voltage-gated-like ion channels (VGLCs).  The project's goal is to define a coherent theoretical framework to analyse both\r\nensembles of structures and sequences and apply it to the study of ion channel communications. \r\n\r\nThe project proposes to use the Blue Waters system to address this problem using a combination of  accurate free-energy\r\nMD calculations and statistical inference analysis of both trajectories and large multiple\r\nsequence alignment. The microscopic determinants of mechanical coupling will be identified\r\nwith the set of residue-residue interactions that are conserved along evolution and are responsible\r\nfor a specific, functionally oriented structural dynamics. The study will focus on two specific\r\nion channels families gated by different stimuli: transient receptor potential channels and\r\nvoltage gated cation channels.\r\n\r\nThe project, if successful, will bridge the gap in our understanding of molecular processes and neuronal responses, with the potential of significantly advancing large-scale initiatives like the BRAIN in the US and the HUMAN BRAIN in EU.  Additionally, the project provides opportunity to involve graduate and undergraduate students in a research\r\nactivity lying at the interface between the fields of data analytics and bio-molecular physical\r\nchemistry. Given the increased relevance of Big Data approaches to drug discovery and the\r\nemergence of precision medicine, the skillset and expertise acquired are expected to match\r\nthe future needs of industry and academia. Furthermore, student recruitment in the project will take advantage of two\r\ninitiatives. The first is a Professional Masters in Bioinformatics, where the PI is involved in\r\nall organizational aspects, from the steering committee to the design of Structural Bioinformatics\r\nclasses. The second is the MARC U-STAR program designed to mentor underrepresented groups\r\nin research, providing financial assistance to prepare students for competitive graduate programs.",
