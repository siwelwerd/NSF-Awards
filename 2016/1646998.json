The conference provides an unparalleled opportunity for students to take in the latest topics of current research interest.

The social program is designed to foster interaction between participants of all symposia, thus offering students opportunities to expose themselves to emerging trends that might not be readily accessible in their home laboratories, alongside interaction with other researchers working in related fields, aiming to promote cross-fertilization of ideas.  The conference will also bestow a Best Student Paper award, to be determined based on judges' notes of all papers and posters presented by students.",
