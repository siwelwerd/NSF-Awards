 "awd_abstract_narration": "As part of its overall strategy to enhance learning in informal environments, the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program funds innovative resources for use in a variety of settings. This proposed effort embraces broad participation by several Native American Ute tribes, the History Colorado Museum of Natural History, and scientists in the field of archaeology to investigate and integrate traditional ecological knowledge and contemporary Western science. The project will preserve knowledge from the Ute peoples of Colorado and Utah, including traditional technology, ethnobotany, engineering and math. Results from this project will inform educational efforts in similar communities.\r\n\r\nThis project will build on the long-standing collaborations between History Colorado (HC), the Southern Ute Indian Tribe, Ute Mountain Ute Tribe and Ute Indian Tribe, Uintah & Ouray Reservation, and the Dominguez Archaeological Research Group DARG). HC will implement and evaluate a regional informal learning collaboration focused on Ute traditional and contemporary STEM knowledge serving over 128,000 learners through tribal programs, local history museums and educational networks. This project will advance the understanding of integrated knowledge and the role of Ute people as STEM learners and practitioners. This Informal Science Learning project will increase lifelong STEM learning in rural communities and create a replicable model for collaboration among tribes, history museums, and scientists.",

Ute tribal members were thought to offer lived experience, direct ties to the past, authenticity, respect, nuance, and detail. Scientists were considered contributors of research, scientific rigor, mastery of methodologies or techniques, depth, and detail. Museums and museum staff were perceived as having the ability to connect with a broader audience. \n-Discussions were seen as a positive method of gaining a fuller picture.\n\n \nGoal 2: Increase lifelong STEM learning across Colorado.\nProject activities focus on introducing and sharing Ute TEK and STEM connections to a wide range of audiences, in a variety of settings, in many different Colorado communities. The team created series of short films, museum exhibitions in Montrose and Denver, a Ute ethnobotany garden in Montrose, a small traveling exhibition at the three Ute tribes and community museums, 100+ copies of a hands&ndash;on K&ndash;12 education program, educator trainings, and public programs.\n\n \nSelect Findings:\n-Exhibit visitors made the connection between TEK and STEM. When asked to describe the Ute STEM interactive area of the exhibit, one visitor said, \"Integration of Native knowledge and modern science.\"\n-Exhibit visitors were able to articulate a variety of examples of Ute knowledge and skills. A visitor stated, \"Making a tipi is engineering. [Beadwork] patterns are math.\"\n-Students made connections directly related to Ute STEM desired outcomes during the hands-on program.\n-Teachers indicated that the program influenced how they might approach teaching about the Ute people and other Native people in the future.\n-More than 85 percent of teachers reported that their students continued to talk about the program afterward.\n\n \nGoal 3: Share a replicable model of collaboration between tribes, history  museums, and scientists. Project activities documented and shared lessons learned, best practices for collaboration, and replicable approaches with broader audiences, in order to inspire and inform their own work. These audiences included local and national networks of tribes, other history and science museums, archaeologists, and other scientists.\n\n \nSelect Findings:\nAs the team continues to work with our partners to capture and share lessons learned and best practices from this  project, a few key topics of interest have emerged:\n1. Recognizing the importance of place\n2. Embracing the unexpected and exploring alternatives\n3. Using best practices for tribal-museum collaboration\n4. Budgeting for a collaborative project involving tribes\nFinally, centering our Ute partners in all aspects of the evaluation was essential.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/24/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Elizabeth M Cook"
