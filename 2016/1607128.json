 "awd_abstract_narration": "Gamma-rays are the highest energy form of electromagnetic radiation.  Observations of astrophysical gamma-rays serve as probes of physical conditions and processes in the most extreme environments throughout the Universe, and can be used to test fundamental physics.  The Very Energetic Radiation Imaging Telescope Array System (VERITAS), located in southern Arizona, is a ground-based observatory designed to study high energy gamma-rays.  VERITAS has unique capabilities, providing high sensitivity pointed observations of both galactic and extragalactic sources.  This award provides funding to continue VERITAS operations.  During this time the Observatory will complete a program designed to address themes in Particle Physics and Fundamental Laws, Black Holes, Cosmology, and Galactic Particle Accelerators.  This award will also support the VERITAS collaboration efforts to engage the public in science.  These include collaboration with the Whipple Observatory Visitors Center to promote VERITAS science to the public, other educators, museum professionals and the wider community.  \r\n\r\nVERITAS is an array of four 12-meter atmospheric-Cherenkov Telescopes. VERITAS seeks both to identify new sources of high energy gamma rays, and to perform in-depth studies of the known sources to better understand their underlying fundamental processes. The primary targets of VERITAS Galactic observations are supernova remnants, pulsars, binary systems, and sources whose classification is unknown. The extragalactic targets observed by VERITAS include active galactic nuclei, radio galaxies, starburst galaxies, galaxy clusters, globular clusters and gamma-ray bursts. In addition, Local Group galaxies, the Galactic Center and dwarf spheroidal galaxies and are targets of VERITAS observations focused on the indirect detection of cold dark matter.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n    VERITAS is the world\u2019s most-sensitive very-high-energy (VHE; E &gt; 100 GeV) gamma-ray observatory, and is located in southern Arizona.  This award from the NSF partially supported the experimental operations of the VERITAS telescope array and the array facility for the purposes of astrophysical research from 2016-2020. The support covered the project\u2019s tenth through fourteenth season of operation. VERITAS remains operational and in excellent condition and support is identified to operate the facility through at least 2022.  \n    A recent external review (NSF PA-CP) concluded the VERITAS collaboration of ~80 scientists \"provided a compelling case for Very High Energy (VHE) gamma-ray observations, as key steps towards understanding the most energetic processes operating in the Universe\", and that the project\u2019s \"discovery potential is significant\".  The scientific operation of VERITAS was very strong during the award period and the NSF PA-CP panel stated \"The VERITAS observatory &hellip; has been tremendously productive.\" Overall, the VERITAS collaboration has reported the detection of 64 astrophysical sources of VHE gamma rays, belonging to ~8 different source classes.  The VERITAS catalog increased by ~10% (7 objects) during the award period, and it represents about one-third of the entire VHE catalog. All VERITAS results are published in high-impact factor, peer-reviewed journals.  The VERITAS collaboration has published 115 refereed journal articles and has produced 71 PhD theses.
