 "awd_abstract_narration": "Providing reliable clean water is essential for the health and prosperity of communities. Our society, however, frequently faces the disastrous consequences of decisions made without considering their socio-economic context or the interdependency of critical infrastructure systems and services. Examples include incidents of poisonous algae in the water supply in Toledo, OH in summer 2014 and more recently, the lead contaminated water in Flint, MI which led to a declaration of a State of Emergency by the federal government. A common observation is that decisions that are primarily based on short-term cost considerations, such as those made by many municipal and city offices when facing resource constraints, can exacerbate water problems rather than improve them. This transdisciplinary research develops a water infrastructure investment decision support (WIIDS) model, calibrated with a rich repository of data. WIIDS places sustainable water services in a broad socioeconomic context that considers the inherent interdependencies of systems and interactions with the contractual, physical, and service infrastructures essential to communities. \r\n\r\nThis research formulates an advanced decision model that builds on a large repository of data to support water-related decisions at different levels. Particularly, the model describes the interdependencies of water systems, road systems (that provide mobility of people and goods while applying loads on the water pipes via mechanical and environmental processes), and the contractual systems (that affect community service decisions that influence the durability of water pipes). The model consists of two distinct parts. One is an engineering sub-model that uses historical data and forecast conditions to predict the probability of failure and the associated costs for the selected sections of water supply infrastructure. Another is a socioeconomic sub-model that utilizes input from the engineering sub-model along with current and forecast business impacts, traffic impact, community demographics, and critical infrastructures (e.g., hospitals, schools) to provide holistic repair/replace/reroute recommendations. The model allows comparisons among alternative decisions (e.g. reactive vs predictive maintenance) considering social costs, indirect economic costs, and public health implications besides the direct solution costs.",

While the application of deicers benefits the safety and mobility on winter roads, this introduces a substantial amount of chloride salts into the environment. The most commonly used salts in roadway deicing or anti-icing include sodium chloride, magnesium chloride, and calcium chloride. Significant increase in the chloride concentration(up to 1,000 mg/L) has been observed in field studies, and the influence of deicing salt can reach as far as hundreds of meters. The fate and transport of deicers in the natural environment are inherently stochastic, because they are affected by traffic characteristics, road type and surface condition, weather conditions, hydraulic properties of the soil, vegetation, and depth and fluctuation of the groundwater level. Similarly, the localized corrosion of metal pipes buried in roadside environment is inherently stochastic, because of various uncertainties related to the factors that define the risk of corrosion.</p>\n<p>In this context, this project aimed to establish the baseline understanding of how roadway deicers affect the structural integrity of buried water pipes, through experimental studies of how typical chloride-based deicers migrate through soils and they subsequently cause the pitting corrosion of carbon steel (a material used for the pipes). The experimental data were then used to establish one model for the deicer fate and transport and another model for the deicer corrosion of steel. To mitigate the corrosion risk of chloride salts, we also developed a patented technology that extracts \"green chemicals\" from various agro wastes (e.g., apple pomace, grape pamace, and waste leaves of peony, dandelion or sugarbeet) and then blends them with salt brine to produde \"greener\" deicers.</p>\n<p>Through this grant, we developed a model to predict how sodium chloride, magenesium chloride, and the blend of sodium chloride with \"green chemicals\" migrate through typical roadside soils. We developed another model to predict how the subsequent leachates from the soils corrode the carbon steel and thus affect the service life of buried steel pipes. The intellectural merits of our work also lie in the patented technology where we developed a zero-waste process to derive various molecules (\"active ingredients\") out of agro feedstock and demonstrated new chemistry as renewable corrosion inhibitors for salt brine.
