 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project seeks to develop millennium-length estimates of the strength of Asian monsoon atmospheric circulation and to infer variability in past monsoon circulation from replicated, annually-resolved stable oxygen isotope (\u00e418-O) time series from the long-lived southeast Asian conifer Fokienia hodginsii in Vietnam and Laos.  The research leverages a previously supported pilot study that demonstrated that tree-ring \u00e418-O from this species in this region responds to broad-scale patterns of Asian monsoon circulation that are consistent with climate dynamics, known controls on the stable isotopes of precipitation, and the physical and chemical mechanisms comprising the study of isotope dendroclimatology.\r\n\r\nThe potential broader impacts include supporting undergraduates in the planned research and providing a potentially important new archive of data from a climatologically sensitive region.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Asian Monsoon is a dominant feature of global atmospheric circulation, controlling regional climate variability in south, southeast, and east Asia and even influencing Africa and other more distant regions.  Failure of the monsoon results in drought and potentially devastating consequences for the over one billion people that directly or indirectly depend on its rainfall for subsistence and for their economic well-being. For instance, drought and famine in Asia in the late 19th century, associated with monsoon failure and strong El Nino events, resulted in the deaths of perhaps 60 million people in India and China alone, and a political and economic legacy that is still reflected in modern geopolitics.  Today, monsoon failure or monsoon flooding can cause agricultural, economic, and sociopolitical consequences that ripple across the entire globe. \n\n\nIn this project we sought to understand how the strength of the Asian monsoon circulation varies in response to variability in the climate system across a range of time scales from interannual to long-term century-scale trends.  To do this we used precision measurements of the oxygen locked into the wood of annual rings of trees in southeast Asia over the last five centuries.  Because trees use the oxygen bound up in water molecules to construct the wood that makes up their stem, we can trace changes in the amount and origin of water arriving in southeast Asia during the monsoon by measuring the chemical composition of the annual rings of trees growing the region.  We developed replicated, annual time series of oxygen isotopes in two locations in Viet Nam and used these data to analyse the large-scale controls on the strength of the monsoon circulation.  We found that monsoon circulation as recorded in these annual tree rings reflects the influence of ocean and atmosphere processes across the Indian and Pacific Ocean region, including the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) system.  Evidence of decadal, centennial, and secular trends in monsoon strength inferred from oxygen isotopes in trees demonstrates the importance of low frequency modes of variability in the climate system and specifically their impact on the Asian monsoon system.  Our data confirm counter-intuitive yet physically-based projections for a weakening of monsoon atmospheric circulation even as enhanced moisture availability leads to increased total rainfall amounts, as well as the opposite condition - an enhancement of monsoon circulation strength during an extended decadal-scale drought in the 18th century across southeast Asia.  We use a combination of forward numerical modeling and state-of-the-art climate models to provide physical, dynamical, and consistent mechanistic support to our statistical analysis.  Our results not only elucidate time scales of monsoon circulation variability that are not available from the limited observational record, but they also provide the opportunity to test climate models used for future projections against inferred large-scale ocean and atmosphere processes in the past. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/12/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Kevin J Anchukaitis"
