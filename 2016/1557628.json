 "awd_abstract_narration": "Astronomers have studied the radio waves that come to us from the universe since the 1930s.  One \r\nfascinating phenomenon that has been measured in radio light is a faint, diffuse glow which covers the \r\nentire sky.  This glow is best described as the \"Radio Synchrotron Background\", where the term \r\n\"synchrotron\" refers to particles making radio waves when they spin around magnetic fields.  Interest in the \"Radio \r\nSynchrotron Background\" has been rekindled recently because of new measurements.  This radio glow \r\npresents a mystery because it is difficult to explain how it came to be there with known astrophysical \r\nprocesses.  It represents one of the mysteries of contemporary astrophysics.  While there have been \r\nmany publications in the literature on this topic, there has not yet been a scientific workshop.  \r\n\r\nWe will hold the first scientific workshop on the radio synchrotron background, which will bring \r\ntogether scientists working in these overlapping fields to discuss the radio synchrotron background in \r\nperson for the first time.  There are implications for many areas of active research in contemporary \r\nastrophysics.  The workshop will inspire new collaborations and new lines of inquiry, and may spur \r\nfuture meetings on the topic.  This project funds travel support toward allowing scientists to attend the \r\nworkshop as well as for a talk for the public and for a report for the scientific community on the \r\noutcome of the meeting.  The workshop will be held at the University of Richmond.  \r\n\r\nThe Radio Synchrotron Background is a newly re-appreciated astrophysical phenomenon which has been \r\na subject of great interest to many in the community. Combining the ARCADE 2 balloon-based absolute \r\nspectrum data from 3-90 GHz with absolutely calibrated single-dish diffuse radio surveys at lower \r\nfrequencies reveals a radio synchrotron excess that is several times brighter than was expected by \r\nmany.  The origin of the radio synchrotron background is one of the mysteries of contemporary \r\nastrophysics.  It is difficult to produce the observed level of surface brightness by known processes \r\nwithout violating constraints.  \r\n\r\nThe existence of the radio background at the observed levels presents profound challenges for our \r\ncurrent understanding of radio emission in the Galaxy and the universe.  As demonstrated in many \r\nrecent publications, there are implications for many areas of astrophysics, including cosmic ray \r\npropagation, galactic and extragalactic magnetic fields, the radio to far-infrared correlation, radio source \r\ncounts, X-ray source counts, quasar luminosity functions, dark matter annihilation, polarization of \r\nforegrounds in microwave background maps, population III stars, mergers of clusters, and many more.   \r\n\r\nThe workshop will feature plenary sessions made up of multiple presentations by attendees \r\ninterspersed with and question and discussion periods centered around different topics that study of \r\nthe radio synchrotron background touches.  The visual component of individual presentations, in the \r\nform of PDF, PowerPoint, or similar files will be made available on the Web.  Additionally, a report will \r\nbe prepared for the scientific community on the outcome of the meeting.  The priorities identified in the \r\nreport will be determined by consensus of the meeting attendees as synthesized by the organizing \r\ncommittee.  Finally, new collaborations and working relationships will be established.",
