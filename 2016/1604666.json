 "awd_abstract_narration": "Rechargeable lithium ion batteries help to enable sustainable energy systems by storing electricity generated by intermittent renewable resources such as wind and solar energy, or by powering zero-emission electric vehicles charged by electricity from renewable resources.  Lithium-ion batteries are comprised of a variety of materials for storing and releasing ions, transporting electrical charge, and maintaining mechanical integrity.  Binder materials, although representing less than 10% of the battery by weight, are an important component for maintaining adhesion between the different materials.  This collaborative project will develop a new class of binding materials based on polymers that are both conductive and electrochemically active, enhancing both mechanical and electrochemical properties. The scientific research will establish the principles for the design of electroactive polymeric binders for lithium ion batteries.  The key innovation is that the polymer material will be designed at the molecular level to enable these electroactive properties.  When properly designed at the molecular level, these polymers have potential to improve the stability and performance of a wide range of battery electrodes.  The educational activities associated with this project will provide opportunities for community college students to work on the development of conjugated polymers for energy storage.  Furthermore, outreach activities to K-12 students from diverse and underrepresented groups are planned through Chemistry Open House, Empowering Leadership Alliance, Schlumberger Energy Institute, and the Sally Ride Festival.\r\n\r\nIn lithium ion battery systems, polymeric binders provide adhesion with various electrode components and stabilize contact with the current collector.  However, current binders are electronically inactive. Substantial improvements in electrode performance and capacity may be possible through the molecular design of electroactive polymeric binders.  Towards this end, polymeric binders that are ion-conducting, electron-conducting, and redox-active as well as mechanically stable, are needed. The goal of this research is to develop and understand the functionality of the polymer materials needed to enable these properties. The research plan will consider polymers that contain electronically conductive backbones, side chains for self-doping and ionic conductivity, and redox-active carbonyl groups.  The research plan has three objectives.  The first objective is to synthesize co-polymers that conduct both ions and electrons simultaneously, and characterize their resulting structural, physiochemical, and electrochemical properties. The second objective is to characterize the electrochemical/mechanical properties of hybrid anodes containing a silicon base material and polymer binders developed under the first objective.  The third objective is to incorporate redox-active groups into the polymer backbone and examine their role on conductive polymer binder properties.  Through this approach, this work seeks to establish the fundamental properties that influence conductivity, mechanical integrity, and electrochemical activity of the polymeric materials to suggest design rules for electroactive binders that are compatible with a broad range of electrode materials.",

Increasing the size, capacity, and reliability of batteries would enable us to increase our use of renewable sources of energy and improve our overall energy efficiency. However, most rechargeable batteries are significantly limited in both capacity and reliability. The goal of this project was to develop new materials that could lead to better, higher capacity rechargeable lithium ion batteries. The focus was specifically on the development of polymeric binders. Polymer binders are minority components of rechargeable batteries, typically less than 10 percent of the electrode, but they play an important role in battery performance and stability, in particular for high-capacity batteries. The binders serve as a glue, holding the battery electrode together during multiple charge and discharge cycle. They are therefore critical to the stability of the battery and can also impact the overall capacity for energy storage. Our work focused on the development of multi-functional binders. In addition to holding the electrode together, the binders we developed also improve electronic and/or ionic conductivity, provide additional capacity for lithium ion storage, and provide other novel and potentially beneficial properties. The intellectual merit of this work is in establishing structure-property relationships that can advance the development of multi-functional polymer binders for use in high-capacity battery electrodes, the discovery of new materials for use as binders or in electrodes, and a greater understanding of failure mechanisms in high-capacity battery electrodes. The broader impacts include educating students and researchers from various levels and backgrounds and advancing technologies that may eventually lead to high-capacity energy storage devices. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Our work focused on a range of polymeric materials for use as binders or electrodes. For example, we studied polymer binders that can effectively transport both electrons and ions, characteristics that are typically lacking in conventional polymeric binders. These materials improved capacity and stability, and demonstrated a general route to more effective polymeric binders. We also studied a low-cost polymer typically used in oilfield operations, and showed that it could also be used effectively as a binder for high-capacity energy storage. Its excellent performance was attributed to strong adhesive properties. We also studied a naturally occurring small molecule tannic acid. This material also exhibited excellent performance due to its strong adhesion and self-healing properties enabled by multiple hydrogen bonds.</p>\n<p>Beyond studying and developing polymer binders, our work also focused on polymers which could serve as the active material in a battery by reacting directly with lithium ions. By engineering the molecular structure of these polymers, we were able to increase the ion mobility and, as a result, significantly enhance the capacity of these materials to store lithium ions. We showed that these reactive polymers could function as electrodes without any additional additives and they exhibited a capacity for extremely rapid and reversible charging and discharging. These reactive polymers can potentially lead to lightweight, fast-charging, and renewable batteries for energy storage.</p>\n<p>The project also supported a number of educational and outreach activities. Four graduate students completed or will complete their PhD due to work on this project and partial support from this grant. One postdoctoral associate researcher was supported by this grant and will pursue a future career in academic engineering research. Several undergraduate students participated in the research, including Houston Community College undergraduate students working as part of a summer internship program. Outreach activities included lab tours, lectures, and demonstrations to middle school and high school students as part of the Energy Explorations Academy and Young Owls Leadership Program at Rice University.
