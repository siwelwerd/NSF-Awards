 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a project that will compile a geographic database linking place name data found on historic Alaskan maps, manuscripts, and within oral histories and printed materials. The project builds on the existing, proven infrastructure of the Exchange for Local Observations of and Knowledge of the Arctic (ELOKA) project to create a sustainable platform accessible to both current and future researchers and community members. A collaborative approach brings together researchers with expertise in Alaska Native languages and geography (Gary Holton) and in web-based mapping and visualization applications for traditional knowledge (Peter Pulsifer). \r\n\r\nLinking place names with maps and manuscripts allows for a greater time depth in place name research, since the archival record for Alaska Native languages stretches back some three centuries. Rather than viewing place names as lists of disassociated points, the integrative approach adopted here reveals connections between configurations of named places and socio-ecological dimensions of landscape, thus providing insights into biological and cultural diversity, adaptation and resilience, and cultural values and ecosystem services within the context of environmental change. In particular, this project provides a foundation for biocultural diversity research at the local level, avoiding subjectively-defined ethnic and linguistic boundaries. By comparing current and traditional resource use, ecosystem services can be understood, helping to inform policy and management decisions.\r\n\r\nThe open and extensible platform developed by this project will provide a foundation for use by both researchers and community members.  The web-based platform and associated mobile apps provided can be easily navigated by K-12 students, yielding opportunities to incorporate geographic and environmental learning directly into the classroom. At the same time, the project framework has full GIS capabilities, allowing users to access geolinguistic datasets with analytical tools of their own choosing.   The long-term institutional commitments by the two collaborating institutions positions this project to grow into the standard repository for Indigenous place name data in Alaska.",

A given place may have many different names, each revealing a bit of knowledge held by the namer and the user of that name. For example, the highest peak may be referred to as Mt. McKinley, commemorating a particular individual; but it may also be referred to by an Alaska Native name, Denali, emphasizing its geography (literally, &lsquo;the high one&rsquo; in the Denaakk&rsquo;e language). Official place names in Alaska have been well documented and are catalogued by the US Geological Survey. Some of those names are also Native names, or else derive from Native names. For example, the official name Susitna River derives from the Dena&rsquo;ina name </span><em>Susitnu</em><span>, meaning literally &lsquo;sand river&rsquo;. But the vast majority of Native place names in Alaska are not documented or catalogued in any regular or official way. Instead, the recording of Native names has been haphazard and uncoordinated, carried out by various federal and state agencies, academics, and Native organizations. Documentation has focused on particular regions or communities, and there is often no effort to achieve comprehensive coverage. Most notably, there is no centralized repository of Native names. Most records of Alaska Native place names remain unpublished and not publicly available. As knowledge of these names decreases with the ongoing shift from Native languages toward English, there is great risk that the documentation of Native place names will be lost.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>This project was motivated by this concern, with a primary goal of creating a comprehensive and enduring record of Alaska Native place names. Conservative estimates place the number of Alaska Native place names at over 50,000, nearly twice the number of official English names which have been recorded. As an initial effort, this project focused on gathering comprehensive documentation for four linguistic areas: Gwich&rsquo;in, Koyukon (Denaakk&rsquo;e), Tanana, and Eyak (dAXunhyuu). In addition, the project sought to connect map data with relevant historical and cultural data, including photographs, archival recordings, and language information. While many tools exist for storing location data alongside multimedia, most are proprietary and do not meet standards for long-term archival preservation. Working in collaboration with the Exchange for Local Observations and Knowledge of the Arctic (ELOKA), this project developed multimedia place name atlas for the four target communities using the open source Nunaliit Atlas Framework. The atlases provide an enduring record of Alaska Native place names and associated information, including pronunciation files, story recording, photographs and videos. The altases will be maintained in perpetuity and are accessible via the ELOKA site, eloka-arctic.org. A key feature of these atlases is that they can be edited and revised directly by local communities.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>While there is still much work to be done to create a pan-Alaska place name database, this project has taken a first step in that direction. As part of the project, working in collaboration with Bristol Bay Native Corporation, the first statewide place names summit was held, drawing more than 150 stakeholders from across Alaska. A white paper was developed which makes recommendations for creating an Alaska Native place names registry. Several people received training in developing applications to gain official recognition for Alaska Native names, and over the course of the project, dozens of Alaska Native names have been adopted as official names by the US Board of Geographic Names. For example, the Gwich&rsquo;in name <em>Teedrinjik </em>was officially adopted to replace the name Chandalar, and the Inupiaq name <em>Utqia&#289;vik</em> was adopted to replace Barrow. Native names are increasingly visible on signage across Alaska.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 02/24/2025<br>\nModified by: Gary&nbsp;Holton</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1624365/1624365_10339234_1740422674700_Eyak_graffit--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1624365/1624365_10339234_1740422674700_Eyak_graffit--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Eyak Place Name Grafitti\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1624365/1624365_10339234_1740422674700_Eyak_graffit--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Eyak Place Name Grafitti\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Eyak place name dlaasha'L carved in fungi by young language learner.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Gary Holton</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Gary&nbsp;Holton\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Eyak Place Name Grafitti</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1624365/1624365_10339234_1740422228117_Eyak_Village__Burial_Ground_and_Place_Names_Heritage_Complex--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1624365/1624365_10339234_1740422228117_Eyak_Village__Burial_Ground_and_Place_Names_Heritage_Complex--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Eyak names in Cordova, Alaska\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1624365/1624365_10339234_1740422228117_Eyak_Village__Burial_Ground_and_Place_Names_Heritage_Complex--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Eyak names in Cordova, Alaska\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Arial view of modern Cordova, Alaska, with Eyak locations and names indicated</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">David Guilfoyle</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Gary&nbsp;Holton\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Eyak names in Cordova, Alaska</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1624365/1624365_10339234_1740422429666_gwi_atlas2--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1624365/1624365_10339234_1740422429666_gwi_atlas2--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Gwich'in Place Name Atlas\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1624365/1624365_10339234_1740422429666_gwi_atlas2--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Gwich'in Place Name Atlas\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Screen shot of example entry in Gwich'in atlas</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Gary Holton</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Gary&nbsp;Holton\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Gwich'in Place Name Atlas</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1624365/1624365_10339234_1740422354627_gwi_atlas1--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1624365/1624365_10339234_1740422354627_gwi_atlas1--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Gwich'in Place Name Atlas\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1624365/1624365_10339234_1740422354627_gwi_atlas1--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Gwich'in Place Name Atlas\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Screen shot of home page of Gwich'in atlas</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Gary Holton</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Gary&nbsp;Holton\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Gwich'in Place Name Atlas</div>\n</div>\n</li></ul>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n",
