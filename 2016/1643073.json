The BLS serves as the focal point for a wide range of technical and policy topics in the life sciences, including genomics, biodiversity conservation, bioterrorism, and key topics in basic biological and biomedical research, such as synthetic biology, the microbiome, and neuroscience. The BLS organizes and oversees studies that provide advice to government and the scientific community on the biological sciences and their impact on society. The BLS also oversees important studies on the improvement of biology education, particularly at the undergraduate level, and the maintenance of a robust life sciences workforce. More information can be found at: http://dels.nas.edu/bls/.\r\n\r\nSupport from this award will allow the BLS to: 1) hold one Board meeting per year, and 2) support staff time to develop topics for new studies and other projects and perform tasks related to completed studies. These functions are critical to the function and nature of the BLS.",
