 "awd_abstract_narration": "As part of its overall strategy to enhance learning in informal environments, the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program funds innovative resources for use in a variety of settings. This Research in Service to Practice project will examine how a wide range of pre-college out-of-school-time activities facilitate or hinder females' participation in STEM fields in terms of interest, identity, and career choices. The study will address the ongoing problem that, despite females' persistence to degree once declaring a major in college, initially fewer females than males choose a STEM career path. To uncover what these factors might be, this study will look at the extent to which college freshmen's pre-college involvement in informal activities (e.g., science clubs, internships, shadowing of STEM professionals, museum-going, engineering competitions, citizen science pursuits, summer camps, and hobbies) is associated with their career aspirations and avocational STEM interests and pursuits. While deep-seated factors, originating in culture and gender socialization, sometimes lower females' interest in STEM throughout schooling, this study will examine the degree to which out-of-school-time involvement ameliorates the subtle messages females encounter about women and science that can interfere with their aspiration to a STEM careers.  \r\n\r\nThe Social Cognitive Career Theory will serve as the theoretical framework to connect the development of interest in STEM with students' later career choices. An epidemiological approach will be used to test a wide range of hypotheses garnered from a review of relevant literature, face-to-face or telephone interviews with stakeholders, and retrospective online surveys of students. These hypotheses, as well as questions about the students' demographic background and in-school experiences, will be incorporated into the main empirical instrument, which will be a comprehensive paper-and-pencil survey to be administered in classes, such as English Composition, that are compulsory for both students with STEM interests and those without by 6500 students entering 40 large and small institutions of higher learning. Data analysis will proceed from descriptive statistics, such as contingency tables and correlation matrices, to multiple regression and hierarchical modeling that will link out-of-school-time experiences to STEM interest, identity, and career aspirations. Factor analysis will be used to combine individual out-of-school activities into indices. Propensity score weighting will be used to estimate causal effects in cases where out-of-school-time activities may be confounded with other factors. The expected products will be scholarly publications and presentations. Results will be disseminated to out-of-school-time providers and stakeholders, educators, and educational researchers through appropriate-level journals and national meetings and conferences. In addition, the Public Affairs and Information Office of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics will assist with communicating results through mainstream media. Press releases will be available through academic outlets and Op-Ed pieces for newspapers. The expected outcome will be research-based evidence about which types of out-of-school STEM experiences may be effective in increasing young females' STEM interests. This information will be crucial to educators, service providers, as well as policy makers who work toward broadening the participation of females in STEM.",

We sampled 15,725 students at 119 U.S. institutions (76 4-year and 43 2-year institutions). Among the participants, 54.6% identified as female.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This retrospective cohort study asked students to recall a detailed variety of OST experiences. They were surveyed about their participation in 60 specific STEM activities (both structured and unstructured) and opportunities within these activities. Students were also asked about their interest in pursuing a number of different careers at the beginning of middle school, the beginning of high school, the end of high school, and the beginning of college as well as about their STEM interest and STEM identity.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The study identified significant gender differences in <strong>OST participation</strong>. Whereas males had higher participation rates than females in the majority of OST activities, females, at all grade levels, were more likely than males to participate in the following unstructured activities: exploring nature including collecting things; photographing nature; observing or studying weather or stars; observing training or raising animals; gardening; and cooking or baking. They were also more likely than males to participate in science fairs and group organizations (such as scouting) during grades 5-8, and more likely than males to tour, work, volunteer, or job shadow in a STEM related setting or participate in STEM related career days in grades 9-12. The study also explored barriers to participation in out-of-school (OST) programs. For both boys and girls, the most common reason for not participating in OST activities was lack of awareness about those opportunities. However, females were more likely than males to mention not feeling welcome, lacking resources, and lacking interest.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We found that participation in the following activities increased females&rsquo; (but not males&rsquo;) <strong>interest in STEM</strong> between middle school and high school: STEM related career days; extracurricular clubs; maker/DIY events; job shadowing; STEAM activities (programs with art or design components); summer academic research programs; tours of STEM places; and volunteering in a STEM setting. The following opportunities commonly afforded within OST activities also increased females&rsquo; STEM interest: taking on a leadership role; mentoring younger students; using STEM equipment; carrying out a STEM project; presenting data to others; working with others in a team; and working on real world STEM issues. Other opportunities increased both males&rsquo; and females&rsquo; interest in STEM: interacting with a STEM mentor, role model, or someone in a STEM career; working with older STEM students and participating in hands-on activities.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Participating often in the following activities during grades 9-12 predicted <strong>STEM identity</strong> for both males and females: working/volunteering in a STEM setting; STEM internships; job shadowing; touring a STEM setting; attending STEM career days; academic/research summer programs; STEM leadership conferences; and OST STEM courses or workshops. Four activities that were found to boost STEM identity more strongly for females than for males include: STEM clubs outside of school; STEM programs that collect data such as Citizen Science; STEM vacation or summer camps; and STEM cafes. In these cases, females who participated frequently had a stronger STEM identity than did their male counterparts whereas, among the non-participants, the males showed a higher level of STEM identity.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Students&rsquo; <strong>interest in a STEM career</strong> varied over their academic progression from middle school into college. Prior STEM career intentions were strongly associated with an increased likelihood of continuing to intend a STEM career. Whereas males were consistently more likely than females to be interested in a STEM career at the beginning of middle school, the beginning of high school, and the end of high school, activities that predicted STEM career intention during middle school and high school, equally for boys and girls, included reading science fiction, using STEM toys/kits, and interacting with someone in STEM.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In sum, the project generated a nuanced picture of OST STEM participation by gender. Rather than finding a general dearth of female participation in these activities, we identified a number of activities in which girls were overrepresented suggesting that the stereotypical distancing of young females from STEM has been weakening. The project further generated evidence about which types and characteristics of earlier OST activities were positively associated with students&rsquo; STEM interest, identity, and career plans at the beginning of college. Importantly. many of these positive effects were similar for boys and girls. All these project results constitute useful information for OST providers and others who are interested in strengthening females&rsquo; affinity to, and broadening their participation in, STEM.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/30/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Philip&nbsp;M&nbsp;Sadler</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1612375/1612375_10451530_1640747971123_Image1(PrimaryImage)--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1612375/1612375_10451530_1640747971123_Image1(PrimaryImage)--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Title: Students' Interest in STEM Careers Over Time\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1612375/1612375_10451530_1640747971123_Image1(PrimaryImage)--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Title: Students' Interest in STEM Careers Over Time\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Interest over time of all students who indicated an interest in a STEM career at least once during the four time periods</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Harvard University</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Philip&nbsp;M&nbsp;Sadler</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Title: Students' Interest in STEM Careers Over Time</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1612375/1612375_10451530_1640749344541_Image2OutcomesReport--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1612375/1612375_10451530_1640749344541_Image2OutcomesReport--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Female Participation in Unstructured OST Activities\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1612375/1612375_10451530_1640749344541_Image2OutcomesReport--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Female Participation in Unstructured OST Activities\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Likelihood of females to participate in unstructured OST activities when compared to males</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Harvard University</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Philip&nbsp;M&nbsp;Sadler</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Female Participation in Unstructured OST Activities</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1612375/1612375_10451530_1640749745036_Image3OutcomesReport--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1612375/1612375_10451530_1640749745036_Image3OutcomesReport--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Female Participation in Structured OST Activities\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1612375/1612375_10451530_1640749745036_Image3OutcomesReport--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Female Participation in Structured OST Activities\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Likelihood of females to participate in structured OST activities when compared to males</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Harvard University</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Philip&nbsp;M&nbsp;Sadler</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Female Participation in Structured OST Activities</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1612375/1612375_10451530_1640750302717_Image4OutomesReport--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1612375/1612375_10451530_1640750302717_Image4OutomesReport--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Barriers to Participation in OST Activities\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1612375/1612375_10451530_1640750302717_Image4OutomesReport--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Barriers to Participation in OST Activities\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Reasons for not participating in out-of-school time programs or activities by gender</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Harvard University</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Philip&nbsp;M&nbsp;Sadler</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Barriers to Participation in OST Activities</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
