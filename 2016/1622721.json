In the worst case, according to the predictions of some numerical models, climate change could cause large reductions in rainfall that could cause the collapse of Amazon forests. Critically needed to allow us to understand whether these models are realistic are observations of forest responses to real-world drought.  This RAPID project will measure the amount of carbon dioxide from the air above the forest that is captured by the forest, along with measurements of tree growth and death during and after the unusually strong El Nino event that is now causing drought, high temperatures, and fires across the eastern region of the Amazon along the equator. The project will be carried out in collaboration with many Brazilian scientists and students who are also working at this location. \r\n\r\nNet ecosystem exchange of carbon dioxide, latent heat and sensible head will be made from the km67 eddy flux tower in the Tapaj\u00f3s forest near the city of Santar\u00e9m, Brazil. This site has the longest combined eddy flux and forest tree dynamics record in an Amazon forest (starting in 2001). It is an ideal location for this work because it is in one of the most El Nino-sensitive areas of the South American Amazon. Results will provide much needed information about the ecological mechanisms that underlie the forest collapse models that have received so much recent attention.",

The 2015 ENSO event was associated with anomalous low rain, high temperatures, and fires across eastern equatorial Amaz&ocirc;nia. Observations were made at the &ldquo;km67&rdquo; eddy flux tower in the Tapaj&oacute;s forest near the city of Santar&eacute;m, Brazil (see image). The Tapaj&oacute;s site, has the longest combined eddy flux and forest tree dynamics record in an Amazon forest (starting in 2001), and it was an ideal location for this work because it is located in one of the most El Nino-sensitive areas of the South American Amazon (Fig 1).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We found that: (1) the 2015-2016 ENSO was the third strongest event on record since 1950 (Fig 1-2); (2) precipitation decreased to 50% of the average annual, the dry-season was extended by 1-month and rainfall was 31.8 mm month<sup>-</sup><sup>1</sup> compared to a mean dry season precipitation of 62.8 mm month<sup>-</sup><sup>1</sup> (1998-2014) (Fig. 1-2); (3) the monthly average water vapour flux (LE) decreased by 20 W m-2 and the vegetation showed signs of stress by closing their stomatas and reducing the amount of CO2 uptake and transpiration (Fig. 3b and 4b) and (4) the sensible heat flux (H, the radiative flux was used in heating rather than in water evapotranspiration) reached sustained day-time daily values above 90 W m<sup>-2</sup>,reaching ~140 W m-2 -the highestseasonal day-time Hmeasured at the site(Fig 3a).The forest exhibited dramatic responses to ElNi&ntilde;o in carbon cycling,as well (Fig4). Large declines in ecosystem-scale photosynthetic activity (gross ecosystem productivity, GEP, Fig4b) were matched by large declines in ecosystem respiration (Fig4c) during the 2015-2016 ENSO (September 2015 - January 2016). Photosyntesis increased at the beginning of the dry season (GEPatFig.&lt;</p>\n<p>span&gt;4</p>\n<p>b).
