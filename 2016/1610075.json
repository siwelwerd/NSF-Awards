Aside from the billions lost from IP infringement, counterfeit parts are often of substandard quality, thereby creating risks for the critical systems and infrastructures that incorporate them. Among integrated circuits (ICs), analog and mixed signal (AMS) ICs are the best targets for counterfeiting due to their long product life cycles, high profit margins, prevalence across major markets (industrial, automotive, intelligence, consumer, wireless, compute, etc.), lower complexity, and (v) ease of reverse engineering and cloning older process technology nodes. Given the large number of systems and sectors using AMS electronics, counterfeits have significant impacts on major component manufacturers, original equipment manufacturers, governments, and society. While there exist counterfeit detection approaches based on physical inspection and electrical tests that could be applied to AMS ICs, they are time consuming, destructive, and often require golden (known authentic) information. In addition, new design techniques have been developed to detect counterfeit digital ICs, but these are not well-suited for AMS ICs due to the fundamental differences between analog and digital design. \r\n\r\n\r\nTechnical Abstract:\r\nThis project explores, for the first time, a holistic framework to detect and prevent all types of analog and mixed-signal (AMS) counterfeit ICs. Fundamental challenges to this goal include lack of aging models (needed to detect recycled/used ICs), lack of digital IC features (e.g., test structures, traditional cryptographic modules, etc.), and strict resource constraints of AMS ICs. In this work, these challenges are addressed through the development of innovative electrical tests for detecting recycled and remarked ICs as well as development of lightweight embedded mechanisms for detection/prevention of cloned, overproduced, and recycled ICs. To eliminate the need for golden information and remain applicable to a wide range of ICs, the electrical tests target differences in behavior of general power management circuitry, which are accessible in many large analog, mixed signal, and digital ICs, such as Low Drop-Out Regulators (LDOs) Embedded mechanisms for passive IC counterfeit detection are developed based on fully analog physically unclonable functions (PUFs) and new recycling\\aging sensors. While existing mechanisms require digital control logic and an additional pin for access to PUF and sensor output, new low cost-interfaces are developed to make all the proposed approaches easier to adopt. For active prevention, chaotic cryptography (which can be implemented in analog ICs) is exploited for novel IC locking\\unlocking mechanisms that prevent overproduced ICs from entering the market. All approaches will be tested in simulation and silicon. Authentic ICs will be acquired and tested against counterfeits available in the PI's lab from industry collaborators. The embedded mechanisms will be incorporated into test ICs and fabricated using standard CMOS processes for validation.",

Among integrated circuits (ICs), analog and mixed signal (AMS) chips are the top targets for counterfeiting due to their decades long product life cycles, high profit margins, prevalence across major markets (industrial, automotive, intelligence, consumer, wireless, compute, etc.), lower complexity, and ease/inexpensiveness of reverse engineering/cloning older technologies. However, the vast majority of initiatives to detect and avoid counterfeit electronics have been developed for digital (non-AMS) ICs. These are not suitable for AMS ICs due to the fundamental differences between analog and digital design/fabrication, area and power consumption, noise, and packaging constraints. While there exist counterfeit detection approaches based on physical inspection that could be applied to AMS ICs, they are time consuming, destructive, and often require golden (known authentic chip) information, subject matter experts, and expensive equipment. Further, they only apply to certain counterfeit types.</p>\n<p>The main goal of this project was to create a holistic framework to detect and prevent the three main types of AMS counterfeit chips: recycled, remarked, and cloned. Recycled counterfeit chips are those harvested from previously used and discarded systems that are fraudulently sold in the market as new. Remarking is often done on a new chip to falsify its specification, e.g., increase its rating from commercial grade to the military or industrial grade; thus, the lower grade chip can be sold as a more financially lucrative (10-100x) higher grade chip. Cloned chips are those that have been created by reverse engineering an authentic design or otherwise illegally replicating it. All three counterfeit types are hazardous and should be avoided, especially in critical systems.</p>\n<p>A universal electrical test technique was developed to recognize chip aging/use and specification differences in order to detect recycled and remarked AMS chips at zero-cost (i.e., no sensors, area, or power explicitly added to the design). Specifically, low drop-regulator (LDOs) are principal components of the power supply of most chips, and were exploited for counterfeit detection. The sources of LDO aging were studied using a custom-designed chip, and it was found that DC stress and DC/AC stress degraded the LDO power supply rejection by 1.6dB and up to 5dB, respectively. Further, changes in gate capacitance as well as equivalent resistance from AC stress shifted LDO parameters. Similar trends were identified from measurements of off-the-shelf LDO chips and AMS SoC chips containing LDOs.&nbsp; When LDOs from the same vendor were available to train the machine learning classifiers, classification accuracy was &gt; 80% for multiple vendors. When LDOs from the same vendor were unavailable, clustering could classify at rates ranging from 63% to 85%. However, this could be improved by using classifiers trained on LDOs from other vendors.&nbsp; Overall, the experiments demonstrated that AMS and SoC counterfeits could be detected with high probability while only using a common, inexpensive power supply rejection measurement setup.</p>\n<p>In order to detect cloned AMS chips, three physical unclonable function (PUF) designs were developed, fabricated, and measured. For anti-counterfeiting, PUFs are capable of generate unclonable chip identifiers that can be used to uniquely track chips throughout the supply chain. In general, PUF identifiers are noisy or unstable, i.e., produce slightly different values when activated. Existing approaches to overcome instability are unsuitable for AMS chips so new PUFs were developed. The first PUF employed dynamic latched comparators and used their random input offset voltages to create a chip-specific identifier. Demonstration in silicon showed that the PUF required 1nJ per bit and could produce less than 1% errors; however, calibration was needed to achieve this. The next PUF took a divergent approach from the state-of-the-art by exploiting passive components, specifically parasitic resistances created between metal and via interconnections, which are more reliable and less prone to aging/noise than active components. The PUF prototype achieved a native instability of 1.18% while requiring 17 pJ per bit. The goal of the third PUF was to avoid both calibration and post-processing by maximizing the entropy source mismatch. To this end, a cross-coupled structure was used. This PUF obtained a native stability of 0.97% - the best one ever recorded in the literature while only requiring 6 pJ per bit.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, all the technologies developed in this project will result in lower costs for AMS counterfeit detection and avoidance, both in terms of on-chip overheads and test setups. The savings associated with the proposed techniques shall be passed on to chip manufacturers, equipment manufacturers, and consumers. The improved reliability of the electronics supply chain derived from these technologies shall benefit society through trustworthy electronics for healthcare and dependable computing platforms for intelligence, weather forecasting, financial transactions, military systems, cyber physical systems, and so forth.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 07/23/2020<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Domenic&nbsp;Forte</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1610075/1610075_10430816_1595515274864_MVR_PUF--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1610075/1610075_10430816_1595515274864_MVR_PUF--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Metal-Via Resistance Based PUF\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1610075/1610075_10430816_1595515274864_MVR_PUF--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Metal-Via Resistance Based PUF\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Die photo, layout of the Metal-Via Resistance Based PUF unit cells (Version A and B) in die, and three-dimension layout view (Version A and B) with legend</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Nima Maghari</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Domenic&nbsp;Forte</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Metal-Via Resistance Based PUF</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1610075/1610075_10430816_1595514691784_Cross-CoupledImpedancePUF--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1610075/1610075_10430816_1595514691784_Cross-CoupledImpedancePUF--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Cross-Coupled Impedance Based PUF\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1610075/1610075_10430816_1595514691784_Cross-CoupledImpedancePUF--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Cross-Coupled Impedance Based PUF\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Die micrograph of Cross-Coupled Impedance Based PUF test chip and PUF unit cell layout.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Nima Maghari</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Domenic&nbsp;Forte</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Cross-Coupled Impedance Based PUF</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1610075/1610075_10430816_1595514434586_ComparatorPUF--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1610075/1610075_10430816_1595514434586_ComparatorPUF--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Dynamic Latch Comparator PUF\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1610075/1610075_10430816_1595514434586_ComparatorPUF--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Dynamic Latch Comparator PUF\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Photo of fabricated die with Dynamic Latch Comparator PUF blocks labeled</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Nima Maghari</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Domenic&nbsp;Forte</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Dynamic Latch Comparator PUF</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
