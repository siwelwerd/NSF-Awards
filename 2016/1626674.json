 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Major Research Instrumentation award will fund the acquisition of scientific instrumentation for the new 0.6-meter telescope at Central Washington University (CWU).  The instrument will be a compact, low-cost, high-resolution spectrograph designed to detect and measure the orbital characteristics of Jupiter-sized planets around nearby giant stars.  While the design is based on an existing instrument, much of the assembly and testing of the instrument will be carried out by undergraduate students. CWU students will also participate in the international partnership that developed the initial design. The spectrograph will give students the opportunity to experience how science, technology, and engineering come together to solve research problems and make new discoveries.\r\n\r\nThis primary scientific goal is detection and monitoring of exoplanets in long-period orbits around giant stars.  This will be accomplished through long-term monitoring of a small number of bright targets, which should also enable asteroseismology of giant stars.  The instrument design targets precision radial velocity studies in the m/s range and makes use of an iodine cell. Much of the local engineering work and scientific observations will be performed by undergraduate students.  This will provide training opportunities that generally are not available at non-PhD granting schools.",
