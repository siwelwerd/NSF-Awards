 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Historically Black Colleges and Universities-Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) Research Initiation Awards (RIAs) provide support to STEM junior faculty at HBCUs who are starting to build a research program, as well as for mid-career faculty who may have returned to the faculty ranks after holding an administrative post or who need to redirect and rebuild a research program. Faculty members may pursue research at their home institution, at an NSF-funded Center, at a research intensive institution or at a national laboratory. The RIA projects are expected to help further the faculty member's research capability and effectiveness, to improve research and teaching at his or her home institution, and to involve undergraduate students in research experiences. With support from the National Science Foundation, Hampton University (HU) will conduct research aimed at understanding the ecology of microbial communities in relation to red deep-sea crabs and their surrounding environment. This study will provide academic and experiential opportunities for undergraduate students in an effort to encourage them to pursue post-graduate study and careers as STEM research scientists. The project will help to enhance the university's research infrastructure and expand HU's ability to access advanced, innovative resources through collaborative partnering arrangements. Thus, HU will be positioned to educate the future members of STEM workforce with the knowledge to conduct innovative research and to enhance local, state, national, and global competitiveness. In addition, this study is aligned with HU's current strategic initiative to raise its research profile and competitiveness in the STEM sciences as well as to become a High Activity Research University.\r\n\r\nThe goal of the proposed study is to understand the microbial ecology of decapods inhabiting the slope of the mid-Atlantic Ocean. The specific aims of this project are to: 1) characterize the in situ midgut microflora of the red deep-sea crab and the microbiome in the in situ benthic ocean environment of the red deep-sea crab; and 2) characterize the stability of microbial communities after exposure to surface water microbiome in a controlled closed system. This study will contribute to our understanding of: a) the effect of dispersal on microbial communities by comparing datasets from three geographic locations; b) the role of environmental microbial flora in establishing the stable symbiotic communities within the crab; c) the effect of seasonal variation on the microbial communities from benthic environment and those associated with crabs. It will also set a biological reference point for future research. Findings from this study will contribute to our understanding of microbial ecology specifically: microbial dispersal, the effect of seasonal variation and how the crab gut communities are influenced by their environment. This project will be conducted in collaboration with the J. Craig Venter Institute (JCVI), University of Delaware and Atlantic Red Crab Company (local fishing industry).",

The limited information about this species made a compelling case to understand the structure of microbial communities associated with deepsea red crabs and their surrounding environment. The deepsea crab gut samples were collected aboard commercial fishing vessels (2015-2017), and water samples were collected aboard the research vessel Hugh Sharp (2018). The 16S amplicon DNA sequencing was used to assess microbial community structure and data analysis pipeline was established as outlined in Figure 1. The data analysis showed significant differences in microbial communities between crab guts (n=57) and their surrounding environment (n=6) (figure 2). Host factors and diet may have contributed to these differences. As shown in figure 3, no significant differences were observed between males (n=31) and females crab guts (n=26). However, certain taxa were enriched in male and female crabs. Similarly, a longitudinal analysis of the crab held in a controlled environment on shore showed less diverse and more homogenous communities over time compared to gut communities from&nbsp;<em>in situ</em>&nbsp;crabs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Broader Impact:</strong>&nbsp;The research initiation award helped establish a vibrant research program in the PIs laboratory and provided the necessary scientific equipment to complete the project successfully. The teaching release allowed PI to engage underrepresented minority students in hands-on research. A total of nine students were directly involved in the project. They spent 1-2 years in the laboratory addressing their scientific question and presenting their research at the scientific meetings. These students continued their careers in STEM, three joined the workforce, and six continued professional and/or graduate school (for example, Virginia Commonwealth University, University of California San Francisco, Howard University, University of Massachusetts Amherst). PI also mentored five high school students who developed scientific questions within microbiology and researched under the guidance of PI and undergraduate students who served as peer mentors. In addition, a bioinformatics workshop was organized in partnership with PIs Research mentor Dr. Regina Lamendella. The professional development allowed PI to take advanced training courses offered at Marine Biological Laboratory (MBL), Woods Hole, MA. These courses not only provided the skillset but also a platform for networking with renowned scientists from MBL, and Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and resulted in fruitful collaborations.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/22/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Indu&nbsp;Sharma</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1601057/1601057_10422328_1671689265470_RIA_figures.001--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1601057/1601057_10422328_1671689265470_RIA_figures.001--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1601057/1601057_10422328_1671689265470_RIA_figures.001--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The 16S microbial community sequencing data analysis pipeline developed in partnership with Dr. Regina Lamendella, Juniata College, Huntingdon, PA</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Regina Lamendella</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Indu&nbsp;Sharma</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 1</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1601057/1601057_10422328_1671689343527_RIA_figures.002--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1601057/1601057_10422328_1671689343527_RIA_figures.002--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 2\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1601057/1601057_10422328_1671689343527_RIA_figures.002--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 2\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Microbial Community Structure A) PCA analysis of microbial communities from near benthic water (blue dots), female crab gut (red dots) and male crabs (green dots).
