The device will sense incident sound and amplify it in a new way such that lower threshold is detected, sharper frequency sensitivity and superior dynamic range are also expected.  \r\n\r\nThe goal of proposed research program is to develop piezoelectric-based, active artificial hair cells (AHCs) capable of mimicking the important aspects of nonlinear cochlear amplifier. They will possess a lower threshold of detection, sharper frequency sensitivity, and larger dynamic range than a traditional, passive transducer. The proposed work will examine a variety of feedback control schemes to achieve a cochlea-like response from piezoelectric-based, cantilever beam sensors. The work will explore using self-sensing methods to transition from lab experiments to practical sensors. Scalability analysis is expected to guide the design and fabrication of miniaturized active AHCs at scales suitable for use in practical applications. An array of active sensing elements for transducing multiple frequency signals will be built and tested. These sensors could also serve as a tool for auditory researchers to gain insight into a healthy cochlea. While the importance and general behavior of the cochlear amplifier is well established, there are unanswered questions over how this amplification arises. Various control laws can be tested on artificial hair cells to test different theories and develop insights into the functioning of biological cochlea.  It is anticipated that this work will help establish improved cochlear implants, thereby improving the quality of life of over 30 million Americans who suffer from permanent hearing loss. Potentially the active artificial hair cells could lead to new cochlear prosthesis and restore hearing function. This research program will offer an excellent learning and education for underrepresented  undergraduate students.",

Our work has been successful in advancing this front and creating, via electromechanically coupled systems, the first of its kind self-sensing artificial hair cells that can mimic the cochlea's compressive nonlinearity. The fundamental research carried out in this project has laid out the initial steps towards revolutionizing hearing&nbsp;<em>restoration</em>&nbsp;and has consequently leveraged the cochlea's characteristics to create sensors with highly advanced dynamic range capabilities for a myriad of applications.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In the mammalian auditory system, the acoustic waves that enter the ear canal are transmitted to the cochlea as traveling waves. The cochlea decomposes the wave into its frequency content. High sound pressure level signals are then compressed and low-intensity signals are amplified by the cochlea. Inner hair cells convert the vibrations of the waves into electrical signals and send them to the brain for interpretation. Damage to the hair cells of the cochlea stops these nonlinear processes and causes severe hearing loss. Although commercial cochlear implants have been developed to aid hearing, there are several problems associated with their functionality including limited frequency range and cross-channel interactions. To enhance the cochlear implants, researchers have developed artificial hair cells (AHCs) and cochleas. Although these devices mimic the frequency decomposition of the cochlea, the great majority of them face major challenges in matching the performance of the complex living, nonlinear cochlea. Therefore, developing artificial cochleae and AHCs has gained traction in recent years.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In most of the studies, mimicking the function of the cochlea over a large frequency range requires an array of AHCs, were each AHC represents a sensing channel for each frequency. Consequently, the total number of sensing channels in an array is equal to the number of the AHCs used. In the present study, the concept of the single-channel AHC was extended to multi-channel AHC. In this work, a cantilever beam augmented with two layers of piezoceramics represents an AHC. Piezoceramic layers are used to convert electrical signals into mechanical vibrations. To mimic the nonlinear amplification/compression functions of the cochlea, a control law is developed as a function of the AHC tip velocity. As the base of the beam is excited, the velocity of tip is measured by a laser vibrometer and the piezoceramics apply a force to AHC in real-time. As a result, the novel multi-channel AHC amplifies or compresses the sensor's output based on its input level much like the mammalian cochlea. Therefore, embedding a number of the AHCs in an array instead of a series of single-channel AHCs will offer larger frequency range in a more compact setting which could greatly aid simplicity and future implants for hearing restoration. These multi-channel AHCs have the potential to be used in the creation of novel cochlear implants, or in applications such as accelerometers, microphones, and hydrophones.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The requirement of an external sensor to achieve this was a strict limitation, therefore, a self-sensing active AHC was proposed and developed. This was achieved by adopting a four layered piezoelectric beam to function as an AHC. Thus, instead of the tip velocity, the output voltage of the outer piezoelectric layers is used to generate a feedback control voltage supplied to the inner piezoelectric layers. The experimental and numerical results show that the AHC mimics the compressive nonlinearity function of the biological cochlea. The next steps where to combine these concepts to develop multi-channel self-sensing AHCs to provide more sensing channels for each AHCs.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Finally, to the best of the PI's knowledge, this is the first time in the literature that such an active multi-channel self-sensing AHC is developed which can lead to an implantable cochlear device, acoustic, or flow sensor in future. This research was carried out by a female Ph.D. candidate in Mechanical Engineering which forms part of the underrepresented group in engineering. She has presented her work at various international conferences and has submitted and published her studies in high impact journals. Additionally, she supported an outreach program in a summer camp activity offered by The Center for the Enhancement of Engineering Diversity at Virginia Tech.
