 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-technical Abstract:  A compass needle shares an important property with the data-storage layer on your computer's hard drive - they are both magnetized, or ferromagnetic. Another property of matter that allows data storage is ferroelectric polarization. This research explores how materials that are both ferroelectric and ferromagnetic respond to intense terahertz-frequency electric fields. The goal is to establish the physics of the materials interaction with the terahertz electric field. One terahertz frequency is more than one hundred times faster than your computer processor speed. Thus, this research potentially enables much faster data writing and storage functionality compared with the technologies available today. This project also aims to educate the next generation of scientists and engineers and to broaden the participation of women and under-represented minorities in sciences. The planned activities enhance the Tulane Science Scholar Program, whose goal is to attract high school students with exceptional promise in science and mathematics into engineering disciplines. The participation of underrepresented minorities in science and engineering is promoted through summer undergraduate student research with participants recruited from local Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) in New Orleans on paid summer assistantships. The participation of women in sciences is promoted by the GIST (Girls in STEM at Tulane) program that provides middle-school girls with the opportunity to meet and work with women role models in science. \r\n\r\nTechnical Abstract:  This project targets a new frontier in technologically advanced ferroelectrics and multiferroics by focusing on ferroelectric and magnetoelectric dynamics driven by intense terahertz pulses, where both spin and lattice are resonantly excited.  The goal is to discover the new physics that emerges when the coupled spin and lattice motion is coherently driven in the very large amplitude regime. It is hypothesized that the terahertz-driven dynamic ferroelectric and magnetic responses can approach in magnitude the responses induced by static electric fields and allow domain manipulation. Terahertz pulses with peak electric field exceeding 100 kV/cm are used to coherently excite the large-amplitude ionic motion along the ferroelectric phonon coordinates. The spin dynamics is excited via the magneto-electric coupling of spin to the lattice motion.  The response of the order parameters is probed using terahertz and optical probe pulses.  This work aims to create new knowledge of the nonequilibrium response of matter to intense terahertz pulses and to provide guidance for the design of future terahertz-frequency magneto-electric and data storage devices.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOptics and photonics underpin much of today?s technological world.  Information technology, consumer electronics, communications, and modern healthcare form an incomplete list of sectors that would not exist in their current form without the foundation of optics and condensed matter physics, the latter being the branch of science that studies and explains the behavior of electrons in all materials and underpins all of today?s photonics.  Light is an electromagnetic wave and is the central entity in our project.  Like any wave, light is characterized by the wavelength ? the distance between its two nearest crests.  Our project focused on a specific range of the wavelengths of light ? terahertz or far-infrared.  These wavelengths are not visible to the human eye and can easily pass through some materials, such as clothing and plastics, but they are completely blocked by metals.  Our goal was to examine how different materials interact with terahertz light and how terahertz light can be used to alter materials? properties.  \n\n \n\nOne materials category that we studied was multiferroics, which can be simultaneously magnetic and ferroelectric. Magnetism is a property that has been used for data storage and recording.  Ferroelectricity is another property that is used for data storage by using the direction of ferroelectric polarization.  In multiferroic materials, magnetism and ferroelectricity tend to be resonant with terahertz light, which also makes them good candidates for property manipulation by very strong pulses of terahertz light.  One discovery that resulted from this line of work is an optical diode effect that occurs at high temperature ? much higher than the ferromagnetic ordering temperature.  In optical diode effect, a sample of material can transmit light in one direction and completely block the light traveling in the opposite direction.  This property can be very useful in photonic devices.  Such optical nonreciprocity only happens in materials with special symmetry conditions: the material must not possess the center of symmetry (center of inversion) and must not obey time reversal symmetry.  We also set out to create artificial materials that fulfil the symmetry conditions for optical nonreciprocity.  Such artificial materials are called metamaterials and consists of ordered arrays of light scatterers of subwavelength dimensions.  The optical properties of metamaterials can be designed to perform a specific function, and we created two metamaterial designs that exhibit optical nonreciprocity.  While working on this topic, we also discovered a way to create a one-way mirror ? if such a mirror were hung on a wall, you could see your friend?s reflection in it, but your friend would not see you.\n\n \n\nAs another part of our project, we explored how different materials can be altered by intense pulses of very strong terahertz light.  For example, we found a way to accurately describe how semiconductors become more transparent when illuminated by such intense terahertz pulses.  We also explored how some transparent crystals become birefringent when illuminated by intense terahertz light.  In the most exciting finding, we observed that the crystal KTaO3 enters a new hidden state when it interacts with intense terahertz light.  We call this state hidden because it is not achievable with other means, for example by changing the temperature or pressure on the material.  In this hidden state, KTaO3 crystal develops birefringence that persists long after the terahertz pulse leaves the crystal.  The birefringence can potentially be used for terahertz-frequency neuromorphic computing devices.\n\n \n\nAmong the societal benefits that go beyond the described scientific advances, we report that this project served as the research training for four graduate students who obtained their PhD degrees.  Two PhD students graduated in 2018 and the other two graduated in 2022.  All four students have now entered the US workforce as highly educated and value-producing workers.  As part of our educational commitment, our Tulane laboratory sponsored and conducted workshops for middle school boys and girls as part of the GiST (Girls in STEM at Tulane) and BATS (Boys at Tulane in STEM) programs.  These programs are designed to allow boys and girls to meet and work with role models in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) fields and encourage them to investigate and discover in a hands-on scientific setting.  The long-term goal is to promote US student participation in STEM fields.  Our workshop titled ?Fluids, bubbles, and slime? consistently attracted full enrollments of both girls and boys.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/28/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Diyar Talbayev"
