 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this program is to increase the number of students from traditionally underrepresented groups who pursue undergraduate degrees in engineering in the Statler College of Engineering and Mineral Resources at West Virginia University.  The program will provide merit scholarships to academically talented, low-income students with a focus on first-generation college students, females, African-Americans and Hispanics.  Recipients of the scholarships will participate in a pre-fall bridge program, specialized first-year courses, and a variety of co-curricular activities designed to provide support and increase retention in engineering degrees.  The major goals of the program are to increase the annual enrollment of underrepresented students in the engineering programs, to enhance curricular and co-curricular support services for these students, to develop and utilize partnerships with local and regional engineering companies and to assess the impact of these activities on student motivation and success.\r\n\r\nPlans for project implementation include facilitating student participation in activities designed to increase retention including enrollment in common courses, participation in live-learn communities, academic advising and tutoring, and multi-tier mentoring from academia and industry with opportunities for internships and undergraduate research.  Program activities will be assessed to determine the relationship between program participation and academic success, what elements of the program most significantly impact success, how practical and logistical challenges are overcome, and what the longitudinal impact of the program is on motivation, perceptions, feelings of inclusion, and overall outcome.  Data from the project will be used to identify successful program elements that can be disseminated to other institutions to foster persistence and perseverance of under-represented and low socioeconomic status students in engineering programs.",

Through curricular and co-curricular activities, this program has served over 100 students and provided over $500,000 of financial support to 42 students through 178 single-term, renewable S-STEM scholarships. At least 45% of the supported S-STEM scholars came from populations typically underrepresented in engineering and computing fields or from families in which no parent completed a college degree.\n\n\nThree elements comprised the first-year Academy of Engineering Success (AcES) program: (1) A one-week summer bridge program before the first year, (2) a fall term, two-credit hour professional development course, and (3) a three-credit hour, Engineering in History, course in the second (spring) term. The bridge experience was led by faculty, staff, and peer mentors and featured a variety of experiential learning experiences, including a hands-on engineering design challenge, field trips to industry sites, math and chemistry instruction and practice sessions, seminars, and social activities. The fall professional development course consisted of: (1) lectures on topics such as learning styles, goal setting, teamwork, professional communication, and career paths; (2) information about undergraduate research opportunities through campus laboratory site visits; (3) introductions to engineering professional life through industry guest speakers and career services workshops; and (4) design projects which help students develop and practice teamwork, engineering design, and professional communication skills. The spring Engineering in History course was taught by a program faculty mentor, counted toward the students general education graduation requirement, and provided additional cohort-building in an academic setting throughout the students entire first year. NSF S-STEM scholar cohorts interacted with each other during end of year celebrations and some upper level students helped to facilitate programming elements for successive first-year cohorts and provided near-peer mentorship and advice.\n\n\nResearchers adapted and implemented evidence-based curricular and co-curricular activities and studied their effect on student retention and academic success, as well as on the students feelings of institutional inclusion, engineering self-efficacy and identity, and assessment of their development of academic and professional success skills. The researchers learned that (1) team projects and social events help students bond with their peers and faculty mentors; and (2) career exploration activities, such as visiting campus engineering laboratories and industrial sites and interacting with practicing engineers through panel discussions and classroom visits, provided motivation for students to work diligently to prepare for an engineering or computing career and prepared the student for what to expect when they begin their career. An analysis of NSF S-STEM AcES scholars who left engineering before their second year indicated that they tended to enter college with unrealistic expectations of the majors difficulty causing them to underestimate the time and effort required for success in an engineering or computing curriculum and overestimate their ability to succeed with minimal effort. Project results were shared with the academic community through 12 research papers presented in regional, national, and international engineering education conferences which provided information that may help other institutions implement similar programs and help researchers learn from our experiences. Challenges related to recruitment were identified for further study.\n\n\nAs a result of this project, 15 (54%) of the 28 financially supported S-STEM scholars from the 2016  2019 cohorts who were eligible to receive at least 4 years of S-STEM funding (by 2023) graduated or will graduate within a year with engineering or computing degrees; six students (21%) graduated with non-STEM degrees; and seven students (25%) left the university before graduation.
