 "awd_abstract_narration": "The sharing economy is large and expanding, as demonstrated by the rapid ascent of services such as Uber and AirBnB. One significant impediment to the growth of the sharing economy is trust. This investigation will contribute to social computing research by exploring &#8232;the possibility of building a trustworthy and efficient sharing economy system that facilitates posting requests and sharing resources within people's existing direct and extended social networks. The advantage of a social-network-based sharing economy system is that social networks produce trust between participants without relying on third-party institutions or reputation systems; trust is built based on the personal and interpersonal&#8232;characteristics of the sharing economy participants. The key challenge of a successful social-network-based sharing economy system is to design the payment structures and system infrastructures to efficiently mobilize the direct and extended social network.\r\n\r\nThis investigation focuses on the following three questions: How to leverage social network structural and contextual information to produce trust between participants in sharing economy systems? Which payment structures encourage friends and friends of friends to respond to requests while also maintaining long-term relationships? 3) Which routing mechanisms are able to quickly match requests with resources without overloading people's social network? This investigation will lead to four research outcomes: (1) Advance theoretical understanding of trust production mechanisms in a sharing economy. (2) Gain empirical knowledge about people's perception and practices regarding different types of payment (e.g., cash, gifts, and IOUs)in a social-network- based sharing economy. (3) Gain empirical knowledge about people's perceptions and practices around routing their requests across their direct and extended social networks. (4) Develop a research platform that embodies the findings of the investigations.",

The grant has led to three full papers that are accepted at CSCW and Group (Klein et al. 2017, Dillahunt et al. 2017, Ma et al, 2020)&nbsp; and one late-breaking work at CHI (Ma et al, 2019). Specifically, Dillahunt et al.

Klein et al (2017) explored how current sharing economy platforms are incentivized and how various incentive structures affect the user relationships on these platforms. Ma et al. (2019, 2020) created the platform - Mobilyzr, and conducted a study to investigate whether anonymity (posting a request anonymously), ephemerality (allowing requests to be visible for only a short period), and system routing (having the system handle the request routing) could reduce perceived barriers in participating in peer-to-peer online exchanges. The broader impacts include training 4 (1 female) Ph.D. students and 4 (3 female) undergraduates.
