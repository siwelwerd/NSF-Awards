In this project, key radical species will be measured that are relevant to the production of small secondary particles in the atmosphere.  Improving the understanding of reactive chemistry in forest environments will improve projections of how changes in forest succession and climate might affect the future composition of the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nThe field study will take place at the University of Michigan Biological Station (UMBS) Program for Research on Oxidants: PHotochemistry, Emissions, and Transport (PROPHET) in the summer of 2016. The overarching objectives of the field study are to investigate the inability of current atmospheric chemistry models to reproduce observed radical concentrations in forest environments in order to accurately predict the impact of biogenic volatile organic carbon emissions on the production of ozone, secondary organic aerosols and the cycling of nitrogen between the atmosphere and the biosphere.  Species to be measured related to understanding atmospheric oxidation include hydroxyl (OH), hydroperoxy (HO2), and organic peroxy (RO2) radicals; sulfuric acid (H2SO4); organic acids; and low-volatility and extremely low volatility organic compounds (LVOC and ELVOC). There will also be several weeks of laboratory measurements conducted at the University of Indiana to intercompare the instrumentation of those participating in the PROPHET 2016 campaign.",

Key in these processes are reactions involving the hydroxyl radical, OH. OH reacts with volatile organic compounds (VOCs) usually leading to the formation of organic and inorganic peroxy radicals (RO<sub>2</sub>, HO<sub>2</sub>), which in the presence of nitric oxide (NO) are primarily converted back to OH.&nbsp; This fast cycling of radicals controls many aspects of atmospheric chemistry and has impacts on issues such as climate change, health effects, and air quality. Crucial to quantification of these various processes is firm understanding of the budgets of oxidants as they interact with biogenic and anthropogenic VOCs and other emissions.&nbsp; Towards these ends, the PROPHET AMOS 2016 study was conceived to improve understanding of the chemistry of BVOCs over a range of conditions.</p>\n<p>Our group deployed an instrument capable of measuring OH, HO<sub>2</sub>+RO<sub>2</sub>, and oxygenated organic species during the PROPHET AMOS study in central Michigan during the Summer of 2016. Figure 1 is a plot of measured OH (1a) and HO<sub>2</sub>+RO<sub>2</sub> (1b) obtained during the study. The weather during the first portion of the study was cloudy and rainy. As can be seen from Figure 1, little OH (&lt;1x10<sup>6</sup> molec cm<sup>-3</sup>) was observed during this time as is expected for a photolytically produced species. The latter part of the study was more sunny and thus more OH (2-3x10<sup>6</sup> molec cm<sup>-3</sup>). As is also seen, both of these species followed the Diel or sunlight cycle.</p>\n<p>The same instrument used to measure OH and HO<sub>2</sub>+RO<sub>2</sub> was also used to measure the oxygenated organic compounds. Here some enigmatic behavior of these species was observed. Figure 2 is a plot of OH together with of the observed signals from three different masses typically attributed to peroxy-radicals for a single day 7/26/2016. The red traces are from the NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> only mode where the sample flow is that of the ambient air only with no additional reagent gases (NO and/or SO<sub>2</sub>) for HOx measurements. As seen in the first panel, C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>7</sub>O<sub>6</sub> (for clarity, the compound is referred to as it's organic backbone without the NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> ion used in the CIMS measurement), an odd hydrogen species and thus a radical typically thought of as an RO<sub>2</sub> species, is present (mainly at night) in the unperturbed ambient measurements (red trace). The addition of NO for the HO<sub>2</sub>+RO<sub>2</sub> modes (green traces) does not appreciable diminish the signal. If this species was indeed a RO<sub>2</sub> radical the addition of ppm levels of NO should cycle it back to OH (as discussed above) and remove it. Perplexingly, the addition of SO<sub>2</sub> only for the OH modes (blue traces) does remove this peak. Also note, C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>7</sub>O<sub>8</sub> is not initially present in the ambient measurements (red trace), yet is formed (especially in the daytime hours) when the instrument is in the OH modes. These perplexing results need more thorough laboratory investigation.</p>\n<p>The following year, two separate instruments, one measuring OH and the other HO<sub>2</sub>/HO<sub>2</sub>+RO<sub>2,</sub> were deployed to the Indiana University Research and Teaching Preserve to intercompare with the LIF OH and HO<sub>2</sub> system of Phil Stevens from IU, and the HO<sub>2</sub>+RO<sub>2</sub> system of Ezra Wood from Drexel University. Figure 3a depicts plots of the average measured OH from both the CIMS and LIF systems for the study. There has been some concern over an instrumental background which occurs in some LIF OH measurements. The IU LIF system has not demonstrated this interference in the past and makes no attempt to correct for it as other LIF OH measurements do. As is seen in Figure 3a, there is generally good agreement between the two systems. If the LIF system had an interference, disagreement would be most prevalent in the nighttime. As can be seen, both systems measure low (&lt;5x10<sup>5</sup> molec cm<sup>-3</sup>) values. Figure 3b is a similar plot, but for HO<sub>2</sub> concentrations obtained from The CU PerCIMS and IU LIF systems. Here the agreement is generally good in the evening hours, but the IU system tends to measure 10-50% smaller values during the day compared to the CU system. The Drexel chemical amplifier system measured the sum of HO<sub>2</sub> and RO<sub>2</sub>. Figure 4a is a plot of HO<sub>2</sub>+RO<sub>2</sub> obtained from the CU PerCIMS system versus that obtained from the DU system. As can be seen the DU system captures &lt;50% of that observed by the CU system. Much of this difference is attributed to problems with the relative humidity measurement inside the Drexel system. Figures 5 shows comparisons of measured OH (5a) and HO<sub>2</sub> (5b) together with different model simulations. As is seen, the model tends to underestimate both species when not including HONO. However, it overestimates both species when including only 50% of the HONO obtained from the IU LIF system.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 08/08/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Roy&nbsp;L&nbsp;Mauldin</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1613169/1613169_10425000_1565289256644_NSFProjectOutcomesFigure1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1613169/1613169_10425000_1565289256644_NSFProjectOutcomesFigure1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1613169/1613169_10425000_1565289256644_NSFProjectOutcomesFigure1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Figure 1</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Roy Mauldin</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Roy&nbsp;L&nbsp;Mauldin</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 1</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1613169/1613169_10425000_1565289305678_NSFProjectOutcomesFigure2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1613169/1613169_10425000_1565289305678_NSFProjectOutcomesFigure2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 2\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1613169/1613169_10425000_1565289305678_NSFProjectOutcomesFigure2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 2\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Figure 2</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Roy Mauldin</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Roy&nbsp;L&nbsp;Mauldin</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 2</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1613169/1613169_10425000_1565289362169_NSFProjectOutcomesFigure3--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1613169/1613169_10425000_1565289362169_NSFProjectOutcomesFigure3--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 3\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1613169/1613169_10425000_1565289362169_NSFProjectOutcomesFigure3--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 3\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Figure 3</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Roy Mauldin</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Roy&nbsp;L&nbsp;Mauldin</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 3</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1613169/1613169_10425000_1565289413278_NSFProjectOutcomesFigure4--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1613169/1613169_10425000_1565289413278_NSFProjectOutcomesFigure4--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 4\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1613169/1613169_10425000_1565289413278_NSFProjectOutcomesFigure4--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 4\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Figure 4</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Roy Mauldin</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Roy&nbsp;L&nbsp;Mauldin</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 4</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1613169/1613169_10425000_1565289473499_NSFProjectOutcomesFigure5--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1613169/1613169_10425000_1565289473499_NSFProjectOutcomesFigure5--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 5\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1613169/1613169_10425000_1565289473499_NSFProjectOutcomesFigure5--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 5\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Figure 5</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Roy Mauldin</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Roy&nbsp;L&nbsp;Mauldin</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 5</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
