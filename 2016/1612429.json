In response to the Ebola virus epidemic, both the World Health Organization and the United States Centers for Disease Control advised direct disposal of Ebola-contaminated liquid waste into sewage systems (wastewater collection and treatment systems) and latrines without disinfection. In the wake of this recommendation, several questions were raised regarding appropriate handling of Ebola virus contaminated liquid waste, including the environmental persistence of Ebola virus, efficacy of disinfection approaches against Ebola virus, and risks posed by Ebola virus within wastewater infrastructure. In light of the uncertainty and research following this outbreak, the principal investigator (PI) proposes a workshop to summarize the state of knowledge on Ebola fate in human waste and the environment. This topic will be extended to other emerging deadly pathogens. The goal of this workshop is to summarize current research findings, compare results utilizing Ebola virus surrogates and the Ebola virus, and move towards a consensus on recommendations for outbreak response and research needs. The workshop is proposed to be 1.5 days (tentatively February 18-19) in the Washington, D.C. region.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe proposed workshop will advance understanding in the handling of Ebola contaminated wastewater by sharing cutting edge research. It will also inform wastewater handling in outbreak response. The proposers are well-qualified to conduct the proposed workshop as each have active funded projects in environmental viral persistence and quantification, including Ebola virus persistence. The workshop is coordinated with Homeland Security investigators who are involved in Ebola studies, and the results of the  studies conducted by the investigators will be compared. The proposed project will promote teaching, training, and learning for workshop participants. It is the goal of the workshop planners to invite a small group of postdoctoral scholars and graduate students to enhance participation and training. The proposed workshop will broaden participation and integrate diversity through targeting gender balance in workshop participants and discussion leaders. The results from this project will be disseminated in the peer-reviewed literature and a final workshop report. Ultimately, this workshop will lead to improved public health through better-informed wastewater handling in outbreak response.",
