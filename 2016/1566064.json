 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project funded by the Chemical Structure and Dynamics Program A of the Chemistry Division, Dr. Craig Murray of University of California, Irvine and his graduate students are using short and ultrashort laser pulses to explore interactions of small molecules with light. After absorbing light of sufficiently high energy, these small molecules dissociate via different pathways and with different time scales. Detailed information on these processes is obtained by time-resolved imaging of the products.  An outreach program involves active participation in the research lab of local high school teachers, providing them with insight into some current research activity.  The program additionally provides a day at university experience for their students, exposing them to opportunities available to them in higher education.  The program draws connections between fundamental chemical processes studied in the laboratory and larger scale applications. \r\n \r\nThis project uses velocity-map (slice) ion imaging coupled to tunable nanosecond and picosecond laser systems to measure correlated photofragment product state distributions. With this technique, unconventional photochemical processes in small gas-phase molecules are explored, such as roaming-mediated intersystem crossing, multiple roaming pathways and extrusion of atomic or radical species.  Time-resolved measurements using transform-limited picosecond pulses explore how the correlated product state distributions evolve in time, identifying characteristic time-scales for roaming, intersystem crossing, and conventional dissociation mechanisms.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project explored ?unconventional? photodissociation dynamics of small molecules, ions, and clusters using state-resolved and time-resolved velocity-map ion imaging experiments.\n\nThe ultraviolet (UV) photodissociation of acetaldehyde and acetone was examined using single photon vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) ionization to detect radical and molecular photoproducts.   Our acetaldehyde study focused on the Norrish Type I pathway leading to methyl and formyl radicals.  The dominant pathway involving dissociation on the T1 state following intersystem crossing was characterized and the onset of a new photodissociation pathway at shorter wavelengths attributed to dissociation on S0 following internal conversion via a S1/S0 conical intersection was observed.  Products formed on T1 and S0 have distinct translational energy distributions; time-resolved imaging measurements using picosecond laser pulses showed that they are also formed at different rates.  Our study of the equivalent photodissociation of acetone, which leads to methyl and acetyl radicals, found similar behavior for the T1 mechanism but no evidence for the S0 mechanism.  An additional observation in the UV photodissociation of acetone was the production of ketene as a primary product with non-negligible yield.  The wavelength-dependent translational energy distributions were consistent with ketene production via a roaming mechanism.\n\nUV photofragmentation of acetaldehyde cations was also studied.  Internally cold parent cations were prepared using VUV ionization, excited across a broad range of UV wavelengths, and the ionic fragments were imaged.  Four distinct photofragmentation channels were characterized and analysis of the photofragment speed and angular distributions showed evidence of both statistical pathways and, unusually for ions, electronically excited state dynamics leading to fragmentation.\n\nState-resolved ion imaging was used to determine the correlated product pair distributions resulting from the vibrational predissociation of the hydrogen-bonded HCl dimer, following infrared (IR) excitation of the bound and free stretch overtones.  The product pairs were found to comprise one vibrationally excited HCl molecule and one in its vibrational ground state; the former was typically more rotationally excited than its partner, regardless of which vibrational mode was initially excited.  The results suggest that interchange of the hydrogen bond donor/acceptor occurs before dissociation.\n\nAn outreach program (?Teacher-in-Residence?) was also supported by this award.  The program allowed three local high school teachers to participate directly in laboratory research activities and supported follow up visits to campus for their students.  During the visits, the students toured research labs and facilities, and participated in a mock research symposium.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/29/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Craig Murray"
