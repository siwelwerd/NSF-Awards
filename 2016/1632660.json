 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will examine how molecular biologists and social justice advocates are responding to the recent NIH policy that would ensure sex-balanced research at the preclinical level.  Both molecular biologists and reproductive justice advocates are stakeholders in the production of scientific knowledge regarding female reproductive physiology.   The project aims to demonstrate that scientific practices and social justice practices can be brought together to produce new understandings of female reproductive biology and health.  This interdisciplinary approach and diversification of ideas will be of benefit to our understanding of reproductive health. It will have a significant impact on the participation of women and other minorities in STEM fields.  The main products that will result from this research include a book project and a web-based interactive narrative.  The book will benefit readers who are interested in STS, molecular biology, and neuroscience.  The web-based interactive narrative will record the views of reproductive justice advocates and molecular biologists on the issue of preclinical sex-balanced research and may be used as a teaching tool to distribute the findings of this project to a wider audience.  This project will directly contribute to the education and interdisciplinary training of two graduate students, one from the biomedical and molecular sciences, and one from gender studies.  \r\n\r\n\r\nAs there is a growing interest on the part of STS scholars to develop joint vocabularies between diverse communities of knowers, this project aims to develop opportunities for shared inquiry between molecular biologists and reproductive justice advocates.  The theoretical and methodological approaches of this project are grounded in practice-oriented STS approaches.  The project utilizes two key analytical frameworks including an awareness of the co-construction of science and society, and the application of social justice perspectives.  These perspectives recognize that certain bodies, such as people of color, reproductive bodies, disabled bodies, and animals, have in the past been subjected to unfair treatment in the name of scientific and technological progress.  Ethnographic studies will be conducted on two molecular biology labs working on epigenetics and sex differences research, and two reproductive justice organizations. The scientific questions that will be posed will closely examine and contextualize responses to the new NIH policy.  Participants will be asked to consider central questions such as who is producing knowledge in this area, and for whom is this knowledge being produced?  At what cost is this knowledge being produced and who and what are the material agents contributing to this research?  Interviews and oral histories of molecular biologists and reproductive justice advocates, combined with participant and materials observation of laboratories and offices spaces, will provide a reflective space to consider the co-production of biologies, social justice movements, and scientific experimentation.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project explored how scientific practices and social justice practices can come together to produce new understandings of female reproductive biology and health.  Therefore the objectives of this project included understanding how these different communities of knowers think about a common set of problems.  It also involved listening to and learning from disparate practices and vocabularies.  It futher involved not only looking for overlap in these practices and vocabularies, but also bringing together common elements that can be used to build a space for shared reflection and inquiry.\n\nOnly conducting interviews with members at SPARK, SisterSong, the Forger Lab and McCarthy Lab was, in the P.I.'s mind, insufficient to the specific objectives of this project.  Close observation of the work space and practices developed by these different groups of experts was required in order to gain an understanding of what is at stake for these communities in producing new knowledge.  Working with and developing a rapport with both scientists and reproductive health advocates took a fair amount of reserach and preparation.  The impact of the new NIH policy may not be fully comprehended any time soon, but creating a policy for sex balanced research at the preclinical level has many immediate ramifications for researchers.  The NSF project provided an opportunity to bring different stakeholders into conversation with each other and to better understand how the next era of research on sex differences and female reproductive health should proceed.\n\nThe main goal of the project was to create a joint or shared vocabulary of concerns and/or interests in sex balanced research that is legible to both moleuclar biologists and reproductive justice advocates.  The intention was to bring the ideas and expertise of two separate communities of knowers together in order to produce more interdiscpinary perspectives.  This goal is being realized through the accomplishment of four main components of the project.\n\nThe first component is comprised of ethnographic research that included site visits at reproductive justice organizations and molecular biology labs.  Observations and interviews of experts working at these sites provided rich data for analysis and was used to inform all other components of the project.\n\nThe second component is a book manuscript entitled \"Molecular Feminisms: Biology, Becomings, and Life in the Lab.\"  Due to its interdisciplinary approach, this book will benefit students and scholars who are interested in Science and Technology Studies, philosophy of science, molecular biology, neuroscience, feminist studies, and women's health. \n\nThe third component is an interactive web narrative that has been created to share the data collected from the ethnographic research and interviews conducted over the course of the award.  This web-based narrative not only serves as a record of the interviews and stories told by molecular biologists and reproductive justice advocates, but will also serve as a means to create new data as visitors to the site will be asked to participate in surveys and questionaires and continue building the conversation and sustain ongoing interest in the project.\n\nThe fourth is the mentoring of four graduate students who have served as research assistants on this grant.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/02/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Deboleena Roy"
