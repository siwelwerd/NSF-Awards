 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Madden Julian Oscillation (MJO) is a large weather system that forms over the Indian Ocean and moves slowly eastward until it dissipates near the middle of the tropical Pacific Ocean.  When it passes a given location, it typically causes a rainy period that lasts 15-30 days that is followed by dry weather, as well as an extended period of strong westerly winds.  The circulations that accompany the MJO go all the way around the world in the tropical atmosphere, and they affect when monsoon rainfall begins in Asia, Australia, and North America, as well as when and where tropical storms and hurricanes form.  Despite its importance to global weather and climate, the MJO has been poorly simulated in climate models for decades, so current predictions of how it will change in the future are unreliable.  \r\n\r\nThe scientists involved in this project have developed a new kind of weather model that better predicts the behavior of the MJO.  It is referred to as \"Lagrangian,\" because instead of solving equations for atmospheric motions on a grid of points, it tracks air masses as they move around the world. The Lagrangian weather model will be used to study how the MJO will change in the future as the oceans warm, and to better understand how the MJO works, so its representation can be improved in other models as well.\r\n\r\nUncertainty about future changes to the MJO represent an important X-factor for climate change.  Preliminary results suggest that the MJO will intensify, become more frequent, and affect a broader region of the tropics as the oceans warm.  Potential impacts include changes to tropical rainfall patterns, altered distributions of tropical storms and hurricanes, and changes in wind patterns that favor more frequent and persistent El Nino-like ocean warming.  This project will also educate two graduate students and several undergraduate students about techniques in modeling atmospheric circulations and about climate dynamics.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) is a very large weather system that enhances rainfall near the equator over the warmest ocean waters on our planet.  It typically forms in the Indian Ocean and moves slowly eastward over the western Pacific Ocean before dissipating near the International Dateline.  The MJO changes atmospheric circulations, both near its region of heavy rainfall, and all around the world, especially in the upper atmosphere in the tropics.  It also modulates the formation of hurricanes and typhoons, the timing and intensity of monsoon rainfall, and atmospheric rivers of moisture that can cause heavy flooding in the United States.  For this reason, exactly how the MJO will change in a warming world is an important question for society, and because the MJO is not fully understood nor is it properly modeled in many climate models, this question merits further research.\n\nIn this project we used novel atmospheric and oceanic models to simulate how the MJO changes in response to warming oceans.  Instead of solving partial differential equations describing fluid motion on a grid of points, which is the standard approach to climate modeling, we tracked the movement of individual \"parcels\" of water or air to simulate atmospheric and oceanic circulations.  Our modeling approach is referred to as \"Lagrangian\" because of its treatment of fluid dynamics in a frame of reference moving with the fluid.  We had previously developed a Lagrangian atmospheric model (LAM),  and in this project we improved the LAM, developed a Lagrangian ocean model (LOM; Haertel 2019), and coupled the two models together yeilding a Lagrangian coupled model (LCM; Figure 1).  One reason we chose to further develop and use Lagrangian models, is that they are particularly good at simulating the MJO (Figure 2), whereas many conventional climate models have struggled to properly simulate the MJO for decades (e.g., Hung et al. 2013).\n\nIn our LAM simulations, in which we prescibe sea surface temperatures and use only an atmospheric model, when the ocean surface warms uniformly the MJO produces heavier rainfall, propagates faster, covers a larger region of the tropics, and occurs more frequently (Figure 3).  The basic structure of the MJO remains the same, with a slight broadening and deepening of circulations, and an increase in the amplitude of moisture perturbations.  These MJO changes are largely caused by enhanced evaporation coming from a warmer ocean surface (Haertel 2018).  In a 100-year coupled ocean/atmosphere simulation mimicing what's happening in our world with increasing greenhouse gases, the MJO also becomes more frequent and intense (Figure 4; Haertel 2020).  The LCM simulation is more realistic because MJO changes feed back on ocean circulations. The MJO changes predicted by the LAM and LCM have the potential to make important impacts on tropical cyclone distributions, Asian and American monsoons, and El Nino.  However, our Lagrangian models predict more substantial MJO changes than other climate models, so it will take further research to clarify the nature and extent of the expected impacts of a changing MJO.\n\nIn addition to providing predictions about possible MJO changes in a warming climate, this project also helped to clarify how the MJO works.  In our LAM simulations, the MJO's winds enhance evaporation both to the east and to the west of the region of heavy rainfall (Figure 5; Haertel 2018).  Moistened air parcels then converge into the MJO center helping to form a broad region with deep atmospheric moisture.  This mechanism of the MJO differs from that in several prominant MJO theories that suggest radiation from clouds is more important than surface fluxes for growing and maintaining the MJO, and which do not account for enhanced evaporation both to the east and the west of the MJO's region with heavy rainfall.  Our work also helped to explain the horizontal structure of the MJO's circulation as a superposition of two atmospheric wave types: Kelvin and Rossby waves, which are excited by the latent heat release of condensation in the MJO's regions of heavy rainfall, and which grow and decay over the MJO's life cycle (Figure 6; Haertel 2021).
