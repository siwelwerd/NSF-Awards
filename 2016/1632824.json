Experimental and computation methods will be combined to better understand biomass deconstruction, the use of lignin for soil improvement, and to develop separation technologies for water treatment. The anticipated outcomes will lead to more sustainable agricultural practices, improved energy efficiency and soil and water quality. A comprehensive suite of education and outreach activities will provide training for K-12 teachers, research experiences for undergraduate and graduate students, and mentoring for early career faculty. These programs will recruit underrepresented minorities and women and broaden their participation in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) fields.\r\n\r\nTechnical Description\r\n\r\nThis project will support complementary, collaborative research between the University of Puerto Rico Mayaguez (UPR) and the University of South Carolina Columbia (USC) to address fundamental issues in biomass deconstruction, catalysis, lignin, and membranes separation technology for engineering improved agricultural sustainability. UPR will perform bottom-up design of nanostructured catalysts for targeted transformation of biomass waste into value added chemicals as well as the study of soil amendment using lignin. USC will focus on the development of advanced composites and membranes to remove contaminants of emerging concern from irrigation water.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Center for a Sustainable Water Energy Food Nexus (SusWEF) established a partnership between the University of Puerto Rico - Mayaguez (UPRM) and the University of South Carolina (USC) that used an integrated approach of synergistic research to study aspects related to the Nexus.  To achieve our goals, we assembled a competitive interjurisdictional collaboration with unique expertise that complemented and supplemented that present at the other jurisdiction.  The UPRM team has experimental expertise in materials design, synthesis, characterization, and evaluation in the areas of catalysis and water treatment coupled with knowledge in soil science, ecology and hydrology.  Additionally, the USC team brought expertise in the areas related to computational chemistry, data science, and high throughput experimental analysis.  Together, our research approach contributed to transform the field by fundamentally altering the way materials are discovered, developed, and optimized.  SusWEF studied:  1) the use of agricultural waste biomass for the sustainable production of lignin and carbohydrates, 2) the use of an integrated set of computational and experimental tools to discover improved catalytic and porous adsorbent materials, 3) the development of selective and efficient catalytic materials and processes for carbohydrates conversion to value added chemicals including biodegradable polymer building blocks, 4) the development of advanced separation technologies for water treatment, 5) the use of soil conditioners for improving crop production and water retention.\n\nSusWEF research advanced our understanding of first principles design, synthesis, characterization, and implementation of 1) catalytic materials for the upgrading of carbohydrates with minimal separation steps and low water consumption (for example the production of a-hydroxy acids from C5 and C6 sugars and the production of levoglucosenone from cellulose), and 2) nanoporous adsorbent composite materials and nanofiltration membranes for the removal of contaminants of emerging concern (CECs, for example the removal of antibiotics) from water used during agricultural operations.  Our team also improved knowledge of lignocellulosic biomass deconstruction using polar aprotic solvents as well as soil conditioning by recycling lignin as a soil amendment.  Our approach should help the efficient use of natural resources and, thus, securing food, water, and energy.  To address these complex challenges, we assembled two research thrusts and a workforce development thrust (WDT) comprised of faculty with shared interests and complementary skills from the partner institutions.  One thrust performed bottom-up design of nanostructured catalysts for the targeted transformation of agricultural and forestry residues into value added chemicals, decreasing fossil fuel consumption, and helping curb CO2 emissions and climate change as well as the study of soil amendment using lignin.  A second thrust focused on the development of advanced composites and membranes to remove CECs from water, particularly those that arise from agricultural irrigation water.  The research was disseminated through 46 publications in peered reviewed journals, one book, two book chapters and 11 theses/dissertations as well as a number of publications that are in preparation.  The research performed also led to one patent ?Methods and Compositions for Hydrodeoxygenation of Carbohydrates and Carbohydrate Analogs?, to a provisional patent application and one disclosure with a provisional patent application in process.  The WDT integrated research, education, and outreach activities that targeted K-12, undergraduate, and graduate levels.  At the UPRM we have trained through this project 6 PhD, 8 MS graduate students (5 female, 14 Hispanic) and 29 undergraduate students (11 female, 29 Hispanic).  Five already successfully defended their PhD theses and two their MS theses.  Twenty three of the undergraduate students already obtained their BS degrees (10 female, 23 Hispanic).  At the USC, 8 PhD students, 1 MS graduate student, 3 postdoctoral associates, and 2 undergraduate student were trained through this project (2 female, 1 African American).  Three students already obtained their PhD degrees and one her MS degree.  The postdoctoral associates received training in heterogeneous catalysis, computational catalysis, training in (computer time) proposal writing, and organization and delivering of research presentations.\n\nSusWEF helped in the creation of a diverse workforce by broadening participation of Hispanics and women in STEM fields with emphasis in sustainability and the WEF nexus.  Furthermore, a major goal of SusWEF was to launch and nurture the academic careers of several, promising early career faculty. Our research teams included four recently appointed assistant professors at UPRM and one at USC who were mentored by established faculty from both UPR and USC.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/23/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Nelson Cardona-Martinez"
