 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program grant will investigate the combined effects of environmental aging and earthquakes on concrete bridges. The main cause of aging-induced deterioration in concrete bridges is corrosion of reinforcing bars, which may result in a significant reduction in load capacity and endanger the safety of the structure. An in-depth computational-experimental research program will be conducted to understand the main corrosion-related degradation mechanisms in reinforced concrete and potential impacts of earthquakes on the deteriorated bridge structure. Novel engineering materials of high-performance fiber-reinforced concrete and superelastic steel alloys will be employed to increase resiliency of the bridge members. The outcomes of this project are expected to result in direct benefits to the society by extending the lifetimes of bridge structures and by reducing the repair and maintenance costs. It is expected that the evaluation, prediction, and design tools developed in this project will serve as a basis for future research and implementation, in not only bridges but also in other reinforced concrete structures such as ports. The research and education will be integrated by creating a community with university researchers and with high school teachers and their students. The Investigator plans to engage college students from underrepresented groups in the project. \r\n\r\nHigh-performance fiber-reinforced concrete exhibits high crack tightness, increased tensile ductility, low permeability, and higher damage resistance compared with traditional concrete. Novel Cu-Al-Mn superelastic alloy reinforcing bars can recover large strains upon unloading. In addition, they are easily machinable and have a cost advantage over conventional superelastic alloy bars. Through use of these new materials, the objective of this project is to improve the seismic performance and durability of bridge structural elements. New knowledge will be generated on the deterioration processes of concrete structures, the thermo-mechanical behavior of new superelastic alloys, and the seismic response of deteriorated bridges.",

The motivation for this research is underscored by the vulnerability of our infrastructure to the natural disasters including earthquakes, hurricanes, tornados, and flooding, among others. This problem is exacerbated by the fact that our infrastructure in the United States is relatively old and has deteriorated due mechanisms such as corrosion. The specific hazards under the multi-hazard umbrella that were considered are environmental aging + one of the following extreme events: earthquakes, blast, or impact. A combined experimental and computational research program was carried out over the duration of the project to first evaluate the vulnerability of concrete infrastructure to these hazards and then propose material and design solutions [1-5]. Specifically, reinforced concrete columns have been evaluated in depth for being one of the most important elements in structures compromise of which could result in catastrophic failures. Innovative materials have been developed or evaluated to address these multi-hazard problems [6-10]. In these studies, Cu-Al-Mn superelastic alloys have been studied extensively as a replacement of steel reinforcement in concrete to improve the resiliency of structures subjected to earthquakes. Fiber-reinforced cementitious composites, particularly, ultra high-performance concrete was evaluated to improve both the seismic performance and the durability. Additionally, a self-healing concrete has been developed and characterized to address the multi-hazard issues [11]. The research findings have been extensively communicated to the community to publications. Eleven journal articles have already been published from this work.
