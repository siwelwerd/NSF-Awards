 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Noyce Master Teaching Fellowship project leverages current high school reform efforts in the Sacramento region by enabling a community of 20 mathematics and science master teachers to lead implementation of new K-12 STEM standards and model effective practices for in-service and pre-service teachers.  The master teachers participate in a three-phase program of study, which includes (1) understanding and implementing science standards and cultural competency, (2) developing leadership capacity, and (3) mentoring pre-service teachers.  Key features of Phase 1 such as the participation of the master teachers in the Parent Teacher Home Visit Project (through which they will be trained in cultural competence, conduct home visits with the families of high-needs students, and then engage them in class) and the implementation of Linked Learning (an educational approach that makes science and mathematics more relevant to students by linking course content to real-world applications that are in turn connected to regional career pathways) will lay the foundation for professional development in Phases 2 and 3.  The project is a partnership between Sacramento's four largest high needs, unified school districts (Elk Grove, Natomas, Sacramento City, and San Juan), the Sacramento County Office of Education, and the Sacramento Metro Chamber of Commerce's workforce development and education affiliate (NextEd).\r\n\r\nResearch shows that the use of Linked Learning strategies in STEM courses can be especially effective at high schools with high drop-out rates, and/or where substantial numbers of students are low income and/or culturally or linguistically diverse.  Recognizing that this pedagogical framework paired with a better understanding of students and their families can also be used as teachers align course content to new standards, this plan will focus on developing Master Teachers through Linked Learning and the Parent Teacher Home Visit Project.  Subsequent leadership training will be used to expand these competences to pre-service teachers.  The evaluation plan will address the effectiveness of the project in developing and retaining math and science teacher-leaders in high needs local education agencies.  Action research data collected by the master teachers will be used to analyze the extent to which teaching practices change and leadership initiatives develop.  Additionally, the development of leadership capacity will be assessed through master teachers' reflection papers and surveys given to those being trained or mentored by them.  The results of this work will be disseminated at the California Department of Education STEM Annual Conference, California Science Teachers Association, California Mathematics Council, and Association of Mathematics Teacher Educators.",
