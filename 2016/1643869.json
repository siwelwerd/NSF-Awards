 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Scholars of Excellence in Engineering and Computer Science (SEECS) program will be an interdisciplinary, multi-year, mixed academic-level program offering scholarships to engineering and computer science majors with academic talent and financial need. The goals of the scholarship program will be to: (1) increase the number of low-income, academically talented students in engineering and computer science majors, (2) assist students in continuing their STEM education through graduation, (3) foster professional development for STEM careers and graduate education, and (4) study the impact of targeted intervention strategies on retention of STEM majors. Students awarded SEECS scholarships will be required to attend a seminar with a team-based, project-based environment structure. The SEECS seminar will encompass three components: engineering design, professional development, and personal development. Facets of STEM majors' professional and personal development will be addressed through workshops, university support services, lectures, and invited speakers. While the professional and personal development facets will occur through typical seminar activities, such as guest speakers and reflective activities, the engineering design component will be the pivotal experience to connect and build engineering competency and personal confidence. Additionally, the design projects will benefit regional service organizations. \r\n\r\nThe SEECS academic-research project will assess the effect of academic interventions on retention rates of high-performing students at the University. University-wide data will be analyzed to monitor the individual effects of intervention strategies. Peer-assisted study strategies (PASS) will be utilized as an intervention to address potential low academic performance. PASS uses peer-tutored extra help sessions for identified attrition point courses. SEECS will evaluate the success of PASS programs in reducing attrition. Project resources will be utilized to investigate the research question: Does peer-assisted study have a measurable positive effect on academic performance for nominally high-achieving students? Additionally, the project will continue to study and disseminate the effect of experiential education as expressed through community-service design projects. The expected outcomes of the proposed work include the dissemination of: (1) research study results, (2) program structure and successes to provide a model for implementation, and (3) student-generated STEM solutions to support local non-profit organizations.",

In 2016, Gannon University received funds to continue the NSF S-STEM scholarship program, <em>Scholars of Excellence in Engineering and&nbsp;Computer Science</em> (SEECS).&nbsp; Over the four-year grant period (2017-2021), $999,885 were received to support 25 academically promising students per year in one of the eight majors in the School of Engineering and Computing.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Three goals were identified for the SEECS project: 1) increase the number of low-income, academically talented students, especially women, enrolling in and graduating from its engineering and computer science programs; 2) assist students to continue their education through graduation using a program of scholarships and rigorous academic support; 3) foster professional development to prepare students for careers in STEM fields and graduate education; and 4) study the impact of targeted interventions on retention of high academic performing students, focusing on attrition-point courses. &nbsp;Four objectives were specified, and Table 1 provides the summary of the results.</p>\n<p>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Provide 25 scholarships per year for low-income, academically talented, Engineering and Computer Science majors, especially women, with demonstrated financial need (96% achieved)</p>\n<p>2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Provide a program of academic and student service support that achieves an average 80% freshman to sophomore retention rate in STEM majors for students brought in as SEECS scholars (achieved)</p>\n<p>3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Provide scholars with academic and professional development that prepares them for employment in a STEM field and/or graduate school (achieved)</p>\n<p>4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Continue successful recruitment strategies and develop enhanced recruitment strategies to achieve a 24% rate of women applicants (achieved)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The cornerstone of the program was the Professional and Personal Enrichment Seminars which offered a single, shared experience for all scholars built around activities that address their personal and professional growth.&nbsp; The seminars involved considerable interaction among scholars and with the PIs, thus enhancing the bond among scholars as a way of increasing retention.&nbsp; Developmental workshops, offered by student support offices, built social, academic, and career skills.&nbsp; In line with the University?s commitment to community engagement, the seminar included a service-learning team design activity.&nbsp; Paired with a community non-profit organization, the team of scholars identified and designed a solution to a STEM-related problem to aid the organization.&nbsp; Such enrichment activities made the scholars more aware of the role of STEM professionals and helped them develop the social and leadership skills for their future careers.&nbsp; The active projects during the last year of the award and the nonprofit they support follow:</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Four objectives were specified, and Table 1 provides the summary of the results.\n\n1)      Provide 25 scholarships per year for low-income, academically talented, Engineering and Computer Science majors, especially women, with demonstrated financial need (96% achieved)\n\n2)      Provide a program of academic and student service support that achieves an average 80% freshman to sophomore retention rate in STEM majors for students brought in as SEECS scholars (achieved)\n\n3)      Provide scholars with academic and professional development that prepares them for employment in a STEM field and/or graduate school (achieved)\n\n4)      Continue successful recruitment strategies and develop enhanced recruitment strategies to achieve a 24% rate of women applicants (achieved)\n\n \n\nThe cornerstone of the program was the Professional and Personal Enrichment Seminars which offered a single, shared experience for all scholars built around activities that address their personal and professional growth.  The seminars involved considerable interaction among scholars and with the PIs, thus enhancing the bond among scholars as a way of increasing retention.  Developmental workshops, offered by student support offices, built social, academic, and career skills.  In line with the University?s commitment to community engagement, the seminar included a service-learning team design activity.  Paired with a community non-profit organization, the team of scholars identified and designed a solution to a STEM-related problem to aid the organization.  Such enrichment activities made the scholars more aware of the role of STEM professionals and helped them develop the social and leadership skills for their future careers.  The active projects during the last year of the award and the nonprofit they support follow:\n\n-          Green Gym (energy recovery from fitness equipment and distribution) for the Recreational Wellness Center, Gannon\n\n-          Hydroponics Systems for three L'Arche, Erie homes\n\n-          Extended data collection during the winter months for the Regional Science Consortium\n\n-          Raised Garden for the Alzheimer Unit in the Pennsylvania Soldiers and Sailors Home\n\n \n\nResults: SEECS has successfully met its objectives of providing scholarships to targeted students, achieving 80% freshmen-to-sophomore retention, creating a professional development course for the scholars, and achieving and maintaining over 24% of women representation (refer to Table 1).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: Summary SEECS at Gannon   University (2017-2021)\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nYear 1\n\n(2017-18)\n\n\n\nYear 2\n\n(2018-19)\n\n\n\nYear 3\n\n(2019-20)\n\n\n\nYear 4\n\n(2020-21)\n\n\n\n\n\n#   of SEECS-eligible university applicants (Obj. 1)\n\n\n\n96\n\n\n\n91\n\n\n\n96\n\n\n\n80\n\n\n\n\n\n#   of applications for freshman cohort (Obj. 1)\n\n\n\n18\n\n\n\n21\n\n\n\n34\n\n\n\n22\n\n\n\n\n\n#   of accepted awards, freshman cohort (Obj. 1)\n\n\n\n7\n\n\n\n8\n\n\n\n10\n\n\n\n9\n\n\n\n\n\nFemale   applications, freshmen (Obj. 1 &amp; 4)\n\n\n\n38%\n\n\n\n33%\n\n\n\n50%\n\n\n\n27%\n\n\n\n\n\n# of accepted awards, all cohorts   (Obj. 1)\n\n\n\n25\n\n\n\n22\n\n\n\n24\n\n\n\n26\n\n\n\n\n\nFemales, across all cohorts (Obj.   4)\n\n\n\n44%\n\n\n\n41%\n\n\n\n58%\n\n\n\n58%\n\n\n\n\n\nAverage award (Obj. 1)\n\n\n\n$6,067\n\n\n\n$6,402\n\n\n\n$6,325\n\n\n\n$8,460\n\n\n\n\n\nFreshmen-to-sophomore retention   (Obj.2 ? target 80%)\n\n\n\n86%\n\n\n\n88%\n\n\n\n80%\n\n\n\n88%\n\n\n\n\n\nYear-to-year retention in STEM\n\n\n\n100%\n\n\n\n95%\n\n\n\n100%\n\n\n\n100%\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduates of SEECS Program (Obj.   4)\n\n\n\n9\n\n\n\n5\n\n\n\n5\n\n\n\n5\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduates   employed in STEM field or continuing their education (Obj. 4)\n\n\n\n9\n\n\n\n5\n\n\n\n5\n\n\n\n5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nFour design projects were completed for regional non-profit organizations during this grant period.  These projects have had significant regional impact and have significant global implication, addressing both environmental and human needs.  Students have showcased their community-based design project yearly via poster presentations at the American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE) North Central Section Conference.  \n\nDuring this grant period, four conference papers (ASEE Annual Meetings) have been published by the PIs reporting many aspects of the SEECS program. \n\nFinally, the program has met the intellectual merit and broader impact criteria of SEECS by having: (1) enhanced the disposition of the scholars towards engineering, service, and professionalism, (2) achieved retention objectives, (3) enabled collaborative PI-students scholarly activities, (4) disseminated the program structure and successes through professional outlets, thereby providing a model for implementation, (5) increased the involvement of women in STEM professions by continuing with successful recruitment practices, and (6) provided enrichment and professional development activities.
