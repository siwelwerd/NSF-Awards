 "awd_abstract_narration": "Gamma-rays are the highest energy form of electromagnetic radiation.  Observations of astrophysical gamma-rays serve as probes of physical conditions and processes in the most extreme environments throughout the Universe, and can be used to test fundamental physics.  This award supports scientists at the University of California Los Angeles to carry out gamma-ray astrophysics research using an operating observatory and participate in the planning and development of the next generation gamma-ray observatory.  The Very Energetic Radiation Imaging Telescope Array System (VERITAS), located in southern Arizona, is designed to perform high sensitivity pointed observations of both galactic and extragalactic sources.  The University of California Los Angeles group will contribute to the operation and maintenance of VERITAS and work on analysis and interpretation of the scientific data.  The group is also involved in the development of the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA), an international gamma-ray observatory currently in planning stages.  The group leads the development of the Schwarzschild-Couder Telescope (SCT), a new technology to be implemented on CTA.  They will operate a prototype SCT at the VERITAS site. The group will continue their existing education and outreach activities to high-school students with hands-on research involving data from VERITAS and the prototype SCT.  They will also develop a citizen science program that will engage the public in exploring the data from the prototype SCT.\r\n\r\nThe University of California Los Angeles group will use VERITAS to study Galactic sources, focusing on the Cygnus region and the Galactic Center, and to search for magnetic fields in cosmic voids.  They will operate the prototype SCT alongside and in coordination with VERITAS to characterize and improve its performance.  The group will continue to be involved in the definition and leadership of CTA through the technology development and top-level project management roles.",

Based on the analysis of approximately 150 hours of data taken over a five year period, we produced a detailed skymap of the Galactic center region (Figure 1) that shows a wealth of distributed emission.  At the center of the region is the strong source J1745-290 that is associated with Sgr A*, the supermassive black hole.  The other sources include the supernova remnant G0.9+0.1 and diffuse emission along the Galactic center ridge (black circles).  In this work, we measured the source spectra to higher energies than ever achieved by any previous instrument and confirm the hypothesis that the region contains a PeVatron, a source capable of accelerating particles to 1 PeV (10^15 eV).\n\n \n\nAnother important study related to the Coma galaxy cluster that has a large angular extension of 6 degs by 8 degs.  There are major difficulties in studying such an extended object given the VERITAS field of view of 3.5 degs.  With detailed knowledge of the VERITAS instrument, we developed an original and non-conventional data analysis method that did not confirm the claim made by independent researchers of gamma-ray emission from a ring-like region exceeding a 1 deg radius.  The putative emission could be consistent with the virial shock in the Coma cluster.  Although we do not confirm such virial shock emission, we see some evidence for gamma-ray emission from the inner 1.5 deg region of the cluster using recent data taken by VERITAS after a significant upgrade in sensitivity.  This evidence warrants further investigation by VERITAS.\n\n \n\nUCLA scientists are also working on the development of a future gamma-ray observatory called the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA).
