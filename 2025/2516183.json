 "awd_abstract_narration": "Language and language expertise have a role in the criminal legal system, whether it be through the interpretation and meaning of documents or testimonies, the treatment of the defendants, witnesses, and experts, or the processes through which juries and judges interpret and understand the evidence they are presented. Forensic linguistics, which focuses on criminal investigation, has had a significant impact, but other approaches in the scientific study of language generally have had less prominent engagement. This conference brings together language scientists who are working on issues in criminal science with lawyers and other social and behavioral scientists to explore and promote new lines of interdisciplinary research on language in criminal legal contexts to advance practice in the U.S. criminal justice system. This conference advances scientific domains at the intersection of linguistics, law and science, and other social and behavioral sciences. Other benefits to society include educational opportunities for students in addition to early career and established researchers.\r\n\r\nThe conference brings together experts and practitioners to identify current areas of successful collaboration and areas where linguistics can have greater impacts. Many experts contribute talks and panel sessions, and an open poster session showcases current empirical projects. The conference provides guidance and support to students and early career scholars with interests in addressing language in criminal legal contexts. The conference is co-located with a large, established gathering of language scientists to enhance the opportunity to advance work at this intersection, by hosting these activities in a setting that is accessible to a wide range of faculty and students.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
