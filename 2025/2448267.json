 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) - Society for Industrial an Applied Mathematics (SIAM) Symposium on Discrete Algorithms (SODA) is one of the premier annual research conferences that cover the breadth of theoretical computer science. It is a conference of very long standing that has continued to play a formative role in the field; it is also at the leading edge of connections made to other areas. This project aims to increase the impact of this conference on students and postdoctoral researchers, particularly those from under-represented groups, by encouraging and enabling their participation, especially in cases where travel expenses and conference fees would otherwise preclude their attendance.\r\n\r\nConcretely, this project assists US-based students and postdoctoral fellows in attending the 2025 Annual SODA conference, sponsored by the ACM and SIAM. The coming SODA will take place in New Orleans, Louisiana, January 12-15, 2025. The project plans to support 26 students in attending this conference. It is planned to select the students in such a way that the group of students attending these top-rank research conferences is broadened. By this the impact of Algorithms Research, as well as the participation in Algorithms Research, will increase.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
