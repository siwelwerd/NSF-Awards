 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides partial travel support to U.S.-based early career researchers and students to attend a workshop that will be held together with the International Congress on Sustainability Science and Engineering (ICOSSE) in Auckland, New Zealand, Feb. 20-22, 2025. The purpose of the workshop is to exchange emerging ideas about ways and means of advancing research and enhancing education on industrial and environmental sustainability using AI and digital technologies. The workshop will help the U.S. workshop attendees to gain comprehensive understanding of the research and education opportunities in the challenging areas, define research and educational directions, and develop ideas for advancing their research and educational activities in the next step. As it will be jointly held with the ICOSSE\u201925 that will cover various topics on sustainability, the workshop will further benefit the U.S. workshop participants to learn more broadly the frontier research and education in engineering sustainability.\r\n\r\nThe workshop will provide an international platform for the U.S. based scholars to engage with global leaders, innovators, and visionaries in multi-disciplinary research from around the world, especially from the U.S. and Asian and Pacific countries; to identify research directions for shaping the future of sustainability engineering using AI and digital technologies; and to develop international collaboration opportunities. Junior faculty members, early-career researchers, graduate and undergraduate students will be strongly encouraged to attend the workshop. A publication based on the workshop will be generated. The workshop will help develop broad international collaboration in this very challenging area.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
