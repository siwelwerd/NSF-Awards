 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 2025 NSF Campus Cyberinfrastructure PI Workshop is a PI workshop for active NSF Campus Cyberinfrastructure (CC*) awardees and relevant NSF staff.  The workshop builds upon the successes of the previous workshops in providing an opportunity for recipients of all active NSF Campus Cyberinfrastructure awards to meet to exchange project findings, interact with national cyberinfrastructure experts and collaborate across project areas and project regions. It provides opportunities for additional collaborations by again coordinating with the 2025 Quilt Spring Member Meeting.  The Quilt has served as the co-PI and PI in the series of CC* PI Workshops over the last eight years.  \r\n\r\nThe workshop provides a critical opportunity for both campus cyberinfrastructure and national cyberinfrastructure experts to exchange ideas, develop best practices, and share both new innovations and some lessons learned.  The workshop has the potential to advance knowledge among the participants in the best practices for operating cyberinfrastructure to support university research through planned as well as less formal interactions between participants both within and across CC* award areas.  The workshop presentations and the workshop final report are being disseminated to CC* award participants and the campus and research community in general, enhancing the broader engagement impact of the workshop.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
