 "awd_abstract_narration": "The impact of this I-Corps project is based on the lab to market translation of a wireless neuromodulation system used in implantable medical devices. This novel system eliminates the need for a battery by using wireless power to activate the device only when needed, minimizing the need for post-implantation interventions. This solution addresses the current need for an on-board battery and/or frequent battery changes. This approach enables the development of smaller, more efficient devices focused on data acquisition and transmission, while also minimizing the size and complexity of the power-receiving components. The implantable medical device market is expected to grow significantly, with over 3 million potential patients in the U.S. by the end of the decade. This technology could benefit this patient population by improving the efficiency, safety, and longevity of implantable devices. \r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of phased-array-based simultaneous tracking, communication, and powering of an optogenetic neuromodulation implant. This implant can inhibit or excite specific genetically modified neurons using specific wavelengths of light emitted through micro light emitting diodes (LEDs). This new solution consists of a small, highly efficient, multiband antenna as a receiver (implant) antenna, an active phased-array transmitter, and a rectifier to convert the radiofrequency signal into a direct current (DC) signal. By enabling safer, battery-free medical implants, the technology reduces the need for invasive procedures, leading to better patient outcomes and lower healthcare costs. The miniaturization of the implantable devices paves the way for more accessible and portable medical solutions, fostering innovation in wearable health monitoring and personalized medicine.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
