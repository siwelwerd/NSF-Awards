 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support for Rutgers Symplectic Summer School 2025 (RSSS2025), which will take place at Rutgers University at New Brunswick, New Jersey, August 18-22, 2025. Symplectic geometry has been thriving in the past few decades and have very rich connections to other fields such as algebraic geometry, low-dimensional topology, and dynamical systems. The growing number of graduate students and young researchers calls for opportunities to learn beyond their regular curriculum, to be exposed to the cutting-edge developments, and to build professional connections. The RSSS2025 will strongly encourage graduates and postdocs to participate in this event and engage in formal and informal research collaboration.\r\n\r\nThe RSSS2025 features three days of minicourses on topics of Fukaya category, Atiyah-Floer conjecture, and Floer theoretic applications in low-dimensional topology. They are followed by two days of research talks covering a variety of topics including recent developments on Viterbo conjecture, contact geometry, global Kuranishi chart theory, equivariant Floer theory, and works related to birational geometry. These topics cover many recent important developments in this field, providing valuable opportunities for learning and exchanging ideas.  More information is available at the conference website: https://sites.google.com/view/rsss2025.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
