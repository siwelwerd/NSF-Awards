 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Centers of Research Excellence in Science and Technology (CREST), this project aims to establish a computer science doctoral program to contribute to the national need for a diverse, highly skilled workforce in critical areas such as artificial intelligence, data science, and cybersecurity. This project is significant for its role in creating accessible doctoral pathways for all individuals in STEM, expanding research opportunities, and developing graduates with essential skills. Through targeted recruitment, structured mentorship, and extensive support systems, this program seeks to increase the participation and success of all individuals in STEM and foster a research-intensive environment that strengthens national STEM competitiveness and prepares the next generation of experts in science and technology.\r\n\r\nThe project goals include developing a comprehensive graduate curriculum, establishing a sustainable recruitment and retention framework, fostering a mentoring environment, and enhancing research capacity for both faculty and students in computer science. Faculty will receive structured training to provide effective mentorship, using evidence-based frameworks such as the Affinity Research Group model, Multiple Mentor model, and Individual Development Plans to support students\u2019 academic and career development, with best practices disseminated through publications and across other institutions. Faculty and students will collaborate on high-impact, interdisciplinary research, participating in workshops that enhance research skills, foster collaboration, and support funding acquisition. The Centers of Research Excellence in Science and Technology (CREST) program provides support to enhance research capabilities of institutions through the establishment of centers that effectively integrate education and research.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
