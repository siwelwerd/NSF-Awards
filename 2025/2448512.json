 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the participation of graduate students and postdoctoral researchers in the July 8-12, 2025 \"Bootcamp\" to be held the week preceding the 2025 Summer Research Institute in Algebraic Geometry at Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO. The algebraic geometry research community has a tradition of running a Summer Research Institute every ten years. The institute convenes researchers from around the world to discuss the developments of the past decade and to chart out the most pressing and far-reaching problems for the next decade. The next Summer Research Institute in Algebraic Geometry will take place immediately following the Bootcamp at Colorado State University from July 14 to August 1, 2025. The Bootcamp is aimed at advanced graduate students and early postdocs and has two main goals: first, to familiarize participants with a broad range of developments in algebraic geometry in an informal setting prior to the start of the Research Institute, and second to provide a venue for early-career researchers in algebraic geometry that will foster peer and near-peer collaborations. \r\n\r\nThe Bootcamp will focus on fifteen areas in algebraic geometry that have seen significant developments in the past decade. Topics include birational geometry and applications, advances on algebraic curves and their moduli, derived algebraic geometry and Bridgeland stability, perfectoid geometry with applications to positive and mixed characteristics, Gromov-Witten and Donaldson-Thomas theory, K-stability and moduli spaces of higher dimensional varieties, and combinatorial geometry. More details about the Bootcamp can be found on the website: https://sites.google.com/view/agbootcamp2025/.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
