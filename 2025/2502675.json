 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides partial support for the conference, The Legacy of John Tate, and Beyond that will take place at the Harvard University Science Center, March 17-21, 2025. This is a research conference in several areas of Mathematics. Many leading researchers in Arithmetic Geometry, Algebraic Geometry, K-Theory, Topology and related topics will be speakers in this meeting and outline current research they and their collaborators are pursuing in these areas. The collective theme is that they were all worked on by John Tate and in some cases started by him. John Tate proved many fundamental theorems, but perhaps more importantly, he demonstrated new ways of thinking about mathematics that show no signs of slowing more than half a century after he introduced them. The majority of the funds will be used to assist with expenses for junior faculty and graduate students without other means of support, to attend and participate in the meeting. \r\n\r\nJohn Tate founded or strongly influenced many of the primary areas of study within algebraic geometry and number theory: his thesis, which gave a different way of looking at zeta and L-functions of number fields, the cohomological reformulation of local and global class field theory, arithmetic duality, nonarchimedean analysis, elliptic curves and abelian varieties, algebraic K-theory of local and global fields, p-adic Hodge theory, and conjectures on algebraic cycles. All of these are active areas of study. The conference will explain in detail how Tate's ideas and results have shaped the field in a fundamental way and are still leading to major advances. This conference will help inspire the current and next generation of mathematicians to extend and go beyond what is presently known in these areas. \r\n\r\nConference website: https://www.math.harvard.edu/event/the-legacy-of-john-tate-and-beyond/\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
