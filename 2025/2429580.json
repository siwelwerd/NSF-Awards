 "awd_abstract_narration": "Electrified aircraft propulsion (EAP) plays a pivotal role in reducing energy consumption and carbon emissions in aviation, but managing the heat generated by high-specific power motors remains a major challenge. This project aims to develop a cutting-edge cooling technology for electric motors using 3D-printed components immersed in oil. Unlike traditional air or pumped liquid cooling, oil immersion provides direct contact between the coolant and the motor\u2019s windings, leading to better heat dissipation, lower temperatures, and reduced noise. The project will address critical barriers such as the lower electrical conductivity of 3D-printed parts and increased system complexity. Through collaboration with NASA Glenn Research Center, the project will advance the development of efficient, reliable motors for urban air mobility (UAM) vehicles, potentially transforming urban transportation, reducing emissions, and boosting the aerospace industry in Arkansas. The project will also foster collaborations with researchers from different disciplines, including thermal, electrical, and aerospace engineering. Educational outreach will include training a Ph.D. student and involving undergraduates in research, integrating project results into aerospace curricula, and engaging underrepresented students through seminars and facility tours. The outcomes will not only contribute to scientific progress but also support job creation and workforce development in a growing industry.\r\n\r\nThe objective of this project is to develop and demonstrate an immersion-cooled, 3D-printed stator technology for high-specific-power electric motors, specifically an interior permanent magnet synchronous motor. The research will explore three key areas: (1) establishing a performance baseline using traditional motor windings with oil immersion cooling, (2) demonstrating improved cooling with additively manufactured windings designed for high-slot-density and enhanced surface area, and (3) validating long-term motor reliability through predictive maintenance enabled by real-time monitoring. Additive manufacturing will allow for the integration of intricate cooling channels within the motor components, optimizing local heat transfer and improving the motor\u2019s performance. Acoustic sensors embedded in the motor will detect early-stage faults to facilitate maintenance and ensure longevity. By overcoming the challenge of lower electrical conductivity in 3D-printed windings through electromagnetic and thermal co-design, this project aims to achieve superior motor efficiency, reliability, and specific power. This project stands to benefit from the extensive experience and strong expertise of the host site, NASA Glenn Research Center in EAP development and testing. NASA Glenn plays a critical role in the progress of UAM, especially in electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft, and provides invaluable expertise and testing facilities for EAP systems. This project will support the principal investigator and a graduate student from the University of Arkansas to visit NASA Glenn and work with NASA researchers to design, develop, and demonstrate a lightweight, effective, and reliable cooling technology for aircraft motors.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
