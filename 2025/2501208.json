 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nontechnical Description\r\nImagine a computer that works more like your brain \u2013 fast, smart, and able to learn from experience. That is the idea behind neuromorphic computing, a new way to design computers inspired by how the human brain processes information. Unlike regular computers, which separate memory and processing, neuromorphic computers combine these functions. This makes them faster, more energy-efficient and better at handling large amounts of data. A promising approach called magnetic skyrmions could make these brain-like computers even better. Skyrmions are tiny, stable magnetic patterns that use very little energy. They could help create powerful computers that learn and adapt. However, controlling skyrmions with electrical signals and making them work on a small scale remains a challenge. This project will solve these problems by exploring new materials and their interface to improve skyrmion control. It will lead to more efficient, powerful computers, and provide hands-on learning opportunities for future scientists and engineers.\r\n\r\nTechnical Description \r\nNeuromorphic systems, inspired by biological neural networks, require advanced materials and device architectures to replicate brain-like functions. Magnetic skyrmions\u2014nanoscale, topologically protected spin structures\u2014offer promising characteristics such as low energy consumption, stability, and high information density. However, controlling and scaling skyrmion-based devices remains a technical challenge, particularly in conventional heavy metal/ferromagnet systems where energy consumption and limited tunability hinder practical implementation. The objective of this research is to explore new materials and their interface to enable precise and energy-efficient control of skyrmions. Specifically, the project will investigate the ferroelectrics/ferromagnet interface, which has the potential to facilitate efficient electric-field manipulation of skyrmions due to broken inversion symmetry and strong spin-orbit coupling. This approach will allow for better control over skyrmion characteristics such as size, chirality, and density. The research tasks include (1) exploring new 2D ferroelectrics and ferromagnets, with a focus on room-temperature ordering, (2) fabricating and characterizing ferroelectrics/ferromagnet heterostructures, utilizing advanced microscopy techniques to observe skyrmion behavior, and (3) using electric gating to manipulate skyrmion properties. The project will integrate experimental investigations with theoretical modeling to understand the physical mechanisms governing skyrmion formation and control. By advancing the understanding of spintronic materials, the project will contribute to the development of next-generation computing technologies. Successful outcomes from this research could enable the development of more efficient, brain-inspired computing systems, fostering innovation in artificial intelligence and advanced data processing.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
