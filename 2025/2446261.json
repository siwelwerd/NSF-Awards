 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will acquire a terrestrial laser scanner (TLS). The TLS is a portable device that captures detailed 3D images of the ground, vegetation and other landscape features, and buildings. These precise, high-quality data will support advanced studies in Earth Sciences and related fields. TLS images are used to model surfaces, observe natural processes, and create high-resolution maps. The new TLS will empower students at Boise State University to address pressing environmental issues. These include understanding carbon storage and loss and the effects of climate change on water resources. Students will gain experience in data science and field data collection, applicable to many career paths. Additionally, the TLS will foster student teamwork, through collaborative studies on diverse research topics.\r\n\r\nThe Department of Geosciences at Boise State University will receive the Riegl VZ-600i TLS and its accompanying software and training. The TLS will be available for research and education across the department and with its partners. It will be used primarily to characterize organic and inorganic carbon budgets in western U.S. drylands (rangelands). The TLS will enhance graduate student projects in quantifying changes in peatland carbon, including studies on peatland microtopography and vegetation from elevated CO2 and temperature experiments. It will also support advanced studies in hydrology, ecohydrology, and geomorphology, while driving innovation in models of ecohydrology and erosion. Finally, the TLS will play a pivotal role in engaging the broader community. Undergraduate and graduate students will gain hands-on experience with this cutting-edge technology, sharpening their analytical and critical thinking skills. Through outreach programs, K-12 students will interact with it, promoting Earth Science and related careers to a new generation. With its mobility and ease of use, the new TLS will be a vital asset for addressing national research priorities, building education and research capacity, and fostering a deeper understanding of our planet\u2019s dynamic systems across academic and public audiences.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
