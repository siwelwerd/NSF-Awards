 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the \u201cMacaulay2 Workshop at Tulane University,\u201d which will be held at Tulane University from April 14-18, 2025. This week-long intensive workshop will be focused on the development of the free and open-source computer algebra software system Macaulay2, which is widely used for research in commutative algebra and algebraic geometry. The workshop aims to develop research infrastructure through the creation and maintenance of Macaulay2 packages, to train early-career researchers in the use and development of the software system, and to facilitate collaborations. It will include a two-day mini-school providing training for participants new to Macaulay2. The workshop also encourages the formation of research communities among graduate students through scheduled lightning talks and a networking event. \r\n\r\nThe specific software development goals are motivated by current needs in active mathematical research areas. Participants will contribute to Macaulay2 packages that implement algorithms and constructions from the invariant theory of tensors and auxiliary algebras, the computation of invariants of linearly reductive groups, injective resolutions in topological data analysis, Gaussian mixture models, and subvarieties under birational maps relevant to algebraic statistics. The conference website is https://sites.google.com/view/macaulay2tulane/.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
