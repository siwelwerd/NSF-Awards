 "awd_abstract_narration": "This conference will support the development of an updated North American Roadmap, first produced at the Gender Summit - North America held in 2013, with a worldwide perspective based on the latest research, policy advances and outcomes to advance excellence in research and innovation. The network of the Gender Summit platforms (Europe, Africa, Latin America & the Caribbean, Asia Pacific, North America, and the newly created GS-India) provides a unique opportunity to implement the recommendations for short-, medium- and long-term impact. The 2013 summit resulted in a Roadmap for Action on Diversity Fueling Excellence in Research and Innovation which included a range of specific, evidence-based actions and identified the relevant key actor organizations who had the power to bring about the improvements needed. \r\n\r\nThe Roadmap is expected to mobilize relevant science actors and stakeholder organizations to consider social and cultural contextual factors in their STEM research and innovation agendas. While social and cultural contextual factors have been recognized in research and innovations in health-related fields, it has not yet been fully recognized as important other research areas such as: Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning, Data Science, Energy Transition, Sustainability, Advanced Materials, Big Science and other fields which impact societal wellbeing. Other goals of the new Roadmap include elevating the importance that social and cultural contextual factors can have on the replicability of studies, and to elevate support for meta-analytic and systematic review which combines multiple research results ultimately strengthening evidence-based policy making.  This conference will strengthen partnerships between academia, industry and government and help inform public policy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
