 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a meeting on mathematical logic, titled a Very Informal Gathering of Logicians, from Friday February 7, to Sunday February 9, 2025, at the University of California Los Angeles. This is the twenty-second in a series of biennial logic meetings at UCLA which, starting in the mid 1970s, has been one of the most important forums for mathematical logic on the West Coast. The meeting is a key opportunity for logicians to learn about and discuss important advances in research, to exchange ideas, and to collaborate on scientific projects. About half the grant funds are dedicated to travel awards for graduate students and early career researchers, to allow them to come to the meeting. Most of the participants will be research mathematicians and university teachers. What they learn at the meeting will have a positive impact on their research and teaching. \r\n\r\nThe meeting is scheduled to have eleven talks, on a wide range of topics within mathematical logic, including set theory, descriptive set theory, model theory, recursion theory, and philosophical logic, with speakers at all career stages who have obtained outstanding results in these fields. There is particular emphasis on descriptive set theory, in honor of Alekos Kechris, on the occasion of his formal retirement from Caltech. One of the talks is a named lecture in honor of Greg Hjorth. The 2025 Hjorth speaker is Grigor Sargsyan. The meeting's webpage is at http://www.math.ucla.edu/~ineeman/Conf/VIG2025/\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
