 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Plant Proteolysis Gordon Research Conference (GRC) with its associated Gordon Research Seminar (GRS), is an international scientific conference focused on advancing the frontiers of science through the presentation of cutting-edge and unpublished research, prioritizing time for discussion after each talk, and fostering informal interactions among scientists of all career stages through evening poster sessions and communal meals.  Plant proteolysis has important practical implications for society, including a major role in agriculture through its impact on plant defense and yield, as well as applications in biotechnology.  The Plant Proteolysis GRS provides a unique forum for young doctoral and post-doctoral researchers to present their research as well as to build collaborative relationships with their peers.  The two-day seminar also offers a conducive environment for participants to engage in stimulating discussions on innovative concepts, and establish collaborative relationships with their peers.  This GRS includes a career mentoring discussion panel designed to offer insights and guidance from experienced mentors on navigating the journey from academic training to professional roles in science.  The GRC program includes a diverse range of speakers and discussion leaders from institutions and organizations worldwide, concentrating on the latest developments in the field.  The conference is five days long and offers oral presentations, poster sessions from individuals of all career stages, and afternoon free time and communal meals to allow for informal networking opportunities with leaders in the field. GRC has a strict no-publication policy and the final program including talk titles will be posted in the GRC website for historical purposes only.\r\n\r\nShaping the cellular proteome, proteolysis is a key process in growth, development, stress, and disease. It is engaged in protein maturation, regulation, and degradation.  Given the number of genes involved that carry out this process, proteolysis appears to be particularly important to  \r\nplants.  The number of proteins devoted to the ubiquitin-proteasome system, including about 1000 E3 ligases, exceeds that in any other kingdom of life. Also contributing to the processing and turnover of the cellular proteome are well over 500 individual proteases of different catalytic classes, as well as endosomal and autophagic sorting pathways.  Proteolysis is a highly regulated process, allowing plants to acclimate to adverse conditions by reshaping the proteome in response to environmental cues.  The GRC and GRS will bring together participants from who study different aspects of plant proteolysis to foster discussion, collaborations, and define the challenges and future opportunities in this research area.\r\n\r\nThis award is funded by the Cellular Dynamics and Function Cluster of the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences in the Directorate for Biological Sciences.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
