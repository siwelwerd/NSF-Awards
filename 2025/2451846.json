 "awd_abstract_narration": "The award will support US based participants to attend the conference entitled Interactions of Poisson Geometry, Lie Theory and Symmetry which will take place in the week of June 30\u2013July 4, 2025 at the Instituto Superior Tecnico (IST) in Lisbon, Portugal. The main scientific goal of this conference is to bring the experts in Poisson geometry, Lie theory and their applications to the study of symmetry, as well as nearby domains, together to present the significant recent developments in each area, and discuss the open problems and challenges in each field, and create a forum for researchers to interact and collaborate. Such a unique week-long conference will help to identify and promote promising new research directions, and to immerse graduate students and junior researchers in the most current research in the fields.\r\n\r\nPoisson geometry and Lie theory are related branches of differential geometry, which are both rooted deeply in mathematical formulation of classical and quantum mechanics, and the study of symmetry in physics. In the last 50 years, these areas experienced a golden period of accelerated growth with many milestone results, e.g. solutions of the Arnold conjecture, mathematical aspects of the mirror symmetry, Kontsevich\u2019s formality theorem, etc. This conference provides a platform for researchers from these areas and nearby domains to learn the most recent advances in Poisson geometry, Lie theory and symmetry, to identify promising new directions, and to help bring graduate students and postdocs up to speed with the current frontier of the fields. The conference webpage is https://sites.google.com/view/ipgls2025/.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
