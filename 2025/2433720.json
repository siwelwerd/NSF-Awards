 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Texas Power and Energy Conference (TPEC) is a student-run IEEE technical conference that started in 2017. TPEC 2025 will be held on the campus of Texas A&M University in College Station, Texas, in 2025. This two-day event will bring together participants from industry and academia to present and discuss the latest technological developments and challenges in the area of power and energy engineering. The conference will include paper sessions, keynote speakers, a student poster competition, and an industrial sponsor and job fair. There will also be tours of the Smart Grids Control Room Lab located at the Center for Infrastructure Renewal (CIR) at Texas A&M University.\r\n\r\nThis grant will be used to support students traveling to and attending TPEC 2025. Students will benefit from hearing and discussing new research developments, hearing keynote speakers, networking with industry and academia, and having the opportunity to present their work in a paper or poster. The whole research community in power and energy engineering will benefit as well, by the value and perspectives these students will bring to the event.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
