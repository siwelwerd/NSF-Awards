 "awd_abstract_narration": "Project-based learning (PBL) and other active learning practices have been shown to increase student motivation and engagement, raise examination performance, and reduce failure rates. The overarching goal of this project is to encourage and facilitate authentic learning experiences in cybersecurity by threading an Identity and Access Management (IAM)-themed PBL curriculum through existing computer science-related curricula. Students will work on authentic, real-world problems similar to what they will encounter on the job. This approach will broadly expand cybersecurity education to all computing-related students, not just those enrolled in dedicated cybersecurity programs. The project also aims to broaden participation in computing disciplines. Ultimately, it will improve student learning outcomes, including personal competencies, mastery of cybersecurity content, and higher-order thinking skills.\r\n\r\nThe project will design and develop a diverse set of ready-to-use IAM-themed software course projects, along with supporting course modules and active learning activities, which will enable course instructors to assign and support take-home PBL projects. At least ten faculty members from multiple institutions will use the developed course materials in their classroom, impacting over 1,000 students as a result. Three forms of formative evaluation, advisory board reviews, undergraduate RA beta testing, and in-house classroom trials, will be used to gather feedback to refine the developed materials. Field tests at multiple volunteer sites will assess the feasibility of implementing the developed projects in typical educational settings. Lastly, a pilot study will assess the promise of the developed projects in improving student learning outcomes. After these evaluations, the overall framework and materials developed will be disseminated through websites, publications in conference proceedings and journals, and proposed workshops. \r\n\r\nThis project is supported by the Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace (SaTC) program, which funds proposals that address cybersecurity and privacy, and in this case specifically cybersecurity education. The SaTC program aligns with the Federal Cybersecurity Research and Development Strategic Plan and the National Privacy Research Strategy to protect and preserve the growing social and economic benefits of cyber systems while ensuring security and privacy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
