 "awd_abstract_narration": "This doctoral dissertation research project investigates the impacts of transnational scientific exchanges on innovations in agricultural technology. The investigators specifically study the interactions and relationships between public and private agricultural researchers and how these collaborations strengthen the global science of food production and agriculture. A systematic, social scientific study of these relationships furthers our understanding of global scientific exchanges in the agricultural technology industry. In addition to training a doctoral student in anthropological science, broader impacts of the research include dissemination of findings to global agricultural technology business partners. Findings will also inform professional development for agricultural scientists and strengthen collaborations across global scientific communities in the agricultural technology sector. \r\n\r\nIn order to understand the impacts of global, technology-driven agriculture on food production, investigators employ a mixed methods approach including quantitative survey data collection, ethnographic interviews with scientists, observations at food technology labs, and participant observations at food production factories. The research contributes to environmental anthropology, agricultural science, the science of global food production, and to the social scientific study of the strengthening of global science infrastructures.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
