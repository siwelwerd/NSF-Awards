 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of a ferroelectric membrane that serves as an essential component in all types of rechargeable metal ion batteries, offering critical improvements in stability and cost-effectiveness. The battery industry, especially small to medium sized battery manufactures specializing in energy storage systems, are facing critical issues related to dendrite growth and short circuits, which can lead to reduced battery performance, capacity loss overtime and safety concerns. Overcoming dendrite growth is critical for advancing battery technology to remain competitive in the evolving energy storage landscape. The technology directly addresses these pressing challenges faced by them, specifically mitigating the issues of poor stability and high costs. \r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. The solution is based on the development of mesoporous polymeric ferroelectric membranes, introducing a groundbreaking separator technique for metal ion rechargeable batteries. The proposed innovation lies in a ferroelectric membrane designed to self-responsively counteract the electric field from metal dendrites, a critical issue that limits the batteries' lifetime and charging rate. While current solutions primary concentrate on novel electrode materials and electrolytes to mitigate dendrite growth, the approach presents a universal solution from the separator standpoint. This solution not only delivers similar enhancements in battery performance but also proves to be more cost-effective. The ferroelectric membrane can provide an over 20% battery stability and performance increase compared to conventional separators, and offers adaptability, as it can be tailored to suit various battery systems with ease.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
