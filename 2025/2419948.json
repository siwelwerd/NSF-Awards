 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Skilled Training in Administration and Institutional Research (STAIR) program addresses a critical need in the U.S. academic landscape by strengthening research administration capabilities across a diverse range of institutions. By providing tailored training, professional development, and consulting to cross-institutional teams of research administrators and early-career faculty from over 20+ institutions, especially from Primarily Undergraduate Institutions (PUIs) and Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs), STAIR equips them with the knowledge and tools needed to compete for and manage research projects effectively, promote collaborations, and remain compliant and financially accountable. This program aligns with NSF\u2019s mission by promoting scientific progress, enhancing national prosperity, and strengthening the country\u2019s overall research capabilities. STAIR democratizes access to essential research infrastructure and fosters an inclusive research ecosystem, empowering institutions with limited resources to contribute significantly to national scientific advancement and societal well-being.\r\n\r\nTechnically, the STAIR program builds on Penn State\u2019s successful ACOR Certification & Education Series (ACES), adapting it into a modular, open-access curriculum for a broader, more inclusive audience. The program\u2019s scope encompasses comprehensive training in proposal development, compliance, and post-award management. STAIR will deliver 2,900 hours of consulting annually, assisting early-career faculty and research administrators in building competitive research teams and securing funding. The curriculum is designed to enhance institutional research capabilities, fostering collaborative and impactful research across various institutions, particularly MSIs and PUIs. Through this approach, STAIR aims to create a highly trained and capable research administration workforce supporting a broad research ecosystem that addresses national priorities in science and education. The program's goals include workforce development, improving the competitiveness of participating institutions in securing research funding, enhancing compliance and financial accountability, and promoting cross-institutional collaboration\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
