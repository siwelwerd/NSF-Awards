This annual workshop was initiated in 1989 to serve as an essential forum for exchanging ideas between beginners and experienced researchers in the field of first-principles simulations of materials. The invited talks and contributed posters presented at the workshop will describe new methods for computing previously inaccessible material properties and will present new approaches towards achieving higher computational efficiency and accuracy. The venue for the Workshop moves around the US to enable more researchers without extensive travel budgets to attend. The workshop will bring together approximately 90 graduate students/postdocs and 30 expert researchers from universities, colleges, national laboratories, and industry.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
