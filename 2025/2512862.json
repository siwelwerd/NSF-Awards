 "awd_abstract_narration": "Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) \u201c2025 Quantum Biology GRS\u201d will be held on March 1-2, 2025, at the Renaissance Tuscany Il Ciocco in Lucca, Italy. This is a pivotal conference for early-career researchers focused on the study of quantum phenomena in biological systems. The GRS provides a close-knit and extended meeting to share ideas and network in an informal setting, fostering a strong sense of community and collective progress. The long-term goals of this seminar are to foster interactions and collaborations among the graduate students and postdoctoral researchers who share common research interests in various aspects of quantum biology including method development for theory, computation, and experiment. To achieve these goals, the GRS has created a program of about 10 speakers (chosen from abstracts submitted by attendees, and an established investigator as a Keynote Speaker). These talks will describe current advances in understanding the role of quantum phenomena in enabling and enhancing biological function beyond the classical limit. This seminar will help in the career development and research infrastructure of early-stage scientists, incorporating broader groups in STEM, by providing them with a platform to present their research, network with senior investigators, and gain exposure to the exciting and diverse career options in quantum biology research and contribute to bioeconomy. Moreover, it will inspire and motivate young scientists to contribute to the advancement of our understanding of how the applications of cutting-edge quantum technologies and sensing techniques to study biological processes in new regimes with sensitivity unachievable by existing methodologies. \r\n\r\nThe GRS will hold a Career Mentorship Panel featuring three leaders from diverse backgrounds to expose trainees to various career options as scientists in quantum biology research. This career panel, a crucial part of the seminar, will play a significant role in helping graduate students and postdoctoral researchers decide between different paths and network with the panelists in the various areas represented in the session. The seminar includes two poster sessions where all attendees can present their work to their peers and the panelists. The seminar is immediately followed by the regular GRC conference and some attendees may stay for the conference to have opportunity to mingle and interact with senior investigators. This meeting was supported by the Molecular Biophysics program in the Division of Molecular and cellular Biosciences.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
