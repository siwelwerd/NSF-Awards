 "awd_abstract_narration": "This I-Corps project is the development of a medical device designed to improve the safety and efficacy of gastrointestinal (GI) surgical procedures. Currently, there is a need to reduce leakage when part of an intestine is surgically removed, and the two remaining ends are sewn or stapled together (anastomosed). Resultant infections may produce complications that may be life-threatening, costly, and detrimental to patient outcomes. The technology is a bioresorbable 3D-printable tube and compressive band combination. The 3D printing allows for a printed, customized surgical solution to accommodate individual anatomical variations. With widespread adoption, this technology has the potential to set a new standard for GI surgical care, improving patient safety and reducing healthcare costs. In addition, this advance may lead to applications that address leakage in other tubular organs and may inspire the development of new bioresorbable medical devices.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of a bioresorbable stent and compressive band combination to improve the safety of gastrointestinal (GI) anastomoses. The goal of the technology is to prevent anastomotic leakage and its resultant infectious complications. The collapsible, low-profile device design allows for introduction and delivery through laparoscopic ports for use in minimally invasive procedures. After implantation, the components are resorbed by the body by which time the risk of leakage has passed, eliminating the need for follow-up procedures to remove the device. The expandable, low-profile design can be used in minimally invasive procedures. Benchtop testing has demonstrated the device\u2019s ability to create anastomoses with minimized leakage risk. This device may address the current limitations of existing methods such as staples and sutures and improve patient GI surgery outcomes.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
