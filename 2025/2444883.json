 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Centers of Research Excellence in Science and Technology (CREST) program, this project aims to expand Morgan State University\u2019s Ph.D. program in Sustainable and Resilient Infrastructure Engineering. This project will advance understanding in climate-resilient engineering while increasing participation of doctoral students in STEM fields. The broader impacts include the development of innovative infrastructure solutions, improved community resilience, and the training of doctoral students as future engineers and scientists to lead advancements in climate change adaptation.\r\n\r\nThe project\u2019s goals are to create a research and educational platform focused on infrastructure resilience by integrating interdisciplinary fields such as engineering, environmental science, geoscience, network modeling, and data analytics. Objectives include enhancing the curriculum with research-informed courses, and engaging communities in resilience-building practices. Research methods will involve state-of-the-art computational modeling, interdisciplinary collaboration, and data analysis to understand and mitigate infrastructure vulnerability. Expected outcomes include interdisciplinary courses in resilience and climate change, increased doctoral student enrollment, and enhanced research partnership. The Centers of Research Excellence in Science and Technology (CREST) program provides support to enhance the research capabilities of institutions through the establishment of centers that effectively integrate education and research.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
