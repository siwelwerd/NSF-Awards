 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of an innovative catalytic membrane technology designed to convert lignocellulosic biomass into valuable chemical intermediates such as levulinic acid. This technology addresses the growing need for sustainable and efficient biofuel production by offering a high-yield, environmentally friendly process. The commercial potential is significant as it provides biofuel producers with a cost-effective solution to enhance production efficiency and sustainability. By improving the conversion process and eliminating the need for harsh chemical pre-treatments, this technology can significantly reduce operational costs and environmental impact, making it an attractive option for biofuel producers aiming to comply with stringent regulations and enhance their sustainability credentials.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. This solution is based on the development of a unique catalytic membrane reactor that employs polymeric solid acid catalysts immobilized on a ceramic membrane substrate. The innovative design involves surface-initiated atom transfer radical polymerization and UV-initiated polymerization to graft poly(styrene sulfonic acid) and poly(ionic) liquid chains onto the membrane surface. This configuration enhances catalytic activity and stability, optimizing the hydrolysis and dehydration processes of biomass into chemical intermediates like levulinic acid. The technology's environmental benefits and operational efficiency demonstrate its potential to revolutionize biofuel production, making it a valuable addition to the renewable energy sector.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
