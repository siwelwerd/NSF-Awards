 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biological invasions threaten stable ecosystems, sustainable agriculture, and food security. Aphids are among the most invasive animal species and the most important agricultural pests. This research project aims to increase our ability to predict and prevent disruptive invasions by analyzing phylogenetic and ecological patterns in the diversity of aphids, their environments, and the drivers of invasiveness in the group. By providing opportunities for student training and international collaboration, it also aims to develop the scientific literacy and human capital needed to address the challenges of biological invasions.\r\n\r\nThe specific goals of this project are to (i) estimate phylogenetic relationships among aphid lineages, (ii) use comparative phylogenetic analyses to shed light on the drivers of biological invasion, and (iii) extend the reach of practical biodiversity science. For the first goal, researchers will obtain and analyze target-enriched genomic data sampled from approximately 700 aphid species. These data will be used to advance the phylogenetic systematics of aphids. For the second goal, researchers will use phylogenetic path model analyses to test integrative hypotheses about the causal relationships between variation in aphid invasiveness, niche identity, niche breadth, reproductive output, dispersiveness, and the ecological similarity between source and recipient areas. For the third goal, researchers across the US, Canada and France will collaborate to train undergraduate and graduate students, and outreach in Alabama about regional insect ecology and invasion biology. Beyond these goals, this project will develop biodiversity data infrastructure in ways that will facilitate other lines of basic and applied comparative research, for example, research addressing general questions about the evolution of geographic ranges, and the responses of natural populations to climate change.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
