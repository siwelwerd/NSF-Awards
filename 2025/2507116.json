 "awd_abstract_narration": "This I-Corps project is based on the development of a technology to recycle wind turbine blades into reinforced construction materials. The technology leverages advanced fiber-spinning techniques to process turbine blade waste into layered fibers with optimized mechanical and chemical properties. Unlike conventional recycling methods that degrade material quality, this technology preserves and enhances the fibers' structural integrity, making them suitable for high-performance applications in construction. The technology may provide an effective solution to waste management while enhancing the mechanical properties of construction composites to meet industry standards for strength, fire resistance, and sustainability. The aim of the lab to market translation is to integrate wind turbine fibers into commercial building materials such as concrete.  This technology may be a scalable and cost-effective solution for wind turbine blade recycling.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of a fiber-spinning process that transforms decommissioned wind turbine blades into high-performance reinforcement fibers for sustainable construction materials. The increasing number of retired wind turbine blades presents a growing environmental challenge, as current disposal methods, such as landfilling and incineration, are costly and unsustainable. This technology seeks to address this issue by converting turbine blade waste, particularly glass-fiber-reinforced polymer composites, into valuable fibers that enhance the mechanical strength, thermal resistance, and durability of building materials. The technology uses advanced fiber spinning techniques to recycle wind turbine blade waste into coaxial layered fibers with enhanced mechanical and functional properties, intended for high-performance, sustainable applications in construction and energy management. Multilayered fibers are developed with a three-phase spinneret, which then may be integrated into biomass (e.g., hemp) concrete, enhancing durability, thermal resistance, fire retardance, and soundproofing. By incorporating these recycled fibers, the technology may reduce landfill waste and promote energy-efficient construction.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
