 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support student travel to the 46th edition of the IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (IEEE S&P) this conference, to be held in May 2025.  IEEE S&P is recognized as a premier platform for showcasing advancements in computer security and electronic privacy across a wide range of related topics and disciplines.  Participation in premier venues is critical to the success of student researchers. Attendees will have the opportunity to showcase their research, receive invaluable feedback, attend high-quality talks, and interact with top researchers across the field of security and privacy. This will provide both intellectual and professional resources to advance the quality of their ongoing work and careers as security and privacy researchers.\r\n\r\nThis grant will provide travel support to about 15 students who otherwise have limited travel funding and so might not be able to attend.  The committee will widely advertise the availability of travel funding to solicit applications from students of a range of institutional, disciplinary, topical, and personal backgrounds.  Criteria for selection include evidence of a serious interest in the field as demonstrated by coursework and/or project experience and financial need.  The committee will also limit the amount of funding given to students from any particular advisor or institution in order to expand the set of students and institutions attending the conference.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
