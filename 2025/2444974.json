 "awd_abstract_narration": "This doctoral dissertation research improvement award supports research on how scientists structure and share genomic data, especially across disciplinary boundaries. The goal of this study is to identify the anticipated and unanticipated effects of genetic data practices to help scientists, decision-makers, and funders to better understand practices and structures of sharing genomic data. The findings of this research may contribute to data sharing practices, managing and controlling the downstream use of genetic data, as well as to improving data management and privacy. \r\n\r\nThis study will trace the origins and circulation of specific data, data structures, and data-sharing practices in genomics, as well as the adaptation and consequences of those practices in social science genomics. The use of mixed methods will permit an understanding of the social and historical context of data sharing through the review of scientific and popular literature; semi-structured interviews; and participant observation. It will focus on online databases collecting genetic data, consortia for meta-analyzing these data, and cloud-based platforms for managing data analysis. The intellectual merit of the project will focus on the active role that data and data practices play in the negotiation of genomic objects, frameworks, and practices through data management.  The study will contribute to the literature on studies of scientific field dynamics and critical studies of data centric science.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
