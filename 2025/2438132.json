 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will build networks within Guam\u2019s research ecosystem to promote and support the development of competitive scientific research. The project is led by the University of Guam in collaboration with Guam Community College. The project will manage and coordinate research ecosystem growth to support improvements to jurisdictional research infrastructure. Additionally, it will provide college students with research experiences in STEM fields. This will lead to supporting the training of a workforce ready to engage with emerging economic opportunities driven by scientific research and development. Student research experiences will employ a near-peer mentoring model that will provide mentorship uniting science, culture, and identity to serve Guam\u2019s largely underrepresented STEM student population. This approach will serve the needs of a diverse student population and broaden participation in STEM fields. The project will also partner with Guam\u2019s Science and Technology Steering Committee and other stakeholders to assess the current state of the jurisdictional research enterprise.  Through organization of workshops and strategic planning activities with Guam\u2019s stakeholder community, the project aims to identify areas and opportunities for growth, foster and strengthen partnerships, and promote efforts to secure external funding to strengthen Guam\u2019s capacity for scientific research. The project will provide project development, along with management and administrative support for these efforts to grow and strengthen Guam\u2019s research ecosystem. \t\r\n\r\nThe Optimizing Research Infrastructure in Guam (ORIG) project will increase collaboration between Guam institutions and individual researchers by strengthening and expanding Guam\u2019s research ecosystem, supporting jurisdictional priorities aimed at economic diversification through STEM research and training. The project is well aligned with Guam\u2019s Science and Technology Plan and will advance scientific knowledge by expanding an emerging research ecosystem for a remote Pacific Island jurisdiction with just two institutions of higher learning and limited access to private sector partners and industries. This will be accomplished through the coordination of research activities and the provision of administrative, management, and project development practices that promote research ecosystem growth. Additionally, the project will support the development of Guam's research infrastructure, including facilities, and student opportunities that integrate technical training and a mentorship program tailored toward Guam\u2019s underrepresented student population. In partnership with the Guam Science and Technology Steering Committee and other stakeholders, the project will assess the state of Guam\u2019s current research enterprise and identify areas and opportunities for growth. The creation of partnerships and the promotion of collaborative efforts to secure and manage research funding from NSF and other sources will be key in strengthening Guam\u2019s scientific research and development capacity. This project is supported by the EPSCoR Research Infrastructure Improvement (RII) Program: EPSCoR Collaborations for Optimizing Research Ecosystems (E-CORE). E-CORE supports jurisdictions in strengthening their jurisdiction-wide research ecosystems by fostering interconnected networks, building research infrastructure, and growing research capacity and competitiveness aligned with jurisdictional priorities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
