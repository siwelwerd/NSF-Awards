 "awd_abstract_narration": "Plants rely on their ability to sense the environment and respond to biotic and abiotic stresses.  A large number of receptors located on the plasma membrane of the plant cell sense these stresses.  The goal of this project is to characterize the components and functions of structures called nanodomains located on the membrane of each plant cell.  Nanodomains are specialized regions of the membrane that are highly enriched in saturated lipids and nanodomain-specific proteins.  This project will explore how nanodomains change during plant responses to pathogen infections, using the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana and the economically important crop potato.  The broader impact of this project will support the development of a Course-based Undergraduate Research Experience (CURE) that will engage undergraduate students in original research.  In addition, the investigator will provide a trainer workshop to engage K-12 teachers in Mobile County, AL through a strategic partnership with the USA Department of Leadership and Teacher Education.  The integrated scientific and broader impact goals will bring a unique experience both to students participating in the CURE and to Education students/future K-12 teachers.  This project will enhance the recruitment, retention, and professional development of educators and students not only at the University of South Alabama but also in regional public-school systems.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to characterize the lipid and protein constituents of the plasma membrane nanodomains in Arabidopsis thaliana and their contributions to plant immunity.  Plant cell plasma membrane is a complex organelle partitioned into heterogenous fractions, allowing for recruitment of specific proteins.  Membrane nanodomains are specialized regions of the plasma membrane that are enriched in ordered lipids (sterols, saturated phospholipids, ceramides, etc.) and they may contribute to responses to biotic interactions in many plant species.  The project will explore the functions of a group of highly conserved nanodomain-occupying proteins called Remorins.  The researchers will use a combination of proteomic, lipidomic, and biochemical approaches to identify shifts in membrane nanodomain components and dynamics upon the activation of plant innate immunity, and how these changes are driven by Remorin family proteins in both Arabidopsis thaliana and potato.  This study will advance fundamental knowledge of membrane nano-scale structure and dynamics, and their contributions to plant disease resistance.\r\n\r\nThis project is jointly funded by the Biological Sciences Directorate and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
