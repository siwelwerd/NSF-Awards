 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the renewal and continuation of the Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site in Physics at the University of Rochester. The site supports ten undergraduate students per year for ten weeks of summer research in the general areas of physics, astrophysics, and optics with direct research in the sub-fields of nuclear and particle physics, quantum optics and quantum information, condensed matter and nanoscience, astrophysics and cosmology, and plasma physics. Individual guidance and mentoring fostered within the faculty's research groups provides each participating student with the skills to navigate the world of science such as giving scientific talks or writing articles that will lead to the participants\u2019 intellectual development as an independent researcher.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe objective of the REU is to offer undergraduate students throughout the nation the opportunity to take part in physics research over a range of topics. Each student works with a faculty adviser on a specific project within the context of the overall research focus of the group. REU students attend weekly presentations by University faculty, tours of University research facilities, and social outings and may also take part in the Department's summer outreach activities. The REU students regularly interact with all REU programs on campus through activities coordinated by the University's David T. Kearns Center. The program concludes with two student symposia (at the Department and University levels), at which each student presents their research; students submit written abstracts and reports of their research experiences. Students are encouraged to continue their projects toward publication and are eligible for additional support to present their results at national student and professional conferences. This site is supported by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
