 "awd_abstract_narration": "This doctoral dissertation project examines the extent to which flooding can result in increased disease risks for human populations, particularly when parasitic diseases are transmitted via organisms that live in bodies of water near human communities. This multifaceted project examines the ways that the distributions of parasites and their hosts align with the geographical distribution of extreme hydrological events. Concurrently, the researchers examine heterogeneity in human communities that may be associated with the risk of parasitic infections during floods. By combining these data sources, the researchers advance a general conceptual model for the transmission of parasitic infections. Key findings are shared with local community partners, and the project contributes to the education and training of an early-career scientist.\r\n\r\nThis project considers human variability to parasitic infections in response to both environmental factors, especially hydrological events, and variation in human populations. Adopting a biogeographical approach, the researchers examine the distribution of vector species over time while concurrently leveraging machine learning methods to identify the considerations that underlie vulnerability. As a complement to the quantitative modeling, the researchers employ focus groups to substantiate the mechanisms that underlie disease transmission and potential remedies. The project contributes to scholarship in geography, water resource engineering, and public health.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
