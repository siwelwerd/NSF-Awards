 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides partial support for the seventh International Conference on \"The Effects of Noise on Aquatic Life\" to be held in Prague, Czech Republic, from June 29 to July 4, 2025. This conference builds on the success of previous meetings held in Nyborg, Denmark (2007), Cork, Ireland (2010), Budapest, Hungary (2013), Dublin, Ireland (2016), The Hague, Netherlands (2019), and Berlin, Germany (2022). The major goal of this conference is to advance the understanding of underwater noise impacts on aquatic life, with a particular focus on progress achieved since the last meeting in 2022. Support is requested primarily seeking funding primarily to support the participation of students, postdoctoral researchers, and representatives from developing nations, enabling them to attend and contribute to the meeting.\r\n\r\nThe meeting should help shape future research and understanding of effects of noise on aquatic life. Based on experience from the earlier meetings, the interactions and networking that took place has resulted in new collaborations between investigators and industry.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
