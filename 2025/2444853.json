 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support the participation of junior US-based researchers in the thematic program entitled 'Mathematical Foundations of Data Science' that will take place at the Centre de Recherches Math\u00e9matiques (CRM) in Montr\u00e9al, QC, Canada during May\u2013June 2025. This thematic program will address mathematical challenges and opportunities connected with the rise of big data, which has opened up new possibilities for extracting knowledge and insight from complex, noisy, and unstructured data. These possibilities also come with new challenges, such as the curse of dimensionality, which have provoked changes, revived traditional ideas and inspired new approaches in many areas of mathematics. This workshop will address new developments that are taking place at the interface of optimization, probability theory, numerical analysis, approximation theory and their interplay with machine learning and statistical learning. \r\n\r\nThe scientific program will include five workshops on Combinatorial Optimization and Data Science, Optimization and Learning: Theory and Applications, Approximation and Learning in High Dimensions, High Dimensional Probability and Applications to Statistics and Machine Learning, and Accuracy and Efficiency in Scientific Machine Learning. The program will also include a spring school entitled Mathematical Foundations of Data Science as well as will host several long-term visitors from around the world.  This award will provide travel funding to support 48 junior US-based researchers (graduate students and postdocs) from US institutions to allow them to participate and learn from the program\u2019s activities at minimal or no cost.  The resulting interactions are expected to enhance the scientific workforce in the US by providing them with new technical tools, theory, and research directions from leading international experts. More information can be found on thematic program website https://www.crmath.ca/en/activities/#/type/activity/id/3950.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
