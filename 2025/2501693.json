 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funding for U.S. researchers to attend two summer schools and two workshops during the special semester \"Analysis and Geometry on Complex Manifolds\" in Budapest, Hungary, scheduled for August-September 2025. Hosted by the Alfr\u00e9d R\u00e9nyi Institute of Mathematics, these events aim to connect renowned experts with junior researchers, providing an introduction to current topics in the field, sharing recent advancements, and encouraging collaborative research. Funding priority is given to U.S. based participants without alternative sources of support, with a special emphasis on applications from early-career mathematicians and members of underrepresented groups in the discipline.\r\n \r\nThe first summer school will cover introductory topics in K\u00e4hler geometry, while the second will focus on non-K\u00e4hlerian aspects. The workshops will address both classical K\u00e4hlerian and non-K\u00e4hlerian topics as well. On the K\u00e4hlerian side, discussions will explore non-Archimedean aspects of the SYZ conjecture, pluripotential-theoretic approaches to singular K\u00e4hler-Einstein metrics, and Calabi-Yau metrics on non-compact manifolds. In the non-K\u00e4hlerian realm, topics will include cohomological properties of complex and symplectic manifolds, analytic techniques in non-K\u00e4hler geometry, almost-complex and symplectic structures, deformations of complex objects, topological aspects of complex and symplectic manifolds, and Hodge theory on almost-Hermitian manifolds. Further details can be found on the special semester\u2019s website: https://erdoscenter.renyi.hu/articles/complex-manifolds.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
