 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Improving Undergraduate STEM Education: Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSI Program), this Educational Instrumentation (EI) track aims to engage students in course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs) in a lab-led freshman physics course (PHYS 2425) along with eight other courses. This approach will provide students with valuable opportunities to conduct various hypothesis-driven research projects related to fatigue loading using the ElectroForce (EF) 3330 equipment and an in-house developed innovative fixture called the Stress Block (SB). Economic shifts, societal changes, alternative career paths, and the lingering effects of COVID-19 have all impacted undergraduate enrollment. With a strong job market for non-degree roles, more high school graduates are considering direct entry into the workforce. However, in today\u2019s competitive job market, the value of higher education remains critical, offering specialized skills and advantages that can elevate quality of life. For many physics and mechanical engineering undergraduates, insufficient high school preparation can create obstacles in problem-solving and understanding complex measurements, often hindering success in rigorous university programs. CUREs will provide essential support by allowing students to apply theoretical concepts to real-world scenarios, reinforcing understanding through hands-on learning. This experience will also enable students to build a supportive network with faculty and peers, contributing to their professional growth. Through active participation, CUREs will foster a sense of ownership and deeper engagement with learning. The SBICS-CUREs project, utilizing ElectroForce (EF) 3330 and Digital Image Correlation (DIC) technology, is designed to enhance these experiences while also contributing to reducing the gender gap in STEM fields.\r\n\r\nThe hypothesis for this project proposes that integrating the ElectroForce (EF) 3330 equipment with a custom-designed Stress Block (SB) fixture in a freshman physics course will significantly enhance students\u2019 understanding and application of hypothesis-driven research. The specific aims are to (1) connect the SB attachment to the ElectroForce (EF) 3330 and (2) apply DIC techniques on samples tested with this setup. The methodology includes six steps: 3D printing samples, speckle deposition for image correlation, setting up a GoPro for reference images, mounting the SB fixture on the ElectroForce (EF) 3330, applying sinusoidal loads, and conducting DIC analysis to assess deformation and strain. This process gives students hands-on testing and simulation experience, bridging theoretical knowledge with real-world applications. Reflective learning is central to this project, utilizing DIC software like Ncorr, a free tool for full-field, non-contact optical measurements of deformation and strain in mechanical components. Findings will be shared through conferences, peer-reviewed publications, and YouTube videos, with plans to connect with industry leaders like Boeing, KBR, and agencies such as NASA and National Science Foundation. Additionally, partnerships with local Independent School Districts (ISDs) will enable high school students to participate, building a recruitment pipeline for UHCL STEM programs. The HSI Program aims to enhance undergraduate STEM education and build capacity at HSIs. Projects supported by the HSI Program will also generate new knowledge on how to achieve these aims.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
