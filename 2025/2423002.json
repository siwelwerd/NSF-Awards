 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader/commercial impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to enhance the efficiency and safety of human-robot collaboration through the development of an innovative 3D safety sensor system. As labor shortages stress supply chains, companies are rapidly adopting robotic solutions to ease the pressure. Manufacturers are recognizing the efficiency benefits of flexible and collaborative robots, moving away from large, application-specific robots that require fixed safety fences. Unlike large industrial robots, collaborative robots can function safely without physical barriers, facilitating easy reconfiguration and adaptation to new tasks. However, the safety limitations of these small co-bots result in systems that are much slower and weaker than industrial robots. The 3D safety sensor system developed in this project will bridge the gap between small, flexible co-bots and powerful industrial robots by eliminating the need for safety fences around large industrial robots and enabling collaborative applications. This technological advancement promises to revolutionize manufacturing, improve productivity, and create safer working environments while shifting human workers to higher-skill positions. The innovation will provide new insights into sensor technology, human-robot interaction, and adaptive safety systems, paving the way for further advancements in robotics and automation.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project addresses the limitations of current 3D sensors in robotics safety applications. Existing 3D sensors like LIDAR or depth cameras lack the reliability, resolution, or cost-effectiveness required for industrial safety. Consequently, industrial robot safety relies on outdated 2D sensor technology, which only captures a slice of the environment and cannot provide 3D protection. This limitation necessitates larger safety boundaries and increases robot cell sizes, making most collaborative applications impractical for the space required. This Phase II research aims to advance an adaptive 3D sensor based on a cost-effective, high-resolution sensing technology, known as programmable 3D light curtains. Unlike traditional sensors that capture and process entire 3D volumes, these sensors optically capture specific 3D surfaces within a volume, focusing on user-programmed boundaries to provide high-resolution data where it is needed with minimal processing time and improved detection reliability. This project will de-risk commercial viability, improving the versatility and reliability of the system. Key objectives include developing a dynamic imaging system for overhead monitoring, creating an eye-safe illumination system with a wide field-of-view, and developing a safety controller for reliable operations. Achieving these goals will produce a versatile 3D safety sensor ready for certification.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
