 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project by Boise State University is providing campus computing cyberinfrastructure that includes six nodes with four NVIDIA L40S GPUs each. The project updates infrastructure that supports data science, machine learning, and AI. Using the new infrastructure, Boise State researchers use AI tools and participate in a community of practice abround AI. Students learn how to use the tools through course projects in data science, natural language processing, and AI classes. The project enables students to be more prepared for an AI-driven world and improve the research capabilities at Boise State University. \r\n\r\nThis cyberinfrastructure is integrated with the existing Boise State research computing cluster and supports science drivers in the areas of large language model (LLM) fundamental research, simulation of energy-efficient hardware, modeling of weather, oceans, and materials, and AI in business education.  The project is advancing AI education through initiatives such as data science education and use of generative AI tools for instructional purposes. Boise State is extending access to its AI optimized cyberinfrastructure to institutions throughout the state by participation in the C3+3 consortium (which includes Idaho National Laboratory and the three research universities in Idaho) and to other partners within Idaho and nationally through the Open Science Grid Consortium (OSG).\r\n\r\nThis project is jointly funded by the Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
