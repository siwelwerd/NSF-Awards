 "awd_abstract_narration": "The \"Regional Applied Interdisciplinary Numerical (Cascade RAIN) in the Cascade Mountains area\" conference will convene on the Oregon State campus on April 26, 2025. The conference will bring together faculty and students from across the Pacific Northwest to facilitate the exchange of scientific advancements in the area of computational mathematics and interdisciplinary applications. Presentations are expected to cover almost all topics within computational mathematics including state-of-the-art methods for numerical partial differential equations and foundational mathematics of machine learning and artificial intelligence. Through the use of travel support, the conference will seek to broaden the participation across this geographic area and reach the broadest possible cohort including graduate students and junior faculty in the region. The conference will also feature mini-tutorials on basic and advanced computational mathematics and the mathematics of data science as a means of engaging both less prepared and more senior participants in research in computational mathematics. Furthermore, this conference will seek to foster future collaborative efforts between participants at all career stages.  \r\n\r\nThis conference will provide support for the participants of the conference and aims to bring together researchers across many career stages including senior, junior faculty and other researchers as well as students involved in computational mathematics across its different aspects including numerical analysis and interdisciplinary work. The participants will gain new insights and perspectives in computational mathematics and various application domains from researchers in local universities. The specific minitutorials include hands-on training of advanced finite-difference and finite-volume methods for initial boundary value problems as well as unsupervised and supervised learning methods. The website of the conference is https://sites.google.com/oregonstate.edu/rain2025\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
