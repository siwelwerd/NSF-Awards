 "awd_abstract_narration": "This CAREER project seeks to provide a comprehensive understanding of the sources, spatial concentrations, chemical processes, and climate impacts of micro- and nano- plastic particles in the atmosphere. Atmospheric micro- and nano- plastic particles contribute significantly to the mass of marine and land micro- and nano- plastic particles, and their concentrations are expected to increase ten-fold over the next decade. Their presence has significant environmental implications, but their atmospheric behavior and impacts remain poorly understood. The research will combine laboratory studies with mobile field measurements in the Houston Texas region to gain a holistic understanding of micro- and nano- plastic particles in the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nThis research on micro- and nano- plastic particles (MNPPs) has three objectives: (1) the real-time and offline quantification of major atmospheric MNPPs to comprehensively examine their atmospheric concentrations, spatial distribution, and sources; (2) the characterization of atmospheric reaction kinetics, chemical reactivity, and decomposition products of MNPPs through laboratory oxidation studies; and (3) the investigation of the potential climate impacts of MNPPs by assessing their optical properties and cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) activities during their atmospheric lifecycle. \r\n\r\nThis research includes the development of an interactive exhibition at the Brazos Valley Museum of Natural History to inform the local community about air pollution and atmospheric science, and the design of an interdisciplinary chemistry lesson module for a local high school. Both graduate and undergraduate students will participate in the research over the course of the project.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
