 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to broaden graduate student participation at the International Conference on Parallel Processing (ICPP 2024) conference (to be held in Gotland, Sweden, from August 12th to 15th, 2024 ) by providing travel awards to help pay for travel to and from the conference venue, lodging, and conference registration fees. Funding of this proposal will not only enhance scientific discovery in areas of parallel processing, but also broaden the impact of the parallel processing field by increasing graduate student participation. ICPP has a history of attracting high quality submissions from researchers around the world. Travel awards will provide graduate students the opportunity to engage with leading experts in parallel computing by presenting their results at the conference proceedings, workshop proceedings and poster sessions. In addition, attendance will create opportunities to network with their peers and solicit feedback from senior members of the research community. This networking may lead to future research collaborations and career advancement opportunities.\r\n\r\nThe International Conference on Parallel Processing (ICPP) is one of the oldest continuously running computer science conferences in parallel computing in the world. ICPP 2024 will be the 53rd year of this conference series and will be soliciting refereed conference papers, posters, and workshops along six tracks, including, Algorithms, Applications, Architecture, Multidisciplinary, Performance and Software. This travel award will prioritize graduate students who are coauthors of an accepted paper or poster, who are members of underrepresented groups, and who do not have alternative funding sources to attend ICPP 2023. We will use travel award application materials to gauge relevance of current and future research work to the conference topics, importance of attending the conference, and career plans related to parallel processing. Each travel award application will be reviewed by a selection committee of at least three members. This selection committee will be led by the ICPP 2024 Poster and Student Program Chairs and will include additional members invited from the ICPP 2023 organizing and program committees and senior members of the parallel processing community. To further broaden participation at the conference, we will engage with societies and institutes which serve and support students from underrepresented groups.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
