 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader/commercial impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be a major contribution to both the scientific understanding and the technological advance of desktop inverted vat photopolymerization 3D printing. First, the theoretical analysis of the peel process will enhance scientific understanding. Second, the experimental validation will demonstrate industry readiness of the technology. These advances will inspire other innovations in healthcare and 3D printing. High throughput 3D printing will enable trauma surgeons to benefit from 3D printed anatomic models in their planning whereas current technologies are unable to address urgent surgeries due to slow throughput. The project aims to improve the surgical outcomes of 2.5 million patients who undergo urgent procedures in the US every year. The proposed lift-based peel separation technology will provide 6X the throughput of commercial 3D printing and provide a durable competitive advantage. The business model includes the sale of the 3D printer, consumables, spare parts, and service contracts to hospitals, medical device companies, and industry. The patent-pending lift-based peel separation innovation will be at the core of commercial success. The first target customers are trauma and urgent care hospitals across the US. \r\n\r\nCurrent desktop inverted vat photopolymerization 3D printing suffers low throughput, which prevents its adoption in planning urgent surgeries. The four project objectives are centered around the development of the core technology, the Lift-Based Peel Separation system, which aims to print 6X faster than the standard. First, application of fracture mechanics and control theory to a theoretical analysis of the peel process will provide foundational understanding. Second, incorporation of force feedback and peel detection into the peel control model, together with a firmware implementation, will bring the theoretical understanding into the real world. Third, experimentation will fine-tune and validate compatibility with medical-grade resin and membrane materials. Lastly, assessment of print quality via 3D surface scanning, caliper measurements, and optical microscopy will ensure dimensional accuracy within 1 mm and satisfactory surface quality for clinical application. It is anticipated that 6X throughput will be achieved as evidenced by print times for 10 anatomic models printed using the proposed technology. Further, it is anticipated that model accuracy will be within 0.5 mm for successful application to diagnostic use. Ultimately, it is expected that the technology will be versatile as demonstrated by its compatibility with many membrane and resin materials.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
