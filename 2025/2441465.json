 "awd_abstract_narration": "The groundbreaking discovery of gravitational waves by NSF\u2019s Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) provided a first glimpse of the profound potential that the rapidly growing field of gravitational wave astrophysics holds for the rest of the century. In 2023, the LIGO observatories reached their design sensitivities, able to detect binary neutron stars 500 million light years away. Unprecedented advances in Quantum-Enhanced Metrology over the last 2 decades have made this increased sensitivity possible. This award will establish a Quantum-Enhanced Metrology testbed at Syracuse University to test novel techniques and materials that will further advance the quantum improvement of gravitational wave detectors. In parallel, this award will inspire the next generation of scientists and non-scientists through various outreach projects and education opportunities related to the quantum world.\r\n\r\nThe primary objective of this award is developing the technology needed to achieve 10 dB effective squeezing improvement to gravitational-wave interferometers. The goal of the LIGO observatories is 10 dB of effective squeezing, which currently operates 5-6 dB below the shot noise limit and a benchmark number for the next-generation observatory Cosmic Explorer. High levels of squeezing improvement are required for future detectors to reach their design sensitivities and to enable their science goals. The first stage of this award includes constructing a squeezed light source at Syracuse University. We will then use this testbed to investigate the integration issues of quantum-enhanced interferometers by coupling this squeezed vacuum state to a coupled arm cavity and signal-extraction cavity. This quantum optics and gravitational wave-focused research is associated with an education plan to excite and inform high school teachers, students, and the public about gravitational waves, quantum light, and experimental physics.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
