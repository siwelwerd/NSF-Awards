 "awd_abstract_narration": "To support participation in the Mathematical Congress of the Americas (MCA), to be held July 21-25, 2025 in Miami, Florida, the American Mathematical Society (AMS) will administer a travel grant program for mathematicians based in the United States, that is  those who are students or faculty in U.S institutions or employees of U.S. organizations or companies. The Society will draw a robust applicant pool by utilizing its infrastructure of communications and its connectivity in the mathematical community. In the selection process, AMS expects to give priority to students and early-career applicants. MCA is a quadrennial gathering, initiated in 2013, with the goal \"to internationally highlight the excellence of mathematical achievements in the Americas and foster collaborations among researchers, students, institutions, and mathematical societies in the Americas.\" The conference is administered by the Mathematical Council of the Americas, a network of over twenty societies, institutes, and agencies throughout North America, South America, Central America, and the Caribbean nations. This third Congress will draw top-tier mathematicians from around the Western Hemisphere and the rest of the world. It will provide an excellent opportunity for exchange of ideas in a broad array of mathematical areas and for the U.S. to be well represented in the international arena. The U.S. sustains its highly-regarded research endeavor, in part, by fostering the participation of its citizens in international conferences. MCA presents an excellent opportunity for such participation, both by established researchers as well as those who will become the research leaders of the future. Those traveling to Florida will be able to share in person the results of their research and garner new ideas from their counterparts from across the Americas, thereby enriching the hemispheric and worldwide endeavor of mathematical discovery.\r\n\r\nThe organizers of MCA 2025 anticipate approximately one thousand attendees from around the Western Hemisphere and the rest of the world. The five plenary speakers are Alexei Borodin of MIT, June Huh of Princeton University, Jorge Vitorio Pereira of IMPA, Melanie Matchett Wood of Harvard University, and Maciej Zworski of the University of California, Berkeley. Twenty Invited Speakers represent such topical areas as algebraic geometry, analysis, probability, ergodic theory, differential geometry, partial differential equations, relativity and gravitation, numerical analysis, graph theory and combinatorics, applied computational analysis, complex analytic geometry, dynamical systems, Riemann manifolds, algebraic topology, geometry, stochastic calculus, fractal geometry, number theory, model theory, statistical mechanics, and neuroscience. The conference will include a wide array of special session topics, and it is anticipated that the schedule will include multiple panel and poster sessions as well as social and cultural events. The MCA is also the occasion for awarding the MCA Prize, the Americas Prize, and the Solomon Lefschetz Medals. The Congress presents a splendid opportunity for early-career mathematicians to share their knowledge, garner new ideas, and interact with counterparts and luminaries on the international stage. Current information about MCA 2025 is at www.mca2025.org, and the AMS travel grant program is detailed at \r\nhttps://www.ams.org/programs/travel-grants/mca.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
