 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides student travel and subsistence for the 2025 International Programming Language Implementation Summer School (PLISS) to be held May 26 -- May 31, 2025, in Bertinoro, Italy. This summer school provides an important and valuable educational opportunity for students to study topics related to designs and implementations of programming languages. The award's broader significance and importance include building international community and enhancing education of US students, including students from historically underrepresented groups. The school also provides students exposure to and multiple opportunities to interact with leading-edge research and researchers. By supporting US-based students, the school thus imparts training to the next generation of researchers in design and implementation of programming languages in both industry and academia, as well as to future application developers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
