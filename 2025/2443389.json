 "awd_abstract_narration": "Red Supergiants (RSGs) are a late stage in the life cycle of stars of 9 \u2013 25 solar\r\nmasses. During the RSG stage, these stars experience significant mass-loss, and\r\nthis lost mass enriches the interstellar medium, playing a significant role in the chemical\r\nevolution of the Universe. This project will use high resolution imaging\r\nfrom optical interferometry (OI) to study RSGs. High resolution imaging of stellar\r\nsurfaces produced via OI enables the study of changes on stellar surfaces at\r\nunprecedented detail. Results from this project will help determine the role\r\nof convection in driving mass-loss in RSGs. This research will be conducted at New\r\nMexico Tech, a Hispanic serving institution. Two PhD and four undergraduate students\r\nwill be supported (per year) by this project to collect observations, participate in data\r\nreduction, and contribute to model development. Outreach initiatives will involve public\r\ntalks, volunteering at state-level science competitions, and collaboration with StarDate\r\nto produce radio shows that communicate the excitement and results of the research.\r\n\r\nHigh resolution imaging of stellar surfaces produced via optical interferometry (OI)\r\nenables the study of changes on stellar surfaces at unprecedented detail. This project\r\nwill use the Center for High Angular Resolution Astronomy (CHARA) Array and\r\nMagdalena Ridge Observatory Interferometer (MROI) to collect OI data for image\r\nreconstruction of RSGs at different stages of evolution. Stars of angular diameter\r\ngreater than 4 mas will be used to study both large convection features and\r\nsmaller granulation-like features. By comparing images reconstructed from data\r\ncovering continuum wavelengths to those covering molecular bands, it is possible to\r\nstudy the link between surface activity and the formation of molecules further up in the\r\nstellar atmosphere. The project will also develop new image reconstruction tools to\r\nmaximize the scientific output of the data. Techniques and models developed in this\r\nprogram will benefit other users of optical interferometers, and all software will be\r\nmade publicly accessible. The model refinements will have an impact on other\r\naspects of astrophysics, such as the study of stellar evolution in other galaxies.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
