 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact of this I-Corps project is the development of a cost-effective and environmentally friendly alternative to conventional filters. This innovation addresses critical challenges in liquid separation processes. The use of naturally derived hydrophobic agents and energy-efficient production methods aligns with growing sustainability demands, potentially reducing environmental footprints in various sectors. Commercially, these membranes could be used in oil recovery, dairy processing, wastewater treatment, and beyond. The ability of the filters to selectively separate oil or water opens new possibilities for resource recovery and product purification. The adaptability of the membranes to external stimuli enhances their market appeal. Industries could benefit from reduced operational costs and improved efficiency. The adoption of these membranes could lead to more sustainable industrial processes, contributing to conservation efforts and reducing reliance on harmful chemicals.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. This solution is based on the development of super hydrophobic membranes for efficient oil-water separation. This technology involves a surface modification process using nanoparticles on various substrates such as polymers, cellulose, and metals. This method allows precise control over nanoparticle size, shape, and distribution, resulting in highly uniform, durable, and water-repellent surfaces. Compared to traditional methods like spray coating or chemical vapor deposition, this approach offers superior adhesion and longevity due to strong chemical bonding between the nanoparticles and the substrate. The filtering technology has shown a separation efficiency of 96% and a throughput of 348 liters per square meter per hour. These filters also demonstrated an absorption capacity of 526% of their weight.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
