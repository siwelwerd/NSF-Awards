 "awd_abstract_narration": "The IEEE International Conference on Computer Communications (INFOCOM) is a premier international conference, held annually, covering a wide spectrum of theoretical and applied research in the networking field. The 2025 IEEE INFOCOM will take place in London, United Kingdom, between 19 May 2025 and 22 May 2025. This project supports students from US universities to attend 2025 IEEE INFOCOM in person. Students will have the opportunity to present their work and be exposed to the state-of-the-art developments in the field. They will also have the opportunity to interact with peers from institutions worldwide, meet with senior researchers, and participate in discussions that are likely to shape the future of the field. \r\n\r\nThe requested support will cover 20 students in the United States to attend 2025 IEEE INFOCOM. This grant will target graduate students who will substantially benefit from attending this conference but have limited travel funds. Priority will be given to first time attendees, especially those without papers. Selected students will be supported by this grant to attend the 2024 IEEE INFOCOM in person.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
