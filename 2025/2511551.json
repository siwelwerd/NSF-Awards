 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Logic Mentoring Workshop (LMW) is a series of workshops that offer guidance and perspective to students aiming for an academic career in theoretical computer science, focusing on logic. LMW is co-located every year with the conferences Computer Science Logic (CSL) and Logic in Computer Science (LICS). This project offers financial support to students that would otherwise not be able to attend this workshop or the main conference. This project's impact is that the audience of the workshop and the main conference reflects a more diverse and inclusive student body, both in terms of socioeconomic background and personal characteristics. \r\n\r\nIn 2025, LMW at CSL will take place in Amsterdam, Netherlands in February, while LMW at LICS will be in Singapore in June. The project is implemented by adding a funding survey to the workshops' call for participation. Candidate selection, based on needs, is done by the workshop organizers. The home institution of the investigator coordinates reimbursements to students.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
