 "awd_abstract_narration": "Within the cellular environment proteins and polysaccharides (complex sugars) interact with each other in very crowded environments and sometimes form a separate liquid phase.  The goal of this project is to understand the mechanism of those interactions and their biological consequences in plants.  The work could have implications for our understanding of that could include cell wall expansion, pollen formation and plant survival under stress. By uncovering the molecular mechanisms of protein-polysaccharide interactions and their phase separation, the findings will inform strategies to improve crop resilience, addressing challenges in agriculture and contributing to food security. In addition to its scientific contributions, this project will inspire the next generation of scientists by providing students with hands-on training in advanced scattering techniques, fostering interdisciplinary collaboration, and promoting inclusive STEM education. By integrating cutting-edge research with educational initiatives, the project aims to enhance workforce development and expand the adoption of advanced biophysical methods in both academia and industry, ensuring broader societal impacts.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis project will systematically investigate the phase behavior of proteins and polysaccharides in crowded environments that mimic the biological settings where these interactions predominantly occur. The research focuses on understanding how crowding impacts the interactions, dynamics, and conformational behavior of these biomacromolecules. Using small-angle X-ray and neutron scattering (SAXS/SANS), combined with complementary techniques such as calorimetry, fluorescence imaging, and electron microscopy, this project will characterize molecular-level interactions and identify the mechanisms driving phase separation. The project will simulate crowded environments using macromolecular crowding agents with diverse physical and chemical properties to explore how these agents influence both segregative and associative phase separation. By examining the structural and dynamic properties of protein-polysaccharide complexes, the study aims to uncover the fundamental principles governing phase behavior and establish predictive models for biomacromolecular interactions in biologically relevant conditions. This project was jointly funded by the Molecular Biophysics Cluster in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
