 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funding for the conference \"4th Upstate New York Topology Seminar\", which will take place at Binghamton University in Binghamton, NY, from 3/1/2025 to 3/2/2025. This meeting is planned as the fourth installment of the Upstate New York Topology Seminar (UNYTS) series, which was started in Fall 2017. The goal of the meeting is to continue to build connections, both within the New York state region and with nearby regions, by gathering the numerous topologists, including the many geometric and algebraic topologists and geometric group theorists in the area, for a weekend of talks. NSF funding will provide partial lodging and travel support, to encourage participation by graduate students and postdoctoral fellows working in the area.\r\n\r\nThe conference will cover various flavors of topology, including algebraic topology, geometric topology, and geometric group theory, promoting the exchange of ideas between these areas. Four invited speakers will deliver the main lectures, and several parallel sessions of shorter talks will give early-career participants the opportunity to share their research in focused groups. The conference will also facilitate in-person interactions between participants at different career stages. To facilitate this exchange, the organizers will run a thematic lunch activity, during which participants will be able to talk about a chosen aspect of the mathematical profession.\r\n\r\nMore information can be found at https://sites.google.com/view/unytsbinghamton/home.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
