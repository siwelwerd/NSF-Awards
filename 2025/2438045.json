 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of sustainable, multi-target biopesticides that address major pest management challenges and crop losses for U.S. farmers. Pests are responsible for a 20-40% annual reduction in crop yields in the U.S., posing a serious threat to agricultural productivity. Traditional chemical pesticides, which dominate over 90% of the U.S. pesticide market, have resulted in widespread resistance, significantly diminishing their effectiveness. Additionally, 99% of these pesticides are derived from petroleum, contributing to environmental degradation and water contamination in over 50% of U.S. agricultural regions. This project aims to replace these harmful chemicals with efficacious, cost-effective, and customizable biopesticides. These biopesticides have the potential to reduce pesticide costs by 40%, particularly for high-value crops like almonds and citrus, while providing a safer and more sustainable alternative. Designed to supplement the existing pest management toolkit, these agro-biologicals may enhance integrated pest control management, focusing on delaying resistance onset and selectively targeting pests while preserving beneficial pollinators and biodiversity.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of microbial-based, multi-target biopesticides using synthetic biology techniques. The proposed technology enables the efficient and versatile integration of large DNA segments from one microbe to another, allowing for the merging of entire pesticidal operons and genetic pathways sourced from diverse microorganisms in nature. To address concerns about unwanted environmental spread of microbes and health risks associated with genetically modified organisms, these engineered microbes are transformed into non-reproducing, biodegradable particles that mimic commercial spore products. This approach ensures environmental safety while preserving pesticidal effectiveness.  In addition, engineering efforts are reduced while expanding the range of possibilities for pest control solutions.  Preliminary results have shown the successful integration of pesticidal traits, significantly enhancing efficacy against microbial pests compared to traditional chemical standards. The proposed technology offers broad-spectrum pest control and extends the product's effective application cycles, and is designed to integrate seamlessly with existing pesticide systems.  This technology may deliver a sustainable, long-term solution to current pest management challenges by addressing resistance and improving crop protection.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
