 "awd_abstract_narration": "The conference Quasiweekend III to be held in Helsinki, Finland, from June 9\u201313, 2025 will focus on advancing areas of mathematics that explore the geometry and structure of spaces. These spaces may be highly irregular or distorted, such as fractals and porous media, and understanding them is important for modeling and analyzing complex structures in nature, technology, and data. The award Conference: Quasiweekend III will support the travel and expenses of ten U.S.-based mathematicians and allow the recipients to participate in Quasiweekend III. More information may be found at https://www.helsinki.fi/en/conferences/quasiweekend-iii.\r\n\r\nThe conference program will highlight recent advances and synergies across asymptotic metric geometry, Sobolev space theory and potential theory, geometric analysis, and large-scale metric geometry. The conference is expected to facilitate the exchange of ideas and techniques among these interconnected fields, fostering new insights and international collaborations that will drive progress in the discipline. The award will prioritize travel support for graduate students, early-career researchers, and mathematicians from underrepresented groups, ensuring broad participation and strengthening the diversity of the mathematical community.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
