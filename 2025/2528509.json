 "awd_abstract_narration": "The National Science Foundation (NSF) supports the research of Professor Xin Cui at Mississippi State University. This project is jointly funded by Chemical Catalysis Program of NSF's Division of Chemistry and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).  Professor Cui is developing new routes to organic compounds that could be used in drugs and polymers.  The specific goal is the invention of ways to make organic compounds that are behave differently from their mirror images. This type of structure requires methods that rely on particularly subtle chemical structures.  Professor Cui proposes to solve these challenges using catalysts containing the element called ruthenium. Ruthenium forms compounds with appropriately subtle structures, which facilitate the formation of desired organic products . New insights will be obtained by systematic changes in the ruthenium catalysts. The award also supports the training of undergraduate and high school students through \u201cstudent-to-student\u201d science education.  Hands-on laboratory experience is provided to participating undergraduates. The chemistry club organized by Professor Cui provide STEM education to K-12 students.  Overall, this research project helps to improve the sustainability and innovation of the chemical industry while increasing the technical workforce of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe National Science Foundation (NSF) supports the research of Professor Xin Cui at Mississippi State University. This project is jointly funded by Chemical Catalysis Program of NSF's Division of Chemistry and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).  Stereoselective C\u2013H functionalization has attracted much attention because the opportunities are significant both scientifically and economically, but still faces major challenges. This challenge is being met by Professor Cui whose research shows that ruthenium(II)-based catalysts are highly effective for functionalization of aromatic C\u2013H bonds.  Of still greater interest, his research reveals new stereoselective, particularly enantioselective, functionalization of various organic substrates. These developments open access to new pharmaceuticals and related bioactive compounds. Products targeted include alkaloids, chiral polymers, and future chiral ligands. In one approach, chiral directing groups are being developed for conferring stereocontrol. In another approach, a new class of chiral umbrella-shaped ligands enable long-range stereocontrol of C\u2012H functionalization reactions. Overall, the two themes are providing new fundamental insights that will enhance synthetic methods as well as to demonstrate the untapped potential of ruthenium(II)-catalysis. In parallel with the laboratory research, Professor Cui leads an undergraduate team that aims to familiarize young generations with modern organic chemistry. His team also aims to encourage the participation of high school and undergraduate students.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
