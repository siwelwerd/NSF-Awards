 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant will support student attendance at the 2025 Annual Conference & Expo of the American Society of Engineering Education (ASEE), which will be held in Montreal, Canada, 22-25 June 2025. The ASEE Annual Conference & Expo is the society\u2019s flagship event which attracts thousands of participants from academia, industry, and government. The conference provides a forum for networking, professional development, and dissemination of cutting-edge research and educational practices. At the ASEE Annual Conference, the Manufacturing Division organizes technical sessions, panel discussions, workshops, and hands-on activities covering cutting-edge topics such as automation, additive manufacturing, smart manufacturing, robotics, and Industry 4.0. The Manufacturing Division also recognizes excellence in manufacturing education by presenting awards for best papers, outstanding educators, and exemplary teaching and research contributions. The financial costs associated with the conference expenses represent a challenge for students, especially those from underrepresented groups, minority-serving institutions, and institutions with limited research funding. Many students, despite their potential and commitment, are unable to attend due to these financial constraints. This grant will directly address these challenges by providing financial support to ensure that a diverse group of students can attend and benefit from the ASEE conference.\r\n\r\nThis funding will help cover the costs of registration, travel, and lodging for 25-30 undergraduate and graduate students from US institutions to attend the ASEE Annual Conference. The availability of travel funding will be announced through the ASEE Manufacturing Division website and shared with relevant communities. The selected students will participate in the ASEE Manufacturing Division sessions and activities. The key objectives of this grant are to (1) promote student engagement in state-of-the-art manufacturing innovation and education, with an emphasis on digital manufacturing, advanced manufacturing systems, and sustainable manufacturing practices, (2) increase participation of students from underrepresented groups in manufacturing engineering, thereby promoting diversity and inclusion in the field, (3) provide students with opportunities to network with experts and professionals in manufacturing for future collaborations and career development, and (4) contribute to the growth and development of U.S. manufacturing workforce by exposing students to the latest research and technological advancements in manufacturing education.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
