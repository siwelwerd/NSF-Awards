 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides partial funding for the annual Space Weather Workshop (SWW) to be held in Boulder, Colorado in March 2025. The nation\u2019s premier meeting on space weather since 1996, SWW fosters communication among researchers, space weather service providers, and users of space weather services. Workshop discussions advance our knowledge of the impacts of space weather on today\u2019s technologies including communications, navigation, space traffic coordination, spacecraft operations, aviation, and electric power. Undergraduate and graduate student participants gain insights into our nation\u2019s space weather priorities. \r\n\r\nDiscussions at the Space Weather Workshop highlight scientific advances in understanding and predicting conditions in the space environment that affect our technological society. The conference focuses on identifying the highest priority needs for operational services that can guide future research and identifying new high-value research capabilities that can be transitioned into operations. Its program and sessions also advance academia-commercial sector-government partnerships and international collaborations. NSF funding will be used to support over twenty students to participate in the workshop.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
