 "awd_abstract_narration": "Electric motors and generators play a crucial role in diverse industries, facilitating the widespread adoption of electric vehicles, enhancing industrial productivity, and harnessing renewable energy sources. Nonetheless, existing technologies heavily depend on costly rare-earth permanent magnets, which present significant obstacles to achieving sustainability objectives and promoting electrification efforts. The demand for rare-earth permanent magnets, such as neodymium iron boron (NdFeB), is expected to surge more than 20 times to fulfill sustainable energy and transportation goals by 2050. The projected demand for rare-earth magnets in offshore wind turbine and electric vehicle applications will reach 36.3% (273.7 kt) and 35.3% (266 kt), respectively, which is more than 70% of the total demand. Therefore, identifying motor drives that are free from rare-earth elements yet maintain high-performance and efficiency is a significant area of research. \r\n\r\nThis CAREER project aims to develop a magnetically integrated electric drive system with a topologically optimized magnet-free and brushless wound-field flux-switching (WFFS) motor, eliminating the need for expensive rare-earth permanent magnets. The research involves optimizing the motor design to eliminate inefficient magnetic flux paths, co-designing the motor and the inverter for high torque density and thermal performance, and accurately quantifying motor and drive losses for advanced control technique development. The outcomes of this research have broader implications for various sectors, including electric vehicles, renewable energy systems, more electric aircraft, and industrial processes, where electric drives are vital components. By providing an alternative to rare-earth magnet-based drives, the project seeks to revolutionize industry and contribute to the development of sustainable and high-power density electric drives. The research also addresses environmental concerns and supply chain challenges associated with rare-earth materials, promoting sustainability in the transportation and renewable energy sectors. The research outcomes will contribute to the body of knowledge in the field and have a lasting impact on the transition to cleaner energy sources and sustainable transportation systems.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
