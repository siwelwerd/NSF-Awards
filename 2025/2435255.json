 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Q-BLUE project will support a three-pronged effort to significantly advance quantum computing: (1) analog quantum hardware development, (2) an optimized compilation process, and (3) advances in three applications \u2013 quantum chemistry (QC), condensed matter physics (CMP) and nuclear physics (NP). Each of these applications will reap significant benefits from quantum computing. In quantum chermistry time-dependent quantum simulations will enable the exploration of complex molecular dynamics, ushering in a revolution in drug discovery and material design. In nuclear physics, a wealth of unprecedented insights into the behavior of exotic nuclei emerges, with direct implications for nuclear energy and astrophysics, will be obtained. In condensed matter physics, the inner workings of quantum many-body systems will be revealed, potentially paving the way for the creation of groundbreaking materials. The Q-BLUE project will bolster partnerships and cultivate a skilled workforce, particularly excelling in education for both graduates and undergraduates. Nurturing a proficient software engineering workforce plays a pivotal role in advancing the field of quantum computation. The project will actively involve students in research initiatives alongside engineers specializing in the development of trapped-ion quantum computers. This comprehensive educational strategy ensures that our graduates are exceptionally well-prepared to contribute to academic research and industrial applications within the field of quantum computing. \r\n\r\nTime-dependent simulations on analog Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) quantum computers hold considerable importance in chemistry, nuclear physics, and condensed matter physics. Such simulations do not merely provide glimpses into the dynamic behavior of quantum systems but also have the potential to showcase \u201cquantum advantage\u201d; i.e. the ability to solve complex problems exponentially faster or to address computational challenges that are infeasible for classical computers to tackle within a reasonable time. The potential of quantum computing to redefine such applications arises from its inherent capacity to manage the exponential complexities inherent in quantum systems, thereby forging new pathways for scientific discovery and technological advancement, pathways that were once considered unattainable. While the digital approach has proven its universality, the quantum analog mode offers a key advantage by being less susceptible to errors. In the 9th month of our project, the Q-BLUE team will organize a Town Hall, conducted virtually to maximize participation, including by under-represented groups.\r\n\r\nThis project advances the objectives of Quantum Information Science and Engineering at NSF in response to the National Quantum Initiative Act for the continued leadership of the United States in QIS and its technology applications.\r\n\r\nThis project is jointly funded by the NSF National Quantum Virtual Laboratory program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
