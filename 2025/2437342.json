 "awd_abstract_narration": "A goal of the Tribal Colleges and Universities Program (TCUP) is to increase the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) instructional and research capacities of specific institutions of higher education that serve the Nation's indigenous students. Expanding the instructional, research, and development capacity at these institutions expands the opportunities for students to pursue challenging yet rewarding careers in STEM fields, provides for research studies in areas that may be locally relevant, and encourages a faculty community to look beyond the traditional classroom for intellectual and professional growth. This project aligns directly with that goal by strengthening the STEM cyberinfrastructure for instructional and research activities. The project aims to enhance cyberinfrastructure and cybersecurity necessary to facilitate development of the institution in STEM fields and for the protection of sensitive data. \r\n\r\nThe project upgrades specific STEM IT resources at Lac Courte Oreilles Ojibway University to improve the resiliency and security of STEM operations, data management as well as the teaching and research enterprises. Improvements to the university\u2019s network and cybersecurity, fosters its ability to implement advances in STEM instruction and research. The activities for developing STEM cyberinfrastructure directly support current and future projects, including the ability to expand STEM instruction through distance education.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
