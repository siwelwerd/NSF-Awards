 "awd_abstract_narration": "Langseth provides the U.S. academic community with a global class vessel with a unique multi-channel seismic (MCS) capability for 2D and 3D reflection seismic imaging and, with the deployment of ocean bottom seismometers (OBS), refraction imaging and tomography. The ship is able to deploy multiple streamer hydrophone arrays and high-quality tuned sound source arrays, which enhance data acquisition. This imaging capability enables scientists to tackle a wide range of marine earth science problems.\r\n\r\nThe seismic data is complimented by towed magnetics and onboard gravimeter measurements. Langseth has an extensive mapping capability with its set of sonars that include a Kongsberg EM122 deep water swath bathymetry system with water column logger, a Knudsen sub-bottom profiler, and an RDI OS75 Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP). An uncontaminated sea water system with thermos-salinographs and an automated pCO2 system for measurements while underway. Onboard labs offer potential of supporting various marine science disciplines.\r\n\r\nLangseth, in common with the other ships in the US Academic Research Fleet, is more than just an instrument for the collection of scientific data. It is a learning tool, a university educational facility that allows young earth scientists to learn the hands-on aspects of their trade. The 2024 Ship Operations program provides an opportunity to collect new, higher resolution data in unexplored areas and more detail in others, which will add\r\nsignificantly to our understanding of fundamental problems in the earth and ocean sciences. Outreach efforts include ship tours and community outreach through LDEO sponsored activities that feature Langseth.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
