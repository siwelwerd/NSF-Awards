 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Householder Symposium XXII will be held June 8-13, 2025, at the Statler Hotel on the campus of Cornell University in Ithaca, NY. The symposium gathers the world's most active researchers in numerical linear algebra once every three years to review advances in the field, present recent theoretical and practical results, and assess where the field is headed in the future. A hallmark of the Symposium is its intimate atmosphere, which promotes close personal interaction and the free exchange of ideas. Many researchers in numerical linear algebra consider this gathering to be the most important and influential meeting in the field, reflecting its rich tradition dating back to the original \"Gatlinburg\" conferences founded by Alston Householder in the 1960s. This proposal supports the travel costs of 12 junior U.S. researchers to the Householder Symposium XXII. The funds will provide essential support for U.S. graduate students and recent Ph.D.s who might otherwise be unable to attend. By enabling full participation for promising junior members of the U.S. numerical linear algebra community, these NSF funds ensure that early-career scientists are introduced to leading experts in the field and have opportunities to showcase their cutting-edge work. The Householder Symposium has traditionally been a gateway conference into numerical linear algebra, making the attendance of junior scientists vital both for their professional development and for maintaining the robust U.S. competitiveness in this critical discipline. \r\n\r\nKey topics to be emphasized at Householder XXII include the solution of large systems of linear equations, eigenvalue problems, preconditioning, perturbation theory, least squares, integral equations, and diverse applications in scientific and engineering computation, such as control, systems and signal processing, data mining, data compression, and bioengineering. Advances in numerical linear algebra have had profound effects on numerous scientific and technological fronts, including web search engines, the global positioning system, high-speed supercomputing algorithms, machine learning, and data science. Ensuring that the next generation of researchers actively participates in the conference will sustain the innovative momentum needed to address future challenges in science and engineering. More information about the conference is available at the website: https://householder-symposium.github.io.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
