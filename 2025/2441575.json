 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to uncover the intricate ways neurons communicate and how this communication influences brain development and maturation. The goal of this investigation is to discover how chemical signals between neurons, such as neurotransmitters and neuropeptides, contribute to the growth and function of the nervous system. By studying the nervous system of a simple and well-understood model organism, like the worm Caenorhabditis elegans, this study will contribute with insights that could benefit a wide range of species, including humans. This research could lead to a better understanding of brain health and disease, and the findings could have broad implications for improving educational and outreach programs. Additionally, the project will foster the development of future scientists, by providing hands-on research experiences and enhancing communication skills.\r\n\r\nThis proposal seeks to investigate the role of neuron-neuron communication, particularly through neurotransmitter-based and neuropeptidergic chemical neurotransmission, in the post-mitotic maturation of neurons during postnatal development. Utilizing the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans, this investigation will leverage advanced genetics, behavioral assays, microscopy, and genomics tools to examine the molecular and functional maturation of neurons. The research will address key questions about the impact of various modes of neurotransmission on behavior, synaptic connectivity, and gene expression. By systematically manipulating neuronal transmission in a temporally and spatially specific manner, this project aims to delineate the interplay between extrinsic environmental stimuli and intrinsic genetic timer mechanisms in regulating neuronal maturation. This study will provide critical insights into the mechanisms of neuronal development, with potential implications for understanding brain function and disease across species.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
