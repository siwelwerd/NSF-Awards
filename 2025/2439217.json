 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is based on the development of methods and products to convert vibrational energy into electricity. Vibration energy harvesters convert mechanical vibrations (from environmental sources like machinery, vehicles, buildings, or natural vibrations) into electrical energy. By capturing a larger amount of vibration energy, this technology could increase energy utilization efficiency, which could reduce the consumption of gasoline to build a greener environment. By converting available, naturally occurring forms of energy from vibrations into usable electricity, this technology could significantly increase the total renewable energy utilization.    \r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the proposed technology. It is based on the prior development of energy harvesting technology. Typically, energy harvesters capture most of the energy at a single frequency and produce minimal energy when the available vibration frequency changes. However, vibrational energy has more than one frequency embedded into it and the frequency varies. To use this variable frequency vibration energy, and by overcoming the shortcomings of the traditional energy harvesting products, this adaptive vibrational energy harvester is designed to capture significant vibrational energy from a wider band of frequencies. This technology designs an oscillator that can harvest non-stationary vibration sources, working as a resonance-tracking vibration energy harvester. Therefore, this process maximizes the vibration energy output from ambient non-stationary vibrations, enhancing energy utilization efficiency.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
