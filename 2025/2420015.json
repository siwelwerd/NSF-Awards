 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research programs supported by R/V Atlantis will provide new insights and invaluable discoveries that will continue to enhance the understanding of our global ocean and address a broad range of significant scientific questions in the next decade. The goal of this proposal is to provide funding support to continue to operate and maintain R/V Atlantis to support its planned life cycle safely and productively.\r\n\r\nAn increased awareness of our responsibility to provide access to science from the classroom and to the public has resulted in the development of new avenues to share these scientific findings. Educational and outreach programs will continue to be an integral part of future expeditions on the R/V Atlantis. These efforts include ship access for MIT-WHOI graduate students, WHOI postdocs, and early career science programs. Telepresence capabilities on the ship, expedition web sites and social media, allow for effective interaction with classrooms, providing real-time images and video, data and two-way communication between scientists and students in national and international schools, and outreach to the public through\r\nthe WHOI website.\r\n\r\nIn addition to WHOI's  impact in the classroom and bringing research to the public, WHOI and R/V Atlantis was also instrumental in two rescue missions in 2023. These missions resulted in saving 14 lives, further displaying our dedication to the public\u2019s safety, and providing aid at sea.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
