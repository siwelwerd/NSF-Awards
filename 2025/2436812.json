 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of an advanced surgical tool designed to improve patient safety and reduce complications during surgery. The project focuses on creating a device that integrates real-time monitoring and enhanced visualization to prevent tissue damage that causes Mastectomy Skin Flap Necrosis, a devastating complication for breast cancer patients. This technology can be applied across a wide range of surgical procedures beyond mastectomies, potentially reducing the incidence of complications, minimizing the need for additional surgeries, and lowering overall healthcare costs. By addressing a critical need for improved surgical precision, this project aims to enhance overall patient outcomes and reduce healthcare expenses, positioning the technology as a valuable asset in medical settings with broad implications for improving surgical practices and patient care.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. This solution is based on the development of a surgical retractor equipped with sensors that continuously monitor retraction levels and provide real-time feedback to surgeons. The technology integrates a miniature camera to enhance visualization, similar to an endoscope, and relies on data-driven algorithms to assess safe pressure ranges. Preliminary research has demonstrated the retractor's capability to identify retraction levels and alert surgeons before excessive pressure causes tissue damage. By integrating these features, the technology offers a novel approach to preventing complications and advancing surgical practices.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
