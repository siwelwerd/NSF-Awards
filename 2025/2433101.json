 "awd_abstract_narration": "Master\u2019s-level engineers are critical for the technology workforce as the nation seeks to continue to advance national health, prosperity and welfare and to secure national defense. However, even though there are four times as many engineering master\u2019s recipients as PhDs in the United States, we know almost nothing about their experiences, motivations, career planning, and skills required in industry. Most prior research on engineering graduate students has focused on doctoral students. This project will focus on this critical segment of the workforce, with an initial focus on mechanical engineering, so that we can systematically understand how to better prepare master\u2019s students for their jobs so that they can make contributions in their careers from the outset. As workforce demands continue to increase for engineers who have master\u2019s degrees, and as technology continues to change at a rapid pace, our research will use cutting-edge generative artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to illuminate the specific skills employers want from employees who have engineering master\u2019s degrees, which can inform graduate curricular offerings. Our research will also help identify potential strategies for recruiting more students to engineering master\u2019s programs, in particular domestic students, which is a critical need for the future workforce. The findings of this project will better inform students, employers, administrators, and those considering master\u2019s degrees, about the skills desired and expected of mechanical engineering master\u2019s recipients.\r\n\r\nThis project will advance novel applications of natural language processing (NLP) coupled with interview research to understand the skills and benefits of terminal engineering master\u2019s degrees, with a preliminary focus on the mechanical engineering discipline. The quantitative element of the project will involve analysis of a data set of over a decade of engineering job postings and apply an algorithm to extract skills from job advertisements to advance understanding of the engineering workforce, and of methodological development of NLP techniques. The qualitative element will involve collection and analysis of interviews with current master\u2019s students about their reasons for pursuing a master\u2019s degree, including desired skills.  The project will mix these qualitative and quantitative analyses to identify mis(alignments) between what is communicated from the workforce about desired skills via job advertisements and current perceptions of the workforce from current master\u2019s students. This research will fill an important gap in research on master\u2019s-level engineering students, building knowledge about motivations for pursuing a master\u2019s degree and employer expectations, including the most marketable skills. The NLP approaches developed in this project will apply to other employment sectors, disciplines, education research questions, and fields beyond engineering education research.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
