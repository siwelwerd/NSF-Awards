 "awd_abstract_narration": "Internet search offers incredible learning opportunities by making information more accessible than ever before. This project examines whether internet search leads to shifts in thinking style and if it affects self-directed learning. The project also aims to investigate whether interventions which encourage people to use their memory as they conduct internet searches could influence search processes. This work seeks to grow understanding of how people can effectively use their mental abilities alongside digital tools. The project also includes STEM research opportunities for trainees and broad dissemination of project outcomes through online public forums.\r\n\r\nThere are two major goals of the proposed research. First, this work aims to examine the extent to which using internet search might affect people\u2019s ability to direct their own learning by changing users\u2019 cognitive style. Prior work suggests that habitually using internet search can impart a low-effort approach to cognitive tasks, so the proposed work plans to investigate the extent to which such a shift in cognitive style influences learning on an unrelated task. Second, this work aims to investigate short-term and longer-term interventions to counteract potential effects of internet use on learning and cognitive style by encouraging users to practice using their cognitive abilities alongside internet search.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
