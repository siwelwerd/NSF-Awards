 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project examines the ways that different types of property rights are associated with strategies for conserving natural resources. When local communities maintain land rights to natural areas, there are opportunities for values and norms to influence conservation approaches and land use activities. This doctoral dissertation project examines multiple communities in settings that have been managed as protected areas with varying degrees of governmental involvement. The researchers comparatively focus on land ownership as a contributor to land use practices and biodiversity conservation. A complementary focus examines the ways that conservation organizations adapt their approaches to support local communities that have secured property rights. The findings are shared with community partners, and the project contributes to the education and training of an early-career scientist.\r\n\r\nThis research considers the effectiveness of conservation strategies in relation to land rights and local communities that prioritize their values and norms. Using a range of qualitative methods, including observations, interviews, and archival analysis, the researchers examine how land ownership affects management and the interface with conservation organizations and governmental agencies. The project potentially elucidates new conservation approaches that can emerge in decentralized contexts. By examining multiple communities and strategies, the project considers the extent to which the success of conservation efforts can be evaluated according to local priorities and contexts.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
