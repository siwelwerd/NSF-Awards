 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will provide partial support for U.S.-based graduate students and postdocs to participate in the Young Geometric Group Theory XIII conference, to be held in Copenhagen, Denmark, from April 7-11 2025. The purpose of this international conference series is to expose early-career researchers to cutting-edge research, provide them with opportunities to share their work, and to facilitate new collaborations. The conference includes mini-courses by established experts, plenary talks by early-career researchers, lighting talks and a poster session for participants, and group discussions. The conference will give an opportunity for early-career geometric group theorists to publicize their research and strengthen their position in the field. The activities will also foster community and enable networking and interactions at all levels. Geometric group theory is a fairly young and very active field, and the selection of mini-course lectures and speakers at this conference will reflect a variety of subtopics within geometric group theory as well as a diversity of identity, background, and geographical location. \r\n\r\nThere will be four mini-courses on the topics of free and free-by-cyclic groups by Radhika Gupta, Helly graphs and non-positive curvature by Thomas Haettel, L2-invariants of groups by Clara Loh, and finiteness properties of groups by Brita Nucinkis. These lectures will present a panoramic overview of some of the important developments in geometric group theory. The plenary presentations will aim to focus on other recent research and directions to broaden the scope of the workshop, and to encourage the participants to explore the boundaries of the subject. More information about the conference can be found on the conference website: https://sites.google.com/view/yggt2025\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
