 "awd_abstract_narration": "This I-Corps project is based on the development of a virtual reality, surgical simulation trainer for endoscopic surgery. Endoscopic surgery is performed using a scope, a flexible tube with a camera and light at the tip. This technology focuses on endoscopic sinus and skull base surgery, which is particularly challenging due to the proximity of critical anatomical structures in the operating field. When complications occur during these surgeries, patients can develop significant health problems. This technology addresses these challenges by allowing trainees, educators, and surgical industries to acquire fundamental knowledge of surgical anatomy, techniques, complications, and instrumentation prior to performing surgery on living patients. The technology includes the surgical steps, a guided surgical feedback tool, and a virtual reality surgical simulator. The goal is to provide a platform for trainees to practice surgery, improving patient safety.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of a virtual reality (VR), surgical simulation trainer for sinus and skull base endoscopic surgery. Endoscopic sinus and skull base surgery is challenging due to the proximity of critical anatomical structures in the operating field and the use of micro-instrumentation, specialized instrumentation, and angled endoscopes. This technology is based on a hierarchical task analysis to divide complex endoscopic procedures into smaller, more manageable tasks. These tasks are associated with relevant clinical information to highlight where surgical errors might occur. The VR simulator allows users to identify surgical steps, associate two-dimensional computed tomography images to an immersive three-dimensional virtual environment, practice surgical technique. This technology uses a software platform that incorporates patient images into an interactive VR environment using commercially available VR headsets. Results from initial testing showed that trainees and educators found this to be a valuable method for surgical education. This technology may reduce surgical complications and improve patient safety.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
