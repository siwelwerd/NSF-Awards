 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this workshop is to bring together physical scientists, computational scientists, social scientists, and practitioners in climate research to define a path for research and community engagement at the global scale. This interdisciplinary workshop will provide a timely venue to advance a research and community- engagement vision for solar radiation management (SRM) over the next decade. The need for expert information on climate and SRM is growing, especially as climate hazards increase worldwide. The workshop aims at defining key scenarios, environmental consequences, uncertainties, and knowledge gaps as identified by experts and at building the necessary tools and infrastructure to address them. The workshop will convene approximately thirty participants for a weeklong program of technical presentations, discussions, working groups, and opportunities for public engagement. \r\n\r\nAfter the workshop, AGCI will make video recordings of workshop proceedings available to the public and work with co-chairs to prepare, publish, and disseminate workshop outputs. Workshop findings will be shared through a peer-reviewed publication to provide research communities a balanced global vision of priority SRM research directions. In addition, workshop participants will develop a roadmap for the development of an infrastructure capability to enable researchers to perform self-defined science of interest. AGCI will engage the public through a public lecture (in-person and live-streamed) and web-accessible videos of workshop proceedings and other multimedia.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
