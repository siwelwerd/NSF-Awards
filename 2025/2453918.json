 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will be used to fund the 2025 conference Frontiers in Computational and Applied Mathematics (FACM), to be held at the New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT) on June 5-6, 2025. The theme of FACM 2025 is \"New trends in data- and physics-based modeling and simulation of fluids\". Since its inception in 2004, the FACM conference has established itself internationally as a leading forum for the dissemination of recent results and new ideas in applied and computational mathematics and applied statistics. It attracts a distinguished international audience and provides an important forum to showcase US mathematical talent, and opportunities, especially junior participants, for networking with researchers in academia and industry. This year's conference will explore the advances that have been made in recent years by applying new computational tools and techniques (including machine learning and artificial intelligence, among others) to challenging problems that arise in fluid dynamics. A particular focus will be on application areas, which range from industrial challenges to biomedical applications to large-scale ocean flows.\r\n\r\nThis year's FACM conference theme will address the many exciting emerging new trends in data- and physics-based modeling and simulation of fluids. New research will be presented and discussed in a variety of forums. There will be four plenary presentations of an expository nature, given by recognized US-based leaders in their fields, each of which will set the scene for a focused minisymposium session. The four minisymposium sessions will focus on: fluid-structure interaction, particularly in the realm of biological flows; complex fluid flows arising in applied physics and industrial applications; new trends in the modeling and simulation of wave propagation; and computer-assisted proof in fluid dynamics (particularly for partial differential equations arising in wave-propagation). A highlight of the conference will be the poster session, anticipated to be extensive, dynamic and stimulating. As one might expect from a workshop focusing on cutting-edge research, methodology that draws on data science, topological data analysis, machine-learning and scientific computing will be featured, as well as more traditional areas such as applied analysis and asymptotics - often in intriguing new combinations. The conference website, which will be updated as more speakers are confirmed, can be found at https://sites.google.com/njit.edu/facm2025/home.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
