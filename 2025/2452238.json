 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national interest by providing a forum for senior university leaders to discuss recommendations and plans for implementation from the findings of the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) Committee on Equitable and Effective Teaching in Undergraduate STEM Education.  The Association for Undergraduate Education in Research Universities (UERU) will plan and host the conference at Howard University, in conjunction with the 2025 UERU national meeting.  The goals of the conference are to present and discuss the NASEM report recommendations with university leaders, to lay the groundwork for implementation of the recommendations, and to produce a conference proceedings volume to capture the discussion and define the plan for implementation.  Fifty senior leaders representing research-intensive institutions across the nation are anticipated to attend the conference, which will include presentation and expert comments on the report and panel discussions on implementation from the perspectives of institutional leaders.  \r\n\r\nThe conference plan includes presentation of the report by NASEM representatives and expert comments from thought leaders in undergraduate STEM education.  Four panels on implementation will be convened, examining the report from the perspectives of provosts, chancellors, deans, and STEM education practitioners and researchers.  Panel organization and speaker invitations will be coordinated by UERU, and the conference will be held at Howard University to situate the proceedings at a top-tier HBCU with a strong emphasis on equitable and effective undergraduate instruction.  The NSF IUSE: EDU Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
