 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 30th International Conference on Architectural Support for Programming Languages and Operating Systems (ASPLOS), sponsored by the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), will be held in Rotterdam, The Netherlands, March 30 - April 3, 2025. ASPLOS is a leading forum for multidisciplinary systems research spanning computer architecture and hardware, programming languages and compilers, and operating systems. It involves participants (researchers, developers, students, and practitioners) from academia, industry, laboratories, and commerce coming together to discuss recent advances and trends. \r\n\r\nASPLOS seeks to increase student participation in the conference and the field. The funding will support the travel of eligible US students. Recipients will be able to attend the main conference, workshops, and tutorials. Travel grants will encourage the research interests and the involvement of students in the field who are not well funded and those who are just beginning their participation in the field or are interested in entering it. A special effort will be made to reach out to students from underrepresented groups. \r\n\r\nThe award will cover up to 15 NSF-sponsored student travel grants for a total budget of $25,000.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
