 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project lies in the development of a next-generation vascular graft that improves outcomes for patients undergoing vascular surgeries. Vascular diseases are a leading cause of mortality worldwide, and there is a critical need for small-diameter vascular grafts that provide better durability, bioactivity, and mechanical compliance. Current graft options, including autologous vessels and synthetic alternatives, suffer from limitations such as poor long-term success rates, risk of blood clots, and mismatched mechanical properties that contribute to complications. This project addresses these challenges by developing a novel fabrication method that produces vascular grafts using a combination of synthetic and bioactive materials. The approach aims to enhance tissue integration, improve long-term performance, and reduce the need for repeat interventions. The potential commercial impact of this project is significant, as it aims to meet the growing demand for improved outcomes in both peripheral artery disease and coronary bypass procedures. Success in this work could lead to new medical solutions that lower healthcare costs, reduce patient complications, and provide a scalable alternative to current standards of care.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project focuses on developing an innovative bioprinting approach for creating vascular grafts that closely mimic the properties of natural blood vessels. The project seeks to overcome the limitations of current synthetic and biological grafts by utilizing a specialized bioprinting process that integrates a double-network hydrogel made from a Dacron synthetic polymer and recombinant human collagen. This combination allows for precise control over mechanical properties, including elasticity and compliance, while promoting cell adhesion and integration with native tissue. The research objectives include optimizing a custom bioprinting system for the Darcon blend, fine-tuning material compositions to achieve the desired mechanical properties, and evaluating the grafts for structural integrity and performance. The anticipated results include the successful production of vascular conduits with controlled dimensions, improved mechanical compatibility with native arteries, and enhanced biofunctionality for long-term graft success. If successful, this project will establish the foundation for a scalable, high-performance vascular graft technology that can address critical gaps in vascular and cardiovascular medicine.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
