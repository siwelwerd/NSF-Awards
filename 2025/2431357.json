 "awd_abstract_narration": "The conference \"D-modules, local systems and applications\" will be held in Centre de Recherches Mathematiques (CRM) in Canada, September 16-20, 2024. This award provides partial travel support for early-career researchers from the United States to attend the conference. The exploration of D-modules, the algebra of linear partial differential equations, and their solutions have been at the forefront of numerous groundbreaking advancements in pure mathematics. These include their pivotal role in the resurgence of singularity theory and topology, and their centrality in geometric representation theory. The conference will unite experts from the fields of geometric representation theory, arithmetic geometry and birational geometry, promoting interdisciplinary collaboration and the exchange of the latest developments in these deeply intertwined areas of mathematics. The conference will cover a broad range of topics, include a diverse list of speakers and participants, and highlight the work of early career mathematicians.\r\n\r\nThe central theme of the meeting is to explore how incorporating Hodge structures and additional weight considerations, as exemplified in p-adic geometry, broadens the application scope of the theory of D-modules into new areas. Hodge theory is crucial for applications in geometric representation theory, arithmetic geometry and birational geometry. This well-timed gathering of experts from these areas will impact the community as a whole, stimulating new ideas and fostering lasting connections among researchers in these rapidly evolving fields.  More information is available on the conference webpage: https://www.crmath.ca/en/activities/#/type/activity/id/3968.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
