 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support the participation of about 60 selected students and recent graduates studying STEM disciplines in US institutions in the 2025 co-located International Advanced Manufacturing Conference (NAMRC/MSEC/LEM&P), including the 53nd North American Manufacturing Research Conference (NAMRC52) sponsored by the North American Manufacturing Research Institution of the Society of Manufacturing Engineers, the International Manufacturing Science and Engineering Conference (MSEC 2025) sponsored by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, and the International Conference on Leading Edge Manufacturing/Materials & Processing (LEM&P 20245 sponsored by the Japan Society of Mechanical Engineers, to be held at Clemson University in Greenville, South Carolina on 23-27 June 2024. These co-located conferences provide an exceptional research forum, with topics including conventional and emerging manufacturing technologies, additive manufacturing, nano-/micro-/meso- manufacturing, biomanufacturing, manufacturing equipment and automation, manufacturing systems, quality control and reliability, advanced materials processing, applications of machine learning and artificial intelligence, sustainable manufacturing, life cycle engineering, and engineering education and many other cross-cutting research. As such, the event provides a global bridge between industry, government laboratories, and academic institutions.\r\n\r\nParticipation of undergraduate and graduate students and recent graduates from US institutions at national manufacturing conferences is crucial to expanding the manufacturing research base in the United States. This award will help lower the barrier for conference participation for selected students by defraying the costs of registration and accommodation. Their attendance will provide opportunities for them to exchange ideas with leading researchers and engineers from industrial and governmental facilities around the world, as well as with students and faculty from both domestic and international universities. The call-for-award applications will be disseminated through postings on main conference websites and directly by conference organizers, track chairs, and symposium organizers, etc. Submitted applications will go through a selection process by the conference committee that will prioritize applicants based on their prior conference involvement, educational achievements, and personal background. During the conference, the awardees will be announced in the conference program. This award will enable selected participants to improve their knowledge of advanced manufacturing research and help them to advance their careers as the next generation of U.S. manufacturing engineers and researchers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
