 "awd_abstract_narration": "Current and future US engineering workforce demands require research to better understand how to support the professional formation of all engineering students. The number of enrolled engineering students nation-wide had the sharpest decline in a generation. Further complicating the problem is the decreased math and reading scores across the US since the pandemic, adding an additional filter of who can enter into engineering. Projected national shortages of engineers are in the tens and hundreds of thousands of workers in some sectors. Simultaneously, fewer young people are entering into four-year degrees. Once a student has enrolled in an undergraduate engineering program, they become a valuable asset for meeting the workforce demands and need support to continue in their professional formation. However, researchers have found that some subgroups of students are at a particularly high-risk of leaving engineering. Among those subgroups of at-risk learners are nonbinary engineering students. Researchers know very little about factors supporting or hindering nonbinary students engineering professional formation. This project serves to help understand how these students leverage identity-specific strengths from their communities, known as community cultural wealth, to succeed in their academic careers. This novel, transformational EAGER proposal will explore their community cultural wealth\u2014that is, for example, how these students sustain hopes and goals, successfully navigate their majors, receive support from family-style relationships, leverage their social network, transgress expectations and resist negative stereotypes and microaggressions\u2014as a means to thrive in engineering. We will interview twenty nonbinary engineering students at various stages of their academic careers using narrative inquiry. Through this project, we aim to raise awareness of the unique assets of the nonbinary engineering community so that engineering students feel affirmed and heard, and engineering educators may design inclusive education practices and advocate on behalf of the nonbinary community in engineering. This project outcomes will result in the development of resources that can be shared to support the professional formation of nonbinary students, as well as the broader engineering student population. \r\n\r\nThe purpose of this asset-based qualitative study is to investigate how nonbinary engineering students leverage their community cultural wealth to support their wellbeing, belonging, and persistence during their professional formation. We are guided by two research questions: 1) How do nonbinary engineering students access community cultural wealth within engineering and queer communities, and 2) how do nonbinary engineering students mobilize their cultural capital to support their wellbeing, sense of belonging and persistence? We will interview 20 engineering students at various stages of their professional formation using composite narrative inquiry and critical incident technique. By interviewing students at various stages of professional formation, we will explore how capital is accrued and how different forms of capital impact students\u2019 persistence at differing stages of their identity development. Our findings will generate new knowledge about how nonbinary students draw upon their personal assets and those of the LGBTQ+ and ally communities during their professional formation. Nonbinary participants will benefit from being heard, affirmed, and seen throughout the interview process, and from reading the narratives of other nonbinary engineering students leveraging their assets to persist, belong and thrive in engineering. To reach students outside of the study, we will disseminate the composite narratives to LGBTQ+ STEM focused social media and professional organizations.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
