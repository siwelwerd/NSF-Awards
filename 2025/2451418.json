 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project lies in its ability to revolutionize biomedical research by enabling advanced fluorescence imaging of biological tissues at unprecedented depth and resolution. The technology's ability to provide precise three-dimensional imaging of molecular structures in thick tissue samples offers significant advancements in drug discovery, disease diagnostics, basic biological research, and biological education. This innovation has the potential to fill a major gap in the high-end microscopy market, providing researchers with tools that surpass the limitations of current imaging systems, fostering breakthroughs in life sciences.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop a compact, multi-color super-resolution imaging system capable of imaging thick biological tissues with nanoscale precision. The project addresses the limitations of existing imaging technologies, which are restricted in depth and resolution, by incorporating advanced features such as adaptive optics and spinning disk technology to minimize optical aberrations and scattering. The research objectives include optimizing the system for imaging up to 250 micrometers in depth with a resolution of 10\u201320 nanometers and demonstrating its capability to visualize multiple molecular targets simultaneously.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
