 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project provides three years of continuing support to the Tudor Hill Marine Atmospheric Observatory (THMAO) on the island of Bermuda. Because of its location in the western North Atlantic Ocean, Bermuda is an important location for studies of the marine atmosphere. The observatory is well equipped for carrying out research, with field laboratories and a 23-meter high sampling tower at Tudor Hill. This allows scientists to study the chemistry and physics of the atmosphere over the oceans. This part of the atmosphere plays an important role in the transfer of moisture, chemicals, and energy between the ocean and the atmosphere. Routine work at the site includes the observation and recording of weather conditions, and sampling of rain and air. Data and samples are made freely available to other users. Additional samples and data are collected for research partners, including projects funded by NSF, NOAA, NASA and other agencies. In addition to the impact on research infrastructure and a broad array of marine and atmospheric research, the project facilitates research by students and the team participates in public outreach activities.\r\n\r\nThe specific objectives for this three-year renewal project are: 1) To continue to operate and maintain a state-of-the-art marine atmospheric sampling and observing facility at Tudor Hill, Bermuda, available for use by the wider U.S. and international research community; 2) To continue the collection of continuous atmospheric data and samples, which will be archived at ASU BIOS and made freely available to other researchers; 3) To collect additional atmospheric data and samples for other investigators (primarily in longer-term time-series programs), and to provide for and support the use of the facility in person by other investigators (primarily in shorter-term intensive programs). The THMAO site will enable research to be undertaken that is central to international initiatives such as IGAC, SOLAS and GEOTRACES. In a regional context, the Tudor Hill facility will complement ongoing oceanographic time-series research in the Sargasso Sea, including Hydrostation S, the Bermuda Atlantic Time-series Station, and the Oceanic Flux Program.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
