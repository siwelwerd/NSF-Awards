 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides travel support for selected student participants of the Doctoral Consortium (DC) at the 18th International Symposium on Combinatorial Search (SoCS-2025), which will take place in University of Glasgow in Scotland, United Kingdom from August 12 to August 15, 2025. SoCS-2025 is an international conference in artificial intelligence (AI) focusing on combinatorial search methods, which are techniques to effectively explore and find the best solutions from a combinatorially large set of possibilities. \r\n\r\nThe doctoral consortium at SoCS-2025 will provide a platform for the students to present their work, receive constructive feedback, and engage in insightful discussions with their peers and established researchers. In addition, students in the doctoral consortium will also have the opportunity to attend and participate in the main technical program of SoCS-2025. This will allow the students to gain exposure and develop a deeper understanding of cutting-edge advances in the field of combinatorial search.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
