 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support student travel to the 33rd edition of the USENIX Security Conference and two co-located conferences: the 20th edition of the Symposium on Usable Privacy and Security (SOUPS), and the third USENIX Symposium on Vehicle Security and Privacy (VehicleSec), to be held in August 2025.  The USENIX Security Conference is one of the most important research conferences for professionals to present cutting edge research of fundamental importance to advancing understanding of computer systems security.  SOUPS is a leading venue for research on security and privacy topics as they relate to people, organizations, and society; VehicleSec is an emerging venue for research about theories, technologies, and systems related to security and privacy issues around vehicles, their sub-systems, supporting infrastructures, and related fundamental technologies.  Funding this travel will allow student researchers to connect to experts from across the academic, government, and industry communities to foster cross-disciplinary approaches and to address shared research challenges.\r\n\r\nThis award will provide travel support to about 33 students who who otherwise have limited travel funding and so might not be able to attend. The funding will allow students to present at the conference and receive valuable mentoring both at the conference and beyond, through an online community that supports attendees. Criteria for selection include financial need, conference participation, close alignment with conference topics, first-time attendance, and diversity of institutional, personal, and disciplinary backgrounds.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
