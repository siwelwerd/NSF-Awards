 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides participant support for the 2025, 2026, and 2027 editions of the Ohio River Analysis Meetings (ORAM), the first of which will be held on March 29-30, 2025 at the University of Cincinnati. The subsequent meetings will be held in Spring 2026 at the University of Kentucky and in Spring 2027 at the University of Cincinnati. ORAM is an annual conference in mathematical analysis organized by faculty at the University of Cincinnati and the University of Kentucky. It provides a venue for mathematicians to learn about the latest developments in the field, to disseminate their own results, and to collaborate with other researchers. ORAM supports the development of early-career researchers through speaking opportunities and travel support to attend the conference.\r\n \r\nORAM will be held for the 14th time in 2025. Each year it features a robust scientific program, with five plenary talks by distinguished mathematicians, approximately 35 contributed short talks in parallel sessions, and approximately 70 participants. The conference welcomes researchers in all areas of analysis, with a particular focus on partial differential equations, geometric analysis, and harmonic analysis. Anticipated plenary speakers for the 2025 event and additional information can be found on the conference website at https://sites.google.com/view/oram14/home.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
