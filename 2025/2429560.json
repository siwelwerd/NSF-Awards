 "awd_abstract_narration": "Furthering Scientific Endeavors Multiple Organization Regional OneOklahoma Friction Free Network (FuSE-MORe-OFFN) upgrades connections to the OneOklahoma Friction Free Network (OFFN) for Langston University and University of Central Oklahoma. FuSE-MORe-OFFN expands education and research drivers in engineering, computer science, mathematics, biology and chemistry. This project aims to inspire and empower students to develop cyberinfrastructure-based skills leading to a more diverse STEM workforce in the critical needs occupations as outlined in the Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education\u2019s Blueprint 2030 strategic plan. Both campuses have racially diverse minority student populations, including a significant number of students pursuing higher education after spending several years in the workforce and military service. FuSE-MORe-OFFN continues to evolve research partnerships and statewide cyber-infrastructure collaborations throughout Oklahoma. \r\n\r\nThe project refreshes campus Science DMZs and provides necessary internal campus network infrastructure to expand education and research driver capabilities. Campus technical personnel facilitate adoption of technology and provide access to network infrastructure, computing tools and scientific equipment. The upgrade allows both institutions to keep pace in their abilities to offer supercomputing resources to other under-resourced campuses throughout the state. The project also supports faculty and student engagement in the larger OneOklahoma CyberInfrastructure Initiative (OneOCII) group, connecting CI practitioners throughout Oklahoma. OFFN is managed by OneNet, Oklahoma\u2019s research and education network, with scientific leadership provided by the University of Oklahoma.\r\n\r\nThis project is jointly funded by the Campus Cyberinfrastructure (CC*) program, and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
