 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will contribute to the national need for well-educated scientists, mathematicians, engineers, and technicians by supporting the retention and graduation of high-achieving, low-income students with demonstrated financial need at Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi (TAMUCC), a Hispanic-serving institution in South Texas. Over its 6-year duration, this project will fund scholarships for two years to approximately 40 full-time graduate students pursuing master's degrees in chemistry, coastal and marine system sciences, and environmental sciences. Key components of the program include: 1) a multi-tiered mentoring program involving faculty, peers, and industry professionals, 2) workshops on technical skills, career preparation, and mental health, and 3) opportunities for students to develop and present research, enhancing both academic and professional success. The Science Education & Advancement Pathways in Physical and Environmental Sciences (SEA-Paths) project not only supports individual student success but also strengthens TAMUCC's role in addressing critical environmental challenges facing the region, aligning educational outcomes with local job market needs in STEM fields.\r\n\r\nThe overall goals of SEA-Paths are to increase the enrollment and retention of low-income students, boost graduation rates, and facilitate transitions to doctoral programs or employment in STEM fields. By addressing the financial, academic, and professional development needs of its students, this project seeks to elevate social mobility, broaden participation in the STEM workforce, and contribute to the economic growth of South Texas through strategic education-to-employment pathways. In addition, by fostering collaborative activities among scholars, peers, faculty, and industry mentors, the program seeks to create a thriving and inclusive STEM community in South Texas. Ultimately, the project aims to improve the quality and quantity of STEM professionals, addressing the demand for skilled workers in STEM fields within the region and beyond. Project outcomes will be shared broadly through the program website, academic publications, and conference presentations. This project is funded by NSF's Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics program, which seeks to increase the number of academically talented, low-income students with demonstrated financial need who earn degrees in STEM fields. It also aims to improve the education of future STEM workers, and to generate knowledge about academic success, retention, transfer, graduation, and academic/career pathways of low-income students.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
