 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project managed by the Chemistry Division at NSF, Professor Manar Shoshani and his students at the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley will study the activation and functionalization of N-heterocycles by heterometallic Ni-Lewis Acid complexes. Professor Shoshani and his group are focusing on the development of new complexes to access more challenging as well as more selective transformations. This project supports continued outreach with high school students from the Rio Grande Valley, an area comprising greater than 90 percent Hispanic individuals. The outreach events include setting up stations incorporating educational chemistry demonstrations led by Professor Shoshani and his group members. \r\n\r\nProfessor Shoshani and his group members aim to carry out thorough reactivity and mechanistic studies with well-defined heterometallic Ni-Al hydride complexes to develop a detailed understanding of the operating mechanism of N-heterocycle functionalization. The team\u2019s goal is to leverage the modular nature of the multimetallic hydride motifs and conduct a set of structure-function studies to identify new ways to guide and toggle selectivity, as well gain access to more reduced N-heterocyclic scaffolds. Professor Shoshani and his group are also exploring new motifs to further leverage the reactive nature of bridged hydrides between electron rich and electron poor metal centers towards further challenging cooperative transformations.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
