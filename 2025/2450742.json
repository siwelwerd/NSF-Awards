 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project proposes to convene a workshop in February 2025 at the Georgia Institute of Technology Campus in Atlanta to gather early career researchers (ECRs) with an emphasis on supporting participation from Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs) and historically underrepresented populations to create a comprehensive needs assessment for training, cyberinfrastructure, and keys for open science adoption. \r\n\r\nThe two-day workshop will be a collaboration between the South Big Data Hub (SBDH), CODATA-RDA Schools of Research Data Science (SoRDS) program, and the ScienceCore Heuristics for Open science Outcomes in Learning (SCHOOL) project (MacManus et al. 2023) of the NASA Transform to Open Science (TOPS) mission (Gentemann et al. 2021). The workshop will be hosted by SBDH in coordination with their Supporting Minority and Regional Training in Data & AI for Researchers of Tomorrow (SMART-DART) 2025 training program.\r\n\r\nThis award is jointly funded by the NSF Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure and the Directorate for Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences (SBE).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
