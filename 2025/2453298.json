 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact of this I-Corps project is the development of agricultural sensors which are capable of directly measuring plant-available nitrate at the plant root zone in real-time throughout the growing season. This ability allows real-time decisions to be made regarding fertilization rates, including using spatially and temporally varying rates. Potential target customers include corporately owned farms, soil science researchers, and fertilizer suppliers. These companies have a commercial interest in knowing the nutrient profile dynamics within soil, and the solution can help achieve real-time continuous monitoring. Optimizing fertilizer usage may provide economic benefit through reduced overall costs, particularly for corporate farming. Additionally, reductions in nitrate waste are also beneficial for the environment, allowing for more sustainable business practices.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. This solution is based on the development of electrochemical sensors which can operate in soil environments. The solution introduces a nanoporous hydrophilic membrane that serves as a selective barrier, filtering out soil particulates while allowing nitrate ions to reach the sensor surface, minimizing interference from other soil components and ensuring a more accurate and consistent nitrate concentration measurement. Additionally, the in-situ soil sensor provides real-time soil nitrate concentrations measurements, enabling immediate insights into soil nutrient levels. This capability facilitates timely and informed decisions regarding fertilizer application and land management, enhancing overall agricultural productivity and environmental quality.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
