 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of a comprehensive software tool for stormwater utility management. This innovation addresses the growing need for efficient and equitable stormwater fee implementation in municipalities across the United States. The software streamlines the process of developing rate structures, managing data, performing assessments, and aligning stormwater utility programs with management goals. By reducing the time and cost associated with establishing stormwater utilities, this tool enables local governments to more effectively fund critical infrastructure and programs. The potential impact extends to tens of millions of Americans and their associated property accounts. Furthermore, the software's versatility allows for conducting feasibility studies, implementing stormwater trading programs, and obtaining credits for best management practices. This innovation has the potential to significantly enhance environmental sustainability efforts and promote more resilient stormwater management strategies in communities nationwide. \r\n\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. This solution is based on the development of software dedicated for stormwater utility decision support and management. As municipalities face mounting regulatory pressures to upgrade stormwater infrastructure, yet traditional fee structures based on equivalent residential units lack precision in addressing stormwater challenges comprehensively. Many municipalities utilize this approach without tools that allow for accurate credit accounting or incentives for behavior change, limiting their effectiveness. There is a critical need for analytical tools that guides municipalities in implementing fee structures tied to specific service levels, improving decision-making and planning. The proposed Stormwater Utility Management System provides a groundbreaking solution, enabling municipalities to determine equitable fees, abatements, and tradable stormwater credits. This system integrates advanced methods to assess stormwater impacts based on both quantity and quality, ensuring that fees reflect the actual impact of activities on the landscape. Beyond revenue generation, the system has the potential to influence property owners, businesses, and other stakeholders to adopt practices that protect water resources and reduce flooding. By offering municipalities a precise and adaptable tool, this project supports more effective and sustainable stormwater management practices.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
