 "awd_abstract_narration": "Quantum information science and technology provides tools that can significantly impact nearly all activities in modern society. Quantum sensors currently allow the most precise measurements possible enabling new discoveries in science and engineering. Quantum computers promise to perform calculations beyond the capacity of any classical device, enabling advances in diverse fields such as medicine, chemistry, manufacturing and security. Quantum networks, which distribute fragile quantum entanglement between multiple parties, permeate the entire quantum technology environment and enable new modalities of both quantum sensing and computation, as well as novel communications capabilities that allow secure communications with no classical analog. This project is developing the Attosecond Synchronized Photonic Entanglement Network (ASPEN-Net), a scalable quantum networking platform capable of distributing entanglement at high rates and over large distances. Three separate interoperable quantum networking testbeds, located in Colorado, Illinois and Oregon, focus on delivering a quantum advantage in sensing and communications applications, while providing user access to the quantum network. To increase the quantum workforce, the project provides a range of on-ramp, training opportunities for pre-college, undergraduate, and graduate students and post-graduate training activities. Equitable access to education and workforce development activities is made possible for individuals from diverse backgrounds, including groups underrepresented in the quantum workforce.\r\n\r\nRealizing ASPEN-Net requires technical development of the key compatible network components: hardware (high-rate, high-quality single-photon sources; phase-stable all-optical quantum memories; efficient photon-counting detectors; and active, attosecond-level synchronization between network nodes), software (network management and feedback control systems), and interfaces for both physical and remote users. The project has four major areas of scientific research activities required to deliver the full network stack from hardware to control software. 1) Hardware development is focused on the co-design of the core components for the network to deliver the entanglement needs for specific applications. 2) System integration is focused on ensuring interoperability of network devices allowing for scalable and reconfigurable network architecture. 3) Network interfacing, control and error correction develops network-level control and reliability, including application programming interfaces for research and education. 4) Quantum advantage demonstrators experimentally establish enhanced performance of quantum sensing and communications tasks utilizing ASPEN-Net. \r\n\r\nThis project advances the objectives of Quantum Information Science and Engineering at NSF in response to the National Quantum Initiative Act for the continued leadership of the United States in QIS and its technology applications.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
