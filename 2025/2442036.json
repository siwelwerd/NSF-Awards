 "awd_abstract_narration": "Whirligig beetles are aquatic insects that primarily live on the water surface. They display rapid but controlled movement and sensitive perception that enables seamless navigation on and below the water surface. These abilities support critical functions such as predator avoidance, prey capture, and multi-environment propulsion. The whirligigs represent a model for autonomous systems. To translate the whirligig\u2019s movemente into robotics or related fields, the underlying fluid dynamics must first be understood. The findings of this proposal could lead to the development of miniature autonomous vehicles and robots functioning in multiple environments, with implications for search and rescue missions, precision agriculture, and national defense. Moreover, the integrated education and outreach plan aims to highlight the hidden beauty of water surface flows, revealed by whirligigs and other biological organisms, to undergraduate and K-12 classrooms. Through the development of affordable, student-safe, and environmentally friendly fluid dynamics tools, students will gain hands-on experience. This engagement will allow them to create and observe natural flow, anchoring fluid mechanics concepts to reality and inspiring future fluid dynamists.\r\n\r\nThe primary research objectives are to experimentally investigate the fluid dynamics behind the whirligig beetle\u2019s propulsion on the water surface and underwater, its diving (i.e., transitioning from water surface to underwater), and its food particle detection using surface ripples. Aim 1 will investigate the differences in the beetle\u2019s propulsion between at the water surface and in deep water and sources of resistance to their diving, and how they overcome them. Aim 2 will study the fluid dynamics governing the beetle's use of water surface ripples to detect food particles on the water surface. The proposed project will provide insights into how surface tension and other hydrodynamic forces interact to achieve propulsion and communication/perception on water surfaces. Aim 3 will support education and outreach goals by designing and implementing accessible fluid dynamics experimental tools for undergraduate courses and K-12 outreach. Aim 4 will further extend the impact of these tools through dissemination at outreach events and professional conferences.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
