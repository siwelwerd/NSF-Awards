 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the creation of a new REU site at Marshall University focused on data science. Over a summer session, 30 undergraduate students from diverse backgrounds\u2014including first-generation, female, and underrepresented minority students and those from economically disadvantaged Appalachian regions\u2014will engage in transformative research experiences. This program addresses the growing demand for skilled data scientists in the U.S. workforce by providing practical experience in data analytics (visual, descriptive, and predictive), equipping participants with the skills needed to succeed academically and professionally. The project contributes to national interests by creating a more diverse and inclusive data science workforce, increasing educational opportunities for students from low-income institutions, and supporting the professional development of young researchers in STEM fields.\r\n\r\nThis three-year REU site at Marshall University will explore various data analytics topics, including cybersecurity, Internet of Things (IOT), social media analytics, and large-scale data center performance analysis. The project objectives are to (1) enhance diversity in STEM by encouraging women, underrepresented minorities, veterans, and first-generation students to pursue degrees and careers in Data Science; (2) train participants in analytic methods, linking classroom knowledge to real-world applications; (3) cultivate participants' research creativity; and (4) provide comprehensive mentoring workshops and professional training to support student success. This project will significantly advance data science research and education, particularly in underrepresented areas, serving as a model for integrating research and education to support national workforce development goals.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
