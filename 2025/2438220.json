 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the 58th annual Spring Topology and Dynamics Conference (STDC) to be held on the campus of Christopher Newport University in Newport News, Virginia, March 6-8, 2025. The conference encourages participation  from a wide range of mathematicians at all career stages and from a variety of backgrounds. In support of this goal of inclusivity, the conference is be available to both in-person and virtual participation. As a result, the 58th STDC will assemble a diverse group of mathematicians to disseminate results and build connections that will lead to future collaboration. Conference funds will be used to support graduate students, early career mathematicians, and those without sufficient institutional support.\r\n\r\nThe 58th STDC will be the latest in a conference series that began in 1967, and it will continue the conference's tradition of bringing together researchers from various active research areas within topology. This year's conference will include sessions in continuum theory, dynamical systems, geometric topology, geometric group theory, set-theoretic topology, and applied topology. The inclusion of applied topology is a new addition for this year's conference and is intended both to appeal to regular STDC participants while also attracting new mathematicians to the conference. More information can be found at https://cnu.edu/stdc/.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
