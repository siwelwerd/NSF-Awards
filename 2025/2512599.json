 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this project is to develop the technical program for the 2025 National Science Foundation (NSF) Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) Principal Investigator (PI) Meeting. This meeting convenes all PIs of the NSF CPS Program for the 14th time since the program began. The PI Meeting is to take place during the spring of 2025 in Nashville, TN. The PI meeting is an annual opportunity for NSF-sponsored CPS researchers, industry representatives, and Federal agency representatives to gather and review new CPS developments, identify new and emerging applications, and to discuss technology gaps and barriers. The program agenda will include a set of mini-workshops, panels, keynotes, project presentations, and poster sessions.  Panels will include CPS in the age of AI, CPS and Digital Twins, CPS and EPSCoR \u2013 approaches for building capacity and collaborations.  \r\n\r\nThe annual PI Meeting serves as the only opportunity where the NSF-funded CPS Principal Investigators meet to share their research, discuss new research opportunities and challenges, and explore new ideas and partnerships for future work. Furthermore, the PI meeting is also an opportunity for the academic research community to interact with industry entities and government agencies with vested interest in CPS research and development.  Special effort will be made to encourage additional Government and Industry participation. The PI Meeting is a forum for sharing ideas across the CPS community. It has played a major role in growing the community across a broad range of sectors and technologies, and performing outreach to others who have interest in learning about the program and participating as future proposers, transition partners, or sponsors. This proposal develops the technical program for the meeting which includes a variety of panels and  workshops covering  emerging topics of interest to the CPS research community in addition to presentations and poster sessions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
