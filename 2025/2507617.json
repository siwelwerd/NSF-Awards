 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial impacts of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project are in developing a new computer program that will enhance the design and optimization of photonic devices used in quantum technology. Photonic devices in quantum technology use light to process and transfer information in advanced ways. This innovation addresses a major gap in the ability to model and design optical processes which are essential for secure quantum communications, sensing, and computing. Existing computer programs cannot capture the complexity of quantum photonic interactions, leading to slow and expensive designs. By introducing a faster and more accurate modeling approach, this project will help accelerate the development of next-generation quantum technologies, reducing both the cost and time required for device design. The commercialization strategy is focused on offering a free version with basic functionality and premium versions with the newly developed capabilities. The proposed technology will provide a durable competitive advantage and large commercial potential through patent protection. Beyond commercial applications, this project will support workforce development and contribute to research and development, aligning with US leadership goals in AI computing.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project focuses on the development of a nonlinear eigenmode expansion simulation tool for modeling nonlinear optical interactions in complex waveguide structures. Current modeling approaches, such as finite-difference time-domain, are computationally expensive and struggle to accurately model key nonlinear optical processes like second harmonic generation and spontaneous parametric down-conversion. The proposed nonlinear eigenmode expansion method aims to overcome these limitations by integrating nonlinear and quantum-specific calculations into an eigenmode expansion framework, using a semi-classical framework. The project will develop and validate a robust simulation tool that significantly reduces computational time while maintaining high accuracy. Research efforts will include implementing core algorithms for modeling nonlinear interactions, extending these methods to quantum-specific processes, and benchmarking the tool against both experimental data and traditional simulation methods. This project will result in a commercially available simulation tool that accelerates research and development in the quantum photonics industry, enabling the design of more efficient and scalable quantum devices.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
