 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact of this I-Corps project is the development of advanced smart clothing technology that offers integrated physiological monitoring for athletes and sports professionals. This innovation addresses critical gaps in current monitoring systems by combining multiple sensing capabilities within custom wearable garments. The technology continuously tracks various vital signs including heart rate, respiration, and other physiological parameters, providing actionable insights for optimizing performance and reducing risk of injury. With significant commercial potential in the expanding sports technology market, this solution supports data-driven training regimens that could reduce injuries and improve recovery strategies. Beyond athletics, the smart monitoring system holds promise for applications in other fields requiring endurance tracking, potentially benefiting occupational health and wellness. \r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. This solution is based on the development of novel textile-based sensors, which include specialized dry electrodes and modular electronics embedded in everyday clothing. The technology builds upon established biomedical research and recent advances in smart textile engineering. A key innovation is a body scanning method that ensures custom fitting for sensor placement and user comfort, enhancing both data accuracy and the overall user experience.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
