 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 10th Lake Michigan Workshop on Combinatorics and Graph Theory will be held at the University of Illinois Chicago on April 5\u20136, 2025. The workshop will benefit graduate students and junior researchers in multiple subfields of discrete mathematics, working at institutions in the Great Lakes area and beyond. It is built around two sets of three tutorial lectures, focusing on state-of-the-art techniques and results on which the speakers are particularly qualified to expound. There will also be short talks by students and early-career researchers. There will be ample unscheduled time during the weekend, allowing new research collaborations to commence and active collaborations to be continued. Junior participants will establish valuable connections with more senior colleagues and receive guidance from them in a relaxed and informal environment.\r\n\r\nCombinatorics and graph theory are two very active areas of research within the broader field of discrete mathematics, with important ties to disciplines such as statistical physics, probability theory, and computer science. In the immediate vicinity of Lake Michigan there are a large number of researchers and students working on a variety of graph theoretical and combinatorial problems. This workshop will bring many of these scholars together. Through the tutorial lectures, short talks, and informal collaboration time, the workshop will train early-career researchers in important and emerging techniques of combinatorics and graph theory. The tutorial speakers for the 2024 workshop are confirmed to be Rose McCarty (Georgia Institute of Technology), Greta Panova (University of Southern California), and Mehtaab Sawhney (Columbia University). The PIs have selected tutorial speakers with the explicit goal of representing disparate subfields of combinatorics and graph theory, with McCarty as an expert in structural graph theory, Panova an expert in algebraic combinatorics, and Sawhney an expert in additive, extremal, and probabilistic combinatorics. The website for the workshop is https://marcusmichelen.org/LakeMichiganWorkshop2025.php\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
