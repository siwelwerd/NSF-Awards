 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader/commercial impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project lies in addressing the critical need for effective, accessible tools to enhance cognitive performance. Cognitive abilities like memory, decision-making, and processing speed are fundamental to success in education, athletics, healthcare, and high-pressure professions such as law enforcement. This project will leverage virtual reality (VR) technology to create an immersive platform that combines cognitive assessment and training to address these needs. The innovation provides a scalable solution that enables users to identify their cognitive strengths and weaknesses while participating in engaging activities that improve cognitive performance. By initially targeting the athletic market, the project will help athletes enhance reaction times and decision-making skills while reducing injuries. The long-term vision includes expanding into markets such as education and cognitive rehabilitation, potentially benefiting millions by improving learning outcomes and supporting recovery from brain injuries. This platform also advances scientific understanding by applying validated sensory-perceptual training techniques to real-world cognitive challenges. Within three years of implementation, this technology is projected to impact thousands of users and establish a sustainable model for commercialization, with the potential to improve the quality of life and productivity across multiple sectors.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project aims to develop and validate a virtual reality-based platform that integrates cognitive assessment and enhancement through perceptual training. The project addresses the need for scalable, scientifically validated tools to improve cognitive performance across domains. Research indicates that training specific sensory-perceptual abilities, such as reaction time and auditory processing, can enhance broader cognitive functions like memory and decision-making. This project aims to utilize perceptual training tasks to improve cognition through a proposed virtual reality (VR) platform with embedded multi-modal VR tasks targeting specific perceptual tasks known to improve cognitive capacity. The research objectives include developing reliable VR-based measurement tools, designing engaging training modules, which demonstrate measurable cognitive gains in athletic performance through iterative development, user testing, and statistical analysis to ensure the platform\u2019s effectiveness and scalability. Anticipated results include improved perceptual accuracy and reaction time, with significant cognitive gains and the project has the potential to redefine cognitive training by integrating cutting-edge VR technology with rigorous scientific principles, providing a novel solution for enhancing cognitive performance in real-world settings.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
