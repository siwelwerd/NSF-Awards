 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact of this I-Corps project is based on the development of catalysts and electrochemical reactors to convert nitrogen feedstocks into nitrogenous fertilizers, which are valuable commodities. Current production methods utilize the Haber-Bosch process, which requires extreme pressures and temperatures, consuming approximately 2% of the world\u2019s energy supply and emitting nearly 2% of total greenhouse gas emissions globally. This innovative production method could reduce energy input by 30%, lower carbon intensity by more than 90%, and decrease the cost of production by at least 40% compared to the baseline technology. This process could provide end-users such as farmers, meatpacking plants, and wastewater treatment facilities with an on-site production method for cheaper, more efficient, and more sustainable fertilizer production.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. The solution is based on the development of catalysts and electrochemical reactors that convert nitrogen feedstocks into nitrogenous fertilizers, which are valuable commodities. This technology can potentially generate ammonia fertilizer with an energy input 25-40% below the energy input of the state-of-the-art process (i.e., Haber-Bosch Process) with zero carbon dioxide emissions. This technology utilizes state-of-the-art single-atom catalysts (SACs) and nanoparticles to directly generate nitrogenous fertilizers from abundant nitrogen sources. The technology develops materials and systems that are affordable and energy-efficient compared to traditional fossil fuel-based methods. By focusing on electrifying and reducing emissions in nitrogen fertilizer production, the technology can later be fully adopted for industrial use. This approach will help lower carbon emissions and energy use in the chemical industry.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
