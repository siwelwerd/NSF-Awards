 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of a software for the optimal design and operation of data center cooling system to reduce energy consumption. The proposed solution offers a path towards dramatically reduced energy consumption in data centers, a sector known for its high electricity demands, primarily due to cooling needs. Data centers in the U.S. use about 2% of the nation's electricity, with half of that for cooling. The global data center cooling market is projected to grow from $14.85 billion in 2022 to $30.31 billion by 2030. With its proven ability to achieve up to 70% energy savings, the proposed software addresses a critical need for more efficient and sustainable operations in data centers, which are increasingly vital to the global digital infrastructure. This leap in efficiency not only lowers operational costs but also significantly reduces the carbon footprint of data centers, aligning with global efforts to combat climate change. The widespread applicability ensures that it can contribute to energy savings and sustainability goals across the industry spectrum, from small-scale operations to mega data centers.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. This solution is based on the development of software for data center cooling design and operation using equation-based complex systems modeling language. The system will offer a streamlined workflow with user-friendly interfaces, automated modeling, and optimization processes powered by a comprehensive library of predefined system templates. The proposed technology will ensure automatic adherence to data center energy standards to bridge the gap in energy code compliance. The solution integrates an optimization engine with machine learning to automatically determine the optimal control settings based on outdoor weather conditions and data center IT load, reducing cooling energy consumption while maintaining system reliability. Additionally, its fault detection capabilities identify various equipment and system faults, even non-critical and subtle ones, helping to save energy, extend equipment lifespan, and prevent catastrophic events.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
