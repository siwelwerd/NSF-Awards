 "awd_abstract_narration": "A major environmental challenge of the 21st century is the spread of invasive plants - aggressive non-native species that disrupt native ecosystems. Invasive plants threaten biodiversity by outcompeting native species, disrupting plant-pollinator interactions, and degrading soil conditions, resulting in over $3 billion in annual economic damages in the United States. This project addresses a critical question in ecology: why do some non-native plants become invasive while others do not? Understanding the traits that promote invasiveness is essential for predicting and mitigating the impacts of invasive species on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. The findings from this research will inform conservation strategies, enabling practitioners to identify and manage high-risk invasive species and protect vulnerable ecosystems. Beyond its scientific contributions, this project will foster the development of a skilled scientific workforce through the mentorship of high school, undergraduate, and graduate students, independent research opportunities, summer educational programs, and a community-oriented ornamental garden initiative.\r\n\r\nThis research investigates the mechanisms driving plant invasions by examining how aboveground and belowground traits contribute to invasiveness and influence soil communities and ecosystem processes. Specifically, the study will explore the interplay between analogous traits - such as specific leaf area and specific root length, and leaf nitrogen and root nitrogen content - to understand their role in invasions. The project integrates field experiments and modeling to (1) identify plant traits that drive invasions under varying disturbance and resource conditions, (2) evaluate their effects on soil food webs, and (3) investigate how plant traits interact with soil communities to influence nutrient cycling. By comparing invasive plants with closely related native and non-invasive exotic species, this research will advance our understanding of plant-soil interactions in invasion ecology and generate actionable knowledge for managing invasive species. The outcomes will bridge gaps in ecological theory while offering practical tools to address the ecological and economic challenges posed by invasive plants.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
