 "awd_abstract_narration": "This I-Corps project focuses on the development of a new on-site treatment technology using high frequency ultrasound to mineralize waste streams containing per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). PFAS are a large and complex class of man-made compounds. Due to their persistence and potential toxicity to human and ecological receptors, PFAS have generated a strong public and regulatory response to their ubiquitous environmental presence. The need for the remediation of PFAS is growing due to societal and regulatory awareness in the wake of rapidly evolving toxicology research on this class of contaminants. This technology has the potential to impact various industries dealing with hazardous waste management, particularly in addressing the ongoing environmental and health threats posed by PFAS contamination. \r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. This technology is based on the development of an innovative approach for decomposing persistent PFAS compounds using a combination of ultrasound and Argon nanobubbles. PFAS are a group of chemicals resistant to conventional degradation methods due to their strong carbon-fluorine bonds. Traditional methods such as incineration have proven inefficient, costly, and harmful to the environment. This novel solution exploits the synergistic effects of continuous Argon nanobubbles and ultrasound waves to disintegrate PFAS into benign byproducts such as fluoride ions and carbon dioxide. Preliminary experiments have shown significant improvements in PFAS degradation efficiency when compared to conventional methods, achieving enhanced destruction while lowering costs, and minimizing harmful emissions. The system is designed to be scalable for industrial use, offering a commercially viable and environmentally sustainable solution for PFAS contaminated water treatment.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
