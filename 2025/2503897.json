 "awd_abstract_narration": "This I-Corps project focuses on a wound healing product utilizing a hyperactive protein. Chronic wounds represent a significant public health challenge, affecting millions of people and incurring substantial economic costs due to prolonged treatment and complications. This product addresses a healthcare need by enhancing the effectiveness of chronic wound treatments, potentially reducing the duration and complexity of the required care. This solution could alleviate some of the burden on healthcare systems and improve the quality of life for patients suffering from chronic wounds, which are often painful and debilitating. The anticipated reduction in healing times and associated complications could lead to cost savings for healthcare providers. This innovation aligns with current trends in precision medicine and targeted therapies. \r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. This solution is based on the development of superoxide dismutase proteins to address chronic wounds. Chronic wounds often result from excessive reactive oxygen species that hinder the healing process. By engineering hyperactive proteins, the technology reduces the level of reactive oxygen species, mitigates oxidative stress, and promotes efficient tissue repair. The technology focuses on addressing limitations associated with protein therapeutics, for example enhanced stability and enzymatic activity for prolonged shelf-life and efficacy under physiological conditions. The technology involves rational design and molecular dynamic simulations to identify key mutations that enhance both the catalytic efficiency and structural integrity of the enzyme. This methodology provides a robust platform for the development of therapeutics aimed at reducing oxidative damage in various pathological conditions. The technology could also have applications in the management of other conditions where oxidative stress plays a key role, thereby expanding its therapeutic applications beyond wound care.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
