 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact of this I-Corps project is based on the development of a wearable, wireless temperature sensor designed for laboratory animals, aiming to improve temperature monitoring in biomedical research and clinical applications. By providing a non-invasive, continuous, and stress-free method for monitoring body temperature, this device enhances animal welfare and improves the quality of research data. Accurate and reliable temperature data from laboratory animals leads to better results in drug testing and biomedical studies, ultimately accelerating the development of effective therapies and medical interventions. By minimizing physiological alterations caused by invasive methods or sedation, the sensor ensures that outcomes are more reflective of true biological responses. The device's wireless charging capability increases operational efficiency and reduces maintenance costs. Beyond animal research, the technology holds potential for human healthcare applications, such as non-invasive patient monitoring in intensive care units. The broader commercial potential includes advancing biomedical research practices, improving the drug development process, enhancing patient care, and setting new standards for temperature monitoring technologies across various industries.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. The solution is based on the prior development of a wearable, wireless temperature sensor utilizing advanced microfabrication techniques and Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) technology. MEMS thermocouples leverage micromachining techniques to produce very small-scale thermocouples for precise and continuous temperature monitoring. The sensor features a minimally invasive microneedle design, enabling rapid and accurate detection of temperature changes in biological environments. This innovation addresses critical gaps in existing temperature monitoring methods by providing a non-invasive, continuous monitoring solution that preserves the physiological integrity of subjects. By improving the accuracy and reliability of physiological data from laboratory animals, the technology enhances the validity of experimental results, particularly in drug testing and biomedical research, thereby advancing scientific understanding and supporting the development of new therapies.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
