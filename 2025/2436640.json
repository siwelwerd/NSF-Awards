 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact of this I-Corps project lies in the development of a camera-based, non-contact, vibration measurement tool that can replace conventional measurement systems. This technology has the potential to improve the measurement of vibrations in rotating structures and objects with complex geometries, while also reducing costs. The outcomes of this project could advance knowledge and provide both industry and academia with testing tools that enhance the understanding of materials, mechanical systems, and biological systems. This advance will help industries adopt new technologies and improve product quality, benefiting sectors such as automotive manufacturing, wind turbines, and other industries by reducing measurement time and capturing the full-field dynamics of vibrating structures.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project leverages experiential learning and direct investigation of the industry ecosystem to evaluate the translation potential of the new technology. The technology builds upon the development of a non-contact testing tool utilizing a camera technology that provides comprehensive information about structural vibrations. This data is used to understand fundamental physics, monitor structures, and validate or update analytical models, facilitating the creation of digital twins for mechanical systems. Unlike conventional methods, the technology extracts operating shapes in the frequency domain rather than the time domain, allowing the integration of dynamic response views recorded at different times. This technology enables robust in-situ measurements of any vibrating system, including those with complex geometries. Conventional techniques, such as accelerometers, offer measurements only at a few discrete locations, require wiring, and add weight or mass to the structure. In contrast, the new technique is wireless, can be applied to rotating structures (e.g., stitching views of rotating tires), and can be easily integrated into existing systems.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
