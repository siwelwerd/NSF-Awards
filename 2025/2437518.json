 "awd_abstract_narration": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools have the potential to transform and accelerate scientific research and communication. However, realizing that potential in emerging research institutions will often require institutions to invest in the administrative and technical infrastructure, staffing and capacity, required to implement these tools at scale. Many institutions already face structural and resource barriers that hamper their ability to compete for federal and private research funding to grow their research capacity, and the expense of building an AI-supported research infrastructure could exacerbate these barriers. This project will develop the understanding necessary to facilitate the establishment of regional hubs for collaboration on issues related to the implementation of AI in research and research administration. \r\n\r\nTo achieve these goals, Ithaka S+R, in collaboration with co-PIs at two Emerging Research Institutions (ERIs), Montclair State University and Chapman University, will convene administrators and research support staff from universities in two regions (in New Jersey and California) to identify and prioritize opportunities and avenues for: a) co-funding software and computing infrastructure, including the possibility of sharing development costs to support engineering and maintenance of AI tools to aid in research administration; b) collaborative professional development opportunities for researchers, research administrators, and librarians or other support providers, as well as possible models for shared staffing and services; c) development of research incubation hubs. Ithaka S+R will publish findings and actionable recommendations for research administrators at ERIs, funders, and other stakeholder communities. The project will seed collaboration in the regional hubs and provide models for communities of practice designed to plan and troubleshoot the expansion of research capacity and competitiveness at regional ERIs,\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
