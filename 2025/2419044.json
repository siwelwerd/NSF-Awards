 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is submitted to request funding for the Research Vessel Thomas G. Thompson, operated by the University of Washington (UW) and owned by the Office of Naval Research.  The proposal requests funds to  conduct oceanographic research missions supported by the National Science Foundation in Calendar Year 2025 through 2028. The intellectual and technical merits of the science proposals have been competitively reviewed by panels to award the funding for the scientific research. In addition, each of the NSF-funded seagoing science proposals had an associated shiptime and marine equipment (SME) request associated with the project. Therefore, if the science proposal - which required data collection at sea - was found to have technical and intellectual merit, then the associated shiptime to collect the data has equal merit. The UW School of Oceanography \u2013 Marine Operations takes great pride in providing essential marine science research and educational facilities to\r\nNSF-funded investigators and academic faculty. The UW remains committed to managing these facilities in a safe, cost-effective, and environmentally responsible manner.\r\n\r\nThe oceanographic research vessels of the Academic Research Fleet (ARF), operated by the academic\r\ninstitutions within the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) framework,\r\nfunded by NSF and other agencies, have been the traditional multi-use facilities required to expand\r\nhuman knowledge of the ocean environment. These ships working from the ocean surface are\r\ncomplemented by human-occupied, remotely operated, and autonomous undersea vehicles (HOV, ROV,\r\nAUV) and sensors provide vital tools in our understanding of the role of the oceans in determining our\r\nclimate and studying and accessing the living and non-living resources of the world\u2019s seas and\r\nseabeds.\r\n\r\nProper stewardship of ocean resources and their wise use, and data-driven decision making for future\r\nocean- and coastal-related issues are not possible without an interested and engaged scientific\r\ncommunity and well-informed public. So, periodically, UW holds open houses and outreach events to\r\nprovide a learning experience for local students and the public including tours through the ship\r\nfacilities and hands-on demonstrations of marine science research guided by faculty, students and ship\r\ncrew members. In 2018, the UW School of Oceanography teamed with scientists from Everett\r\nCommunity College to take students out for ORCA cruise on Earth Day on the Rachel Carson.\r\nAnnually, around 200 people tour R/V Rachel Carson each May as part of the UW Aquatic Sciences\r\nOpen House.\r\n\r\nIn addition to technology, our national ocean endeavor requires a diverse cadre of trained researchers\r\npossessing sound science, mathematics, and technical education: a critical mass of individuals are\r\nrequired who will collect and analyze data, as well as design the tools, models and applications. These\r\nseagoing research and educational facilities enable scientists and students from UW and other\r\ninstitutions nationwide to study natural phenomena and to instruct the future scientists and stewards of\r\nour marine ecosystems while on board state-of-the-art oceanographic research vessels utilizing\r\nhigh-quality instrumentation. Essential to our mission is providing post-secondary educational opportunities for students of the marine sciences by introducing them to seagoing research, collecting\r\ndata for student developed research projects, and having them participate in other funded research;\r\nthese include programs like UW undergraduate courses (OCN 443), MATE internships, and the\r\nVISIONS outreach component of the Ocean Observatories Initiative (OOI-RCA). In addition,\r\neducation of K through 12th grade students nationwide - through outreach programs such as REVEL,\r\nNOAA\u2019s \u201cTeacher at Sea\u201d, and the NSF-funded Geosciences - Earth, Ocean, Polar and Atmospheric\r\nSciences (GEOPAths) are supported on the vessels of the Academic Research Fleet. Finally, there are\r\nadditional outreach programs, such as the NSF-funded STEMSEAS, UW GEODUC, and the\r\nONR-supported DINO-SIP program which specifically use the UW research ships to provide\r\neducational opportunities for non-traditional STEM students; these programs are discussed further in\r\nthe Broadening Participation section of the Supplemental Documentation.\r\nThe University of Washington, with the support of the National Science Foundation and with\r\ncoordination by the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System, remains dedicated to, and\r\nfocused on, furthering our understanding of the world ocean, the living and non-living resources\r\ntherein, and their interactions with the approximately fifty percent of our citizens who live within fifty\r\nmiles of the shoreline.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
