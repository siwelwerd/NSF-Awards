 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research goal of this project is to advance the development of a new kind of computer memory device using tiny magnetic molecules that have the potential to hold information in ways that go beyond current standard technology. Placing these molecules between two magnetic layers enables control of electron movement, leading to more efficient data storage and enabling the development of smaller, faster, and more energy-saving memory devices for everything ranging from personal electronics to large-scale computer devices. Additionally, in line with the mission of the CREST Postdoctoral Research Program, the project will promote the professional growth of the postdoctoral scholar leading the research and provide opportunities to engage students in cutting-edge nanotechnology studies, developing their STEM skills and exposing them to STEM career opportunities.\r\n\r\nThis project focuses on covalently attaching paramagnetic porphyrin molecules between two ferromagnetic electrodes in a prefabricated magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ). The MTJ-based molecular spintronics device (MTJMSD) design will exploit the quantum spin states of the porphyrin core to demonstrate novel spin-dependent transport phenomena. By integrating low spin-scattering alkane tethers and thiol linkers, the porphyrin molecule\u2019s magnetic properties can be finely tuned to create multiple resistance states. The proposed methods involve synthesizing custom-designed porphyrin molecules, microfabricating MTJs with exposed sides, and then characterizing their electronic and magnetic behaviors under various external conditions. This research will reveal new ways to manipulate molecular spin states for device switching, potentially paving the way for three-state memory and logic applications that exceed the performance of conventional binary spintronic devices.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
