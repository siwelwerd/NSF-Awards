 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to revolutionize live-cell imaging by harnessing the power of nanodiamond quantum sensing and advanced microscopy. By developing nanodiamond quantum sensors with exceptional sensitivity, this project will study intricacies of life processes with unprecedented detail. This research aligns with NSF's mission to promote the progress of science and serves the national interest by advancing the understanding of fundamental biological mechanisms. While traditional fluorescence microscopy provides valuable insights into cell structures and functions, nanodiamond quantum sensors with ultra-high sensitivity to local electromagnetic fields offer a new dimension to see through live cells and reveal the underlying physical mechanisms of life processes. By integrating nanodiamond quantum sensors with advanced imaging techniques, this project will capture four-dimensional (4D) information, encompassing three-dimensional spatial data and an additional temporal dimension. This has wide-ranging implications, from enhancing cancer immunotherapy through the monitoring of T cell activity to unraveling the mysteries of membrane potentials in cardiac and neuronal cells. Furthermore, this project extends beyond scientific discoveries. It encompasses comprehensive educational and outreach programs, with a particular focus on fostering diversity in STEM fields. By engaging underrepresented minorities in quantum-related studies, this team aims to create a vibrant and inclusive community of quantum scientists and engineers. This project not only supports education but also benefits society at large, offering new avenues for biomedical research and applications.\r\n\r\nThe research will involve the fabrication of scalable nanodiamond sensors with biocompatible interfaces, uniform sizes and shapes, controlled color center densities, and minimal impurities. By integrating optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) spectroscopy of nanodiamond quantum sensors with light-sheet microscopy (LSM), this team will achieve high spatiotemporal resolution and low phototoxicity, enabling precise imaging of live cells. The technical approach includes the utilization of machine learning algorithms and image processing techniques to analyze the acquired data and extract valuable insights into the dynamics of live cells. Particularly, this team will apply the developed ODMR-LSM quantum sensing imaging technology to study T cell activity in cancer immunotherapy and measure membrane electrical potential. The synergy between nanodiamond quantum sensing and advanced imaging techniques will deepen the understanding of complex biological processes. The proposed nanodiamond quantum sensing system, with the ability for correlating the ODMR spectroscopy and the spatiotemporal imaging of LSM, allows for revealing 4D live-cell dynamics which have not been studied before. This project will bridge the gap between fundamental quantum science and applied bioengineering and bring quantum sensing into rich applications in biomedical fields.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
