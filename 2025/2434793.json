 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Improving Undergraduate STEM Education: Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSI Program), this Educational Instrumentation (EI) track aims to provide instrumentation necessary to successfully implement Course-based Undergraduate Research Experiences (CUREs) within the Organic II laboratories at the University of Dallas. Traditional undergraduate summer research experiences have a profound impact on students, often leading to higher retention rates, increased interest in STEM careers, greater motivation to pursue a Ph.D., and a stronger sense of scientific identity. These effects are particularly valuable for students underrepresented in the sciences, as these experiences can significantly boost scientific self-confidence and identity. However, most summer research programs are competitive and require a strong application, limiting access for many students. Additionally, students must first be aware of these opportunities and have an initial interest in scientific research to consider applying, which narrows the applicant pool. This project aims to provide research experience within a required laboratory course and to measure if the benefits seen in traditional research experiences can also be achieved through course-based undergraduate research.\r\n\r\nSupport will provide the essential instrumentation and equipment needed to create a meaningful research experience within the constraints of a once-weekly laboratory period. Specifically, this funding will enable the acquisition of a benchtop NMR, NMR autosampler, FTIR system, and rotary evaporator. These instruments will alleviate significant bottlenecks in data collection, identified during a Fall 2023 pilot CURE, that limit students' engagement with research\u2014especially for those students with limited availability outside scheduled lab hours. The project will evaluate whether accessible research experiences through CUREs provide the same benefits as traditional undergraduate summer research experiences by fostering a stronger scientific identity and increasing motivation to pursue further studies and STEM careers. Outcomes will be assessed through an IRB-approved survey adapted from the Undergraduate Research Student Self-Assessment (URSSA), measuring gains in scientific confidence, analytical skills, and career orientation. Additionally, selected exam questions will evaluate student achievement of learning objectives related to spectroscopic analysis. The HSI Program aims to enhance undergraduate STEM education and build capacity at HSIs. Projects supported by the HSI Program will also generate new knowledge on how to achieve these aims.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
