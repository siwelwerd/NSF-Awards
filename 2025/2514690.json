 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports participants of the conference \"Groups, Logic, and Computation: Interactions between Group Theory, Model Theory, and Computer Science (GAGTA 2025)\" which will take place at the Stevens Institute of Technology (New Jersey), June 9--13, 2025. The event will bring together researchers from various branches of group theory, model theory, and computer science to explore open questions in the field, now being approached from fresh and promising perspectives. It will also strengthen the discipline's connections to other branches of mathematics. Through this exchange of ideas among experts, students, and postdoctoral researchers, the conference aims to disseminate current knowledge and identify promising directions for future research.\r\n\r\nThe conference will focus on recent developments in group theory, emphasizing groups and group actions, as well as their applications across various areas of mathematics where they serve as fundamental tools. The program will cover multiple branches of modern group theory with a particular focus on geometric, asymptotic, and combinatorial group theory, dynamics of group actions, probabilistic and analytic methods, first-order rigidity and classification, and Diophantine problems in groups and rings. Additionally, the conference will explore emerging AI connections, with dedicated sessions examining how group theory can further impact machine learning, formal verification, and symbolic computation and how AI methods may contribute to advances in group-theoretic research. This interdisciplinary exchange aims to foster collaboration and open new directions in both mathematics and AI. More information can be found at https://web.stevens.edu/algebraic/Stevens2025/\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
