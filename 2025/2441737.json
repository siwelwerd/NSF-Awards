 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program in the Division of Chemistry, Professor Borotto's group at the University of Nevada, Reno seeks to characterize the processes driving gas-phase protein folding. This will be accomplished through the development of a laser-based technique that will enable the assessment of fast folding pathways. Better understanding of these processes will improve the capabilities to rapidly assess the solution phase conformation of proteins. As part of this project, Dr. Borotto will partner with local tribal secondary education institutions to better recruit Native American students into science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) majors.\r\n\r\nNative mass spectrometry (MS) has shown promise at rapidly assessing the solution-phase conformation of proteins but a thorough understanding of how the structure of protein ions is altered upon entering the gas phase is critical to differentiate the valuable solution phase conformational information from artifacts created during the gas phase measurement. In this work, the Borotto Lab aims to characterize the mechanisms behind gas-phase protein folding. This will be accomplished through the design and development of novel laser-driven activation techniques that will enable the assessment of rapid folding pathways. Additionally, this proposal seeks to increase the involvement of Native Americans in STEM disciplines. To accomplish this goal, Dr. Borotto will partner with the local tribal secondary education institution and demonstrate cutting edge MS-based culturally relevant experiments to inspire increased recruitment to STEM-based degrees and offer undergraduate research opportunities to improve retention of these students.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
