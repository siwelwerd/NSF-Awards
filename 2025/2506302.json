 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports travel for graduate students and researchers, mainly early career researchers, to attend the inaugural Southern Regional Harmonic Analysis Conference, scheduled for November 1 and 2, 2025, at Louisiana State University (LSU) in Baton Rouge, LA. Harmonic analysis is a foundational area of mathematics with applications spanning number theory, partial differential equations, and signal processing. This conference aims to build on the growing momentum of harmonic analysis research in the South. By bringing together mathematicians from across the region and at all career stages, the conference will promote research, education, and collaboration, thereby advancing the progress of science and enhancing educational opportunities in the Southern region. The conference will foster collaboration and communication among researchers in the Southern United States and to provide graduate students and early-career researchers with exposure to cutting-edge developments in harmonic analysis and related areas.\r\n\r\nThe Southern Regional Harmonic Analysis Conference will focus on current research in harmonic analysis and its applications. Topics include discrete harmonic analysis, harmonic analysis on Lie groups and homogeneous spaces, improving and sparse bounds, oscillatory integrals, geometric measure theory, and related problems in operator theory and PDEs. The conference will include four plenary talks by leading mathematicians and nine contributed talks by junior researchers. Participants will have opportunities for discussions and networking during breaks and at a planned conference lunch. By facilitating engagement among researchers and students in the Southern region, this conference is expected to strengthen the regional harmonic analysis community, inspire new collaborations, and provide a platform for emerging researchers to present their work.\r\n\r\nFor additional information, visit the conference website https://www.math.lsu.edu/~ha2025/\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
