 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Symposium on the Theory of Computing (STOC) is one of the premier annual research conferences that cover the breadth of theoretical computer science. It is a conference of very long standing that has continued to play a formative role in the field; it is also at the leading edge of addressing algorithmic challenges. This project aims to increase the impact of this conference on students and postdoctoral researchers by encouraging and enabling their participation, especially in cases where travel expenses and conference fees would otherwise preclude their attendance.\r\n\r\nConcretely, this project assists US-based students and postdoctoral fellows in attending the 2025 Annual STOC conference, sponsored by the ACM. The coming STOC will take place in Prague, Czech Republic, during June 13-17, 2025. The project plans to support fifteen to twenty students and/or postdoctoral fellows in attending this important conference. Supporting the development of these early researchers assists them in making significant contributions to the computer science community and society at large.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
