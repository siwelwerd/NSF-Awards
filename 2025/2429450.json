 "awd_abstract_narration": "Today, cosmology stands at a crossroads, with surveys of Type Ia supernovae revealing multiple indications of potential new physics beyond what is predicted by the standard cosmological model. At the University of Hawai\u02bbi (UH), two of the most productive supernova surveys, Pan-STARRS and ATLAS, are currently being operated. However, advancing cosmology research using these data requires a large team of experts to tackle complex challenges related to data quality, systematic uncertainties, and parameter inference. Duke University astrophysicists have played a pivotal role in nearly all recent and next-generation cosmology surveys. This proposal aims to establish a collaboration between UH and Duke University, creating a robust support system that positions UH cosmologists as leaders in the field. The collaboration will address some of the most profound questions in cosmology today, such as whether the growth of structure and locally measured expansion of the Universe is consistent with the standard model, and the nature of dark energy. In pursuit of these goals, the project will also partner with high school programs in North Carolina and Hawai\u2018i to introduce diverse students to STEM research. These programs include 1) Maunakea Scholars, 2) Hawai\u02bbi Student/Teacher Astronomy Research (HI-STAR), and 3) Duke Cosmology Development Via In-situ Learning and Study.\r\n\r\nCurrently, cosmology is at a pivotal moment, with Type Ia supernova (SNe Ia) surveys positioned to either confirm or challenge recent indications of new physics beyond the \u039bCDM cosmological model. This project outlines a research collaboration between UH and Duke University to create a support system that will empower UH cosmologists to lead the next decade of cosmological parameter measurements. The collaboration will leverage UH-led supernova discovery surveys, which will significantly reduce key systematic uncertainties in cosmological parameters by combining calibration systems and supplementing future surveys with enhanced cadence and color data. However, addressing complex challenges related to data quality, systematic uncertainties, and parameter inference will be crucial. Given Duke University\u2019s critical role in nearly all recent and future cosmology surveys, it serves as the ideal partner for this collaboration. The project will focus on assembling and validating low-redshift SNe Ia samples, providing a critical anchor for higher-redshift data. To guide the work, the collaboration will include four one- to two-week visits to Duke University, spaced every six months, involving a postdoctoral scholar and a UH graduate student. The overarching scientific goal will be to determine, over the next decade, whether the \u039bCDM model accurately describes the Universe. Additionally, the project will partner with existing high school programs in both North Carolina and Hawai\u2018i that introduce diverse students to astronomy. These programs include 1) Maunakea Scholars, 2) HI-STAR, and 3) Duke Cosmology Development Via In-situ Learning and Study.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
