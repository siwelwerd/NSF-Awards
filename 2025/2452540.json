 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project aims to address the impact of geomagnetic disturbances (GMDs) on submarine cables. Submarine cables are vital as they carry a significant portion of global internet traffic. Disruptions to these cables due to GMDs can lead to widespread communication outages, affecting economies, national security, and daily life. GMDs caused by space weather events like solar storms, induce geomagnetically induced currents (GICs) beneath the Earth's surface and within bodies of water. These currents can produce hazardous voltages in submarine cables, potentially leading to failures. However, the detailed behavior of these induced currents in modern submarine cables during extreme space weather is not well understood. This project seeks to characterize the induced underwater geoelectric fields (GEFs) and potential along submarine cables during various geomagnetic disturbances. The project will benefit various stakeholders, including space weather researchers, submarine cable operators, policymakers, and the broader scientific community. Moreover, this research will facilitate technology transfer and provide practical insights for disaster management and policy development. It supports the training of a postdoctoral researcher, a female early-career scientist, and a mid-career scientist, enhancing diversity and education in the field. \r\n\r\nThe project aims to model interactions between ionospheric and magnetospheric currents and submarine cables during geomagnetic disturbances (GMDs). GMDs induce geomagnetically induced currents (GICs) beneath the Earth's surface and within bodies of water, posing significant risks to submarine cables, which are critical for global internet traffic. The main objective is to characterize the induced underwater geoelectric fields (GEFs) and potential along submarine cables during various geomagnetic disturbances. Specifically, the project will investigate: (1) the types of GMDs that may produce hazardous voltages, (2) how magnetospheric and ionospheric currents influence underwater GEFs, and (3) the potential impact of solar superstorms on submarine cables. The work will utilize the SCUBAS (Submarine Cable Upset By Auroral Streams) model, which predicts voltages induced in submarine cables during geomagnetic disturbances. The model leverages data from magnetotelluric (MT) studies and integrates magnetic field disturbance inputs. This research will significantly enhance our understanding of how GMDs impact submarine cables under various conditions, including extreme space weather events. The project will gain insights into the GMDs that generate significant GEFs and potential along submarine cables, contributing to better risk assessment and mitigation planning. Research fills a critical knowledge gap using a novel combination of satellite and ground-based datasets and a comprehensive computational model. The findings will aid in risk assessment, disaster management, and policy development.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
