 "awd_abstract_narration": "This I-Corps project is based on the development of a sensor-equipped smart chair for early detection and monitoring of dementia. Currently, smart watch-based or video surveillance-based approaches cannot be used to diagnose or quantify the stage of dementia and can violate patient privacy while traditional diagnostic methods, such as brain imaging or cognitive assessments administered by experts, require trained personnel and medical equipment. This technology uses a non-invasive approach coupled with multi-modal data including physiological and cognitive markers associated with dementia. The solution is envisioned to be used in memory care facilities, veterans' homes, homes with elderly members, and hospitals, making it accessible to a wide range of users. This technology may reduce the financial burden and economic impact associated with dementia diagnosis, intervention, and care management.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of a dementia detection system integrating physiological and cognitive markers through a non-invasive smart chair. This technology uses advanced machine learning algorithms to monitor early behavioral and cognitive changes, providing real-time analysis and improving detection accuracy. This technology may be used to track and analyze the progression and trends of dementia as well as identifying the disease stage.  In addition, the solution integrates multi-dimensional data and significantly reduces false alarms. The technology may improve the limitations of traditional medical diagnostics through brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and standard cognitive assessments as well as reduce costs, improve early-stage detection, and improve patient care and management.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
