 "awd_abstract_narration": "NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:\r\n\r\nThis REU-Site program at the University of Pennsylvania's Laboratory for Research on the Structure of Matter (LRSM) will provide transformative research experiences to 10 undergraduate students annually, drawing talented participants from small colleges and institutions nationwide. The program will combine hands-on materials research with innovative science communication training, preparing the next generation of scientists and engineers. Students will work directly with leading researchers while developing crucial skills to communicate complex scientific concepts to broader audiences. Building on a proven track record where nearly 90% of participants pursue advanced STEM degrees, this program will strengthen America's scientific talent pipeline. The program's impact extends beyond individual participants, as students will learn to effectively communicate their research to younger audiences, thereby inspiring future generations of scientists. This investment in undergraduate research education serves the national interest by expanding the scientific workforce and fostering innovations in materials science that drive technological advancement.\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL SUMMARY:\r\n\r\nThis REU-Site program will embed undergraduate researchers within active research groups at the Laboratory for Research on the Structure of Matter (LRSM), engaging them in cutting-edge materials research spanning multiple disciplines. The program will integrate two core objectives: providing authentic research experiences in materials science and developing advanced scientific communication skills. Research projects will span the LRSM's interdisciplinary portfolio, including work on metamaterials, bioinspired engineering, condensed protein mesophases, and novel materials applications. Students will be paired and matched with faculty mentors from a pool of over 90 LRSM-affiliated researchers. The program will implement a structured mentoring approach incorporating both faculty advisors and graduate student mentors, complemented by professional development workshops, weekly faculty seminars, and targeted communication training. A distinguishing feature is the program's integration with visiting scholars and researchers from multiple institutions, providing students exposure to varied approaches in materials research. Program assessment will utilize pre- and post-surveys, focus groups, and longitudinal tracking to measure impacts on participants' research capabilities, career trajectories, and communication skills.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
