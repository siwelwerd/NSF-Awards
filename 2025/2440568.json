 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Standard Model (SM) of particle physics has been a remarkably successful description of nature on the smallest length scales. It has been validated experimentally by decades of measurements at particle colliders. Despite this success, the SM alone cannot account for measurements at larger length scales. For example, it does not explain the abundance of dark matter in galaxies. These disagreements suggest the SM is only part of some larger theory with other particles and forces that have not been discovered yet. The group led by PI Prof. Osherson is searching for such particles in proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. The group focuses on discovering very light new particles that might have evaded previous searches. In particular, this project builds new tools that can probe a range of new physics scenarios with light new particles. The project also includes an educational component aimed at bringing experimental particle physics to high-school students.\r\n \r\nPI Osherson\u2019s group works within the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) collaboration at the LHC. The project has two main objectives, one focused on the immediate analysis of the current CMS datasets, the other preparing for future data-taking at the LHC. The group will develop new algorithms for reconstructing the signature of two overlapping photons, a signature common to many new physics scenarios. Such signatures are also relevant to precision measurements of the Higgs. The group will use these algorithms to search specifically for axion-like particles produced at the LHC. Looking to the future, the group is working on upgrades to the CMS detector, specifically replacing the Tracker sub-detector. The new Tracker is designed to operate in the new environment of the planned High-Luminosity LHC. The group is responsible for the production of software that will operate that detector. Students from the group will also contribute to its construction. In addition to the research experience gained by students in the group, the PI will combine education and research through outreach aimed at high-school curriculum development. Specifically, as a member of QuarkNet, the PI seeks to increase participation in virtual particle physics workshops for high-school teachers by better publicizing the program.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
