 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to build an inclusive research ecosystem to serve as a cornerstone of the Vermont economy.  Project goals are to establish administrative support to build and sustain a diverse, integrated science and technology (S&T) research ecosystem in southern Vermont. Additionally, the project seeks to broaden the participation of underrepresented groups in S&T research and employment. Through the project's responsiveness to the S&T needs of Vermont, the jurisdiction has potential to increase its S&T research and employment; have a strongly educated S&T population; position the community to understand various aspects of S&T research and its role in the community; and increase participation of underrepresented groups in S&T research including neurodivergent, first-generation, low-income, and multilingual students.  The project will build S&T research capacity through training, increasing research opportunities, and creating new S&T jobs. It will contribute to expanding the S&T workforce locally and nationally. \r\n\r\nThe Science and Technology Research Initiative for the Vermont Economy (STRIVE) is a collaboration between Landmark College (lead institution), Bennington College, and the Community College of Vermont. STRIVE will examine how an equitable research infrastructure can catalyze the civic value of science in undergraduate education and rural economies. The project will invest in achieving a holistic, jurisdiction-wide research ecosystem attuned to the needs of Vermont while monitoring the impact they have on STEM participation at an institutional, community, and jurisdictional wide level. Investments will broaden participation in S&T driven research and economic development, and bridge longstanding S&T research divides in the state. STRIVE will invest in the following research administrative infrastructure: Research Administrators, Research Scholars, and improvements to a research farm; experiential learning opportunities; S&T research grants;  professional development; and outreach activities. STRIVE will engage S&T research entities within and outside of the education system. This will lead to community-responsive partnerships that will leverage STRIVE\u2019s investments to secure funding for S&T research expansion in Vermont. This project is supported by the EPSCoR Research Infrastructure Improvement Program: EPSCoR Collaborations for Optimizing Research Ecosystems (E-CORE). E-CORE supports jurisdictions in strengthening their jurisdiction-wide research ecosystems through fostering interconnected networks, building research infrastructure, and growing research capacity and competitiveness aligned with jurisdictional priorities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
