 "awd_abstract_narration": "NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\nThis project focuses on understanding and controlling the complex behaviors of quantum systems\u2014those made up of many interacting particles\u2014that arise from their interactions, randomness, and the influence of their surroundings. Recent advances in quantum technologies, such as solid-state systems, cold atoms, and quantum computers, have uncovered remarkable properties in these systems that are still not fully understood. The research aims to explore how particles in these systems are correlated quantum mechanically and how their organization is affected by factors like disorder, external disturbances, and measurement processes. It will develop new methods to study these properties and investigate how they change under different conditions, including when systems are exposed to noise or other disruptions. The outcomes could deepen our understanding of how quantum systems behave and support the development of next-generation quantum technologies. This project will also involve students and early-career researchers, encouraging collaboration and building expertise to drive progress in this cutting-edge field.\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\nThis award supports theoretical research and associated education aimed to investigate and understand novel quantum phenomena in many-body systems, particularly those that can emerge through interactions, disorder, dissipation, and periodic driving, such as Floquet driving and adiabatic processes. The focus is on exploring universal properties and phenomena in quantum phases, specifically multipartite entanglement and topological properties in open quantum systems. Key research topics include the role of multipartite entanglement and the higher Berry phase in gapped quantum phases, as well as random matrix theory applications in open quantum systems, such as Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev models under Lindbladian dissipation. Additionally, the project will address related phenomena, including quantum quench and Floquet dynamics near criticality in one-dimensional systems and the study of topologically localized insulators. Using approaches from quantum field theory and quantum information, this research seeks to develop non-perturbative theoretical tools for these complex systems. The project will integrate junior researchers, fostering collaboration and knowledge exchange, with the ultimate goal of achieving fundamental breakthroughs in the field.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
