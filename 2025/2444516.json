 "awd_abstract_narration": "Landscape transformation can result in environments that are variable and patchy, potentially limiting an animal\u2019s ability to move and find a mate. While this situation can hinder a species\u2019 capacity to maintain healthy populations, the impact of landscape transformation on a species depends on its response. This doctoral dissertation project examines how different species of non-human primates respond to landscape changes, by identifying the species traits and landscape features that help or hinder their movement and genetic connectivity. The project advances knowledge of the traits that impede or promote gene flow (movement of genetic material from one group to another), diversity, and species survival among non-human primates. The study informs conservation efforts that support the persistence of non-human primates in the wild, highlighting the importance of tailoring conservation strategies.  \r\n\r\nThis doctoral dissertation research uses a multispecies landscape genetics approach to investigate how habitat variation affects gene flow and population connectivity among six non-human primate species in the wild. By combining population genetics, remote sensing, and data on species traits, the project identifies environmental features that help or hinder movement in species with diverse biological traits, such as body size, diet, and locomotion. Using novel single-nucleotide polymorphism genotyping techniques on non-invasive samples, this research analyzes genetic diversity and structure of multiple non-human primate species. The results advance the understanding of how species\u2019 traits influence their vulnerability to habitat fragmentation and provide actionable insights for designing corridors and reforestation strategies to support multiple species.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
