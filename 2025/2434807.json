 "awd_abstract_narration": "Grand Valley State University will deploy and evaluate an Algebra 2 extension of the Bootstrap:Data Science curriculum across Michigan. Michigan faces logistical challenges in providing widespread Computer Science (CS) education: only 55% of high schools offer it at all, much less to all students. At the same time, data science \u2014 with its job prospects and ties to artificial intelligence\u2014is vying for the same attention. Ideally, the two subjects could be taught together while meeting relevant standards and supporting diverse students in learning both subjects. The practitioners in this Research-Practice Partnership (RPP) \u2014  state education leaders in Michigan\u2014see opportunity in Algebra 2. It is a graduation requirement that many students struggle to pass and many teachers see as needing reform. At the same time, state data show that college enrollment has risen since the requirement was adopted, especially for students from historically underrepresented groups in computing. Algebra 2 prepares students for calculus and many science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) subjects in college. This RPP will address problems of practice for CS and mathematics education by integrating computing as needed for Data Science into Algebra 2. The project team will offer professional learning workshops and ongoing support to teachers across Michigan. The research team will use a mixed-methods design to study the factors that motivate districts and teachers to explore, adopt, and deepen their use of the project\u2019s materials, with an eye towards how this differs across regions and student demographics across Michigan. This RPP will also study the impact of this curriculum on girls and students from rural areas. If successful, the project will provide a model for expanding access to computing and data science while improving student outcomes in Algebra 2. It might also impact students\u2019 confidence and perceived relevance of Algebra 2 (issues that are known to affect girls and rural students in particular), which could in turn influence students\u2019 future course and career interests. \r\n\r\nThe Bootstrap:Data Science curriculum is a mature program with STEMworks certification and an underlying research foundation that covers significant portions of the standards from the Computer Science Teachers Association (CSTA), mathematics, and Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS). It is customizable across a wide array of datasets, thus enabling districts to select topics that are culturally relevant to students and their communities. The project team will use a combination of lightweight classroom activities and validated instruments about math confidence and math relevance to study the project\u2019s impact on students, contrasting the experiences of rural students and girls with those of the broader student population. Deliverables include research-backed models for including computing and data science in Algebra 2, Michigan-focused datasets targeted to regional issues and career pathways, 150 trained teachers and Michigan-based facilitators, case studies in adoption by districts and teachers, and findings on the impact of this approach on students from two under-represented populations.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
