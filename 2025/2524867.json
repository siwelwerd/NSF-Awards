 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant supports student travel to the Eighth Conference on Machine Learning and Systems (MLSys 2025), which will take place at the Santa Clara Convention Center in California, United States, from May 12th to 15th, 2025. The conference focuses on research at the intersection of machine learning and systems, an area that hasn't been extensively explored by traditional Machine Learning or Systems conferences. By bringing together these fields, MLSys aims to foster new connections, identify best practices, and establish design principles for learning systems. It also seeks to develop innovative learning methods and theories tailored to practical machine learning workflows. The MLSys community has enjoyed a close interaction between academic researchers and industrial designers and aims to continue this tradition at MLSys 2025. \r\n\r\nGraduate and undergraduate student attendance is vital to the growth of the MLSys community. Students receiving travel support will benefit from the opportunity to engage in the technical, professional, educational and social exchanges that MLSys fosters. The MLSys conference serves as an open forum to exchange research results and develop new ideas, as well as an educational platform to expose students to new research methodologies, tools, and infrastructures, and as a social event to network and prepare students as future researchers and leaders. The conference will also feature a Young Professionals Symposium that will especially benefit students and young researchers. This grant will enable students who might otherwise be unable to attend to participate fully, ensuring they can benefit from the mentorship, interactions, and networking opportunities available at MLSys 2025.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
