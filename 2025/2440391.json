 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to acquire a laser ablation microprobe (LAM) and quadrupole inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (Q-ICPMS) at the Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory (LDEO) of Columbia University to support a broad sweep of research by LDEO, American Museum of Natural History (AMNH) and greater New York City researchers and students. The Q-ICPMS makes it possible to measure most of the elements in the periodic table with great sensitivity (below parts per trillion detection limits) in minutes. The LAM is a front-end sampler that allows measurement of solid materials in spots as small as 5 microns. Twenty-one separate research groups have developed new applications with the proposed instrumentation, including projects that bear on volcanic hazards, geohealth, and critical minerals. This project also provides support for geochemically-focused research projects by summer interns at LDEO, and provides training opportunities for students in state-of-the-art, hands-on chemical analysis.\r\n \r\nPurchase of a new excimer laser and Q-ICPMS will leverage two other high resolution ICPMS instruments in the designated lab (a 2009 Nu AttoM and a 2012 Thermo Neptune-Plus), enabling applications that range from multi-trace element to high precision isotope ratio measurements in microns-spot measurements. The primary research to utilize the LAM-Q-ICPMS system is focused on measuring chemical zonation in volcanic crystals for developing diffusion timescales of magma in motion beneath active volcanoes, and on measuring boron isotopes in serpentinites to trace the deep earth water cycle at subduction zones. Others in the user group propose provenance studies that focus on paleoclimate or human artifacts; in situ trace element analyses of melt inclusions, tephra and crystals for volcanic-magmatic-ore deposit research; corals and foraminifera for paleo-climate reconstructions; geohealth applications in the study of trace metals in rice, hair, soil and paint; and environmental engineering applications in carbon sequestration and processing of ores. In addition to LDEO and the AMNH, the new instrumentation will support research at other institutions in the New York City area, including several CUNY campuses and Stockton University. The facility will also provide training opportunities for up to 20 graduate students given existing projects. Further applications and new technique development are anticipated with another decade-plus of LAM-ICPMS capabilities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
