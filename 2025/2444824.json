 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of a pediatric manual mobile standing wheelchair, a novel wheelchair that allows children with a neuromuscular condition to transition between standing and sitting and move manually throughout their day whether at home or school without need for additional equipment or caregiver assistance. School systems that are required through federal mandates and Individual Education Plans to support children in wheelchairs and their medical need for daily standing would benefit from a pediatric manual mobile standing wheelchair. Families with children with neuromuscular conditions will similarly benefit. This novel wheelchair reduces the number of pieces of specialized equipment needed in the school or at home, reducing both cost and space demands as well as reducing the number of staff members/caregivers and time needed to assist the children in transitioning between and using each piece of equipment. Finally, a pediatric manual mobile standing wheelchair may have significant health benefits for children with neuromuscular conditions including the health benefits from frequent standing (bone density, muscle and tendon length, respiratory and cardiovascular health, and more) and the psychosocial benefit of increased independence and participation. \r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. This solution is based on the development of a pediatric manual mobile in stranding wheelchair. The Pediatric Manual Mobile Standing Wheelchair is a novel mobility device that allows children with disabilities to navigate their environment in either a seated or standing position. The ability to stand or sit in a single device reduces the need for multiple pieces of equipment and decreases caregiver demands by eliminating the requirement to complete several daily transfers between devices. Offering the ability to manually move in both the seated and standing position is theorized to increase compliance with therapeutic standing programs and thereby augment the positive health outcomes associated with regular standing. In addition, the ability to move in either a standing or seated position facilitates greater participation and independence in activities of daily living. The technology was developed via a collaboration between the University of Minnesota and the Minneapolis Veterans Affairs Medical Center.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
