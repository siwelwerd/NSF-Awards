 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant partially supports the participation of Ph.D. students from US institutions in the Doctoral Consortium at the 2025 IEEE Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV). WACV is the premier annual conference focused on the applications of computer vision. It is held in the United States and attended by members of the international research community. The goal of the PhD Forum is to highlight the work of PhD students working in computer vision and to give these students an opportunity to discuss their research and career options with senior researchers in the field. The broader impacts of this project include supporting the career development of some of the brightest junior researchers in computer vision, contributing to the research community in general by drawing attention to an important aspect of graduate student development, potentially increasing the number of active researchers and educators in STEM, and ensuring that the computer vision community, through its recent graduates, makes fast advances in solving problems that will benefit society as a whole. The Doctoral Consortium aims to have representation from a diverse group of participants in terms of gender, ethnic background, academic institution, and geographic location.\r\n\r\nSupport from the National Science Foundation covers some of the costs for 17 selected US-based graduate students to attend the conference. The selection of participants receiving travel support is conducted by the 2025 WACV Doctoral Consortium Chairs. For graduate students, this event offers a chance to receive guidance on their research and career plans from experts from various institutions, potentially offering diverse perspectives compared to their own research advisor. For senior researchers involved, the event serves as an opportunity to engage in meaningful discussions with promising young researchers and to contribute to the community through mentorship. This year's Doctoral Consortium features a poster session, one-on-one mentoring, and a panel discussion.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
