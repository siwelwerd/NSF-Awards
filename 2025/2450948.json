 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project investigates how war-induced relocation affects the professional, social, and civic life of physicians. Through a case study approach, this research examines the factors that facilitate or hinder their continuation of medical practice, integration into the host region, and participation in civic life when physicians are relocated. By understanding these dynamics, the study aims to enhance scientific understanding of how highly-skilled professionals displaced by war can contribute to their host regions and whether shared professional or civic identities help overcome war-induced divisions.\r\n\r\nPhysicians are considered a prototypical professional group due to their universal commitment to care, reliance on scientific knowledge, and pursuit of autonomy. Core data collection includes in-depth, semi-structured interviews with clinicians who relocated during the last decade. To assess the role of pre-existing professional communities in facilitating integration, additional interviews are conducted with physicians who relocated from the same areas several decades ago. Virtual interviews also are conducted with physicians who remained in conflict-affected regions to gain insight into their perceptions of and connections with colleagues who left. Data are analyzed using abductive reasoning, and a database of relevant organizations, social networks, and media is developed to support the analysis. The research is conducted by a collaborative team under the NSF/BSF program.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
