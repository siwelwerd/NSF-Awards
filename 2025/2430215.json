 "awd_abstract_narration": "Bowdoin College, an undergraduate liberal arts college in Maine, is developing a forward-looking campus cyberinfrastructure (CI) plan. Through faculty, staff, and student engagement, Bowdoin is completing an assessment of its current infrastructure, identifying science drivers, and gaining a deeper understanding of the cyberinfrastructure needs to support current and future research at an emerging research institution.  The primary driver for the project lies in the importance of technology for supporting scientific research and education across diverse fields at Bowdoin. The completed CI plan will define priorities and plans for resource allocations around shared research and education goals, providing a foundation for faculty to build future research, teaching, and collaboration plans.\r\n\r\nMore broadly, this project is advancing scientific research at Bowdoin by forging productive trust relationships among researchers and technology staff, engaging students in research collaborations they may not have previously considered, creating new research collaborations, and positioning Bowdoin as a valued partner with peer institutions, research organizations, and industry to expand its reach and impact on the scientific community. Overall, the project is creating a strategic CI plan that strengthens Bowdoin's research capabilities and support, expanding research and collaborative opportunities with local, regional, and national partners, and setting a foundation for future National Science Foundation Campus Cyberinfrastructure (CC*) support.\r\n\r\nThis project is jointly funded by the Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
