 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of wireless power transfer (WPT) technology. Compared to the existing power systems, the proposed technology may increase power transfer efficiency while reducing cost and weight.  This may benefit a wide variety of applications including the charging of low-power consumer electronic devices and high-power electric vehicles (EVs).  The proposed technology is thin enough to be integrated into an electronic device without increasing its size and thickness. In addition, in EV charging applications, it may significantly improve the mobility of EVs by removing the charging cables and providing convenience to customers.  Each wireless charging pad works as an independent power system with a secured data-link service for customers to support intelligent charging demand and management.  The applications may be expanded to biomedical implants to eliminate wire-connected chargers for patients and bring benefits in healthcare area.  The proposed technology also may be applied in high-voltage power systems to support the penetration of renewable energy and distributed energy resources with high-voltage isolation capabilities.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on the development of wireless power transfer (WPT) technology based on magnetic resonance. The proposed technology uses a resonant circuit topology design and a special magnetic coupler structure implementation.  It has been demonstrated to achieve multi-kW power transfer with over 97% efficiency across a distance up to 8 inches, which represents state-of-the-art performance. In addition, the magnetic coupler structure is optimized to confine the magnetic fields within a limited area and reduce magnetic field emissions to the surrounding environment. The technology is designed to satisfy the safety requirements proposed in both the IEEE C95.2 standard and the international commission on non-ionizing radiation protection (ICNIRP) guideline.  The proposed WPT technology targets high power, high efficiency, long distance, and compact (high power density) applications, spanning from low power to high-power systems and may be used in the power, energy, and biomedical areas.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
