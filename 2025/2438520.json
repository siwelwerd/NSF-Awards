 "awd_abstract_narration": "This EAGER program award to the Center for Strategic and International Studies (hereafter referred to as \u201cCSIS\u201d) will advance the research community\u2019s understanding of how substantial increases in public investments in translational science and emerging technology impact global supply chains, economic competitiveness, and network effects. This assessment will leverage a wide range of traditional and novel indicators, as well as qualitative research from experts in the field. It will also provide a comparative analysis of global innovation investment frameworks, assess various international models of university-industry cooperation, provide case studies on key emerging technology roadmap developments, and propose new avenues for future research to better understand national science and research infrastructure. This project will rely on novel applications of game theory and network systems analysis to map and visualize national innovation ecosystems and infrastructure. As a leading research organization trusted by a wide range of experts, CSIS is uniquely positioned to take on this work and has a deep bench of trusted and experienced academic researchers to rely on in the creation of this report. This award will also advance public participation and understanding of public innovation infrastructure and its impact on key national and global priorities through a series of public workshops, events, and roundtable discussions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
