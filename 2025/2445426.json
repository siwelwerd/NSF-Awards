 "awd_abstract_narration": "This doctoral dissertation research studies the social and environmental impacts of energy transitions on coastal communities.  The investigators specifically test how community decision-making and adaptations impact local regions impacted by energy transitions. The research expands scientific understanding of community adaptations and decision-making in the context of new, sustainable energy solutions. In addition to providing scientific training for a graduate student in anthropology and interdisciplinary research in the energy sector, the broader impacts of this research involve close collaboration with local communities in the development of educational materials on energy transitions. Research findings will also be shared to inform local adaptations to changes in the energy sector. \r\n\r\nIn order to understand the lived experiences of communities most impacted by the new energy sector, investigators utilize a mix-methods approach that combines qualitative and quantitative data collection. Investigators specifically use semi-structured interviews, content analysis, and quantitative analysis of health, environment, and socioeconomic data of communities living in impacted areas of energy sector expansion. The research makes significant contributions to environmental anthropology, the anthropology of energy, and to the social science of local impacts of global energy infrastructures.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
