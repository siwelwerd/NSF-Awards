 "awd_abstract_narration": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has made major advances through deep learning, powering technologies like ChatGPT and self-driving cars. However, deep learning systems often struggle to organize and apply knowledge effectively. This EAGER project will explore the possibility of creating the Translational Institute on Knowledge Axiomatization (TIKA) to address this challenge. TIKA would help AI better understand and use information by structuring it into networks, making logical connections, and improving decision-making. The institute would offer education and training programs, build a central collection of knowledge resources, and support new research and industry partnerships. These efforts will expand AI beyond deep learning, leading to smarter, more adaptable systems. This EAGER award will help advance AI research, create new learning opportunities, and strengthen the U.S. science and technology workforce.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis EAGER will take three key steps to help AI better organize and use knowledge through knowledge axiomatization. First, it will develop community-building workshops and expand the existing Prototype Open Knowledge Network (Proto-OKN) initiatives to create and distribute coursework on knowledge graphs. Second, it will establish a sustainable operational framework to maintain TIKA\u2019s knowledge resources beyond the initial funding period. Third, the project will build open educational resources and training materials, equipping researchers and practitioners with tools to construct and apply knowledge graphs effectively. The project\u2019s outcomes will enhance AI research, broaden educational opportunities, and establish a foundation for long-term advancements in AI knowledge systems, ensuring both scientific and societal impact.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
