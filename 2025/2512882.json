 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 31st International Symposium on High Performance Computer Architecture (HPCA-2025), sponsored by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), will be held in Las Vegas, NV March1 \u2013 5, 2025. HPCA is the premier forum for presenting the latest research findings on computer architecture and computer design including microarchitecture, cache and memory system design, parallel-, power-efficient-, embedded- and reconfigurable computer architectures. \r\n\r\nHPCA seeks to increase student participation in symposia and the field. The  funding will support the travel of eligible US students to the symposium. Recipients will be able to attend the main conference, workshops, and tutorials. Travel grants will encourage the research interests and the involvement of students in the field who are not well funded and those who are just beginning their participation in the field or are interested in entering it. A special effort will be made to reach out to students from underrepresented groups. The award will cover up to 12 NSF-sponsored student travel grants up to $1,250 each.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
