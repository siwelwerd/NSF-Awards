 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site award to Texas A&M University, located in College Station, TX, supports the training of 9-10 students for 10 weeks during the summers of 2025-2027.  In this program, funded by the Division of Chemistry, participants conduct independent research projects, collaborating with faculty across distinct chemistry disciplines alongside graduate student mentors. By focusing on the ongoing transition from hydrocarbons to sustainable chemical alternatives, the program addresses societal and environmental priorities in the Gulf Coast region. This research experience is complemented by weekly professional development workshops, seminars and networking opportunities that will provide interaction with their peers and industry partners within the university and the broader scientific community in the area. The program is committed to empowering talented students with limited research opportunities to pursue graduate studies in STEM fields.\r\n\r\nThis REU program focuses on advancing sustainable solutions to replace hydrocarbon feedstock for the chemical industry. Research will address critical challenges in green chemistry, energy security, and human health\u2014key issues shaping the Gulf Coast's evolving economy. Students conduct independent research in areas such as sustainability, catalysis, and environmental chemistry, developing skills in experimental techniques, data analysis, and effective communication. Weekly seminars contextualize the research within broader regional and global challenges, while workshops on ethics, teamwork, and science communication emphasize professional development. Participants engage with industry partners through site visits and network with alumni from various career paths, fostering a lasting mentoring network. The program leverages the collaborative environment at Texas A&M University, offering close faculty and graduate student mentorship, access to state-of-the-art facilities, and opportunities to present research through various symposia and public outreach, promoting engagement and collaboration across the scientific community.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
