 "awd_abstract_narration": "Arkansas State University seeks to modernize its cyberinfrastructure (CI) capabilities in three potential areas: 1) Access to large-scale computing resources for both research and teaching; 2) improved networking access to regional high-speed research networks; and 3) availability of large-scale digital storage to support research and archival needs.  This CC* Strategy grant supports a comprehensive CI planning initiative to address the growing demands of computationally intensive research, broaden research participation and collaboration among faculty, and improve student outcomes as an institution with a large online student population.  This planning project is crucial for keeping the institution at the forefront of scientific innovation and education as the only research institution in Arkansas serving the Arkansas Delta Region.\r\n\r\nThe CI planning initiative entails the development of a master Campus Cyberinfrastructure Plan to prioritize future infrastructure investments and acquisitions based on campus impact, long-term sustainability, and the ability to contribute to state-level and regional cyberinfrastructure networks.  These planning activities position the institution to compete for future funding opportunities in campus CI that modernize A-State's cyberinfrastructure resources to meet the needs of a diverse research enterprise and student body.  The resulting campus CI improvements will support high impact student training, research opportunities, and professional development in the Arkansas Delta and beyond.\r\n\r\nThis project is jointly funded by the Campus Cyberinfrastructure (CC*) program, and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
