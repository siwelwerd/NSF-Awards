 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-year proposal entitled REU Site: Integration of Biology and Materials in Chemical Engineering focuses on research projects at the biology-chemistry interface and their applications to healthcare, energy, environmental remediation, and homeland security. Ten REU students each year will engage in a 10-week program featuring research projects and student activities/workshops. Recruitment will target a diverse group of students, including students who do not have prior research experience or that are from institutions where research opportunities are limited. Professional development workshops will focus on research ethics, scientific communication, graduate school, and careers, and are designed to enhance belonging and connection and to build students\u2019 confidence in handling open-ended questions associated with scientific research. At the completion of the program, students will present oral and poster presentations at a cross-disciplinary undergraduate research symposium on campus and the possibility of presenting their research findings at national conferences. \r\n\r\nBiomolecular materials and processes hold great promise for confronting critical challenges facing the world, including producing food, clean water and other resources, designing and manufacturing innovative medicines and materials for biomedical applications, and developing sustainable, renewable and clean energy. Addressing these global concerns requires broadening participation in the engineering workforce to bring new perspectives and to maximize the potential for impact. The objectives include recruiting a highly diverse group of students; providing professional development on analytical and research skills, and collaborative and communication skills; offering an overview of career opportunities and future careers; and evaluating the effects and outcome of the research experience on students. Overall, the program will promote scientific and professional growth of participants and will educate the next generation of undergraduate students to be leaders and contributors to the field of biomolecular materials and to the nation\u2019s scientific output in areas including healthcare, environmental remediation, and energy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
