 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Partnerships for Innovation - Technology Translation (PFI-TT) project focuses on dental restoration technologies through the advancement of 3D printing techniques specifically tailored for zirconia ceramics. Zirconia is a material that is well-regarded for its durability and biocompatibility. By enhancing the adhesion properties of zirconia used in dental crowns, this project addresses a critical challenge in dental restorations: the longevity and reliability of crowns within the oral environment. This innovation has the potential to improve patient outcomes by reducing the frequency of crown replacements due to better initial fit and stronger bonding with the natural tooth structure. Additionally, the project supports the dental industry's shift towards more personalized and rapidly produced dental solutions, thereby reducing overall healthcare costs and improving patient care. The commercial impact of this project includes the creation of efficient production capabilities in dental laboratories, improved quality and accessibility of dental care, and the adoption of advanced manufacturing technologies within the healthcare sector.       \r\n\r\nThis project will advance the manufacturing of 3D printed dental crowns made from yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ). The primary research objectives include developing innovative methods to enhance the adhesion of 3D printed zirconia to dental cements, a longstanding issue due to zirconia\u2019s smooth and non-etchable surface, a surface that traditionally resists effective bonding techniques. To address this, the team will integrate customized micro-patterns and micro-porosity on the inner surfaces of the crowns using sophisticated 3D printing technologies. The solution is aimed at improving mechanical interlocking and thus, the overall retention and durability of dental crowns. Additionally, the project may reduce production time by integrating a newly developed ultra-fast de-binding and sintering technology that utilizes advanced heating mechanisms to accelerate time-consuming stages. This approach will dramatically enhance the efficiency of manufacturing processes, reducing the overall turnaround time for creating dental restorations. The research will leverage advanced digital design tools and a stereolithographic 3D printing technology to create precise and reproducible textural enhancements on zirconia surfaces. Anticipated technical results include validated improvements in crown adhesion strength and a reduction of de-binding and sintering times compared to traditional methods, without compromising the quality of the final product.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
