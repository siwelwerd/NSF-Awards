 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact of this I-Corps project is the development of a motion capture technology to be used in filmmaking and animation. Currently, capturing intricate motions of finger joints has remained a significant challenge. Traditional motion capture technologies, such as optical tracking systems, primarily rely on cameras and reflective markers to track movements. This technology presents several drawbacks as it relies on controlled environments, such as specific lighting conditions, and inaccurate capturing of complex and rapid movements. The new technology addresses these issues by incorporating a wearable, self-powered sensor to capture motion. This application may improve the design of immersive experiences using Extended Reality (XR) technologies. The sensor also may have application in the field of rehabilitation, capturing real-time biomechanical motions. \r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of a wearable motion capturing device. The aim is to offer users greater flexibility and adaptability in working in dynamic settings and environments, such as capturing the motion of the human hand. The new technology is based on a textile sensor composed of hundreds of miniatured sensors directly in contact with the human hand. This integration allows the motion data to be genuine and comprehensive and, combined with an algorithm for real-time signal processing, the sensor can track the motion of the user with seamless data transfer. In comparison with optical or Inertial Movement Unit (IMU)-based systems, this device does not require a specifically allocated workspace and is self-powered. This flexibility provides the wearers more freedom to carry on the hand movement tasks in any environment.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
