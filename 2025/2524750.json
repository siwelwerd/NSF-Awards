 "awd_abstract_narration": "DNA and RNA constitute the molecular code of life, serving as the foundation for all cellular processes. Information is encoded not only in the sequence of nucleotides but also in nucleic acid structure, chemical modifications, molecular dynamics, and interactions with proteins and small molecules. Advances in nucleic acids research drive discovery and innovations in genetics, cellular biology, molecular biology, and biotechnology. For over sixty years, the biannual Nucleic Acids Gordon Research Conference has played a pivotal role in nucleic acids research by serving as an incubator for transformative discoveries and innovations in biotechnology. The associated trainee-focused Nucleic Acids Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) began in 2017 as a venue for graduate students, post-doctoral fellows, and early career researchers to share their research and build their professional networks.\r\n\r\nThis award will support the 2025 Nucleic Acids GRS, which will bring together trainees in the nucleic acids field to discuss cutting-edge and unpublished research findings. The GRS will feature presentations from trainees in scientific sessions focused on functional genomics and the structure, organization and dynamics of DNA and RNA. All participants will have ample opportunity to interact with peers and receive feedback in poster sessions. The program also features a keynote address from a leading researcher in the field and a career panel with experts from academia, industry, and scientific communication. The GRS provides trainees with an environment that inspires new directions in research, supports development of communication skills, and helps clarify future career paths, including as emerging leaders in the field.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
