 "awd_abstract_narration": "This doctoral dissertation project investigates interregional interaction between prehistoric complex society sites. Archaeological ceramics are well-suited to answer questions about interregional interaction because of the wealth of social and geospatial information they provide through their decoration, form, production, and composition. This project enhances a growing body of literature on ceramic imitation in the archaeological record. The primary data and eventual dissertation generated from this research will be accessible to audiences through open access online publications and databases. Ceramics will be installed in a museum exhibit to further public education. Students participate in laboratory research and gain valuable archaeological experience. \r\n\r\nThe project evaluates three competing models of long-distance interaction: (a) colonization/migration; (b) emulation; and (c) trade/exchange. Archaeological excavations took place at two Classic period sites which are distant from each other, and which contain similar types of ceramics.  These are sorted into two categories of material culture: (1) low-visibility, which includes rote manufacturing techniques that are not readily apparent to the naked eye and indicate colonization or migration and (2) high-visibility, which includes visible attributes that attract attention and indicate emulation. An analysis of decoration, form, and production technology is conducted to distinguish between low and high-visibility materials. An analysis of ceramic chemical compositions determines whether ceramics were made locally or traded between groups. By testing all three models of interaction, this study will broaden current understandings of interregional relationships of how develop over long periods of time.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
