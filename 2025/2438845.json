 "awd_abstract_narration": "Being able to predict behaviors of other people is important to successfully navigate the social world. Prior research shows that one major way to achieve this is by learning about other people\u2019s personality traits. This project explores how individuals learn not only about others\u2019 personality traits but also about the situations that inform people\u2019s actions, and in turn use situational learning in decision making. Impacts of this project include research training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students, and dissemination of findings to the public. \r\n\r\nThis project aims to characterize how individuals learn about situations and explore how different life experiences influence this process. The research team leverages behavioral methods, advanced neuroimaging techniques and computational modeling to (1) identify the neural and cognitive mechanisms involved in situational and trait learning and to (2) examine the role that situational and trait learning play in moral reasoning and decision-making across different contexts.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
