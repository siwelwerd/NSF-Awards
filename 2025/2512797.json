 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides funds to support students for travel to the International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE 2025), which will take place in Ottawa, Canada in April, 2025. ICSE is the flagship conference in the field of Software Engineering. The grant will provide travel and registration support for US-based students. The ICSE conference this year will have a doctoral symposium, student mentoring workshop, and a new faculty symposium. Conference attendance is important for the technical exchange of information and research conversations/collaborations made possible by the conference, as well as advances in the field made possible by these interactions. The conference provides opportunities for education, training and mentoring to build the next generation of researchers and practitioners in the field of software engineering. The international nature of this conference helps develop a globally-aware workforce of research and educators within the US and helps build the community of researchers in the field of Software Engineering.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
