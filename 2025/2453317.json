 "awd_abstract_narration": "This I-Corps project is focused on the commercialization of a unique device that allows people to produce their own plant-based foods and potentially learn about healthy eating, while improving their diet. The technology uses algae to provide fertilizer for vegetable growth and allows for the simple and easy growing of micro-greens, greens, and herbs at home. The countertop device requires little space and no electricity to grow plant-based diet options for people in their homes and kitchens adjacent to where food is prepared. The advancement is designed to help people add affordable, healthy options to their daily routines and to learn about beneficial nutrition.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of a compact, in-home hydroponics device that uses algae to provide fertilizer for vegetable growth. The device uses tap water and has no complex wiring or electronics. The algae grow on the special interior of the device which is configured to create a moist and textured environment that supports the algal needs while still encouraging plant growth. Seedling germination and plant growth in the device takes place over the course of two to three days when growing microgreens and one week when growing other plants. Harvesting is possible within one week for microgreens and two to three weeks for other plants. The algae are hardy and self-regenerating, so they do not require replenishment even after multiple rounds of plant production.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
