 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the creation of the Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site in the Department of Physics at The Ohio State University. The program provides eight undergraduate students each summer with a ten-week immersive experience in cutting-edge research spanning astrophysics, atomic, molecular, and optical physics, biophysics, condensed matter physics, nuclear physics, particle physics, and physics education research. Through this initiative, students gain hands-on experience in scientific inquiry, bolstered by field trips and professional development activities designed to equip them with the tools and insights needed to achieve their academic and career aspirations. This program aligns with NSF\u2019s mission by advancing the progress of science across multiple disciplines, fostering educational growth, and broadening participation in STEM fields by engaging students who may have limited access to research opportunities. \r\n\r\nThe REU site seeks to provide students with meaningful research experiences through a structured program of mentorship, professional development, and research training. Students will engage with expert faculty mentors\u2014including APS Fellows and NSF CAREER award winners\u2014who offer a dynamic, collegial environment and innovative research opportunities. Mentorship will be enhanced by the inclusion of graduate student \"near-peer\" mentors and integration with the OSU Polaris program, fostering collaboration and community.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
