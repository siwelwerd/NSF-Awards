 "awd_abstract_narration": "A Summer School and Hackathon event on Structure-Preserving Scientific Computing and Machine Learning will take place at the University of Washington, Seattle on June 16-25, 2025. Structure-Preserving Scientific Computing is an emerging field of research focused on the design of efficient numerical methods or algorithms that preserve fundamental mathematical structures or properties of continuous models at the discrete level. Such approaches are often essential to maintain accuracy and stability of numerical solutions, as well as to enhance efficiency in large-scale simulations. Moreover, scientific machine learning, which utilizes machine learning techniques to solve scientific computing problems, can also benefit from incorporating structure-preserving ideas to improve their prediction capability and generalizability on data-driven models. The main objectives of this Summer School and Hackathon event are: 1) Create a synergistic opportunity for established researchers, industry partners, postdocs, and graduate students to meet, network, and share the latest cutting-edge research in structure-preserving scientific computing. 2) Engage and provide training to graduate students working in computational mathematics. 3) Enable early career researchers to form strong connections and receive mentorship with world-leading experts and industry project leaders. 4) Cultivate long-lasting collaborations and innovative research among students and researchers at all career stages from academia, government agencies, industry, and beyond. \r\n\r\nThe Summer School will feature world-renowned experts delivering four minicourses on topics in Structure-Preserving Scientific Computing and Machine Learning, including operator splitting, dynamical low-rank methods, neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs), and neural operators. Building on this synergy, the subsequent Hackathon will challenge students to apply their newly acquired knowledge to real-world applications through four projects, led by project leaders from academia, government agencies, industry, and national laboratories. Event details and applications for graduate student participation will be posted on the conference website: https://sites.google.com/view/crg-spd/events/seattle-2025.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
