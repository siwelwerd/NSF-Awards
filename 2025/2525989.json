 "awd_abstract_narration": "Engineering for US All (e4usa\u2122) introduces all students to engineering and supports educators to prepare students successfully to be key contributors to the United States workforce. The curriculum features hands-on projects addressing real-world challenges, fostering creativity, critical thinking, and collaboration skills essential for future engineers. Rooted in feedback from educators, the curriculum continues to evolve with new content and instructional resources. e4usa\u2122 will improve and grow the usage of its end of course examination and the MyDesign\u00ae Learning Management System, which provides students and educators with a valid and reliable way to assess engineering design process portfolios. e4usa\u2122 prioritizes teacher development with year-round professional learning opportunities, preparing both new and returning educators to implement the curriculum effectively and grow their pedagogical practices. Professional learning at e4usa\u2122 will include the development of new professional development opportunities to support a wider audience and be responsive to the needs of educators. In doing so, professional developments will continue to be designed in partnership with educators, and the e4usa\u2122 Hub will be leveraged to increase engagement with professional developments and the e4usa\u2122 curriculum. Elevating the impact of e4usa\u2122, more institutions of higher education will join e4usa\u2122 to offer college credit and placement to students completing e4usa\u2122 in high school. As e4usa\u2122 increasingly scales, it will work to retain current e4usa\u2122 educators and engage with new schools, districts, and states. Furthermore, the network of both universities and industries partnering with and supporting educators and students will grow through increased numbers of liaisons and funding. By continuing to grow all intertwined initiatives of e4usa\u2122, e4usa\u2122 seeks to transform the engineering education system and strengthen students\u2019 readiness to join the United States workforce. \r\n\r\nFor the past 22 years, Engineering for US All (e4usa\u2122) has demonstrated a steadfast commitment to the core mission of revolutionizing high school engineering education and building students\u2019 skills to become tomorrow\u2019s engineers. This mission guides e4usa\u2122 as it continues to  strengthen the  landscape of the nation's educational system and be responsive to the demands for a highly skilled workforce. To date, e4usa\u2122 has strengthened engineering education for over 7700 students across 105 high schools. e4usa\u2122 aims to continue and grow that impact by working closely alongside states and school systems across the nation. This mission guides e4usa\u2122 as it continues to be malleable and responsive to the changing landscape of the nation's educational system and workforce demands. In doing so, e4usa\u2122 consists of many critical initiatives that are closely intertwined to continue to make an impact toward expanding engineering engagement for all students and educators. These initiatives support the intentional growth of the e4usa\u2122 curriculum and teacher professional learning, including the scaling of the e4usa\u2122 Hub. Evolving key technologies, including the MyDesign\u00ae Learning Management System, and leveraging technologies for the purposes of the end-of-course assessment further support students and teachers engaged in e4usa\u2122. Scaling the network of e4usa\u2122 through colleges and universities granting credit and/or placement for students, as well as increasing partnerships with more states, schools, teachers, and students across the nation is essential to growth. Furthermore, strategic partnerships with other initiatives and organizations are key to the scalability of e4usa\u2122. As the premier choice for introducing engineering to all high school students, e4usa\u2122 is a leader in showcasing the importance of building a deep understanding of engineering design principles in students, investing in the continual professional development of our nation\u2019s educators, and helping to create a better future for citizens nationwide.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
