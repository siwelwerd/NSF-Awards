 "awd_abstract_narration": "The inaugural International Synthetic Biology Young Speaker Series Conference provides the global synthetic biology community with an opportunity to brainstorm, advance science and biotechnology, and solve many global problems. The programing includes not only technical presentations but also panel discussions and workshops to maximize the feeling of participation from attendees who are not speakers and nurture diverse opinion sharing. Specifically, the sessions include technical presentations, panel and roundtable discussions and road-mapping discussions among broader global community members. The program also includes poster presentations, networking sessions and a \u201cmeet the legend session,\u201d which is a forum in which there is opportunity for an informal chat between trainees and prominent established investigators. With these unique features, this conference provides the global research community, the biotechnology industry, and policymakers with the vision of and perspectives on engineering biology. \r\n\r\nThe inaugural International Synthetic Biology Young Speaker Series Conference addresses compelling questions in molecular and cellular biology and concomitantly gathers SynBYSS webinar speakers and audiences to build a more interactive, inclusive, sustainable, and collaborative synthetic biology community. It is a conference organized by and based on community input to provide the global synthetic biology community with an opportunity to brainstorm and solve many global problems that could be solved by the application of synthetic biology. The wide spectrum of scientific themes within the conference addresses compelling questions in molecular and cellular biology as well as the advancement of systems and synthetic biology as robust disciplines within the scientific landscape. Through its unique features, the conference provides the global research community, the biotechnology industry, and policymakers with the vision of and perspectives on engineering biology\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
