 "awd_abstract_narration": "This I-Corps project is based on the translation of engineered proteins that act like tiny sensors, lighting up when they detect specific changes inside cells. These proteins can be customized to track important biological signals, such as pH levels, harmful pollutants, or disease-related molecules. Currently, industries like healthcare, waste management, and food production rely on slower methods to monitor biological changes and these slower technologies leads to delayed disease detection, inefficient processing of waste, and missed opportunities to improve product safety.  By translating this research from discovery to real-world application, this project may benefit society and the U.S. economy by creating more high-quality jobs in biotechnology and supporting healthier communities nationwide.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of a genetically encodable biosensor. This biosensor uses a conformational rheostat design with fluorescent signals to create proteins that act like tiny molecular switches that light up or change color when they detect molecular changes. This solution consists of proteins engineered to change shape and glow when they detect changes, using a flexible system that measures tiny signals at the single molecule level. This novel technology is in contrast to existing sensors that only give simple on-or-off results. The engineered proteins respond faster than current testing methods, which often require expensive equipment and take hours or even days to produce results. The benefits of this approach include instant, precise data to track molecular changes in medical tests, industrial processes, or environmental systems, improving efficiency and outcomes while offering a customizable tool that adapts to different biosensing needs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
