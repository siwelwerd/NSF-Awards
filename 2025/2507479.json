 "awd_abstract_narration": "The space industry is growing at an exponential rate. The launch, operation, and re-entry of rockets and satellites will have potentially important effects on the upper atmosphere. The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine will plan and convene a workshop that brings together experts in the research, public, and private sectors to explore the current and potential future effects on the upper atmosphere from rocket launches and re-entering satellites, and related research gaps. This activity will enhance collaborations between different agencies.\r\n\r\nRockets emit gaseous and solid chemicals directly into the upper atmosphere, potentially affecting atmospheric composition. Recent modeling studies have shown that increases in rocket launches may deplete stratospheric ozone and impact radiative forcing from absorbing particles in fuels. When orbital debris re-enters the atmosphere, it also produces metal vapors, with additional consequences for stratospheric chemistry and radiative forcing. While there has been relatively more attention toward hazardous objects or debris from re-entry, little research has been dedicated to understanding the impacts of the growing space industry on atmospheric composition. This workshop will begin to rectify that gap by exploring the impact of low Earth orbit activities on atmospheric conditions. Specifically, workshop discussions will consider risks to the upper atmosphere from the increased frequency of rocket launches; discuss gaps and opportunities for measuring, monitoring, and modeling changes in emissions, atmospheric composition, and associated impacts; and consider how changes in atmospheric composition and opacity impact the feasibility of research within and through Earth\u2019s atmosphere.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
