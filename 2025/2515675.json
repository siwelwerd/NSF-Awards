 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Department of Mathematics and Statistics at South Dakota State University will host its seventh annual Data Science Symposium (February 6 & 7, 2025) in Brookings, South Dakota. This regional conference will assemble practitioners and researchers from many branches of data science, including statistics, mathematics, medicine and public health, precision agriculture, finance, forensic science, and others to exchange ideas, explore employment opportunities, and build collaborations. National Science Foundation funding will enable participation by students and early career attendees. The symposium is a highlight among conferences in the upper Midwest.\r\n\r\nParallel session tracks will feature speakers from diverse fields such as statistics, mathematics, computer science, healthcare, finance, forensics, precision agriculture, and other data science-related topics. The symposium facilitates networking, collaborations, and exposes students to various career paths within mathematics, statistics, computer science, and other STEM areas. The symposium aims to 1) bring unique opportunities to the Midwest region, where students, faculty, business leaders of the region, and practitioners all gather to discuss the applications and foundations of data science; 2) provide hands-on, four-hour-long instructions on emerging topics/tools used in data science; 3) host presentations covering foundational and use-case aspects of data science and garnering interactive discussions and future collaborations; 4) expand networks during the career fair and exhibit sessions, connecting faculty, students, and hiring managers of companies in the area. The three keynote presentations feature experts in data science in industry and academia and highlight the roles of artificial intelligence in modern data science. The conference web site is https://openprairie.sdstate.edu/datascience_symposium/2025/ .\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
