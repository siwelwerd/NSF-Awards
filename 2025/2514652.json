 "awd_abstract_narration": "Generative AI systems are increasingly used to create text, images, and other media.  These systems raise technical and usability issues around ways to better-integrate AI-based tools into creative practice while respecting the needs of creative professionals whose content is used to train the models.  These issues include questions about the nature of, ownership of, and responsibility for creativity and the creative content generated by these tools.  To inform research addressing these issues, the Workshop on Creativity and Generative AI will bring together learning researchers and creative professionals.  By bringing together the people who build these tools and the people who use them and are impacted by them, the workshop will identify important directions for research and tool development around generative AI.  This award will support the participation of creative professionals in the workshop.\r\n\r\nThe Workshop on Creativity and Generative AI will be held in conjunction with the Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS) conference, one of the world\u2019s leading research conferences on AI.  NeurIPS is a home conference for machine learning researchers, so it is comparatively easier for them to attend the workshop than creative professionals.  Supporting creative professionals to attend the workshop is important for achieving its goals.  The participation of these professionals will inform the evolution of generative AI, while also bringing in a wider range of backgrounds and perspectives to the NeurIPS research community.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
