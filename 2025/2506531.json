 "awd_abstract_narration": "The National Science Foundation (NSF) Computational Mathematics (CompMath) Principal Investigators (PI) Meeting, \"NSF Computational Mathematics Meeting 2025\" will be held on May 8 - 9, 2025, at the University of Utah, in Salt Lake City, Utah. The meeting will bring together program officers of the NSF Division of Mathematical Sciences (DMS) CompMath program, program officers from related programs, and researchers working in computational mathematics and related fields. Participation is open to all including those already funded by the NSF CompMath program, as well as participants seeking funds from the NSF, such as early career faculty, postdoctoral fellows, and graduate students. The major goals of the meeting are to provide a forum for the NSF CompMath-sponsored researchers to showcase their projects regarding intellectual merit and broader impacts, to raise awareness of the breadth of the program's topics and their impacts, and to allow the computational mathematics community to assess the programs in their entirety. In addition, the meeting is intended to facilitate the exchange of ideas and spur collaboration on the development of crucial insights into future directions of computational mathematics, to broaden the expertise of the community by introducing junior researchers to the NSF CompMath program, and to help communicate to the public the scope of the impacts of the computational mathematics field. The meeting is open to all interested in computational mathematics.\r\n \r\nThe NSF DMS CompMath program supports fundamental mathematical, applied, and interdisciplinary research in diverse areas where computation plays a central and crucial role. Algorithms and numerical simulations have long become necessary and unavoidable for the description, analysis, and predictions of real-world phenomena. However, the proliferation of computation continues at an accelerated pace, aided by advances in available computational power. The unprecedented growth in the scope of applications of computational mathematics highlights the need for continuing progress in the development of revolutionary algorithms to address, for example, a broad range of complex multiscale and multiphysics problems to maintain the pace of scientific, engineering, technological, and societal discoveries. This unique meeting and forum for the computational mathematics discipline will provide invaluable overviews of the broad spectrum of research topics within the field and showcase many achievements of the projects funded by the NSF CompMath program. The meeting will help to further strengthen the computational mathematics community by creating a supportive and engaging atmosphere for new interactions and collaborations among participants. In addition, the meeting will provide an important platform for exposing junior investigators, from graduate students to postdoctoral researchers and early-career faculty, to all the exciting directions of modern computational mathematics, as well as will give them an opportunity to learn more about the NSF DMS CompMath program and various funding options to support the research and educational activities in the area. The focus areas of the program for the NSF CompMath meeting 2025 range from more classical areas to novel emergent directions. Topics include the design of numerical algorithms for the solution of mathematical models based on differential equations, the development of algorithms for inverse problems, numerical analysis, scientific computing, optimization, mathematical aspects of data science and artificial intelligence, mathematical and computational aspects of the development of digital twins, quantum computing, and applications of these numerical analysis and computational tools for the solutions of pressing scientific, engineering, and societal problems.
