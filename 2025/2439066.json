 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact of this I-Corps project is the development of a diagnostic device for the early detection of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) in premature newborn babies (neonates). By monitoring patient breath, this device has the potential to prevent deaths and comorbidities associated with NEC. Early detection of NEC could facilitate timely antibiotic treatment and could be lifesaving. Moreover, reducing clinicians' fear of NEC in patients presenting with common gastrointestinal symptoms could lead to better optimization of nutrition for all premature babies. If successful, this device could decrease neonatal mortality, lower the incidence of short bowel syndrome, improve neurodevelopmental outcomes, and shorten hospital stays by promoting faster growth.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project leverages experiential learning and direct investigation of the industry ecosystem to evaluate the translation potential of the technology. The solution builds upon the development of breath collection interfaces and gas sensor technologies to advance the clinical utility of breath biomarker research. Breath collection from premature neonates presents numerous challenges, including their high respiration rate, sample dilution due to respiratory support, and the fragility of their skin. By combining innovative breath collection techniques with highly responsive and sensitive gas sensors, these challenges can be effectively addressed, enabling real-time disease monitoring for clinicians.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
