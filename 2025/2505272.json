 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial is based on the development of a vehicle immobilization device to prevent a vehicle from being stolen by someone who does not have the key to turn the engine.  Currently, auto thefts primarily are caused by the limitations of key/keyfob-based vehicle immobilizers, such as wireless keyfobs, physical locks, after-market vehicle alarms, which often rely on vulnerable external wireless communications and in-vehicle networks.  The proposed technology aims to address this problem by providing anti-theft protection that is physically isolated from these common cyber-attack vectors.  Unlike other systems, this technology does not require car owners to carry any additional token, making it more convenient to use.  In addition, this technology may be installed in all existing and new gasoline, hybrid, and electric vehicles, providing a universal solution.  This proposed device potentially may address the critical issue of vehicle security and benefit all stakeholders within the auto industry ecosystem.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on the development of an anti-theft device for vehicle theft protection.  The proposed technology is designed to leverage automotive batteries to authenticate drivers and immobilize vehicles using the authentication results.  The disruptive nature of technology lies in its utilization of the battery as a sensing and control channel, effectively safeguarding vehicles against common cyber-attack vectors such as external wireless communication and internal in-vehicle networks.  The proposed device consists of three key components:  two authentication systems to authorize each legitimate driver using battery voltage/current as the identity carrier, an adaptive and thermally-robust power control module to reduce/restore the battery\u2019s power capacity to dis/enable vehicle access, and  four important functions to enable an end-to-end vehicle immobilizer that is compliant with current standards, including estimation of vehicle status, detection of weak/faulty vehicle batteries, detection of illegitimate vehicle accesses, and automatic recharging power supplies to relieve drivers from maintenance burden.  This technology has the potential for widespread application in various battery/AC-powered systems, offering physical security in an increasingly interconnected world.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
