 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Gordon Research Conference on Carbon Capture, Utilization and Storage (GRC-CCUS) is organized to explore and disseminate emerging advances with respect to creating sustainable carbon management solutions. This conference addresses the urgent ecological and environmental need to advance sustainable carbon management solutions to meet the growing need for energy and resources while limiting detrimental environmental impacts. The conference is forward \u2013 looking and is organized to disseminate emerging advances in harnessing natural resources including soil, water, and biomass to aid in carbon management. The conference provides a platform to educate scientists and engineers across the career pipeline on the latest advances in engineered and natural solutions to capture, convert, store, and remove CO2 emissions for a sustainable future. The conference serves as platform to discuss emerging scientific and technological advances for managing rising CO2 emissions. Topics ranging from the fundamentals of carbon transformations to the role of biomass, soil, and water resources in carbon management, industrial decarbonization, and scale \u2013 up and deployment will be discussed.\r\n\r\nThe conference is designed to broaden participation of a wide range of stakeholders in advancing and co-creating transformative carbon management solutions. These stakeholders include students, early career researchers, faculty members, industry and national laboratory representatives. International engagement and collaborations will be fostered to educate and train the next generation of leaders in advancing sustainable engineered and natural carbon management solutions. Early career researchers will have the opportunity to disseminate their findings, and seek training and mentoring through the Gordon Research Seminar (GRS). New scientific and technological insights from scaling up solutions will inform the community on opportunities and challenges in unlocking the path to commercial impact. New knowledge associated with social acceptance and governance of carbon management solutions will be shared at this conference.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
