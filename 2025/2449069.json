 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact of this I-Corps project is the development of an economic method to autonomously organize semiconductors precursors into three dimensional (3D) hierarchical structures. These structures can then be converted into semiconductor devices with functions similar to modern day microelectronics devices. This method has the potential to improve microelectronic fabrication so that it avoids the expensive lithographic processes common in modern day fabrication laboratories. The ability to fabricate various microelectronic devices at low capital costs and at lower workforce skill levels will reduce both supply challenges and the dependency on imports. Successful commercialization of the technology could contribute to building a new generation of foundries with a decrease in the carbon footprint of microelectronics devices. \r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. This solution is based on the development of a guided self-assembly fabrication process of semiconductor arrays. Target atoms are harvested from a reservoir and transported to the growing front of a wire. Using symmetry and the energy-driven orientation of chemical bonds, the chelated atoms are organized into 3D assemblies, enabling fabrication across nano- to micrometers. By using the spacing and capillary bridges on deposited arrays, the technology enables deposition of new wire arrays on top of existing ones to create a hierarchical assembly. Given the controlled bottom-up approach, the composition of the arrays can be tuned across the length of the wires or across the layers enabling fabrication of diodes, gates/transistors at any location of the array. The use of fluids as carriers and assembly vehicles enables simultaneous or in tandem fabrication of arrays of complex shapes and sizes within the same array. Hierarchical assembly has the potential for use in the fabrication of 3D chips and high-density processors.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
