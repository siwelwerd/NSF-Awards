 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support for participants in the Rocky Mountain Mathematics Consortium (RMMC) Summer School on Analysis and Partial Differential Equations, to be held June 17-20, 2025 at the University of Wyoming. The Summer School will bring together leading experts in analysis, partial differential equations, and their applications - at various stages of their careers - to present recent advances, exchange ideas on open problems, and explore new directions for research. The Summer School will feature a blend of introductory short courses and more advanced lectures, designed to introduce early-career researchers to the broader mathematical community and facilitate professional connections. The mini-courses will help prepare students to engage with the more specialized components of the program, as well as other research conferences in the field.\r\n\r\nThe RMMC Summer School will highlight recent developments in Analysis and Partial Differential Equations, two areas at the forefront of international research and closely aligned with the research activities of many leading U.S. mathematics departments. The program will feature two principal lecturers, each delivering four-hour mini-courses aimed at graduate students and recent PhDs. The mini-courses are \"The frequency function method in the theory of elliptic equations,\" presented by Eugenia Malinnikova (Stanford University), and \"Schauder and boundary Harnack principles via degenerate elliptic equations,\" by Susanna Terracini (University of Turin, Italy). Additionally, approximately ten invited participants - primarily early and mid-career researchers - will give one-hour lectures. Graduate students and recent PhDs will also have the opportunity to contribute 20-minute talks, with around ten speakers chosen through a call for applications. More information on the Summer School is available at the web page https://math.asu.edu/rmmcss2025.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
