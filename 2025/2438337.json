 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact of this I-Corps project is based on the development of a digital simulation platform with applications in aerospace, automotive, energy and other industries. In aerospace, the platform\u2019s high accuracy meets the rigorous standards required for advanced systems such as electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft, helicopters, and propulsion systems. By providing precise simulations, it enables engineers to reduce design cycles while enhancing the safety and performance of vehicles. The platform's focus on computational speed also supports rapid prototyping and system optimization, making it a useful tool throughout the design process, from initial concept to final certification.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the proposed technology. The solution is based on the development of an advanced computational fluid dynamics (CFD) technology that integrates a novel physical model with higher-order numerical schemes. The new physical model is designed to improve the capture of complex turbulent fluid behaviors, while the higher-order schemes enhance solution accuracy across a variety of fluid dynamics problems. Additionally, the platform\u2019s capabilities have been expanded to address complex, real-world scenarios, including viscous flow transitions, multi-body relative motions, and fluid-structure interactions. This inclusion makes the platform well-suited to tackle fluid flow challenges in industries such as aerospace, automotive, energy, and environmental systems.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
