 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides funding for travel support for junior researchers wishing to attend a workshop on future trends in computational mechanics for design and manufacturing. The Workshop on Future Trends in Research and Education in Computational Mechanics for Design and Manufacturing, scheduled for 11-13 August 2025, in College Station, Texas, aims to broaden participation from regions and universities with limited access to such opportunities. The selection process will prioritize participants in terms of institutions, and engineering programs. By engaging these participants, the workshop will strive to create a more well-rounded ecosystem in the field of computational mechanics, ensuring that its impact extends beyond well-resourced institutions and that all stakeholders are included in discussions about the future of research and education in the field.\r\n\r\nOrganized in collaboration with the Texas A&M Engineering Experiment Station, this workshop will focus on the rapid advancements in simulation technologies, particularly those driven by Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML). It will bring together experts from academia, industry, and national laboratories to explore the impact of AI/ML on computational mechanics and education. Key topics will include promising AI and ML techniques for developing new computational tools, fostering interdisciplinary collaborations to drive innovation, and addressing the data requirements for applying these technologies effectively. Additionally, the workshop will examine how to integrate AI/ML into curricula to better prepare students for future roles in research and industry. It will also discuss how these technologies can be used responsibly, taking into account ethical considerations and their potential societal impacts. The event will feature presentations by rising faculty, discussions at various career levels, and a writing session to create a widely disseminated roadmap for the future of the field, emphasizing the integration of research and education.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
