 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fiber is a type of carbohydrate that is difficult to digest and fiber-rich diets can present nutrient absorption challenges. Several evolutionary adaptations that maximize fiber digestibility (e.g., slow gut passage time and/ or microbial fermentation) have been identified in non-human primates. However, while it is known that the microbiome converts fiber into short-chain fatty acids, its adaptive role in fiber digestibility is poorly understood. This doctoral dissertation project examines the role of the gut microbiome in fiber digestibility in three non-human primate species, contributing to our growing understanding of microbiome adaptations and functions. The study is also relevant for understanding non-human primate survival and reproduction, conservation initiatives, and captive animal care. The study promotes community engaged research and conservation education.  \r\n\r\nThis doctoral dissertation research evaluates fiber digestibility across three non-human primate species that have different feeding strategies in the wild. The study collects data on behavior/feeding, plant samples, and feces to measure fiber input and output, fiber digestibility, and the functional role of the gut microbiome.  Fecal samples are analyzed using 'shotgun' metagenomic sequencing to profile the composition and function of the gut microbiome across species and between seasons. By combining methods from nutritional ecology and microbiome research, the study expands current knowledge of primate ecology and evolution, directly informing ongoing conservation efforts.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
