 "awd_abstract_narration": "The biennial Coastal & Estuarine Summit is the nation\u2019s largest gathering of the coastal restoration and management community. Since over 40% of Americans live in coastal counties, it is essential that the Summit reflect the scope and diversity of these communities, and that it helps foster relationships that will make restoration more impactful for all members of these communities. According to a study by Green 2.0, ethnic minorities and people of multi-racial backgrounds comprise about 38% of the U.S. population, but the percentage of minorities on the boards or general staff of environmental organizations does not exceed 16%. To bring in a wider range of voices to the Summit and to build a connection among frontline leaders, this grant will: 1) help reduce the costs of attending the Summit for people who represent frontline communities and could not otherwise afford to attend; 2) foster connections among practitioners that have been historically underrepresented but are critical to expanding the benefits of coastal restoration; and 3) facilitate the sharing of information among coastal practitioners and community leaders on issues related to broadening participation in the coastal sector. \r\n\u202f \r\nThe goal of the proposed work is to advance knowledge across the coastal conservation sector and facilitate ongoing information exchange among practitioners and leaders in frontline communities. The Summit will include presentations on relevant topics for coastal communities. Support for this work will enhance participation in the Summit for individuals representing frontline communities. This award will also support the hosting of networking events which will feature expert speakers and panelists engaging in and leading discussions around issues related to leading and advancing broadening participation activities. Potential contributions of this work include: 1) Advancing a movement towards a coastal sector that more strongly embraces and promotes frontline communities and their leaders, 2) Advancing awareness of the need for leadership in fostering culture change, 3) Increasing a sense of belonging and inclusion among Summit attendees from historically underrepresented demographics and communities, 4) Increasing the participation and accessibility of the Summit and related events, and 5) Equipping Summit attendees with tools to advance their leadership skills.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
