 "awd_abstract_narration": "The impact of this I-Corps project is based on the commercialization of an innovative pretreatment method designed to enhance the performance of Granular Activated Carbon (GAC) filtration in water treatment plants focused on removing per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). PFAS have wide use in both industrial and consumer products.  However, PFAS are linked to adverse health effects, even at exceptionally low parts per trillion (ppt) levels. Once PFAS enter the environment, these substances do not easily break down, making their removal a significant challenge. The fundamental issue this solution seeks to address is the inadequate effectiveness of existing GAC filtration in removing PFAS from contaminated water, resulting in low treatment performance and increased operational costs for drinking water treatment facilities. At least 45% of U.S. tap water contains PFAS, and nearly all Americans have PFAS in their blood, underscoring the widespread nature of the problem. \r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential a new technology for removing PFAS from water. This technology is based on a novel hydrophobic ion-pairing (HIP) pretreatment for Granular Activated Carbon (GAC) filters that enables the filters to capture short-chain PFAS effectively. The HIP technique involves forming ion pairs between charged hydrophilic molecules and hydrophobic counterions, resulting in neutral hydrophobic complexes. In this pretreatment method, the interaction between charged PFAS and the HIP agent creates a hydrophobic complex, enhancing adsorption onto the GAC without altering the filter material itself or requiring complex modifications. The benefits of this approach include increased removal of short-chain PFAS in compliance with regulatory standards, extended lifespan of GAC filter columns used in water treatment facilities, improved adsorption efficiency, and reduced GAC waste.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
