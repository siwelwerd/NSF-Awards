 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support the 2025 Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on Epigenetics titled \u201cEpigenetic Variation: Mechanisms and Impact Across Systems,\u201d as well as its associated Gordon Research Seminar (GRS), titled \u201cEpigenetic Landscapes: Between Perception and Memory\u201d. The GRS (August 9-10) will provide a forum for postdocs and graduate students to present their research and discuss new ideas in the field. The goals of the GRS are to support scientific discovery in the field of epigenetics and to promote the scientific and career development of attendees by creating a collegial, welcoming, and trainee-focused environment. The GRC (August 10-15) will include presentations by trainees, early-career, and established scientists performing leading-edge research in epigenetics using a variety of model systems and approaches. The GRC will also include a Power Hour to address issues related to broadening participation and retention of talent in STEM fields. Attendance at the GRC and GRS will be capped at 200 and 70 attendees, respectively; this small conference size will help promote open discussion and meaningful interactions. \r\n\r\nEpigenetics refers to heritable changes in gene expression or phenotypes that are not caused by changes to the underlying DNA sequence. Epigenetic regulation is critical for essential processes, including tissue growth, cellular differentiation, germ cell development, response to the environment, genome stability, and transgenerational inheritance. Conversely, dysregulation of epigenetic processes impacts organismal development, fertility, and fecundity. Hence, deeper understanding of the epigenetic mechanisms that govern these processes is relevant for human health, crop production, pest control, and understanding evolution in natural populations, among other biological challenges. The Epigenetics GRC/GRS brings together scientists from varied areas of epigenetics who may not otherwise have opportunities to interact and discuss unpublished research with each other, and thus serves as a critical forum for accelerating scientific discoveries and creating new research opportunities in the field.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
