 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-technical description:\r\nHydrogels are squishy, sponge-like materials with significant potential in medicine and\r\nenvironmental science. Hydrogels are used for wound healing, drug delivery in the body, and even\r\nto clean up pollution. Made from long chains of molecules called polymers, hydrogels hold large\r\namounts of water and change shape or function depending on their design. However, designing\r\nthe most effective hydrogels for specific applications is a complex challenge. Traditional testing\r\nmethods are slow and expensive, making it difficult for researchers to quickly and efficiently\r\nidentify the best hydrogels. This prevents effective hydrogel materials from being developed for\r\nmany critical applications.\r\nThis proposal aims to leverage two innovative techniques, barcoding and pooled\r\nscreening, to accelerate the testing and development of hydrogels. The principal investigator\r\nproposes to barcode individual hydrogel materials with unique identifiers, like product barcodes\r\nin a store. These barcodes are chemical markers that can be used to track and distinguish\r\nhydrogels. Instead of testing each hydrogel separately, barcoded hydrogels can be grouped, or\r\npooled, together and exposed to the same test conditions, saving time and resources and\r\nlowering experimental variability. The barcodes make it possible to track the performance of each\r\nhydrogel individually. This proposed method will provide a way to test up to hundreds or thousands\r\nof hydrogel designs in parallel, enabling rapid evaluation and comparison of hydrogel\r\nperformance. This approach aims to speed up the discovery of improved, functional hydrogels for\r\nmedical and environmental applications.\r\nThis project will also give middle school students the opportunity to learn about hydrogels\r\nthrough hands-on demos. The principal investigator also plans to introduce biomaterials into core\r\ncollege courses and create a new elective class to introduce students to exciting careers in the\r\nfield of biomaterials.\r\n\r\nTechnical description:\r\nHydrogels are versatile biomaterials made of hydrated, cross-linked polymer networks\r\nused in tissue engineering, drug delivery, and environmental applications. However, their complex\r\ndesign and vast parameter space make it challenging to identify generalizable design principles\r\nthrough traditional, low-throughput methods, slowing and preventing the development of\r\nfunctional hydrogel materials. High-throughput techniques like barcoding and pooled screening\r\ncan accelerate the discovery of structure-function relationships. While these types of approaches\r\nhave not yet been applied to hydrogel-based biomaterials, there is significant potential to advance\r\nthis field to the same extent. This CAREER proposal aims to leverage a molecular barcoding\r\nplatform pioneered by the principal investigator for systematic evaluation of hydrogel parameters\r\nin a pooled, combinatorial manner. This approach will enable the assessment of material\r\nproperties such as degradation and cargo release and help establish generalizable design rules\r\nfor diverse hydrogel systems. By utilizing cost-effective, commercially available barcoding\r\nreagents and mass spectrometry-based detection methods, the proposed approach offers a\r\nstandardized, high-throughput tool accessible to the hydrogel community. Additionally, it will\r\nstreamline data harmonization and automate workflows. The research focuses on four main\r\nareas: (1) examining how polymer and linker designs affect hydrogel degradation, (2) studying\r\nthe impact of biomolecule size and charge on release from hydrogel matrices, (3) developing and\r\ncharacterizing hydrogel sorbents, and (4) automating screening workflows. This proposal also\r\naims to promote diversity in STEM and expose students to biomaterials-related careers,\r\nparticularly in the local medical device industry through a multi-tiered educational program that\r\nincludes the integration of biomaterials course modules into core undergraduate courses,\r\ndevelopment of an elective biomaterials course, and a STEM outreach program for middle school\r\ngirls.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
