 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant supports the next generation of researchers in control systems, automation, and robotics by funding graduate students and junior researchers to attend the 2025 American Control Conference (ACC), held in Denver, Colorado, 8-10 July 2025. The ACC is a premier venue for disseminating research on control theory, learning-based control, optimization, and intelligent systems design. The conference brings together researchers from academia, industry, and government laboratories to discuss recent advances in autonomous systems, energy networks, and cyber-physical security. The primary objective of this grant is to broaden participation by enabling students from a wide range of institutions to present their work and engage with experts in the field. Student travel support expands access to professional development opportunities and allows participants to engage with the latest scientific developments and establish valuable professional connections. The conference also includes structured professional development activities to equip students with the skills necessary to contribute to future technological advancements, supporting national interests in economic growth, infrastructure resilience, and scientific progress.\r\n\r\nThe 2025 ACC features a broad technical program that includes learning-based control, networked and distributed systems, and the intersection of artificial intelligence with control engineering. Core topics include advances in data-driven control, robust and adaptive system design, and novel transportation, healthcare, and manufacturing applications. The conference will also include dedicated sessions for career development, mentorship opportunities, and networking with leaders from both academia and industry. Attendees will have the opportunity to participate in sessions focused on broadening participation and technical panels that highlight emerging challenges and opportunities in the field. This initiative strengthens the pipeline of future control engineers and researchers by supporting student attendance, ensuring that the next generation of innovators can engage in high-impact scientific discussions and contribute to advancing the field.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
