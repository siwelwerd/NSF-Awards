 "awd_abstract_narration": "Learning a structural model of dynamic decision-making helps us better understand and predict how agents, whether human or machine, make decisions over time in changing environments. Instead of just copying actions, this approach allows us to capture both the agent\u2019s goals (preferences) and how it understands the world (environment dynamics). This provides a much deeper insight into behavior, enabling predictions about how the agent would act in new or unseen situations. Such models are valuable because they can help improve decision-making systems, allowing them to adapt and make reliable choices in complex real-world scenarios, such as personalized AI assistants, autonomous systems, or decision support tools. There is an urgent need for models and algorithms that can create such structural frameworks. The outcomes of this project will have broad applications, including areas like control systems, natural language processing, and autonomous driving. Moreover, these efforts offer valuable opportunities to enhance the optimization and reinforcement learning curriculum, engaging students from diverse backgrounds in cross-disciplinary research and K12 outreach initiatives.\r\n\r\nThis project develops machine learning models of an agent\u2019s dynamic decisions subject to structural constraints on observed behavior. Specifically, the agent\u2019s observed behavior (data) is modeled as being consistent with the inter-temporal optimization of a reward function (preferences) given a representation of how the environment evolves pursuant to control actions (dynamics). Unlike behavioral cloning models, a structural model of observed control behavior is a solid basis to perform counterfactual analysis and/or transfer learning. However, developing structural models of control is computationally challenging and the statistical properties of structural estimators are not easy to characterize. This project aims to advance the state-of-the-art on methodologies for learning structural models of control, by considering a diverse set of data (including demonstration and preferences), and by considering both online and offline settings. Finally, extensive experiments will be conducted to evaluate and apply the proposed methodologies in aligning large language models (LLMs), and in autonomous driving.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
