 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 8th Conference on Analysis, Probability, and Mathematical Physics on Fractals, to be held at Cornell University in June 2025, will bring together leading researchers and early-career mathematicians to foster collaboration, innovation, and education in this evolving field. Fractals, which play a critical role in modern mathematical research, serve as a bridge between pure and applied mathematics, with applications ranging from modeling random processes to understanding physical phenomena. The conference will provide a platform for advancing knowledge in these areas while promoting the education of the next generation of mathematicians. More information can be found at https://math.cornell.edu/cornell-conference-analysis-probability-and-mathematical-physics-fractals.\r\n\r\nThis five-day conference consists of three structured components: plenary sessions, mini-courses, and parallel sessions. Plenary talks will feature recent breakthroughs by leading researchers in topics such as differential equations, random processes, and physical models on fractal spaces. Mini-courses will provide foundational knowledge and expose participants to significant open problems, engaging advanced undergraduates, graduate students, and early-career researchers. Parallel sessions will enable all attendees to present their work and exchange ideas. By building on foundational work in the field and fostering collaboration across disciplines, the conference aims to explore new research directions in potential theory, geometric analysis, and probabilistic approaches on non-smooth and fractal spaces. This event continues a 20-year tradition of advancing knowledge, cultivating young talent, and encouraging innovation in mathematical research on fractals.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
