 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides support for students to participate in the 2025 Institute of Industrial and Systems Engineers (IISE) Annual Conference and Expo to be held 31 May to 3 June 2025, in Atlanta, Georgia. The IISE Annual Conference & Expo is interdisciplinary, bringing together engineers from different disciplines which can foster innovation and increased engagement from students with diverse interests. This conference aligns with the scientific areas supported by NSF CMMI, addressing the opportunities and challenges posed by digital technologies in the next industrial revolution, with a focus on integrating design and manufacturing within the broader life cycle ecosystem. Travel support to attend the IISE Annual Conference & Expo can broaden participation in engineering by providing students, especially those from groups historically underrepresented in engineering, with access to a professional network, mentorship opportunities, and exposure to cutting-edge research and industry practices. Engaging with a diverse community of professionals and peers at various career stages helps students build valuable connections, gain insights into career pathways, and develop a sense of belonging within the engineering field, ultimately encouraging their continued growth and participation in the profession. The diverse range of topics presented at the conference will provide students with opportunities to learn more about the methods and tools needed to create globally competitive industries focused on the creation of manufactured products and systems.\r\n\r\nThis grant will support students' conference registration and travel costs with the goal of promoting student participation at the conference, especially among students from groups often underrepresented in engineering. The selection process of the awardees will prioritize students who do not otherwise have sufficient funds from other sources (e.g., advisor, department, other travel awards) to attend the conference. The conference offers career development opportunities through special sessions, workshops, networking activities, and mentoring from experienced professionals representing a variety of career stages, institutions, and geographical regions. Participation is open to all, and the diverse lineup of speakers and organizers fosters an inclusive environment, empowering students from underrepresented groups to engage meaningfully in discussions on the future of manufacturing.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
