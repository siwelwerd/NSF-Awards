The workshop aims to connect renowned experts with early career scientists and graduate students, offering an introduction to current topics in the field, sharing scientific advancements, exchanging ideas, and encouraging collaborative research to accelerate scientific discovery. The involvement of early career scientists and graduate students will enhance their scientific education, advance their careers, and fully prepare them to contribute to the U.S. scientific workforce.\r\n\r\nTechnical Abstract\r\n\r\nUnderstanding strong correlations is crucial for discovering and designing functional materials with novel properties. These correlations and anomalous behaviors are particularly pronounced in materials containing f electrons, such as those based on lanthanide and actinide elements. Advances in the field of strongly correlated f materials will not only enhance our understanding of electron correlations but will also have significant implications for research on various families of functional materials.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
