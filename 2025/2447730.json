 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site award to Mississippi State University, located in Starkville, MS, supports the training of 10 students for 10 weeks during the summers of 2025\u20132027. Funded by the Division of Chemistry and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), the program immerses participants in collaborative research projects at the intersection of chemistry, engineering, and environmental science. Participants investigate the interconnections between water quality, fertilizer use for enhanced food production, and renewable energy, using interdisciplinary approaches to tackle these complex challenges. The program\u2019s goal is to develop environmentally engaged scientists, and a workforce prepared to address critical global issues. In addition, seminars and workshops promote entrepreneurial thinking, providing participants with tools and insights into pathways for starting small businesses.\r\n\r\nResearch projects focus on energy security, water quality, food security, and related challenges. Participants explore the conversion of biomass and energy crops into biofuels, the use of biochar (a byproduct of biofuel production) for water purification, and the enhancement of food security through biochar soil amendments. These projects involve growing biomass, converting it into biofuels, and repurposing byproducts to clean water and improve soil quality. Through these hands-on experiences, participants gain exposure to research instrumentation, fostering enthusiasm for science and equipping them with practical skills for careers in the chemical sciences or graduate school. Alongside the research experience, seminars and workshops cultivate an environmentally conscious and entrepreneurially minded cohort capable of addressing societal challenges and advancing solutions in the chemical sciences.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
