 "awd_abstract_narration": "Modeling and simulation have many research applications, ranging from large-scale national laboratories to industrial applications. The annual conference on Principles of Advanced Discrete Simulation (PADS) is the flagship conference of the ACM's Special Interest Group on Simulation and Modeling (SIGSIM). Aligned with NSF's mission, this conference serves as a vital platform for disseminating research, fostering connections among researchers, and training the next generation of scholars. Student attendance is critical to the research workforce development of this field.\r\n\r\nIn support of national science and engineering advancement, this award supports graduate students in the United States to attend the ACM SIGSIM PADS conference in New Mexico, an EPSCoR state, in June 2025, recruiting from all students accepted into the conference\u2019s Ph.D. Colloquium. The selected students gain opportunities that enhance their career paths and provide essential tools for advancing science in both theoretical and applied research on modeling and simulation. This NSF funding significantly impacts the careers of emerging researchers in modeling and simulation, playing a valuable role in developing the research workforce within the field.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
