 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will provide support for the 2025 RNA Editing Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) entitled \u201cBiological Discoveries and Emerging Technologies in RNA Modifications and Editing\u201d to be held in Lucca (Barga), Italy, on March 15\u201316, 2025. Organized by and for early-career researchers, this GRS will provide a dedicated forum for graduate students and postdoctoral researchers to present their ongoing work, share ideas, and develop professional skills before the associated Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on RNA Editing. All attending trainees will have the opportunity to present their research in either an oral or poster format and will benefit from mentorship opportunities including a keynote lecture from a prominent leader in the field and a panel focused on developing scientific writing skills. The GRS aims to promote scientific exchange, mentorship, community building, and fostering an inclusive environment. By offering early-career researchers the opportunity to share unpublished findings and connect with their peers, the GRS will support the development of the next generation of scientific leaders and innovators in RNA biology. \r\n\r\nRNA modifications and editing are essential to gene regulation, impacting key processes like translation, immunity, and disease progression. While these modifications are present in nearly all organisms, many of their biological functions remain poorly understood. The 2025 GRS will highlight emerging discoveries in two sessions, \u201cRNA Modifications Across Biological Systems\u201d and \u201cTools and Technologies in RNA Editing and Modifications.\u201d These sessions will emphasize fundamental discoveries and technological advances with a focus on presenting unpublished data to inspire scientific exchange and interdisciplinary collaboration. By providing a space for early-career researchers to network and develop scientific and professional skills, this seminar will advance research in RNA biology and contribute to the development of tools and technologies with applications in health, biotechnology, and agriculture.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
