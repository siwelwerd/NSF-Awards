 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support the participation of students from institutions of higher learning in the United States in the 16th Power and Energy Conference at Illinois (PECI), to be held at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign in April 2025. The conference program will include paper presentations, keynote lectures, tutorial sessions, and panel discussions. Networking events between students and power system researchers from industry and government laboratories are also planned.\r\n\r\nThe conference will provide students with the unique opportunity to engage with field experts through attending session talks, immersing themselves in enlightening keynote presentations, and fostering valuable connections during social events. PECI is the oldest annual, student-run IEEE international conference about power and energy technology. The conference is organized by the IEEE PES/PELS/IAS Joint Graduate Student Chapter at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and has become a perfect place in the Midwest for industry and academic researchers to discuss future power and energy topics such as renewable energy, electrified transportation, smart grid reliability, security of cyber-physical systems, and power electronics for emerging technologies. Attendees will have the opportunity to present their research and to learn about each other's work to gain a broad perspective on ongoing topics in energy systems research.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
