 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the travel of scientists, particularly early-career researchers (including students), working at institutions in the United States to participate in the Plant Genetics and Developmental Biology Symposium that will be held at the University of Pennsylvania on August 22, 2025. The symposium bridges the historical evolution and future trajectory of plant developmental biology. This research field is critical for addressing global challenges such as food security and biodiversity conservation. It is a cornerstone of our understanding of how plants grow, reproduce, interact with other organisms and adapt to their environments. Studying the mechanisms that control plant development at molecular, cellular, and systemic levels has revealed principles that bridge fundamental biology with applied sciences, including agriculture and biotechnology. The symposium will create significant impacts by bringing together scientists across multiple generations. It aims to inspire undergraduate students and other early-stage researchers through interactive sessions and will explore practical strategies for integrating plant science into pre-college education. The event highlights varied professional opportunities, featuring speakers from academia, industry, science communication, and education.\r\n \r\nThe symposium will provide a unique platform to explore the historic evolution of plant developmental biology over the past 50 years which have marked the dawn of plant molecular biology, the rise of Arabidopsis as a model system, and an explosion in functional genomics research. This symposium will celebrate scientific milestones in the field, and will also critically examine the trajectory of the field, offering attendees a rich context to shape its future. To achieve the symposium\u2019s aim of reflecting on historical discoveries to guide future research, it will include three sessions: 1) The early days of plant developmental biology; 2) The rise of Arabidopsis as a model system; and 3) New systems and frontiers. This symposium will unite researchers in this field, from pioneers with decades of contributions to various aspects of plant development to recent graduates developing cutting-edge tools in this field, featuring a multigenerational dialogue about the past, present, and future of plant developmental biology. By embedding contemporary breakthroughs within the context of historical evolution, the symposium aims to inspire innovative perspectives and strategic directions for the field. Through this integrative approach, participants, especially early career researchers will gain not only a deeper appreciation for the discipline's milestones but also a visionary outlook on its future to solve pressing global issues in the decades ahead.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
