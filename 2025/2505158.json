 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 28th Annual Quantum Information Processing Conference (QIP 2025), the premier international conference on the theory of quantum information science, is co-hosted by Duke University and NC State University in Raleigh, North Carolina, from February 24\u201328, 2025. This conference serves as a global platform for researchers in quantum computing, cryptography, quantum foundations, information theory, and many-body physics to present and discuss groundbreaking advancements. Despite the critical role of mathematics in quantum information science, U.S.-based mathematicians are currently less represented in the QIP community, hindering opportunities for broader interdisciplinary collaboration. To address this, the project provides 40 fellowships for U.S.-based students and early-career researchers in the mathematical sciences. These fellowships align directly with the NSF mission by fostering the progress of quantum information science, strengthening the workforce, and driving innovation in a field with broad societal and technological implications.\r\n\r\nQuantum information science has deep ties to mathematics, with foundational contributions from applied and computational mathematics, algebra, analysis, and probability among others. This project supports the participation of U.S.-based students and early-career researchers in the mathematical sciences by providing 40 travel fellowships to attend QIP 2025. The fellowships aim to empower talented young mathematicians to engage in cutting-edge research and interdisciplinary interaction opportunities with quantum information science researchers from other disciplines. Fellows will benefit from research talks, poster sessions, rump sessions, industrial sessions, networking opportunities, and interdisciplinary exposure, significantly advancing their professional development. Ultimately, this initiative supports the development of the next generation of quantum researchers, advancing the field and contributing to the NSF mission.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
