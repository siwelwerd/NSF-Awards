 "awd_abstract_narration": "This I-Corps project is based on the development of a tool to assess mental health conditions using wearable sensors to monitor stress. Currently, insurance companies and clinicians rely on patient self-reports, psychological assessments, and limited physiological monitoring such as pulse, heart and respiratory rate, and the electrical activity of the brain to assess mental health conditions. However, these methods are often inconsistent and prone to error. This technology is based on the use of a sensor to measure cortisol levels in the body, which is the primary stress hormone. Alterations in cortisol levels have been shown to correspond to stress and mental state. This technology may fill the critical gap in how mental health is measured and treated. The goal is to improve outcomes for patients with mental health conditions.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of a quantitative cortisol measurement tool based on acoustic wave sensors and molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs). This solution is a wearable technology that aims to provide a continuous assessment of the mental state of a patient based on cortisol levels in the body. This sensor technology combines MIPs with acoustic wave devices to provide continuous cortisol monitoring. Cortisol is targeted using a MIPs bioreceptor that is capable of operating in situ continuously. The binding of cortisol in the MIP leads to a shift in the resonant frequency of the acoustic wave devices made of piezoelectric materials. The frequency shift can be electrically read by applying voltages to the acoustic wave devices. This innovation may enable better assessment of mental health conditions, better treatment decisions, and improved patient outcomes.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
