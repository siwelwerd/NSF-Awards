 "awd_abstract_narration": "This NSF-funded workshop is dedicated to understanding the complex systems of particles found in soil, mud, sand, and clay. These particles play a crucial role in addressing significant challenges such as climate change, agricultural productivity, and soil erosion. The workshop will take place from December 14-15, 2024, at the Carnegie Mellon University campus in Kigali, Rwanda, and will bring together researchers, policymakers, and students from both the United States and Africa.  The conference aims to allow the currently disconnected research communities from geosciences, materials science, nanoscale chemistry, and complex systems to build common knowledge, grow relationships and exchanges for further understanding and collaborations. By tackling fundamental scientific challenges and practical applications of geoparticle systems, the workshop will contribute to global sustainability, economic growth, and poverty alleviation in regions heavily affected by soil degradation and climate-related issues.\r\n\r\nThe workshop will address three main scientific challenges: developing comprehensive theoretical models for diverse particle systems, a better understanding of the formation and disintegration of fibrous and other metastructures and a unified approach to evaluate the impact of these factors on large-scale behaviors such as landslides and soil stability. Experts from various disciplines will engage in discussions on themes such as particle interactions at the nanoscale, the physics of granular flows, and the stress transfer mechanisms in soils. Experts will discuss particle interactions, granular flows, and stress transfer in soils through keynote presentations, panel discussions, and brainstorming sessions. A key outcome will be a detailed perspective article outlining new research directions, including the creation of theoretical frameworks and methodologies for monitoring and controlling metastructures. This document will serve as a roadmap for future collaborations and innovations, guiding efforts to develop technologies and methods for better environmental and agricultural practices. By fostering cross-continental partnerships, the workshop will advance scientific knowledge, support education and broadening participation, and contribute to societal welfare through improved soil and environmental health.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
