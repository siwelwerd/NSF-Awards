 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computational techniques are impacting the way in which scientific and engineering research are conducted. Impressive computational advances have been made in different scientific areas including biology, medicine, and drug discovery. Given the great importance of these areas in society, it is essential to advance the state of the art in all three topics. Such advances can be made when scientists come together to discuss the best possible diagnosis tools, treatment procedures, and drug therapies for various diseases. The International Conference on Computational Advances in Bio and Biomedical Sciences (ICCABS) unites leading scientists in academia and industry serving as a collaboration platform. These collaborations are expected to result in the solution of challenging problems in all three fields. Topics to be discussed include, but are not limited to, biological big data analytics, biomedical image processing, biomedical data and literature mining, and biological modeling and simulation.\r\n\r\nThe funds provided by this award will be used to support the travel expenses of trainees including US-based undergraduate and graduate students, and post-doctoral fellows.  Students funded by this award will learn from a state-of-the-art scientific and educational conference program, an opportunity to present their work and receive feedback, and an opportunity to network with peers and other members of this broad community.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
