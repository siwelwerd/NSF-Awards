 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact of this I-Corps project is based on the development of innovative metal inks for high-resolution printing used in the additive manufacturing process that is used to produce electronic devices. Emerging printing methods like electrohydrodynamic (EHD) printing require a new generation of functional inks, and this technology fills that need with stable, high-resolution inks that can enhance the performance of electronic devices. These inks also make it possible to produce smaller, lighter parts, reducing the quantity of materials and energy needed. This advance could also benefit industries such as automotive, biomedical, smart packaging, and touch displays.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. The technology is an innovative method to produce metal nano-inks for the manufacturing of electronic devices. These metal inks are designed for high-precision printing techniques, like electrohydrodynamic (EHD) and aerosol jet printing. The process involves an in-situ capping process to synthesize ultra-stable nanoparticle dispersions with a wide range of particle sizes, morphologies and materials. This highly tunable process meets the ink requirements of various printer systems, including EHD inkjet printing and aerosol jet printing. The nanoinks \r\naddress the limitations of existing commercial products and have been successfully tested for EHD printing. These inks provide over 10 times the resolution of existing products, allowing for the creation of smaller, more compact electronic devices.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
