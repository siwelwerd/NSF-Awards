 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports participation of US based mathematicians in the workshop \"Ventotene International Workshops VII: Higher dimensional hyperbolic geometry\", which will take place from September 8-13, 2025 in Ventotene, Italy. In light of  recent major advances in higher dimensional hyperbolic geometry, the main goal of the conference is to have a timely meeting of researchers to educate participants on these advances and discuss new directions. The conference will help educate early career mathematicians on these advances  and help bring them to the forefront of this active research area. The majority of funding will support students and participants with recent Ph.D.s. \r\n\r\nThe workshop will consist of three mini-courses on different aspects of higher dimensional hyperbolic geometry:, 1) Sphere Packings, Reflection Groups, and Arithmetic by Alex Kontorovich (Rutgers University), 2) Coxeter polytopes by Bruno Martelli (University of Pisa) and 3) Arithmeticity, superrigidity, and totally geodesic submanifolds by Nick Miller (University of Oklahoma). The workshop will also feature research talks and informal discussions and a lightning talk session for junior researchers. Participants will include leading U.S. and European researchers from the different areas related to the topic of the workshop, as well as younger researchers, both graduate students and postdocs. The lecture series will provide an opportunity for the researchers to educate each other and the workshop participants about  techniques and recent advances in the area. By the end of the workshop, the participants are expected to be able to draw  enough parallels between the different techniques to be able to put them to use and open new directions of research stemming  from the interaction among the topics. The organizing committee will encourage and support broad and diverse participation. The workshop website is at:https://www.ventoteneinternationalworkshops.net\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
