 "awd_abstract_narration": "The IEEE International Conference on RFID (IEEE RFID) is the premiere venue to present multi-disciplinary cutting-edge research in RFID, wireless sensor networks, energy-harvesting, localization, and low-energy wireless communications -- topics which all touch on next-generation wireless technologies. These cutting-edge research areas are key enablers for the Internet of Things (IoT) and machine-to-machine communications. This travel grant will allow continued growth and participation of early-career U.S. researchers in this strategically important community. With a history of 19 years, the IEEE RFID conference series has become the major event in this community with strong emphasis on industry-academic partnership, attracting more than half of the attendees from industry. \r\n\r\nThe 19th IEEE RFID conference will be held in Atlanta, GA on April 22-24, 2025 and co-located with two other IEEE conferences, the IEEE Digital Twins and Parallel Intelligence (DTPI) and the newly launched IEEE Additively Manufactured Electronics Systems (AMES), as well as a number of networking events and industry sessions that are part of the Cyber-Physical Radio Week. To support the training of the next-generation scientists and engineers working on wireless technologies and applications, this NSF travel grant will provide travel support for 20 U.S. students or post-doctoral researchers to attend and present their papers at the conference. Their participation in the conference and co-located events will be valuable opportunities for them to learn the newest research and development trends in this field and interact with other attendees including industry participants. This travel grant will contribute to the U.S. STEM workforce development and have long-term and broad impacts on the career developments of participating students and postdoctoral researchers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
