 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will develop a multiscale experimental/modeling framework to obtain a fundamental understanding of the coupled ice/salt crystallization phenomena in low/zero clinker systems. Freeze-thaw causes billions of dollars of damage to concrete infrastructure and buildings in the US yearly. Impacts of climate change such as increased number and severity of freeze-thaw events are predicted to aggravate this damage. The socioeconomic consequences of these reductions in serviceability include impediments to economic activity and exacerbated inequities in access to quality infrastructure in marginalized communities. By exploring new materials with reduced environmental impact, this project will lead to the development of more resilient concrete formulations, significantly extending the lifespan of infrastructure. Project outcomes will open significant pathways for broad implementation of low/zero clinker systems in building and infrastructure applications. The project supports national interests by promoting scientific progress, improving infrastructure resilience, and reducing carbon emissions. It also enhances educational opportunities and STEM diversity through exposure of K-12 students and teachers to novel technologies and sustainability concepts. Furthermore, development of concrete sustainability seminars and advanced academic courses will lead to a more knowledgeable STEM workforce. \r\n\r\nThe technical goals of this research are to elucidate the mechanisms of entrained air void formation/stabilization, saturation, and coupled ice/salt crystallization damage in low/zero clinker cementitious materials. Using a combination of multiscale experimental methods, molecular dynamics simulations, and advanced characterization techniques, the project seeks to understand the physico-mechano-chemical interactions at play. The project will develop a comprehensive multiscale experimental/modeling framework to study these interactions, linking microscopic characteristics to macroscopic performance. These findings will inform the creation of highly durable concrete mixtures suitable for cold environments. Ultimately, the project aims to produce a performance model to predict the longevity of low/zero clinker materials under freeze-thaw conditions, providing a pathway for their broader implementation in sustainable building and infrastructure applications. Microstructures of low/zero clinker systems could be engineered from the bottom-up to mitigate damage due to crystallization stresses. This award will advance the specific state-of-the-art in low/zero clinker systems and more broadly brittle porous materials from several scientific and technological perspectives. This research will also advance the knowledge base in material science, porous media mechanics, computational science, and advanced analytical and imaging techniques.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
