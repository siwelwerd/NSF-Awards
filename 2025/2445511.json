 "awd_abstract_narration": "This I-Corps project focuses on a permanent solution for people who have high blood pressure caused by stiff arteries. Stiff arteries affect up to 20 million people over the age of 60. The solution is a medical device that is implanted through minimally invasive procedures, serving the patients who are not responsive to medication. The treatment population can benefit from a higher quality of life and a lower risk of complications including stroke, heart failure, heart attack, kidney failure, and vision loss. In addition to increased patient health, this solution can result in a reduction of expensive surgeries associated with cardiovascular diseases and strokes. \r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. This technology is based on the development of a physical approach to reduce systolic blood pressure. Within a pulse of blood from the heart, energy is usually distributed through the arteries due to their compliance. However, as people age, the arteries stiffen, leading to reduced buffering of this pulse wave and ultimately to isolated systolic hypertension. This disease is difficult to adapt to, since it stems from a physical change in the molecules that make up the walls of the blood vessels. The solution restores the native compliance of the blood vessels using an implantable device, which then brings the patient's blood pressure back to a healthy state. This solution differs from current treatments by directly treating stiff arteries, which are one of the most critical risk factors for the development of cardiovascular diseases.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
