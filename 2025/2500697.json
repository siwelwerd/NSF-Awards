 "awd_abstract_narration": "Public abstract\r\nThe Gordon Research Conference on Polar Marine Science is held every 2 years and provides a high profile and international platform for highly interactive discussions. These meetings deal largely with new observations and unpublished results, leading to the development of conceptual frameworks and new collaborations. This version of the conference will bring together Arctic and Antarctic sea ice researchers to develop a network of interdisciplinary polar scientists. Knowledge of polar marine sea ice systems is necessary for understanding ocean circulation, predicting sea level rise, estimating oceanic CO2 uptake, and for managing fisheries and biodiversity conservation, and is therefore relevant to both local communities and global society. In addition, the open discussion format and international participation fosters interaction between participants, giving early career scientists the opportunity to develop a broad network of peers.\r\n\r\nTechnical abstract\r\nThis 2025 Gordon Research Conference on Polar Marine Science, titled \u201cSea Ice as a Nexus in Polar Seas Between the Ocean and the Atmosphere\u201d aims to convene a diverse collection of national and international scientists to discuss cutting-edge and interdisciplinary research on the impact of sea ice on polar oceans and atmosphere. Topics to be covered include 1) how sea ice shapes the physics, biogeochemistry and ecosystems of polar oceans; 2) the physical and chemical properties of sea ice ecosystems; 3) sea ice supported biodiversity; 4) how sea ice can promote evolutionary mechanisms; and 5) sea ice as a proxy for life on solar system icy moons. The conference, along with the preceding early career seminar, will foster discussions between early, mid and late career stage researchers on interdisciplinary and cutting-edge polar sea ice science. The funds requested by this proposal will be used to enhance the participation of early career scientists, as well as the excellence and international diversity of attendees.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
