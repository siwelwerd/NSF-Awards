 "awd_abstract_narration": "Thermal management is a major bottleneck in electronics cooling. Traditional techniques can no longer provide the necessary cooling. State-of-the-art devices use phase change (condensation and boiling), but this is limited by the direction and magnitude of gravity. The proposed concept overcomes this limitation by amplifying gravity using acoustic waves for improving heat transfer. The outcomes of the proposed work will make important contributions to basic science and benefit society by sustaining progress in the semiconductor industry. The project includes integrated education and outreach programs to motivate, inspire, and enrich the educational experience of K-12 students.\r\n\r\nUsing experiments and modeling, the goal of the research program is to develop a comprehensive framework to effectively manipulate droplets and bubbles during phase change for enhancing heat transfer rates for thermal management applications. By superposing gravity with an acoustic field, the research program aims to demonstrate unprecedented heat transfer rates in condensation and boiling. Using state-of-the-art thermal-fluidic experimental facility and theoretical and numerical modeling, the research program investigates the heat transfer rates in condensation and boiling with three principal objectives: 1) improving the heat transfer rate in dropwise condensation and the critical heat flux in pool boiling by superposing gravity with tunable radiation pressure of acoustic waves, 2) developing a theoretical framework and analytical model for acoustically enhanced condensation and boiling, and 3) implementing acoustic wave-assisted film-wise condensation. The proposed research is expected to advance basic science by producing new knowledge that enables beyond-gravity condensation and boiling. The work will benefit society by enabling forward progress in the semi-conductor industry by providing efficient cooling for the next-generation compact microelectronic devices. It also benefits space exploration studies in microgravity environments where condensation and boiling are practically impossible due to the absence of gravity.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
