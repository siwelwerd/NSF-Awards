 "awd_abstract_narration": "The regional conference \"Joint Alabama--Florida Conference on Differential Equations, Dynamical Systems and Applications (JAF DEDS)\" organized by the departments of Mathematics at The University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB), Auburn University Mathematics and Statistics Department, Florida International University (FIU) and Florida State University (FSU) Mathematics Departments will take place in Birmingham, AL, May 21-22, 2025. This meeting will be the third event in a sequence of annual JAF DEDS conferences moving between Auburn, UAB, FIU, FSU. The sizable growth of applied mathematicians specializing in partial differential equations and applied dynamical systems in the states of Alabama and Florida has led to new level of research activity in mathematical biology, fluid dynamics, medical imaging, mathematical physics, applied harmonic analysis and spectral theory. This regional conference series connects newly formed and existing research groups and provides opportunity for dissemination of recent results, especially to early career researchers without federal funding, facilitating interaction between an increasing number of regional graduate students and the internationally recognized experts in the field. The Third JAF DEDS Conference will be preceded by a graduate students day on May 20th, 2025, featuring two mini-courses by guest presenters and a professional development panel. Priority for financial support will be given to those with no other sources of support and special attention will be given to graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and early career researchers. \r\n \r\nThe tools and techniques from dynamical systems have been used to establish existence and investigate stability of special solutions (pulses, traveling waves, steady states, and fronts) for large variety of differential equations. These solution are often used to model complex physical phenomena across a range of applications, including evolution of surface water waves, coherent structures in optics, combustion phenomena, and plasma dynamics. Motivated by the recent progress, the scientific program of the conference will be centered around a variety of equations from the mathematical physics modeling optical systems, fluid motion and waves in novel materials. These systems are described by equations of Klein-Gordon or Nonlinear Schrodinger type and are either Hamiltonian or dissipative in nature. Understanding them will improve our theoretical knowledge and provide new insights into practical aspects of nonlinear optics, electronic transport in irregular media, new materials, and fluid dynamics. The goal of this conference is to connect researchers working in different aspects of PDE's and Dynamical Systems and to explore the deep connections between these fields, as well as to stimulate interactions among regional experts in these areas, graduate students and junior researchers.
