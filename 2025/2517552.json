 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is related to the support for the 2025 Compound Semiconductor Week (CSW) Conference. CSW is the premier forum for science, technology, and applications of compound semiconductors, combining the International Symposium on Compound Semiconductors (ISCS) and International Conference on Indium Phosphide and Related Materials (IPRM) in a single venue. CSW 2025 will provide a unique platform for sharing the latest advancements in compound semiconductors, with a particular emphasis on interdisciplinary approaches to solve critical challenges in the field. The scope will cover the entire spectrum of compound semiconductor research, from fundamental physics to novel electronic and photonic device architectures and integrated systems. The conference will feature a mix of plenary and invited talks, technical sessions, and interactive poster presentations designed to stimulate in-depth technical discussions and foster collaborative research. By hosting technical sessions and cross-disciplinary discussions, CSW 2025 aims to push the boundaries of semiconductor research and accelerate the adoption of novel technologies in real-world applications. CSW covers important topics related to photonics materials and device/integration science.\r\n\r\nCSW 2025 will bring together world-leading researchers, scientists, and engineers to present pioneering work in areas such as III-V, II-VI, GaN, SiC, and emerging materials such as two-dimensional semiconductors and ultra-wide bandgap materials, providing a platform for sharing the latest advancements and breakthroughs in compound semiconductor science and technology. Participant support will be in the form of stipends for US students and early career professionals to help cover their registration/travel and related costs, with the goal to increase US students and professionals\u2019 participation. Through this support the conference aims to nurture the next generation of compound semiconductor scientists and engineers, thereby increasing participation in STEM fields in the US. Outreach efforts will include mentoring activities related to career development and navigating academic and industrial research paths. These activities will help prepare students and early career professionals to become future leaders in academia, industry, and government research. CSW 2025 will also serve as a venue for early career researchers to present their work and network with established experts in the field, promoting interdisciplinary research and development.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
