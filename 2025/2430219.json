 "awd_abstract_narration": "SC-Share is a regional planning activity that brings together higher education institutions in South Carolina to identify and address shared needs in research data, computational resources, and training.  This initiative focuses on enhancing cyberinfrastructure (CI) resources essential for higher education.  The project team consists of representatives from Clemson University, the University of South Carolina, Claflin University, Benedict College and Furman University, reflecting a diverse range of institutions including research-intensive universities, Historically Black Colleges & Universities (HBCUs), and primarily undergraduate colleges. The project\u2019s goal is to foster a collaborative community throughout South Carolina while encouraging participation from the Southeast region.\r\n\r\nThe project creates opportunities for student training and establish pathways to graduate programs. This involves enhancing communication between campus Chief Information Officers (CIOs) and faculty to better understand and overcome both perceived and actual barriers to accessing necessary resources. SC-Share year one activities include forming the steering group, conducting a stakeholder survey, and hosting a planning workshop to explore the impacts on workforce development in data science and analytics.  In the second year, the project includes training events for students.\r\n\r\nThis project is jointly funded by the Campus Cyberinfrastructure (CC*) program, and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
