 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will contribute to the national need for well-educated computer scientists by supporting the retention and graduation of high-achieving students with demonstrated financial need at the University of Denver, a private institution committed to the public good. Over its six-year duration, this Track 1 project will provide scholarships to 19 unique full-time students pursuing bachelor\u2019s degrees in computer science, a high-demand STEM field. This project will offer first-year students four years of scholarship support, designed to address their financial need and support their academic success. The project will implement a variety of high-impact activities, including cohort-based courses in calculus and computer science, professional development modules, and peer and faculty mentorship. Scholars will also participate in a dedicated early-start program to foster development of social bonds and may engage in paid summer research experiences as they progress in their studies. This initiative seeks to broaden participation in the computing workforce by ensuring that low-income students complete their degrees and successfully transition into the technology industry or graduate programs. The project will include a comprehensive evaluation plan to assess the relative effectiveness of financial support, academic programming, and social connections. The goal is to identify the most effective methods for supporting student retention, persistence, and career success in the field of computer science.\r\n\r\nThe overall goal of this project is to increase STEM degree completion of high-achieving low-income undergraduates with demonstrated financial need. To achieve this, the project will address financial, academic, and social barriers that hinder student success. Providing scholarships to address unmet financial needs will ensure that financial constraints do not impede academic progress. Students will participate in an early-start program, cohort-based courses with faculty mentors, and peer mentoring that all foster a strong sense of belonging and community, which are critical factors for persistence and success in STEM. The project will also offer professional development opportunities, such as paid summer research internships and career preparation workshops, to help students gain practical experience and career readiness. The research will explore the effectiveness of the combined interventions of financial aid, academic programming, and mentorship, in improving retention, academic performance, and graduation rates. It will also examine how these strategies contribute to students' long-term success in STEM fields. Evaluation will be based upon quantitative data, such as graduation rates and GPA, as well as qualitative feedback from participants. Results will be disseminated through academic publications, conferences, and a project website to inform best practices for supporting low-income students in STEM. This project is funded by NSF's Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics program, which seeks to increase the number of academically talented students with demonstrated financial need who earn degrees in STEM fields. It also aims to improve the education of future STEM workers, and to generate knowledge about academic success, retention, transfer, graduation, and academic/career pathways of students with financial need.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
