 "awd_abstract_narration": "Previous research has found that social factors influence linguistic differences among language users. However, individuals can hold numerous social identities, which may intersect with each other to influence linguistic variation. This doctoral dissertation project examines the factors that lead to linguistic similarities and differences between social groups, and how this relates to individuals\u2019 understanding of the place where they live. In doing so, this research advances scientific theories of how linguistic patterns vary among language users and dynamically change over time. Additional benefits to society include educational and workforce development opportunities for undergraduate research assistants who receive training in research methods. In addition, data are publicly shared through community and academic repositories. Finally, the data collected in this project may be used to develop educational materials and promote awareness of dialect variation.\r\n\r\nThis doctoral dissertation project investigates the effect of social meanings on language variation and change. This project advances two related goals. The first goal increases a scientific understanding of the factors that lead to linguistic similarity or differences between social groups. The second goal identifies associations between certain linguistic features and geography and how these associations influence linguistic behavior. Because these language-place associations may or may not be shared across specific social lines, this project asks if they play a role in explaining why speakers of different social groups do or do not share certain linguistic characteristics. These research questions are addressed through long-term observation and immersion in the community of interest, to gain an understanding of how community members understand the place where they live, and interviews with a sample of community members. Linguistic characteristics of interest, consisting of certain vowels and consonants, are acoustically measured and quantified. Statistical models that include both linguistic factors and social factors are used to identify predictors of linguistic behavior.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
