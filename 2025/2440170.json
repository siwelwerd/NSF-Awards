 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ACM SIGCOMM Internet Measurement Conference (IMC) is the premier venue for presenting innovative research on Internet measurement, fostering collaboration, and advancing knowledge in the field. The 24th IMC will take place in Madrid, Spain, from 4 November 2024 to 6 November 2024, bringing together researchers and practitioners to exchange ideas and showcase the latest developments. This travel grant program, with a proposed budget of $19,000, aims to support 10\u201315 undergraduate and graduate students from US institutions in attending the conference. By participating, students will have the opportunity to present their research, engage with peers and experts, and cultivate the skills necessary to become leaders in the field. These travel grants will serve to widen the audience attending the Internet Measurement Conference (IMC), raising the level of interaction and the potential for new collaboration, new investigations, and higher quality research. By facilitating broader attendance, the program aspires to foster a richer exchange of ideas, stimulate new partnerships, and strengthen the IMC research community. Supporting student involvement in IMC 2024 will not only expand the conference\u2019s impact but also inspire the next generation of Internet measurement researchers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
