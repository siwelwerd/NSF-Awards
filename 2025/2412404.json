 "awd_abstract_narration": "The acquisition of a laser diffraction particle size analyzer at the University of New Mexico (UNM) will transform how scientists and students investigate pressing environmental and societal challenges. By analyzing the size and shape of particles in soil, sediment, and airborne dust, this instrument will generate insights into Earth\u2019s past and future, from understanding environmental change through sedimentary records to assessing air quality in vulnerable communities. One important application of this technology will be to address environmental health risks in communities where contaminated dust from abandoned mines poses a significant health risk. Additionally, this state-of-the-art tool will provide UNM students, with hands-on experience in cutting-edge scientific methods, preparing them for careers in the geologic and environmental sciences.\r\n \r\nThe laser diffraction particle size analyzer supported by this project will be equipped with a dynamic imaging accessory, which enables high-precision measurement of particle size and shape across a wide range of scales, catalyzing research in geomorphology, carbon cycling, paleoclimatology, and geohealth. By providing a robust method for analyzing the full particle size and shape distributions of soil, sediment, and aerosol samples, the instrument will support investigations into sediment transport dynamics, microbial ecosystems in extreme environments, and the environmental impact of dust particles from abandoned uranium mines. The project includes an undergraduate research project focused on assessing the particle size distributions of airborne particles transported from an abandoned uranium mine, with implications for air quality in the Laguna Pueblo community. Overall, acquisition of this particle size analyzer will complement existing capabilities at UNM, facilitate interdisciplinary collaborations, and provide hands-on analytical training for students through research and teaching.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
