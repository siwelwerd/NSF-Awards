 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the 13th Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on Radiation and Climate, to be held at Bates College in Lewiston, Maine, 20-25 July 2025. Additional support is provided for the seventh Gordon Research Seminar (GRS), convened over the two days preceding the GRC. The GRS is a pre-conference meeting targeted specifically at students and early-career scientists, intended to provide an environment in which participants with comparable levels of experience and education can come together to discuss their current research and build networks for long-term collaboration. This year's GRC is focused on improving understanding of key uncertainties of the climate system and its response to external forcing, with particular emphasis on new ways to connect observations and models across spatial scales. The focus area is motivated by novel Earth observations and applications of artificial intelligence to climate modeling.\r\n\r\nThe GRC and GRS have scientific broader impacts by serving as a venue for the exchange of results and ideas among researchers attempting to understand the radiative processes that govern weather and climate. The meeting is expected to be particularly advantageous for early-career scientists, as it is formulated to promote in-depth interactions among junior and senior scientists over the course of a week, in a conducive setting of manageable size with few distractions. The topics to be addressed are of societal interest given the key role of radiative effects in determining Earth's climate.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
