 "awd_abstract_narration": "In preK-12 contexts, students with Autism Spectrum Disorder have historically faced barriers in accessing and actively engaging in STEM education experiences that support the development of computational thinking knowledge and skills. This lack of access limits opportunities for neurodivergent learners to choose and pursue STEM careers and futures. While high-quality Computational Thinking curricula and materials exist, most are not designed to support the unique learning needs of students with Autism Spectrum Disorder, particularly in middle school contexts. To address this critical gap in STEM education, this project draws on the expertise of practitioners and researchers to collaboratively design and implement accessible Computational Thinking curricula tailored specifically for middle school students with Autism Spectrum Disorder. By fostering inclusion and diversity in STEM education, the initiative not only aligns with national demands for a more skilled labor pool but also empowers neurodivergent individuals to engage with technology and innovation. Furthermore, the project intends to create a replicable Computational Thinking curricula design framework for educators and policymakers seeking to create a more inclusive and representative STEM education landscape in their contexts. As societal reliance on advances in technology continues to grow, this project holds the potential to strengthen both individual capability and national competitiveness, ultimately contributing to a more equitable society. \r\n \r\nThis project involves a research-practitioner partnership designed to develop, implement, and evaluate accessible Computational Thinking curricula for middle school students with Autism Spectrum Disorder. Building on the prior work of this partnership, the project focuses on making Computational Thinking curricula accessible to students in grades 6-8 over three years, with Year 1 dedicated to curriculum development and Years 1-3 to implementation and assessment in two school settings through a two-group repeated measures experimental design. The research-practice partnership brings together researchers from Youngstown State University and practitioners from two local middle schools who serve students with Autism Spectrum Disorder. Specifically, the project team will: 1) conduct a needs assessment to investigate the accommodations and adaptations needed to make two existing computing curricula accessible to 6th and 8th grade students with Autism Spectrum Disorder; 2) use the needs assessment and a previously developed 7th grade computing curriculum to create a sequential three-grade-level accessible computing curriculum for middle school students with Autism Spectrum Disorder; 3) implement the multi-grade-level accessible Computational Thinking curriculum sequence in 6th through 8th grade contexts serving neurodivergent learners and evaluate its impact on learning; and, 4) examine how and to what extent teachers of students with Autism Spectrum Disorder perceive the sufficiency and effectiveness of the project's approach and process for developing adaptations and accommodations for a computing curriculum tailored to meet the unique learning needs of their students. Both qualitative and quantitative data will be collected and analyzed to document and disseminate processes, artifacts, and outcomes of the project's design and development of adaptations and accommodations, students' and teachers' experiences with the accessible curricula, and teachers' perceptions of the sufficiency and effectiveness of the adaptation and accommodation development process. This project responds to a need in STEM education research and development for evidence-based approaches to Computational Thinking education that is inclusive of neurodivergent learners. The products and research findings from this work will contribute to the field's understanding of curriculum design work that, along with teacher supports, can meet the unique learning needs of not only middles school students with Autism Spectrum Disorder specifically, but also, more broadly, other student populations that face similar barriers in accessing and actively engaging in STEM education experiences that support computational thinking knowledge and skills.
