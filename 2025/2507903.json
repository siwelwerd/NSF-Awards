 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial impacts of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project lie in the development of a novel, non-destructive, in-line inspection technology to improve the quality and efficiency of semiconductor manufacturing. As semiconductor devices become smaller and more complex, defects hidden beneath surfaces can reduce production yields and product reliability. This project aims to address this challenge by using quantum-based sensing to detect these hidden defects during manufacturing. The technology is expected to reduce manufacturing waste, lower production costs, and enhance the competitiveness of the U.S. semiconductor industry. Commercialization of this innovation is anticipated to support semiconductor manufacturers and suppliers, with projected annual revenues exceeding $10 million by the third year of production. The project will also support workforce development by creating high-tech jobs and training opportunities.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project focuses on developing an advanced inspection tool that uses quantum effects to identify defects in semiconductor chips without damaging them. Current inspection methods struggle to detect certain types of defects in complex chip designs. This project will develop a non-destructive, in-line metrology system that leverages quantum sensing techniques to identify these hidden defects quickly and accurately during production. The research will focus on building and testing this new inspection tool, with the goal of improving quality control and production efficiency in semiconductor manufacturing.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
