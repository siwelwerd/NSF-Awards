 "awd_abstract_narration": "The work aims to support U.S.-based early career researchers to attend a 5-day conference set to occur between 24-28 March 2025 in Cambridge, U.K. This conference is part of a special joint international workshop efforts to sharing the latest results from three ongoing model inter-comparison projects organized through a core project of the World Climate Research Program called the Atmospheric Processes And their Role in Climate. \r\n\r\nThe workshop aims to help participants better understand the role of the stratospheric processes in enhancing weather, climate, and extreme events. Emerging outcomes may lead to the improvement of sub-seasonal-to-seasonal predictions and climate projections which would have strong societal benefits. The involvement of the supported early career researchers can contribute to the development of future leaders in the fields of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics and an effective national workforce.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
