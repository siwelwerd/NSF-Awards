 "awd_abstract_narration": "The International Conference on Mathematical and Scientific Machine Learning 2025 (MSML2025) will be held in Naples, Italy at the University of Naples Federico II, August 4-8, 2025. This conference will be hosted in the \u201cAula Magna.\u201d MSML2025 will be the fifth edition of a recently established international conference with an emphasis on promoting the study of mathematical theory and algorithms of machine learning, as well as applications of machine learning in scientific computing and engineering disciplines. This edition will be the second conference of the series to be held fully in person. This international conference aims to bring together the communities of machine learning, applied mathematics, and computational science and engineering, to exchange ideas and progress in this fast-growing field. This conference will help contribute to the training and growth of the workforce in this field by supporting the attendance of graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and junior researchers. \r\n\r\nThe objective of this conference series is to promote the study of theory and algorithms of machine learning and machine intelligence as well as applications in scientific and engineering disciplines such as physics, chemistry, material sciences, fluid and solid mechanics, etc. New themes of the conference will include transformers and state-space models, analysis of attention mechanisms, causal inference, optimization for surrogate training, and optimal transport, while more traditional themes such as graph neural networks, neural operators and general mathematics of machine learning will also be featured. More information about the conference is available at the conference website:  https://sites.google.com/view/msml2025/home.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
