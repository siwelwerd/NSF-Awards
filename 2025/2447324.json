 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Marist University Statistical Mathematics and Research Training (SMART) Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program will offer a distinctive and immersive research opportunity for nine undergraduate students each summer for three years. Over an intensive eight-week period, participants will engage in original research projects in statistics, data science, and mathematics under the mentorship of dedicated faculty members. Working in small groups, students will tackle complex and meaningful problems in areas such as Bayesian statistics, probability, machine learning, control theory, mathematical modeling, combinatorics, graph theory, and sign language recognition. The program will also feature weekly talks by faculty and students, covering topics in mathematics and related fields. SMART REU participants will be part of a vibrant community of students and faculty conducting research and other creative and investigative activities over the summer at Marist University.\r\n\r\nThe SMART REU aims to introduce undergraduates to the excitement and challenges of conducting original research in statistics, data science, and mathematics. Throughout the program, students will acquire essential background knowledge and develop a strong foundation in research ethics, including proper collaboration practices, credit attribution, and source citation. As the program progresses, participants will prepare a final report summarizing their research findings, which they will present at a local or national conference. When appropriate, their work will be submitted for publication in peer-reviewed journals. In addition to strengthening their research skills and mathematical/statistical expertise, students will refine their communication abilities through regular presentations and project updates, receiving constructive feedback from faculty mentors. For more details, please visit: www.marist.edu/smart-reu\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
