 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Dauphin Island Sea Laboratory (DISL), which is located on Dauphin Island in Alabama, will host a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program. The program will bring eight undergraduates to DISL each summer for three years. Students will participate in a 10-week guided research project and a professional development program. The intellectual theme of the DISL REU program is understanding how marine and estuarine ecosystems and living resources of the Gulf of Mexico respond to disturbance. Under this theme, DISL will provide semi-independent research experiences for participating students. Student recruitment will focus on undergraduates from 2-year and 4-year primarily undergraduate institutions, with a special focus on institutions in the northern Gulf of Mexico coast (nGOM) region.\r\n\r\nThe DISL REU program seeks to enhance understanding of how marine and estuarine ecosystems and living resources of the Gulf of Mexico respond to disturbance. Students will conduct semi-independent research across disciplines in coastal ecology (plant, invertebrate, fish, mammal), toxicology, microbiology and biological, chemical, physical and geological oceanography. Students will participate in seminars, field trips, group discussions, and a formal poster symposium to develop critical professional skills. Networking is encouraged, and mentors facilitate publication of a peer-reviewed paper and presentations at scientific meetings following the internship. By providing basic research skills and career development to early career undergraduates, this REU will increase the likelihood of enduring participation in sciences among these students and build capacity for their future success in any field. By targeting students along the nGOM coast, the program additionally supports local communities and economies by enhancing the education and intellectual capital of the next generation in technical fields in the region.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
