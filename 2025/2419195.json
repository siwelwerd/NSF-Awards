 "awd_abstract_narration": "NSF requires that, in addition to intellectual merit, projects should contribute broadly to achieving\r\nbroader societal goals. These broader impacts are accomplished aboard SIO-operated research vessels\r\nthrough the research itself, through activities that are directly related to specific research projects, or\r\nthrough activities that are supported by, but are complementary to, the project. Many of these activities\r\nhave been established previously and proven to be successful and will continue during the next award\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nNSF recognizes several activities as being particularly worthwhile. NSF values the advancement of scientific knowledge and activities that contribute to achievement of societally relevant outcomes. Such outcomes include, but are not limited to: full participation of women, persons with disabilities, and other underrepresented groups in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM); improved STEM education and educator development at any level; increased public scientific literacy and public engagement with science and technology; improved well-being of individuals in society; development of a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce; increased partnerships between academia, industry, and\r\nothers; improved national security; increased economic competitiveness of the United States; and enhanced infrastructure for research and education.\r\n\r\nNearly every federally funded research program that uses SIO ships involves its own unique broader impacts that take advantage of, or are facilitated by, these shared-use facilities. In addition, SIO and SOMTS PIs add additional value to these facilities by initiating and executing activities that promote teaching, broaden participation, enhance infrastructure, and disseminate our products for the benefit of society at large.\r\n\r\nThis award will support operations and maintenance for Research Vessel Roger Revelle.  The ability to operate R/V Revelle enables a range of science to occur that address NSF's missions to promote the progress of science; to advance the national health, prosperity and welfare and to secure the national defense.   This vessel plans to carry out NSF peer-reviewed sea-going projects in 2025. The Year 1 request was developed based on the current Draft Ship Schedule for CY2025. Total costs include an estimate related to all ship users, but requested funds to NSF reflects only the funding necessary to perform NSF-funded activities. The approved draft schedule includes 234 usage days (all ship users), and 217\r\nusage days (NSF projects). Year 1 request is calculated based on NSF's 217 days.  The total number of usage days per year\r\n(285 days per year) is the midpoint value of the vessel's Full Optimal Year for Roger Revelle as reported\r\nby UNOLS. Our Year 2-4 requests are calculated based on 170 NSF ship days each year.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
