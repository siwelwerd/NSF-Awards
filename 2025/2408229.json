 "awd_abstract_narration": "This MRI project will provide much-needed equipment to modernize the scientific computing infrastructure at Fordham University. It will address the growing demand for advanced computational resources required to tackle complex scientific and technical problems across various disciplines, such as computer science, neuroscience, security, economics, chemistry, statistics, and psychology. This project not only promises to elevate the quality and scope of research but also enhances educational opportunities for students across the campus by providing hands-on research and education experience with cutting-edge computing technologies.\r\n\r\nThe GPU cluster consists of three computing nodes, featuring approximately 12 NVIDIA Ampere A100 GPU accelerators. This cluster provides the essential hardware and software to support Fordham's new and emerging research projects. The on-site HPC cluster at Fordham will significantly advance multidisciplinary research in areas such as deep learning, robotics, quantum computing, cybersecurity, neuroscience and neuroimaging, computational psychology, chemistry, and more. Additionally, the HPC cluster will enable faculty to enhance their educational activities in computational fields and promote the development of both undergraduate and graduate curricula, facilitating the training of the next-generation STEM workforce. The system will be optimized and accessible to major users across the campus, ensuring sustainable use throughout the grant period and beyond.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
