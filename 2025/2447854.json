 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site award to Oklahoma State University, located in Stillwater, Oklahoma, supports the training of 10 students for 10 weeks during the summers of 2026-2028. In this program, funded by the Division of Chemistry and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), the student participants will perform research at an R1 institution while working on important problems in Chemistry. The projects are designed to be appropriate for their skill level and to promote their interest in the sciences. Professional development training will expose the students to elements of graduate school and increase their awareness of career opportunities within the field of chemistry. The program will encourage participation by students from primarily undergraduate institutions in the state of Oklahoma.\r\n\r\nThe selected students will participate in interdisciplinary research that focuses on Materials Chemistry, Medicinal/Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Advanced Spectroscopies, Chemical Biology, Catalysis, Environmental Chemistry, Bioanalytical Chemistry and Computational Chemistry.  Students will benefit from the highly collaborative environment, one-on-one interactions with faculty and graduate student mentors, state-of-the-art facilities, and opportunities to present their research.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
