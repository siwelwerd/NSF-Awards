 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant supports student participation in the 4th Symposium on Computer Science and Law (CSLaw), sponsored by the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), to be held March 25-27, 2025, in Munich, German. The event brings together computer scientists and law scholars and policymakers to discuss the latest research, developments, and trends in the developing intersection of Computer Science and Law. Students will attend invited talks, technical paper presentations, poster sessions, and panel discussions. The topics discussed include cybersecurity and privacy, and more generally, the legal aspects of computer and software technology in all aspects of society, which has become especially critical as societal functions and capabilities are increasingly relegated automation by computers and software. The symposium allows computer scientists and legal scholars to work together to solve problems that require their combined expertise. \r\n\r\nComputer science and law have long existed in parallel, with occasional overlaps in areas such as export controls. However, computer technologies are now performing functions for which people used to be responsible, and now that computers are taking over these functions, new legal frameworks are needed to deal with the new roles of automated systems, applications and agents. Legal and regulatory aspects need to be implemented correctly to meet new types of requirements in order for users (citizens) to be served effectively.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
