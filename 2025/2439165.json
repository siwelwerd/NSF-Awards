 "awd_abstract_narration": "As the focal point for the health and welfare of animals at the National Academies, the Board on Animal Health Sciences, Conservation, and Research (BAHSCR) has a responsibility to facilitate and accelerate interdisciplinary research and knowledge exchange toward addressing scientific, policy, and societal challenges in the health and wellbeing of animals, humans and ecosystems, and support responsible stewardship of animals involved in research. To achieve these goals, BAHSCR organizes sessions at board meetings that focus on specific fields or scientific developments in animal health in various settings including advances from comparative medicine, biodiversity and conservation, animal models and complementary methodologies for biomedical research, and the care and use of animals involved in research. BAHSCR works across sectors and disciplines to provide advice on critical and emerging issues associated with research involving animals in ad hoc and continuously operating activities. Through these efforts, BAHSCR anticipates and develops project concepts on critical and emerging issues needing to be addressed. Engaging in these efforts with the above goals in mind, this project led by BAHSCR aims to achieve the following outcomes: a) advanced knowledge about scientific, ecological, policy, regulatory, and broader issues associated with animal health in wild, semi-wild, captive, and laboratory settings to address before they become significant challenges adversely impairing animal health, research, and biodiversity and conservation; b) focused attention on research and translation of knowledge-to-action for the improvement of animal health in all settings; and c) broadened participation of scientists from a range of backgrounds providing scientific and science policy advice to the U.S. government on issues related to animal health. \r\n \r\nThe Board on Animal Health Sciences, Conservation, and Research (BAHSCR) of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (National Academies) works to advance rigorous and innovative scientific approaches for informed decision-making toward improving the health and wellbeing of the animal kingdom including humans and ecosystems. BAHSCR facilitates and accelerates interdisciplinary research and knowledge exchange toward addressing critical scientific, societal, and policy challenges in the health and wellbeing of animals, humans, and ecosystems, and support responsible stewardship of animals involved in science. BAHCR provides the best possible scientific advice on the welfare of animals involved in research in wild, semi-wild, captive, and/or laboratory environments and on animal health, leveraging research in veterinary and human medicine. The primary objectives of this project by BAHSCR are to : a) anticipate emerging scientific, clinical, and policy issues associated with the health and wellbeing of animals, research involving animals, and complementary scientific methodologies; b) develop project concepts to address identified critical, emerging issues; and c) address a range of science and welfare of animals involved in research. These objectives are achieved through semi-annual meetings of board members and staff, engagement of experts from various fields in BAHSCR\u2019s work, service as an authoritative resource on animal welfare to the international scientific community, and identification and development of project concepts to address outstanding needs. These needs extend to addressing complex issues involved in animal health and conservation, interconnectedness of human and animal health and methods for reducing reliance on animals involved in research.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
