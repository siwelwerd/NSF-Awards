 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of an advanced tissue engineering product. Effective knee cartilage repair requires a blend of surgical precision and supportive biomaterials that foster cartilage regeneration. Existing solutions often face challenges like poor integration, inadequate cellular environments, and prolonged rehabilitation, leading to graft failures, reoperations, increased work absences, and high costs. The proposed technology addresses these issues with a phase-transformable scaffold composed of inter-crosslinkable, protein-based microribbons. These microribbons can solidify into a porous scaffold with optimal tissue-specific porosity. The injectable nature of our technology supports minimally invasive procedures, allowing it to conform to and fill defects of varying geometries before solidifying. This adaptability enhances implant integration with host cartilage. The tunable ribbon size optimizes pore structure for 3D cartilage growth. Preliminary in vitro and explant tests have shown advantages, and further evaluations using horse models are underway.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. This solution is based on the development of a new method to transform collagen, the key component of cartilage, into microscopic ribbons. During surgery, these ribbons can be crosslinked with blue light to create a tissue-engineering scaffold. Chondrocytes, the cells responsible for cartilage formation, are pre-mixed with the microribbons before crosslinking, forming a scaffold that encapsulates the cells. The technology functions on both microscopic and macroscopic levels. Microscopically, the microribbons, which are approximately 0.01 mm wide\u2014about the size of chondrocytes\u2014regulate cell shape and movement, activating cartilage-producing processes. On a macroscopic level, the paste-like microribbons, containing cells, can be injected into cartilage defects of any shape. Once injected, they are crosslinked into a solid scaffold that integrates with the existing cartilage, enhancing healing and repairing the defect. This innovative approach is designed to significantly improve cartilage repair and regeneration.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
