 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is its potential to transform the solid tumor cancer treatment market, projected to reach $424.6 billion by 2027. The project aims to advance the regulatory pathway for space-made medicines by using Janus base nanoparticles (JBNps) as a test case to demonstrate comparability with Earth-made versions. This step is crucial for the commercialization of space-made therapeutics, addressing challenges in drug delivery for solid tumors and advancing oncology biotherapeutics. Additionally, the project will boost U.S. dominance in the space economy, drive innovation and economic growth in biotech, and enhance the nation\u2019s global competitiveness. It could lead to advanced, safer therapies for various diseases and contribute to fostering a diverse American STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) workforce. Beyond its technological benefits, this project emphasizes diversity, education, and community outreach, promising broader societal and environmental benefits. Ultimately, it holds potential for positive impacts on the LEO (Low Earth Orbit) commercial space economy and global healthcare.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to tackle the urgent need for advanced drug delivery systems capable of effectively targeting solid tumors. Current lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), while widely used, face challenges in penetrating the dense extracellular matrix (ECM) of tumors. Eascra\u2019s project focuses on creating a regulatory pathway to commercialize space-made Janus base nanoparticles (JBNps). These nanoparticles, with their nano-rod morphology and DNA-mimicking chemistry, offer improved tumor penetration, effective treatment, and minimal toxicity. Additionally, JBNps maintain drug stability and bioactivity at room temperature, overcoming the cold storage challenges faced by LNPs. Phase I will advance the regulatory approval pathway, laying the groundwork for Phase II, where in-space manufacturing of JBNps will be optimized. This technology has the potential to revolutionize cancer treatment by providing a versatile, more effective drug delivery platform. The success of this project holds significant implications for future space-made medicines, benefiting both terrestrial and space-based healthcare.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
