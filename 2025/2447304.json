 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-year REU Site: Building a Greener Future: Sustainable Construction Research for Empowering Students with Learning Disabilities is hosted by the University of New Haven. The development of innovative technologies for rapidly constructing sustainable NetZero homes and shelters to address housing needs after natural and manmade disasters is the focus of this program. Ten undergraduates will be recruited each year, with a special emphasis on recruiting participants with learning disabilities. These opportunities will engage participants in impactful research focused on sustainable construction and eco-friendly homes for post-disaster recovery in a supportive, low-pressure environment.  Guided by experienced faculty mentors, participants will collaborate on innovative projects that promote teamwork and problem-solving focusing on real-life engineering problems. This REU Site emphasizes a strength-based approach, building confidence while offering career development workshops on r\u00e9sum\u00e9 writing, networking, and public speaking. Participants will also interact with engineering professionals, including those with disabilities, to inspire their career paths. This initiative aims to increase research opportunities for students with learning disabilities, fostering their growth as engineers and role models, while contributing to a more inclusive academic community.\r\n\r\nThe program emphasizes off-grid, durable, and efficient housing solutions for displaced populations, ensuring sustainability and adaptability in challenging environments. The frequency and severity of natural disasters, such as California wildfires and Florida hurricanes, are increasing. Special shelters are designed to function independently of disrupted infrastructure, offering immediate and sustainable housing. Cutting-edge methods like 3D concrete printing, Building Information Models (BIM) for advanced planning, solar photovoltaic systems for off-grid energy, and rainwater collection for sustainable water use are examples of research projects. These approaches aim to provide scalable solutions for housing crises in disaster-stricken areas. By advancing rapid construction and fostering empathy in engineering solutions, the program has the potential to revolutionize post-disaster recovery and global humanitarian responses, making a meaningful impact on communities worldwide. REU participants can develop skills in engineering and sustainability through hands-on and computational tasks. This inclusive approach ensures participants can excel in tackling interdisciplinary engineering challenges focused on sustainability and humanitarian design.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
