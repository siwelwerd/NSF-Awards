 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will support the attendance of numerous early career researchers at the 2025 Developmental Biology Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) and Gordon Research Conference (GRC). The Developmental Biology GRS and GRC is attended by scientists working on diverse organisms and biological systems at the forefront of the field of developmental biology. This meeting allows scientists (both leading experts in the field and emerging leaders, such as students and fellows) to present their work, engage in discussions and enable discoveries. These discussions result in national and international collaborations which greatly accelerate the pace of science and generation of knowledge. The GRS, held immediately before the larger GRC, brings together early career scientists and allows for an open networking opportunity rooted in exchange of scientific ideas. Of note, all conference presentations will be followed by dedicated periods of discussion to promote participation from trainees as well as senior scientists. This project will be used to defray the cost for US trainees to attend the GRS and GRC. The overall Broader Impacts of this award includes creating opportunities for those to attend this key conference who otherwise might not be able to attend, and enabling the Developmental Biology community to further develop their ideas and spur research forward.\r\n\r\nThe generation and maintenance of the body plan and its subsequent tissues is essential for the existence of life. Most multicellular organisms undergo some form of cellular specification, organization, and morphogenesis. The universality of developmental processes highlights the importance of studying the mechanisms that regulate tissue development and maintenance. The goal of the 2025 GRS and GRC in Developmental Biology is to be a forum for the discussion and exchange of ideas about the latest discovery and innovations, both conceptual and technical, in developmental biology. The GRS is a trainee specific meeting that is held right before the GRC to provide student and postdocs an unintimidating environment to present their work to peers and a few senior scentists. This permits the trainees to build confidence and make the most out of the subsequent GRC, which is attended by both trainees and leading faculty and scientists. The GRS topics will be devoted to \u2013 1 Insights from well-established and emerging models. 2- Classical questions through mathematical and physical paradigms and 3 - upgraded and innovative technologies in development. Thus, this conference will promote interactions among trainees and investigators from all career stages who use a multitude of organisms and approaches to define the molecular, cellular and genetic processes that control how bodies are shaped and maintained, leading to insights that inform stem cell biology and regenerative medicine.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
