 "awd_abstract_narration": "This I-Corps project is based on the development of a portable, ultra-low-power desalination and water treatment system designed to provide clean drinking water in remote or compromised locations. Millions of people lack reliable access to safe drinking water, posing significant health and economic challenges. This technology addresses this issue by integrating advanced water purification technologies into a compact and energy-efficient system. The system combines solar-powered desalination, energy recovery, and artificial intelligence (AI)-driven optimization to ensure sustainable and cost-effective operation.  The goal is to provide this technology for use in disaster relief, rural communities, industrial applications, and outdoor recreation.  This system is designed to provide the delivery of clean, safe drinking water where traditional infrastructure is unavailable or insufficient.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of a water treatment system for the delivery of clean, safe drinking water where traditional infrastructure is unavailable or insufficient. Conventional desalination systems are often energy-intensive and infrastructure-dependent.  This portable technology integrates a brushless direct current (DC) water pump with sensors for real-time total dissolved solids monitoring, an energy recovery turbine, and ultraviolet (UV)-based disinfection. The system employs artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms to optimize performance by adapting to varying water quality conditions while minimizing energy consumption.  In addition, the system is powered by integrated solar panels, which operate independently of traditional infrastructure.  This portable water treatment technology may address the need for water in emergency disaster situations as well as industrial and other applications that require clean water.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
