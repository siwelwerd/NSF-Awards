 "awd_abstract_narration": "What makes some memories last a lifetime? One factor that determines whether a memory will endure or fade away is how it is processed during sleep. While we sleep, activity in brain networks that represent memories helps some memories survive and thrive. One unknown is whether sleep only helps a memory shortly after it is acquired, or whether it continues to improve memory for a long time thereafter. Previous research generally examines the role of sleep after only one sleep event; this project examines the contribution of multiple nights of sleep to memory, using a combination of behavioral, physiological, and computational methods. Whereas the current public discourse revolves around sleep\u2019s short-term impact (\u201csleep well before your test\u201d), the findings could highlight sleep\u2019s lasting impact (\u201csleep well throughout the semester\u201d).  \r\n\r\nThe research systematically examines the contribution of multiple nights of sleep to memory, using a combination of behavioral, physiological, and computational methods. There are three distinct research goals: to examine how memory benefits change with time and sleep using a well-established memory task; to consider whether sleep may play a prolonged role specifically for the weakest memories, which are the most sleep-reliant; and to reveal the constraints for multi-night processing by examining how susceptible memories are to being reactivated during sleep. The work should resolve the conflict between two views of sleep\u2019s role in memory: Does sleep transform memories over a prolonged process or are its contributions a \u201cone and done\u201d affair, limited to a single night that \u201cclears the decks\u201d for new learning?  The knowledge gained through this project will provide valuable and useful information to the public, with potential implications for day-to-day sleep hygiene practices.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
