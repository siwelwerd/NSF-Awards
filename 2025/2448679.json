 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Spring 2025 Redbud Topology Conference will be held at the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville, AR on Friday, February 28 through Sunday, March 2, 2025. This conference will bring together researchers from across the United States to discuss current developments in low-dimensional topology.  Participation by graduate students and junior researchers will help facilitate their advancement in the discipline and ensure progress addressing fundamental questions in low-dimensional topology.  In Fall 2025, a smaller meeting will be held at Oklahoma State University in Stillwater, OK at a date to be determined.  This meeting will mainly feature speakers from the Arkansas-Oklahoma EPSCoR region and provide an avenue for students in the area to network with regional experts in topology. \r\n \r\nThe research focus of the Spring 2025 Redbud Topology Conference is braids and mapping class groups and their applications in dimensions 2, 3, and 4.  There will be speakers with backgrounds in geometric group theory, the topology of 3- and 4-manifolds, and in contact and symplectic topology, all who use or study braid and mapping class groups.  On Friday, February 28, there will be a graduate student workshop with several educational talks by some of these speakers.  The main research talks will be on Saturday, March 1 and Sunday, March 2.  There will also be a lightning talk session on Saturday, March 1 for other participants to share their work.   The webpage for these meetings is located at: https://redbud.uark.edu/.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
