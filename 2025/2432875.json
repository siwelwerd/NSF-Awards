 "awd_abstract_narration": "Increased usage of the metalloid tellurium (Te) in electronics manufacturing has significantly increased Te contamination in the environment. As an environmental contaminant, Te is highly toxic to living organisms. Additionally, as most of the extracted Te is ultimately released into the environment, there are concerns about the capacity of existing Te reserves to support the element\u2019s growing demand for usage in renewable energy, semi-conducting, national security, and materials manufacturing. This project investigates how microbial processes influence the chemical transformation of Te in freshwater environments. Understanding how microorganisms participate in the chemical transformations of Te in the environment is vital for addressing the ecosystem health impacts of Te and for developing recovery strategies to meet the increasing global demand for this element. This project will also support the training of two undergraduate students, including one student from a nearby community college, as well as one graduate student in the field of biogeochemistry. Additionally, this project will support the development of undergraduate mentoring resources for both faculty and graduate students at SUNY ESF. This project aligns with the National Science Foundation's mission by contributing to environmental and economic resilience and supporting broader societal benefits through education, strengthening diversity in STEM, and capacity building at an R2 institution.\r\n\r\nThe study employs experimental sediment microcosms to monitor changes in Te speciation across oxygenated, ferruginous, and sulfidogenic conditions. Integrated geochemical and molecular analyses\u2014including amplicon sequencing, metagenomics, and metatranscriptomics\u2014 will identify active microbial populations in each of these experimental systems. The goal of this work is to link the active microbial communities under varied redox regimes to specific Te transformation activities. This approach will facilitate the development of a stronger framework for predicting microbially mediated Te cycling, providing insights into strategies for mitigating contamination and recovering valuable resources.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
