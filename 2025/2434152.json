 "awd_abstract_narration": "The landscape of modern energy storage is evolving rapidly, necessitating advances in battery technologies. Traditional lithium-ion batteries face challenges related to resource scarcity, safety concerns, and environmental impacts. A lithium ion transfers only one electron during each reaction. Recently, alternative metals that can transfer three electrons during each reaction and use water-based electrolytes have emerged as compelling battery candidates. Indium is one of these emerging battery candidates. This project will fill critical knowledge gaps in the field of indium metal batteries and deepen the fundamental understanding of novel battery operating mechanisms. The research findings will be integrated into graduate courses that will enhance STEM education and raise awareness of energy-related challenges among future generations of scientists and engineers. Furthermore, engagement with the public through science fairs and outreach events will inspire curiosity and excitement about science and technology, fostering a deeper appreciation for the role of research in addressing real-world problems. Finally, the translation of research findings into practical applications through patentable products and industry collaborations will contribute to economic growth and technological innovation.\r\n\r\nThis project will provide a comprehensive picture of indium metal plating mechanism and ion insertion chemistry. Studies will focus on the indium metal plating mechanism and ion insertion chemistry. The research will encompass a holistic approach including material innovation, electrolyte design, electrochemical and structural characterization, and theoretical simulations. The research goals will be achieved through the following objectives: (1) understanding the indium nucleation and growth behavior on different substrates and revealing the underlying indium-substrate interplay; (2) formulating and refining sophisticated concentrated indium-ion electrolytes, investigating the ion/solvent interactions, enhancing indium metal performance, and establishing the electrolyte-electrode performance correlation; and (3) developing high-capacity cathode materials for high-energy indium metal batteries and investigating the electrochemical behavior and mechanisms associated with ion insertion in indium-ion electrolytes.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
