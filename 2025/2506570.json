 "awd_abstract_narration": "The significance of this I-Corps project is based on the translation from lab to market of high-voltage, silicon-carbide (SiC)-based, multilevel power electronics building blocks (PEBBs) \u2014 a technology with the potential to modernize critical energy and propulsion systems. Power electronics refers to the branch of electrical engineering that deals with the conversion, control, and management of electrical power using semiconductor devices such as diodes, transistors, and silicon-carbide (SiC) components. These systems enable efficient power conversion across different voltage and current levels, making them essential for modern energy applications. The U.S. faces urgent challenges in upgrading its aging power grid, integrating new energy sources, and accelerating electrification in aerospace and space power systems. The impact of this technology extends beyond engineering innovation; it supports a more efficient and resilient energy infrastructure, fostering economic growth and technological leadership in the U.S. power and electrification industry.\r\n\r\nThis project investigates the commercialization of a class of high-voltage, silicon-carbide (SiC)-based, multilevel power electronics building blocks (PEBBs). The PEBB is a generic block that can be connected to form a class of modular and scalable high-voltage and high-power converters capable of performing any conversion type, alternating current (AC) - direct current (DC), DC-AC, DC-DC, and AC-. The PEBB uses a neutral-point clamped (NPC) topology, compared to existing full-bridge topologies, unlocking the ability of achieving higher-voltage levels, increased power-density, reliability, efficiency, and improved control, while enabling higher switching frequency compared to state-of-the-art commercial products. Additionally, the PEBB incorporates built-in overvoltage and overcurrent protection and an integrated power management system, enhancing operational reliability. As such, this technology\u2019s modular, scalable, and cost-effective PEBBs have the potential to enhance system reliability, increase energy efficiency, and improve energy accessibility \u2014 all while reducing maintenance costs, minimizing downtime, and extending the operational lifespan of power electronics systems.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
