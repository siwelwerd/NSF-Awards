 "awd_abstract_narration": "This I-Corps project is based on the potential commercialization of a novel concrete material. By utilizing industrial waste materials and incorporating an energy-efficient curing method that recaptures water, this project reduces water consumption in the construction sector. The applications are relevant to potential industry sectors ranging from home construction and community infrastructure to space exploration. Notably, the technology's net-zero water aspect can be used in water-stressed regions in the U.S. and worldwide. Additionally, the technology can support U.S. efforts in space exploration by enabling on-site extraterrestrial construction materials. \r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of an alternative concrete material. This concrete substitute utilizes alternative cementitious materials and carbon nanomaterials for the production of building materials with an integrated water recapture system. This technology utilizes geopolymerization, a reaction that results in a concrete-like product using industrial byproducts and water; Unlike conventional concrete's hydration reaction, which consumes water, geopolymerization does not consume water after solidification. This solution provides a cement alternative that is more cost effective and can be used in construction locations where resources are scarce.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
