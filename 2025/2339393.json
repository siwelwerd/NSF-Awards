 "awd_abstract_narration": "As technology advances across aerospace, biomedical, and semiconductor fields, the demand for high-performance engineering materials continues to grow. Ceramics like sapphire and zirconia excel in extreme environments such as hypersonic flights, medical applications, and high-speed semiconductor devices. However, as these applications evolve, ceramic component designs become more complex and difficult to produce using conventional manufacturing methods such as grinding and polishing. Ultra-precision machining, which manipulates cutting tools at small length scales, has been developed to create complex geometries without costly post-processing. However, the tool-workpiece interactions and material removal mechanisms at this scale are not fully understood, limiting productivity. By combining precision cutting experiments with computer simulations, this project aims to investigate the interactions between various deformation and fracture mechanisms and develop a predictive model to enhance machining efficiency and advance the manufacturing of cutting-edge technologies. Beyond immediate applications, the findings will advance materials science by providing insights relevant to other high-performance materials. Project results will be shared through publications, conferences, and graduate courses. Moreover, this project will provide research opportunities for undergraduate students, fostering a broad talent pipeline in various science and engineering fields.\r\n\r\nSelecting optimal process parameters for ultra-precision machining of difficult-to-cut materials often relies on trial-and-error, leading to wasted resources and require extensive post-processing. Addressing these challenges requires predictive models based on a comprehensive understanding of material deformation in crystalline structures during machining. Current models primarily focus on single dominant deformation modes, which limits their ability to capture the complex interplay of slip, twinning, and fracture mechanisms involved in machining ceramics. This research aims to elucidate the interactions among various deformation and failure mechanisms during ultra-precision machining of single-crystal materials and their influence on machining performance. The study focuses on sapphire, examining how specific types of defects impact machining outcomes. Artificial defects will be introduced using focused ion-beam milling, enabling controlled investigations of individual deformation modes. To complement experimental efforts, atomistic simulations will be conducted to analyze the temporal evolution of deformations and the role of defects, such as dislocations and twinning, which are difficult to replicate experimentally. Insights gained will enhance existing material deformation models, moving beyond single-mode analyses. These improved models will support the development of machining strategies that optimize the machinability of advanced engineering ceramics, reducing costs and improving efficiency.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
