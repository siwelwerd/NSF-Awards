 "awd_abstract_narration": "Understanding the unique research infrastructure and development needs of faculty at Emerging Research Institutions (ERIs) will lead to improved strategies to reduce the systemic barriers that can contribute to limited involvement in the research enterprise. This planning project will assess the research enterprise need at California State University Monterrey Bay (CSUMB), and result in a scalable research enterprise model to address these needs. The project will help create environments of enhanced support and responsiveness that increase faculty engagement in the advancement of science at CSUMB, and the model is likely applicable to similar institutions of higher education.   \r\n\r\nThe project team will conduct a needs assessment, focusing on the challenges and gaps in service encountered by faculty at CSUMB in each major area of the research enterprise. A survey will be followed by focus groups regarding concerns and opportunities for improvement. Data will be analyzed using a gap analysis identifying needs, opportunities, improvements, strengths and exceptions that will lead to an action plan applicable for campus and cross-campus use. The project will culminate in a convening of multiple campuses in the California State University system, focused on application of a pilot model for institutions facing similar challenges. Working groups will identify strategies to leverage personnel, technological, and financial resources to develop more options for responding to faculty needs through a shared resource model.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
