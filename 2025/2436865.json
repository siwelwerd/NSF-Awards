 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will examine how faculty communication influences the development of engineering identity among undergraduates at California State University Northridge (CSUN), a Hispanic-Serving Institution (HSI). Faculty communication plays a pivotal role in shaping students\u2019 perceptions of themselves as future engineers, particularly during the \"sophomore slump\" phase. This period is a critical juncture in students\u2019 academic journeys, as they transition from introductory coursework to more rigorous, discipline-specific engineering courses. Faculty interactions during this phase can significantly impact students' confidence, motivation, and sense of belonging in the field. For Latinx students, especially Latinas, this phase often coincides with heightened challenges stemming from systemic barriers, including ethnic and gender stereotyping, that undermine their academic and professional engineering identities. Understanding the nuances of faculty-student interactions during this period is essential for identifying practices that support student success.  This project aligns with NSF\u2019s mission to promote the progress of science and advance national welfare by addressing persistent equity gaps in STEM fields. By investigating the interplay between faculty communication and engineering identity development, the project will contribute valuable insights into how institutional practices can create more equitable pathways for Latinx students in engineering.  The findings will serve as a foundation for the development of evidence-based interventions and programs aimed at fostering inclusive and supportive educational environments. Ultimately, the project will advance the broader societal goal of creating a diverse and equitable STEM workforce, positioning CSUN as a model for HSI institutions nationwide.\r\n\r\nThis project will investigate the influence of faculty communication on the development of engineering identity among Latinx students at CSUN by addressing the \u201csophomore slump\u201d period, a pivotal stage in a student\u2019s academic journey. The proposed research will use a mixed-methods approach, including a cross-sectional survey and a diary study, to capture both overall trends as well as detailed, real-time data on faculty-student interactions. Drawing on identity development and confirmation theories, this study will examine the impact of confirming and disconfirming faculty messages, the role of minority stressors, and the effects of stereotype consciousness on students\u2019 academic and professional identity formation. Additionally, the project will explore how message characteristics, such as type, frequency, and memorability, affect students\u2019 perceptions of the engineering climate at CSUN. The findings will inform the creation of actionable strategies, including faculty onboarding and professional development programs, designed to foster inclusive and supportive educational environments. By aligning with NSF goals to broaden participation in STEM, this initiative aims to enhance retention and success among Latinx engineering students, ultimately contributing to a more diverse and inclusive STEM workforce.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
