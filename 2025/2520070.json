 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the convening of a two-day workshop that brings together anthropologists, ethnobiologists, and conservation scientists to further the science of cultural adaptation, ecological change, and conservation in mountain regions across the world.  The workshop will be held in association with the 2025 meeting of the Society of Ethnobiology. This workshop provides a novel approach to uniting the biological, social and environmental scientific approaches to understanding the variations in human adaptation in mountain regions worldwide.\r\n\r\nThe workshop results in a number of tangible societal benefits, including: supporting collaborations between universities, government institutions, and members of local communities; supporting students and faculty in EPSCoR jurisdictions; informing pathways for grassroots solutions to changing land-management and conservation challenges developed by community stakeholders that center local knowledge and community implementation; providing a model for collaborations between experts and local knowledge holders and for future partnerships that result in knowledge and resource sharing, student training, and ongoing multinational scientific investigations.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
