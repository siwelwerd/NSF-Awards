 "awd_abstract_narration": "This I-Corps project focuses on the development of a novel, cell-free, therapeutic approach to promote skin regeneration and wound healing. As individuals age, skin loses its ability to heal effectively due to reduced elasticity, thinning, and diminished cellular activity. Current regenerative therapies often rely on live stem cell treatments, which pose significant regulatory and logistical challenges. This project explores the potential of using biomolecules secreted by stem cells\u2014called the secretome\u2014to stimulate tissue repair without the need for live cell transplantation. These biomolecules help direct the body's natural repair mechanisms, improve collagen production, and enhance healing while avoiding complications associated with traditional stem cell therapies. By developing an innovative approach to secretome production, this project seeks to improve the accessibility and effectiveness of regenerative treatments, contributing to advances in healthcare and improved quality of life.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. This solution is based on the development of a temperature-responsive, three-dimensional culture system designed to enhance the production of regenerative biomolecules from stem cells. Unlike conventional methods, which require extended cell expansion and often reduce the therapeutic potency of the secretome, this system uses mild temperature fluctuations to optimize cell communication and maintain key regenerative signals. By improving the efficiency of secretome production, this technology aims to provide a more potent and scalable solution for skin repair and wound healing applications.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
