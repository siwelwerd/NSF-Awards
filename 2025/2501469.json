 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 41st edition of the Southeastern Analysis Meeting (SEAM) will be held on the campus of the University of South Florida, March 21-23, 2025. SEAM has been held annually at a university in the southeastern United States since 1985. It has established itself as leading national venue for analysis, with a mission of promoting interaction and collaboration between researchers at all career stages. It encourages research and education in the field of analysis.  The program of SEAM includes plenary talks by selected participants and 20-minute contributed talks open to all participants as well as professional development activities for early career researchers. This format fosters collegiality and a vibrant environment that encourages the exchange of ideas, networking, and the initiation and development of new research collaborative projects. \r\n\r\nThe Southeastern Analysis Meeting (SEAM) promotes interaction and collaboration between researchers at all career stages and encourages research and education in the field of analysis. The meeting brings together experienced researchers, junior faculty, postdocs, and graduate students to discuss recent work and advances in analysis, classical and modern \u2014 the mathematics at the intersection of Operator Theory, Classical Complex Analysis, Harmonic Analysis, and Several Complex Variables \u2014 and related areas and fields of application, including Operator Algebras, Spaces, and Systems; Systems and Scattering theory; Control Theory; and PDE to name a few. As an annual event with a dedicated focus, it is now a part of the research community infrastructure, enhancing research in mathematics and graduate education, as will be described in further detail throughout this proposal. The meeting website is at https://www.usf.edu/arts-sciences/departments/mathematics-statistics/research/conferences/seam2025/index.aspx\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
