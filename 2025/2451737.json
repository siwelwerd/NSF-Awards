 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impacts and commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project lie in developing a magnesium (Mg) alloy for implants that support healing by temporarily fixating bones or stabilizing tissues. These implants provide mechanical support during recovery and are gradually absorbed by the body, restoring the implant site without requiring removal surgeries. Specifically, this project will develop a bioabsorbable magnesium alloy for maxillofacial fixation. This innovation aims to improve healthcare outcomes by eliminating secondary hardware removal surgeries, which occur in 5-20% of maxillofacial fixation cases and cost the U.S. healthcare system $1.72 billion annually. Permanent metal implants often lead to ongoing risks and expenses, while resorbable polymers, an alternative, are limited by limited strength, unreliable healing, and complex surgical procedures. A bioabsorbable metal implant with superior mechanical robustness and controlled absorption addresses these challenges and offers the potential to capture market share from both titanium and polymer implants. With 19% of the maxillofacial fixation market already using resorbable polymers, a superior bioabsorbable alloy would significantly improve clinical outcomes while reducing healthcare costs.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will demonstrate the feasibility of a bioabsorbable alloy with a customizable absorption profile tailored for maxillofacial fixation. Intellectual merit includes (1) developing a bioabsorbable alloy with tunable absorption profiles, (2) understanding how processing affects absorption behavior, and (3) validating a large-animal preclinical model for novel bioabsorbable implants. Technical challenges addressed in this project include the impact of processing on microstructure and absorption (TC1), correlation between in vitro and in vivo absorption profiles (TC2), anatomical variations in absorption (TC3), absorption effects on the bone-implant interface (TC4), and gas evolution's impact on bone density (TC5).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
