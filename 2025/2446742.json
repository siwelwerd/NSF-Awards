 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at Lehigh University, which will provide ten undergraduate students each summer the opportunity to participate in ten weeks of research across a diverse range of physics fields. These fields span from fundamental areas, such as String Theory, Nuclear Physics, and Astrophysics, to classical domains like Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Statistical Physics, as well as areas with practical applications in technology, energy, and health, including Condensed Matter Physics, Optics, and Biophysics.  The program involves research, weekly faculty seminars and lab tours, a student symposium at the end of the summer, other professional development opportunities, and various social functions that foster the interaction of undergraduate students with faculty and graduate students. A group housing arrangement greatly enhances both the academic and social experiences of the participants as it helps the students to develop a strong group identity.\r\n\r\nProgram participants gain research experience at a critical point in their undergraduate careers, as well as an excellent preview of graduate school. The students make substantial contributions to specific research projects, with many presenting their findings at key conferences such as the American Physical Society Meeting, and some achieving publication of their work in referred journals. Since the beginning of the program at Lehigh more than two-thirds of the participants have gone on to graduate studies in science and engineering, and most of the remaining students obtained jobs in fields of science and technology.  The program plays a critical role in empowering promising students to pursue careers in science and other technical fields, guided by ongoing evaluation and assessment for continuous improvement.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
