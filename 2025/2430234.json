 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Holland Computing Center (HCC) at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln provides advanced cyberinfrastructure and high-performance computing resources to the University of Nebraska (NU) system.  The recent explosive growth of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) has dramatically increased the need for GPU computing resources to support this work.  The areas of scientific inquiry GPU supports are diverse, consisting of domains such as neuroscience, computer engineering, animal science, and mathematics. PLUMAGE (Promoting Learning Using Mixed Advanced GPU Environments) creates a flexible GPU-based cyberinfrastructure resource to address this need.  To enhance its effectiveness, the resources within PLUMAGE can be integrated as either part of HCC's Swan cluster or the National Research Platform (NRP).  This allows access either using a traditional batch-scheduled environment, or via an interactive Kubernetes platform.\r\n\r\nPLUMAGE is available to all HCC users, including the four primary NU campuses (UNL, UNO, UNMC, and UNK), as well as other higher education and research organizations in Nebraska and nationally to NRP and the OSG. To enhance the efficiency of PLUMAGE users, training sessions and workshops are offered at all Nebraska campuses to help effectively utilize GPU resources. PLUMAGE and the scientific advancement it enables are presented to broader research communities to share experiences and insights gained through this project. In addition, PLUMAGE and its applications are demonstrated via HCC's outreach activities to diverse audiences, including K-12 students, to foster interest in science and engineering research.  Undergraduate students are also employed in PLUMAGE's maintenance and operation, providing valuable professional development experience.\r\n\r\nThis project is jointly funded by the Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
