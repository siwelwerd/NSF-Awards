 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial impacts of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) phase I project is in advancing semiconductor processing by providing cutting-edge technology to produce super thin coatings for advanced chips manufacturing. This technology uses tiniest controlled bursts of electricity to significantly enhance coating quality, eliminate processing steps, lowering costs, and reducing energy usage. The product will consist of a unique type of power generator, new to semiconductor processing, integrated to an applicator for energizing the gases used in the coating process. The product protected by strong patents and trade secrets will be sold to leading semiconductor process equipment companies for use on their existing systems, with company\u2019s product market opportunity projected to be $200 million in year three of production. Beyond this first thin coating application, the technology can be extended to other advanced semiconductor applications, further growing company\u2019s market opportunity to over $500M.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the limitations of current plasma enhanced atomic layer deposition to cost-effectively deposit hydrogen free, conformal oxide and nitride films. A new solution to semiconductor plasma processing is proposed using an array of micro-plasma dielectric barrier discharge applicators, powered by nanosecond scale high voltage pulses, capable of breaking down non-hydrogen containing reactants such as nitrogen thus avoiding hydrogen containing reactants such as ammonia, and achieve improved film conformality by eliminating ion bias induced anisotropic deposition.  Research objectives are, firstly, characterize set of 5 applicators over a range of physical electrode configurations, gas types, flow rates and pressure, and electrical pulse parameters, to determine optimum conditions for producing desired radicals and active species, whilst avoiding undesirable plasma breakdown regimes. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and spectrometry will be used to measure gas breakdown effectiveness, with photoresist removal by oxygen used to determine surface reaction rates. Secondly, data gathered from an existing nanosecond high voltage pulsed generator will define Phase 2 generator specifications. Thirdly, 75 mm diameter ceramic-metal arrays containing multiple applicators, capable of scale up to 300 mm wafer processing size, will be tested. Data will be basis of seeking PEALD demonstration on customer\u2019s test chambers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
