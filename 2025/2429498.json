 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the participation of graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and early-career faculty in the special session titled \"Research Results by Mathematicians from the Enhancing Diversity in Graduate Education (EDGE) Program\" at the 2025 Joint Mathematics Meetings (JMM). The 2025 JMM will be held January 8-11, 2025 in Seattle, Washington. The EDGE program was founded in 1998 to improve retention and completion rates for women and minorities in graduate programs and increase diversity in the mathematics community. The 2025 session will showcase the research of individuals affiliated with the EDGE program. \r\n \r\nThe session provides a platform for those in all areas of mathematics and statistics to present their research findings and generate ideas for new research techniques and directions. Opportunities to strengthen participants' network of mathematicians and establish new mentoring relationships with others affiliated with the EDGE program are provided. The session benefits the larger mathematics community by increasing the visibility of women and minorities in mathematics by highlighting their research work, thereby creating opportunities for recruitment and retention of more people into mathematics. Further information can be found here: https://www.edgeforwomen.org/edge-session-jmm/\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
