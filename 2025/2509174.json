 "awd_abstract_narration": "This I-Corps project is based on the development of black soldier flies to produce omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids are healthy fats found in certain foods such as fish and fish oil supplements. The goal of this technology is to produce a sustainable alternative to fish oils, reducing the overfishing associated with current practices. Unfortunately, the fat product produced naturally from farmed black soldier flies is suboptimal for use in animal feed and is usually disposed of as waste. This technology creates black soldier flies that can produce omega-3 fats that may be harvested and used in pet or livestock feed. This technology addresses these issues by transforming black soldier fly larvae, which are primarily used for protein production, into high-value omega-3 producers. Increasing omega-3 content in black soldier flies may create an economically attractive and environmentally sustainable alternative to fish oil.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of biomanufacturing omega-3 fatty acids in black soldier flies. Omega-3s such as alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) are essential for human and animal health but are primarily sourced from fish oil. This technology uses genetic engineering to enhance black soldier flies to produce larvae with an altered fatty acid composition that is higher in the omega-3 precursor linoleic acid and omega-3 fatty acid alpha lipoic acid (ALA). This technology is based on an automated, genetic screening processes, rapid integration of beneficial transgenes, and the creation of stable, genetically modified insect lines. Currently, black soldier flies are farmed primarily for protein production. Farming genetically enhanced black soldier flies producing omega-3 lipids may improve the value of insect farming and solve the economic challenges of insect farming through a scalable biomanufacturing platform. Potential adopters, including nutraceutical companies and animal feed producers, may benefit from a reliable, scalable, and sustainable supply of omega-3 fatty acids, reducing environmental impacts and improving nutritional outcomes across the nutraceutical, agricultural, and pet food industries.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
