 "awd_abstract_narration": "This CAREER project aims to develop a miniature sensor capable of measuring how heat flow within living cells is affected by variations in thermal conductivity. Thermal conductivity \u2013 the ability of a material to conduct heat \u2013 is a fundamental material property, and variations in thermal conductivity inside a cell can provide valuable insights into biological processes such as metabolism, enzyme activity, and cell communication. This project will create a microdevice specifically designed to detect variations in thermal conductivity within single cells. The knowledge gained from this research has the potential to significantly enhance medical diagnostics and treatments. Understanding the thermal properties could lead to improved therapeutic techniques. Furthermore, insights from this work could benefit studies on disorders and diseases by elucidating how heat flow dynamics influence cellular health and disease progression. This project also includes initiatives to advance education in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and to promote diversity. Research findings will be incorporated into workshops and curriculum development, inspiring students and engaging the public. By tackling fundamental scientific questions and fostering educational growth, this project supports the national interest by advancing scientific knowledge and delivering societal benefits through technological innovation and improved health outcomes.\r\n\r\nThis CAREER project aims to develop an innovative microelectromechanical systems biosensor to measure thermal conductivity at the subcellular level using the 3-omega method. Thermal conductivity is a key biophysical property that governs how heat is transferred. This project seeks to investigate localized thermal conductivity and its correlation with cellular functions such as metabolic activity, enzyme dynamics, and signal transduction pathways. The research involves the design, fabrication, and calibration of a biosensor, which will achieve precise measurements of thermal conductivity. Experimental studies will focus on various cell models. The findings are expected to advance understanding in cellular thermodynamics and contribute to the development of diagnostic tools and therapeutic interventions. In cancer therapy, for example, precise thermal conductivity data could optimize techniques such as hyperthermia treatments, thermal ablation, and cryotherapy. Additionally, this work may benefit research on metabolic disorders and neurodegenerative diseases by uncovering how heat transfer properties affect cellular function and disease progression.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
