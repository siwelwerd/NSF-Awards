 "awd_abstract_narration": "Geohazards pose large risks at geologically active continental margins. These geohazards are interconnected and thus difficult to study in isolation. The goal of this project is to bring together experts to develop plans for an integrated array of instruments to observe these hazards. The array will be designed using Chile as a case study. This is a unique location where frequent events and existing networks provide a global understanding of interacting hazards.  Teams of experts in computer modeling and technical planning will design sub-arrays for earthquake, volcanic, and landslide observations. Teams will also compile new catalogs of earthquakes and landslide susceptibility in the study area. The teams will meet in a 3-day workshop to synthesize results. Broad input from the scientific community will be solicited through a series of webinars. New models and catalogs will be shared openly through the SZ4D website and data repositories to benefit communities exposed to subduction-related hazards in the U.S. and internationally.\r\n\r\nSubduction of ocean lithosphere results in the largest earthquakes, volcanic activity, and landscapes highly prone to destructive landslides. For decades research related to subduction and related geohazards has proceeded piecemeal. This research will provide the basis for an overarching framework for integrated studies that can directly address the linkages between earthquake, volcano, tsunami, and landslide geohazards. This award will support a series of modeling studies and technical planning that will be used to design three overlapping arrays of instrumentation at the Chile Subduction Zone. Chile is unique in combining a high level of geological activity and good logistical access. The instrument array will be designed to observe a broad range of earthquake, volcanic, and landslide processes. The work is organized into ten work packages. Five will assess and plan various aspects of the seismic detection and geodetic network. Two will address sediment and hydrologic transport for landslides. Two will address using seismicity to forecast volcanic processes. The final work package will bring together the others with a  three-day workshop and with scientific community input via a series of webinars. The connection between this research and the SZ4D initiative makes very clear the connection of this planning activity to benefit people who live with subduction-related geohazards in the U.S. and globally.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
