 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal supports scientific users of R/V Atlantic Explorer primarily for NSF funded research projects.  R/V Atlantic Explorer is an Ocean/Intermediate Class Research owned and operated by Bermuda Institution of Ocean Sciences Inc. (BIOS) homeported in Bermuda. The ship is a designated University National Oceanographic Laboratory System operator, and a member of the U.S. Academic Research Fleet (ARF).  The research and cruise activities of R/V Atlantic Explorer support a broad suite of teaching, mentorship, and outreach programs.  \r\n\r\nR/V Atlantic Explorer operations are important contributors to education, training and public outreach. These activities that are strongly linked to the BATS and Hydrostation S programs and include undergraduate and graduate research projects, training at sea and graduate courses with experience at sea as part of the curriculum that are supported by the BATS and Hydrostation S programs. This provision of R/V Atlantic Explorer data are important for researchers and educators to conduct independent research as well as tools for education and mentorship.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
