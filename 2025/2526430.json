 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supports a two-day meeting for scholars supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF) Cyberinfrastructure for Sustained Scientific Innovation (CSSI) program. This meeting is held jointly with a similar meeting for scholars supported by the NSF Cybertraining and the Strengthening the Cyberinfrastructure Professionals Ecosystem (SCIPE) programs. It will serve as a platform for participants to advance the mission of the CSSI program by 1) exchanging Cyberinfrastructure (CI) advancements created by CSSI Principal Investigators (PIs); 2) share best practices for creating and maturing CI; and 3) creating opportunities for collaboration to advance CI development and utilization by interacting with PIs from the Cybertraining, SCIPE, and other NSF communities. \r\n\r\nThe two-day meeting for scholars supported by the National Science Foundation CSSI program will share innovations and best practices for the development of sustainable cyberinfrastructure (CI) among critical stakeholders, including the Cybertraining community, SCIPE community, CSSI community, and Computational and Data-enabled Science and Engineering (CDS&E) community. These workshop interactions will support the continued development of CI to advance science and engineering, and to broaden the nation\u2019s CI portfolio. These impacts will be assessed by various metrics in a final report, which will be disseminated to participants and available through public services.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
