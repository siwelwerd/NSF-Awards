 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant fosters excellence and promotes student engagement in the fields of Dynamics, Vibration, and Acoustics by supporting their participation in the 37th Conference on Mechanical Vibration and Noise (Technical Track VIB), part of the 2025 ASME International Design Engineering Technical Conferences (IDETC 2025). VIB is a leading technical conference that covers a wide spectrum of experimental, analytical, and computational research in dynamics, vibration, and sound/acoustics engineering. Key topics include dynamics and control of smart structures, contact dynamics, data-driven and machine learning techniques in dynamics, biomechanics, biomimetics, industrial applications, and energy harvesting. The conference aims to foster the exchange of ideas and information among engineers and researchers within the vibration and sound community.\r\n\r\nThe primary objective of this grant is to facilitate the participation of a diverse group of undergraduate and graduate students, particularly from underrepresented backgrounds, enhancing their academic and professional development at VIB 2025. This will be achieved by supporting student-oriented activities designed to maximize the academic and professional benefits of the conference. Three specific activities will be initiated under this grant. First, travel support for students and postdoctoral scholars will encourage participation from young talents, building a diverse community and fostering collaborative networks. A panel will select at least 15 participants to expand conference access. Second, the grant supports the Best Student Paper Awards, recognizing outstanding student achievements in dynamics and acoustics, and encouraging high-quality research. Lastly, an Industry Panel will guide graduates and postdocs into the workforce, providing insights from experts and linking academic research with practical applications, aiming to empower students for successful careers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
