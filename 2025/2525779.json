 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides travel support for Principal Investigators (PIs) with current active awards from the NSF Mechanics of Materials and Structures (MoMS) program to attend the 2025 MoMS Grantee Meeting, an integral part of the Society of Engineering Science (SES) Annual Technical Meeting. Scheduled for 12-15 October 2025, in Atlanta, Georgia, the meeting will serve as a platform to bring together NSF MoMS grantees, offering opportunities to strengthen collaborations and facilitate the exchange of cutting-edge ideas and research findings. The meeting will feature a series of poster sessions where grantees can present their research, encouraging peer review, feedback, and discussion. Panel discussions, led by invited experts, will dive deep into current challenges and opportunities in the field of mechanics of materials and structures. Topics will include advances in structural and soft materials, new insights into metamaterials, and the use of data-driven approaches to tackle complex engineering problems. The meeting will also include various social activities designed to promote networking and foster potential collaborations across disciplines and institutions.\r\n\r\nSES has long been a catalyst for advancing research in mechanics, particularly in the areas of structural materials, soft materials, and metamaterials. By providing a forum for the exchange of ideas between seasoned researchers and emerging talent, the meeting will help drive forward-thinking discussions and innovative solutions to pressing challenges in the field. The event will also offer invaluable mentorship opportunities, where established PIs can share insights on how to navigate the research landscape, secure NSF funding, and develop competitive proposals. The 2025 MoMS Grantee Meeting aims to further solidify the mechanics of materials and structures community by strengthening its connections and providing the next generation of researchers with the tools and guidance needed to thrive in their academic and professional careers. This gathering will foster an environment of collaboration and innovation, propelling forward research that is critical to advancing the mechanics of materials and structures, as well as addressing emerging global challenges.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
