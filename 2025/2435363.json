 "awd_abstract_narration": "The emergence of practical applications for quantum information is being hailed as the second quantum revolution due to its potential to transform applications in computing, communications, and sensing. At the root of this revolution is the ability to harness the property of quantum entanglement between two or more quantum systems, or qubits, to push performance beyond the single-state quantum limit. This quantum testbed will work to realize this performance for solid-state quantum sensors capable of measuring molecular structure and dynamics at the single molecule level, validating quantum advantage in applications ranging from materials characterization, to catalysis, to drug discovery. The testbed will coordinate between the quantum creator and end user communities to develop a roadmap to quantum advantage, aligning research activity with critical needs in science and industry. Students participating in the testbed will be mentored within a highly interdisciplinary and convergent environment. The emerging roadmap will be used to inform the development and dissemination of curricular material that will lay the foundation for training the next generation of quantum scientists and engineers in partnership with the QuSTEAM Initiative.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, the testbed is developing a platform for exploiting the entanglement of multi-qubit ensembles to achieve quantum advantage in the measurement of molecular and solid-state systems, including structural, electronic, and dynamic degrees of freedom. This platform allows for the modular deconstruction of the quantum sensor into three fundamental units: (1) a set of molecular targets, (2) a spin-relay layer that directly couples to both the target and readout, and (3) a readout qubit. The power of this modular approach can be seen in the fact that the spin-relay layer can be selectively driven into a metrologically relevant entangled state to enable sensing beyond the standard quantum limit (i.e., sensitivity scaling that surpasses sqrtN). Further, this modularity provides a framework for structuring collaboration and co-design between stakeholders including end users, system manufacturers and quantum researchers across academia, government, and industry.\r\n\r\nThis project advances the objectives of Quantum Information Science and Engineering at NSF in response to the National Quantum Initiative Act for the continued leadership of the United States in QIS and its technology applications.\r\n\r\nThis project is jointly funded by the NSF National Quantum Virtual Laboratory program and the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences in the Directorate for Biological Sciences.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
