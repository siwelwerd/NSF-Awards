Several pathways are available for enhancing strength through control over defects in the material.  However, efforts to-date have failed to bring material strengths anywhere near the holy grail of strengthening, referred to as the ideal strength. This failure has not come from a lack of materials engineering, nor would innovations in materials design or processing immediately solve the problem. Instead, prior approaches have been too limited in scope from the viewpoint of the material\u2019s deformation physics, which is addressed in this research by considering novel design pathways for controlling material structure and, in turn, the defects that govern strength. The findings of this project are applicable to advanced materials with increased chemical complexity, which are desired for modern engineering applications. An interactive online learning module transcending traditional institutional barriers \u2013 denoted the Mechanics Interactive Teaming (MINT) initiative in engineering education \u2013 is being developed to engage students cooperatively at the partnering universities with new virtual learning modules focused on cutting-edge topics in materials science. The initial focus on graduate curricula is being broadened to reach undergraduates through the Women in Science and Engineering Program at Stony Brook University and further expanded for working professionals using relevant design problems through collaboration with the Advanced Casting Research Center at UC Irvine.\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: \r\n\r\nThis research enables materials with near-ideal strength by developing a fundamental understanding of dislocation nucleation and propagation as rate-limiting deformation mechanisms in nanostructured alloys where defect confinement and interaction with grain boundary and lattice solutes act as local barriers to plasticity. Specific research questions to be answered include: (i) what are the important transition states and associated energy barriers for dislocation nucleation at solute-decorated interfaces and for propagation within a nanoscale alloy crystal, (ii) how does interfacial structure and energy variation upon doping alter dislocation nucleation/propagation, and (iii) how do solute atoms inside the grain, which can potentially act as local pinning points but also alter the properties of the lattice, influence dislocation propagation? A practical hypothesis of this research is that the strength of nanocrystalline alloys can be maximized by synergistic doping to stabilize the grain boundaries against local plasticity and delay defect nucleation while simultaneously inhibiting dislocation propagation through the nanograin interiors. Using a combination of atomistic modeling, multi-modal structural characterization, and unique micromechanical testing, this hypothesis is being tested in nanostructured aluminum and copper alloys, where their intrinsically different stacking fault energies will provide access to different confined slip events. In a broad sense, this research will define new strengthening paradigms in nanoengineered metallic materials and establish the mechanistic underpinnings of solute-biased interfacial energy landscapes for understanding fundamental dislocation physics in confined slip environments.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
