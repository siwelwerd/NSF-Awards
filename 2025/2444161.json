 "awd_abstract_narration": "Among non-human primates, the tail is an important arboreal adaptation that allows them to safely move in the trees. Despite its relevance, the complete scope of the primate tail\u2019s functional anatomy is not yet understood. This doctoral dissertation research project increases knowledge regarding the function and evolution of the primate tail, through an analysis of the anatomy and range of motion of the tail in a broad sample of non-human primate species, both living and extinct. This project increases public access to primate tail anatomical data, provides research experience for undergraduate students increasing their access to STEM fields, and reaches the public through multiple outreach events.  \r\n\r\nThis project applies an innovative digital method to quantify the range of motion of the vertebrae that compose the non-human primate tail. Digital models are generated for several primate species, and detailed anatomical measurements are obtained from them.   These data are integrated with known information regarding tail length, and function. Together, the information allows for the assessment of anatomical form-function correlations in this important anatomical segment. Additionally, the methods and data are Holland-Lulewicz employed to reconstruct (and revisit previous interpretations of) the tail behavior of a fossil primate (Cebupithecia sarmientoi). Through a detailed analysis of both living and fossil primate tail functional anatomy, this study advances the scientific understanding of this important anatomical unit.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
