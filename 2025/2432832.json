 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader/commercial impact of this SBIR Phase I project is to produce durable, flexible, and high-efficiency perovskite solar panels. These panels offer a power conversion efficiency of 20% and lower manufacturing costs compared to existing technologies. The global market for perovskite solar cells is expected to reach approximately $3 billion by 2030, growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 56.5%. The key metric for the success of the perovskite solar market is its stability. With a projected lifespan exceeding 25 years, a global market share of at least 1% is projected in the short term, resulting in annual revenue of $30 million by 2030, which is expected to grow significantly. Investment in the manufacturing of this type of technology is important for achieving energy security and independence for the United States.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this project lies in manufacturing high-performance mixed halide-based perovskite solar cells with long-term stability. To address the limitations of previous perovskite-based technologies, the focus is on improving stability by tackling both extrinsic factors (such as moisture and heat) and intrinsic factors (like halide ion movement within the perovskite material) that contribute to cell degradation. The more severe internal degradation is prevented through two-dimensional perovskites and ultra-thin atomic layer deposition (ALD) coated buffer layers, significantly mitigating ion migration. Additionally, the buffer layers serve as suitable moisture barriers, enhancing protection against extrinsic degradation factors. This technology is unique because it addresses instability challenges from the inside out, leveraging novel buffer layers and encapsulation methods to provide the superior durability needed for mainstream commercialization. Compared to conventional solar cells, perovskites can be manufactured using simple, solution-based, and low-temperature processing techniques (approximately 100-150\u00b0C versus around 1400\u00b0C for silicon), which reduces costs. Project objectives include: 1) Enhancing stability of the perovskite material to support a 30-year solar cell lifetime, 2) Constructing perovskite-based cells on flexible substrates, enabling application across a broad range of markets, and 3) Demonstrating roll-to-roll manufacturability, validating ease of scaleup and implementation.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
