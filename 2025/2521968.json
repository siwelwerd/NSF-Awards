 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support participation of early career scientists in Ribosomes 2025, this year's triennial international conference on ribosome research. The conference will be held at the Asilomar Conference Grounds in Pacific Grove, CA on June 22-27, 2025. Ribosomes are the molecular machines that translate genetic information carried in messenger RNA into protein in all living organisms, thus serving as the vital link between genotype and phenotype. The purpose of this conference is to bring together researchers from all over the world to communicate their latest findings to each other, and to stimulate critical discussion and promote collaboration. The gathering will provide a unique opportunity for graduate students and postdoctoral scholars to present new results of their research and to advance knowledge through engagement with peers and leaders in the ribosome field.\r\n\r\nRibosomes are the largest, most complex asymmetric biomolecular structures, presenting many daunting challenges to scientists investigating their form and function in living systems. The conference will enable researchers to share expertise across many disciplines, including foundational knowledge and new technological developments that advance ribosome biology and the fields of protein synthesis and gene expression at large.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
