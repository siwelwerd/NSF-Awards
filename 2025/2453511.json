 "awd_abstract_narration": "Post-quantum cryptography (PQC) has gained significant attention from various communities, from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) PQC standardization process to the 2022 National Security Memorandum. The need to conduct research on PQC and quantum computing security is increasing. Among those, many aspects of hardware security research that are unexplored or underdeveloped. This workshop fills this gap.  This workshop covers topics: (i) for PQC, including new design methodology, secure hardware implementation methods, and new simulation tool design and development for security assessment; (ii) for quantum computing, including novel strategies for addressing cybersecurity challenges, fault tolerance techniques, quantum risk assessment, quantum-secure ecosystem, and practical transition. \r\n\r\nThis workshop integrates the hardware security research with new trend in the PQC and quantum computing. The invited talks and panel discussion summary in this workshop promote two important research topics in the era of quantum computers. This workshop will foster a strong research community in the U.S. to investigate the new round of hardware security research for PQC and quantum computing. This research project echoes the recent U.S. National Security Memorandum on promoting PQC and quantum computing research. On the research community side, this workshop serves as a platform to cultivate a strong research community in the U.S.; on the technology development side, this workshop offers opportunities to lead researchers and scientists in the field to boost novel ideas and new directions regarding hardware security for PQC and quantum computing. The efforts of inviting underrepresented groups and female researchers will also foster a strong and diverse research team in the U.S.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
