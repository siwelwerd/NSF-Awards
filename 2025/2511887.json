 "awd_abstract_narration": "This I-Corps project is based on the development of pulse oximeter designed for neonatal care. While pulse oximetry, electrocardiogram (ECG), and temperature monitoring are established practices during neonatal care, current devices can be unwieldy, requiring troubleshooting and wasting precious time due to difficulties like opening clenched neonatal fists, adhesive issues on wet skin, and complex application procedures. The accurate monitoring of oxygen saturation during neonatal care is vital to prevent complications from both excessive and insufficient oxygen levels.  This technology is a rapidly appliable, multifunctional pulse oximeter designed specifically to address the challenges of neonatal care. The device's design allows it to be easily attached to a newborn's clenched fist using a flexible rounded post, enabling quicker and more reliable monitoring. In addition, the design includes a convertible clip that facilitates both short-term and long-term attachment without detaching the device. Eliminating the need for adhesive and reducing the complexity of application may serve to improve neonatal monitoring, potentially reducing the risk of complications from both excessive and insufficient oxygen levels and improving neonatal care.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of a pulse oximeter designed for neonatal applications. This technology is designed to provide accurate pulse oximetry, electrocardiogram (ECG), and temperature monitoring without the use of adhesives. The solution may be easily attached to a newborn's clenched fist using a flexible rounded post, enabling quicker and more reliable monitoring. The device also includes a convertible clip to strap design to facilitate both short-term and long-term attachment without detaching the device. Accurate and timely monitoring of vital signs in newborns is critical to preventing conditions such as retinopathy of prematurity, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and neurodevelopmental impairment as a result of complications from both excessive and insufficient oxygen levels. In addition, this device is designed to integrate with existing hospital monitoring systems, which may facilitate adoption in hospitals and neonatal care units. The technology may improve neonatal care and may be suitable for use in other clinical environments, potentially extending its impact beyond neonatal care.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
