 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds for participant travel support to the 50th Annual New York State Regional Graduate Mathematics Conference (ANYSRGMC) which will be held at Syracuse University on March 28 and 29, 2025.  In addition, the grant also provides funds for the 51st and 52nd editions of the conference which are planned for March or April of 2026 and 2027.   The ANYSRGMC is the longest running graduate mathematics conference in the country and is organized primarily by graduate students.  The conference presents an opportunity for graduate students in New York State and surrounding regions to come together, share current research, and interact with other graduate students in a similar phase of their academic career. Opportunities to speak at conferences are an essential part of training future mathematicians. Unlike other graduate student mathematics conferences in the region, at the ANYSRGMC graduate students in all areas of mathematics have an opportunity to present their research. In many cases this is the first time a graduate student will speak at a conference, giving them a valuable opportunity to learn how to structure and deliver a talk. In addition, given the broad range of topics covered, graduate students are exposed to areas of mathematics that they are less familiar with, potentially broadening their research horizons. NSF funding increases access to this conference, giving graduate students with fewer financial resources an opportunity to travel to the conference.\r\n\r\nThe majority of the ANYSRGMC consists of 30-minute graduate student talks given in parallel sessions. There are also two invited guest speakers who give keynote addresses. The two speakers are typically prominent mathematicians in two distinct areas of mathematics who can speak to the diverse interests of the graduate student participants. In addition to hearing interesting mathematics, students can meet and learn from successful mathematicians outside of their home universities. Breaks between the talks give graduate students a chance to interact with each other, potentially leading to new collaborations. The website for the conference is at https://mgo.syr.edu/conferences/upcoming/\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
