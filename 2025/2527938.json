 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nontechnical Description:\r\nNanotechnology plays a critical role in fueling advances in information technology. Miniaturization and scaling of the basic devices that underpin all leading technologies in computing, communication, and sensing are based on innovations, and therefore research advances, in nanotechnology.  This project will support the 19th Nanotechnology Forum between the United States and South Korea, which will be held July 3-4, 2025, in Kintex, Gyeonggi-do, South Korea. Past nanotechnology fora between the two countries have addressed leading-edge topics at the time of each forum. The present forum will continue this tradition by focusing on nanotechnology issues related to Neuromorphic Computing, Quantum Sensing, and Sustainability in Semiconductor Manufacturing by Design. The key objective of past fora, including this one, is to facilitate networking among members of the research communities and funding agencies of the two countries.  The forums have always enabled exchange of technical information and exploration of opportunities for collaborations. This was the motivation that led to the convening of the 1st U.S.-Korea Forum on Nanotechnology that was jointly supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation and its Korean counterpart.\r\n\r\nTechnical Description \r\nThe 19th U.S.-Korea Nanotechnology Forum will bring together a bi-national community of expert researchers and innovators, working on leading-edge, next-generation neuromorphic systems, novel quantum sensing schemes, all based on sustainable semiconductor manufacturing processes. This forum will stimulate efforts to promote these areas.  Expected outcomes of the forum will lead to definition of new milestones and vigorous research collaborative opportunities in both countries, thus advancing investigations of scientific and technological questions with potential to make significant economic development, welfare, and security. The exchange of ideas among leading scientists and engineers in the neuromorphic, quantum sensing, and semiconductor technology areas, will spur new paradigms of investigations in these areas, thus promoting collaborations in them. In addition to individual collaborations, the forum is expected to nurture development new research frameworks by the funding agencies of the two countries. The discussion will enable the U.S. to pivot towards transformative approaches for novel semiconductor manufacturing and sensor development.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
