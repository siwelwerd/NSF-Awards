 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will provide funding for the \u201cIntegers Conference 2025,\u201d which will be held in Athens, Georgia, May 14-17, 2025. The conference is being hosted by the Department of Mathematics of the University of Georgia. The Integers conferences, of which this will be the tenth, serve to bring together mathematicians and students interested in the fields of combinatorics and number theory. The conference will promote interaction among research mathematicians at all career stages ranging from undergraduate mathematics students to internationally distinguished researchers. A significant portion of the funding will support students and early-career faculty.\r\n\r\nThe conference will serve as a catalyst for major collaborative projects among mathematicians representing the areas of additive number theory, multiplicative number theory, combinatorial game theory, probabilistic number theory, enumerative combinatorics, combinatorial optimization, Ramsey theory, the theory of partitions, and other areas of number theory and combinatorics. It will feature twelve plenary speakers and about fifty additional speakers. The conference organizers intend to include a number of student research talks, including talks presented by students who have recently participated in NSF \u201cResearch Experiences for Undergraduates\u201d programs. The proceedings of the conference will be published as a special volume of the journal Integers. The following website has been created for the conference: https://sites.google.com/view/integersconference2025\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
