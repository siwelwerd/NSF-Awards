 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Delaware's College of Earth, Ocean and Environment (CEOE) in Lewes, DE will host a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site program. The program will bring ten undergraduates to UD\u2019s Lewes campus each summer for three years to conduct independent ocean science research with the guidance of a research mentor. The main focus of the program is to train students in the process of doing science including such skills as formulation of research questions, research methods and design, and problem solving. Interns will also participate in professional development workshops on topics ranging from science ethics, to science communication, to grad school funding. They will join several field trips including a half-day aboard the R/V Daiber, a marsh walk, and a daylong trip to Cape May to join the Rutgers REU program to learn about aquaculture practices and careers. At the end of the summer, interns will be encouraged to apply to the CEOE graduate program and considered for a graduate fellowship.\r\n\r\nThis program will provide a total of thirty undergraduates with extensive research experience and career training. The site has state of the art research facilities, excellent mentors and access to the local coastal environment. Potential research topics include a wide breadth of ocean science ranging from microbial ecology, to paleoceanography, to comparative physiology and behavior of marine animals to biogeochemistry and physical oceanography, in addition to other topics. Professional development opportunities for interns will complement research training and will address career options, paying for graduate school, and more. The program will continue collaborations with Delaware Technical Community College and Delaware State University. This project is jointly funded by the Division of Ocean Sciences and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
