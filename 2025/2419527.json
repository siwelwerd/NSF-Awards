 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is a comprehensive archaeological study of early human settlements in rural settings. This research builds on previous research, combining targeted excavations and remote sensing techniques to examine the site's occupation both during the height of its the occupant society's power and its subsequent decline. Past scholarship has predominantly focused on urban centers and the centralized power of the ruling elite, often overlooking rural settlements that played a vital role in an imperial landscape. Archaeological surveys have identified a significant expansion of rural settlements during the empire\u2019s peak, yet the nature of these settlements remains underexamined. This project addresses this gap by investigating the importance of rural communities and political power. The research includes students and local archaeologists who are being trained to enable future mapping and analysis.\r\n \r\nThis project examines the relationship between imperial settlement policies and local community dynamics, focusing on agricultural organization, production, and the interaction between rural communities and the surrounding environment.  Through the excavation of large building complexes and domestic spaces, the project investigates agropastoral production and storage practices that were crucial to the local economy. The team employs advanced remote sensing methods, including magnetic gradiometry, to map subsurface site features and landscape. The project involves a robust sampling and analysis program, utilizing isotopic analysis of faunal and botanical remains, as well as ceramic and sediment analysis, to evaluate the extent of centralized administration, local subsistence strategies, and human-environment interactions. This interdisciplinary research has the potential to shed light on how ancient imperial projects influenced rural life and how these communities adapted during periods of political instability and collapse.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
