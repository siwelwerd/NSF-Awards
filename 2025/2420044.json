 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research programs supported by R/V Neil Armstrong will enhance understanding of the oceans and address a broad range of important scientific questions including significant insights into the impacts of global ocean climate change in the next decade. The goal of this proposal is to provide funding to continue operating and maintaining the R/V Armstrong and to support its planned life cycle safely and\r\nproductively.\r\n\r\nAn increased awareness of our responsibility to provide access to science from the classroom and to the public has resulted in the development of new avenues to share these scientific findings. Educational and outreach programs will continue to be an integral part of future expeditions on the R/V Neil Armstrong. These efforts include MIT-WHOI graduate student introductory cruises, telepresence capabilities on the ship, expedition web sites and social media, which allow for effective interaction with classrooms, providing real-time images and video, data and two-way communication between scientists and students in national and international schools and outreach to the public through the WHOI website.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
