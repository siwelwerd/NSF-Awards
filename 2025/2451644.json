 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project aims at bringing together researchers in partial differential equations (PDEs) and applied mathematics from the northeastern United States. The workshop features researchers at various career stages and will foster new research connections and collaborations among senior and junior participants. Special care will be taken to attract attendees from colleges and universities in the northeast region, which hosts a large population of students. The successful stories of the invited speakers will inspire younger generation of students to pursue careers in STEM fields. A panel discussion will offer graduate and undergraduate students valuable insights into potential career paths for individuals with a mathematics degree.\r\n\r\nOver the past two decades, significant progress and important breakthroughs have been achieved in several branches of nonlinear PDEs. An important development is that techniques developed in one area have played crucial roles in other areas. Moreover, there has been a remarkable growth in the use of computer-assisted proofs. The workshop will mainly focus on current research areas: i) recent progress in fluid dynamics; ii) new results in non-convex calculus of variations. Participants will be introduced to cutting-edge topics in nonlinear PDEs and learn about the latest techniques developed to address those problems. Whenever possible, lectures will be recorded, and a poster session featuring graduate students will be held. The event is open to anyone interested in the conference themes.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
