 "awd_abstract_narration": "Lung cancer detection has traditionally relied on imaging and tissue biopsies, which are accurate but have significant drawbacks. The challenge is to develop simpler and more cost-effective early detection methods. The proposed solution is a carbon dot-based nano-sensor that can detect specific lung cancer markers in saliva. This sensor, designed at the nanoscale, uses modified carbon dots with receptors to offer a large surface area for detecting deficient levels of cancer markers. The goal is to create an affordable, convenient, and non-invasive kit for early lung cancer diagnosis that overcomes the limitations of current methods.  The project will provide students with practical biomedical research experience, using existing resources to support their future graduate studies and careers in advanced technology. By working on carbon dot biosensors for lung cancer detection in saliva, students will gain valuable skills. The findings will be published in leading journals, helping to build the research team\u2019s reputation and improve public health, particularly for those at risk of lung cancers.\r\n\r\nBiosensors are crucial in modern biomedical diagnostics and are used for real-time monitoring of treatments, disease tracking, environmental checks, food safety, and advanced research. Combining these sensors with high-affinity biomolecules can detect a wide range of substances with high sensitivity and selectivity. Recent advances in biomarker detection have made it possible to use saliva for non-invasive diagnostics in both oral and systemic diseases. Lung cancer (LC), a leading cause of cancer-related deaths, can affect salivary glands, changing saliva's composition and amount. Traditional diagnostic tools like X-rays and CT scans are often ineffective for early detection. Liquid biopsy using saliva is a promising alternative because saliva contains various biomolecules, including the sensitive tumor marker CYFRA 21-1. This marker, a fragment of cytokeratin-19, is present in low levels in healthy individuals but increases in LC patients. Our project aims to enhance the detection of CYFRA 21-1 in saliva using carbon dots (CDs) functionalized with anti-CYFRA 21-1 (aCYFRA 21-1). These fluorescent, biocompatible CDs offer a large surface area, making them ideal for lung cancer research. The project will develop a lab-on-chip device with this biosensor and test its effectiveness for early lung cancer diagnosis using saliva samples. The project involves three main tasks: (1) Synthesizing and Characterizing: Creating and analyzing the carbon dot-based biosensor functionalized with anti-CYFRA 21-1; (2) Assessing Binding Efficiency: Evaluating how well the biosensor detects CYFRA 21-1 in both standard and actual saliva samples; and (3) Developing a Microfluidic Device: Building a device to detect CYFRA 21-1 by monitoring its interaction with the anti-CYFRA 21-1 molecules on the biosensor.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
