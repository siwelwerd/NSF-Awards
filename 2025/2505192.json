 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will partially fund 10 students to attend the 2024 Women in Hardware and Systems Security (WISE) Workshop.  Hardware and systems security is a critical social issue given society's reliance on microelectronics that are targets of malicious attackers.  To increase the number, quality, and diversity of hardware and systems security researchers, the WISE workshop series provides intellectual, mentoring, and professional network development activities for researcher entering the field.  The series offers a platform for the exchange of innovative ideas around hardware and systems security, as well as panel discussions of the professional challenges of succeeding in this research area.  Students will also have the opportunity to present posters about their own work to both the WISE workshop and the co-located IEEE International Symposium on Hardware Oriented Security and Trust (HOST).\r\n\r\nThrough these efforts, the WISE workshop series will broaden participation in hardware and systems security, in turn increasing the size and quality of the workforce.  Students' work will also be disseminated through the WISE YouTube channel, increasing awareness of hardware and systems security advances for both the research community and the general public.  Students will be selected based on financial need, the relevance of their research to the field of hardware and systems security, and their career stage (with consideration given to both first-time attendees and to attendees about to enter the job market).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
