 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 2025 Midwest Numerical Analysis Day (MWNADay) is scheduled to take place on April 5-6, 2025, at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. This conference will provide a collaborative platform for researchers from the Midwest region and beyond to share knowledge and build connections in numerical analysis, computational mathematics, and related applied fields. By fostering a welcoming and low-pressure environment, MWNADay has become particularly valuable for early-career researchers, enabling them to present their work, exchange ideas, and explore collaborations. This event will also emphasize and encourage participation from individuals across many types of groups and institutions with limited access to major conferences. As computational technologies continue to impact various disciplines, MWNADay serves a crucial role in strengthening the community and advancing the frontiers of computational and numerical sciences.\r\n\r\nMWNADay 2025 focuses on promoting advancements in numerical analysis and scientific computing by providing a forum for researchers to discuss cutting-edge developments, exchange methodologies, and explore interdisciplinary applications. The conference will draw participants from various academic and research institutions, including (according to the Carnegie Classification System) the 26 R1 (very high research activity) and 32 R2 (high research activity) universities in the Midwest, to share insights and engage in collaborative discussions. Central to its mission is the development of efficient numerical algorithms and their theoretical foundations, which are essential for addressing challenges in fields such as fluid dynamics, biomechanics, and geophysics. The local organizing committee aims to facilitate the participation of a broad audience, particularly early-career researchers, as well as faculty from institutions where access to major research conferences may be limited. MWNADay will offer a range of activities, including technical presentations, poster sessions, and networking opportunities, to inspire innovation and foster partnerships among attendees. Additionally, the conference aims to bridge gaps between research communities by integrating junior and senior researchers and advancing knowledge transfer across disciplines, ultimately contributing to the broader fields of numerical analysis and computational mathematics. The conference website is https://math.unl.edu/midwest-numerical-analysis-day-2025\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
