 "awd_abstract_narration": "A planning workshop will be held for the atmospheric chemistry community to discuss the future instrumentation needs of the community as part of the Lower Atmospheric Observing Facilities. The Lower Atmospheric Observing Facilities are managed by the National Center for Atmospheric Research and administered by University Corporation for Atmospheric Research. The facility provides instruments to the atmospheric science community for use in field campaigns or in other observational studies. This workshop will bring together the research community to focus on emerging needs in lower atmosphere observational capabilities that will lead to scientific advances in atmospheric chemistry and Earth system science.\r\n\r\nThe goals of the meetings are: (1) Discuss the community\u2019s observational needs now and into the future with an emphasis on the NSF Lower Atmospheric Observing Facilities and the Community Instruments and Facilities; (2) Improve communication and knowledge about atmospheric chemistry observational research activities being conducted by university PIs and scientists supported by the NSF-Atmospheric Chemistry Program and scientists supported at NSF sponsored facilities; (3) Encourage new and continued collaboration between NSF-Atmospheric Chemistry Program-supported PIs and NSF facility scientists; and (4) Develop a widespread understanding in the community of the atmospheric chemistry observational activities and community facilities available at NSF supported centers. The workshop will be held June 16-18 in Boulder Colorado. It will serve to initiate a direct dialogue between all participants, to inform each other of current scientific activities, to discuss future observational needs and to develop plans for future research and collaborations.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
