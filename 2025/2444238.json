 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will restore a critical scientific instrument at the University of Rochester. The instrument, known as a laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (LA-ICP-MS), allows scientists to precisely measure tiny concentrations of elements in rocks and minerals. Bringing this instrument back to full working order ensures that researchers can continue investigating how Earth\u2019s crust formed and evolved, as well as how essential resources and minerals concentrate in certain regions. These discoveries are not only vital for advancing scientific understanding of Earth\u2019s past, but also for informing the sustainable use of natural resources and promoting science education. In addition, using the instrument in undergraduate teaching labs will allow students to gain hands-on research experience and develop critical skills for future careers in science.\r\n\r\nThe primary goal of this project is to repair the software, computing hardware, and laser components of the LA-ICP-MS system, with the goal of extending its useful lifespan by a decade. The restored instrument will support several active NSF-funded research initiatives at the University of Rochester\u2019s Early Earth and Experimental Geochemistry Laboratory. These initiatives include studying the geochemical signatures of ancient impact melt sheets to understand Earth\u2019s early crust formation, investigating the cycling of halogen elements over geologic time, and identifying regions with the potential to host critical mineral deposits essential to modern technologies. To achieve these objectives, degraded computer and control software components will be replaced, the laser head and related hardware will be repaired, and the system will be recalibrated to ensure stable, reliable operation. With these improvements, the LA-ICP-MS will again provide high-precision isotopic and elemental data of natural and experimental samples, and enhance educational experiences for both graduate and undergraduate students.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
