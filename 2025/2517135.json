 "awd_abstract_narration": "The impact of this I-Corps project is based on a water resistant, clear glass that is energy-efficient and low-maintenance and can be used by various industries, such as construction, real estate, hospitality, and healthcare. This solution seeks to address the high energy consumption and maintenance costs associated with traditional glass in buildings, which contributes to increased operational expenses. By reducing maintenance requirements, enhancing energy efficiency, and offering privacy through customizable translucency, this solution can improve both the functionality and aesthetic quality of residential and commercial architecture. \r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of an advanced hydrophobic coating technology for glass surfaces. This solution consists of a high-performance coating process that imparts hydrophobic properties, high-temperature resistance, and customizable translucency to glass, providing a durable and cost-effective alternative to traditional glass coatings. The scientific advances behind this technology include the development of a long-lasting coating that overcomes the limitations of existing products, which often degrade quickly or fail under high temperatures. The benefits of this approach include lower cleaning costs, reduced energy consumption, and an extended lifespan for glass surfaces, providing users with a practical solution that improves maintenance efficiency, enhances privacy, and promotes long-term cost savings in both commercial and residential settings.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
