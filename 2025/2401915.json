 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project enables fundamental electrochemical research aimed at using sustainable electricity (e.g., electricity produced from solar energy through photovoltaic devices) to promote the catalytic splitting of water to generate \"green\" hydrogen.  Sustainable green hydrogen production is a critical technology needed to ensure production of fuels and chemicals without carbon emissions. Platinum (Pt) is a key catalytic element utilized in electrochemical water splitting, but it is expensive.  The project focuses on novel electrocatalyst designs that utilize Pt atoms more efficiently than current practice for the electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER).  The project contains broad-reaching educational and outreach activities aimed at providing underserved students with increased access to research facilities and STEM resources.  \r\n\r\nThe project is aimed at studying the relationship between the local atomic structure and composition of the Pt microenvironments and HER mechanisms and kinetics. The project  focuses on the discovery of new degrees of freedom for tuning the activity of atom-efficient Pt-based catalytic materials rooted in: (1) understanding the effects of synthesis conditions on the surface topographic features, including exposed facets, low-coordinated surface sites, and interfaces, and on the structure and stability of supported and embedded Pt aggregates and (2) revealing the relationships between the structural and compositional configurations of these materials and their ability to promote the HER.  Experimental and theoretical approaches will be combined to investigate the effects of supporting Pt on a wide range of thin-film transition elements consisting of varying atomic size, electronegativity, electronic configuration, and crystalline structure.  The data obtained will be used to establish a robust model for the design of low-cost, high performing HER electrocatalysts.  From the broader impact perspective, the project will support the development of a well-trained STEM workforce. The partnership between faculties and students at Elizabeth City State University (ESCU) and partner institutions \u2013 including national laboratories - ensures that achieving the project\u2019s scientific goals is complemented by building foundations for research and education at ECSU that support the development of a diverse, equitable, and inclusive research community in the northeastern North Carolina region.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
