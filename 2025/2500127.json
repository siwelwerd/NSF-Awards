 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact of this I-Corps project is the development of a cooling system for mechanical finishing processes of additive manufactured metal parts. The technology has the potential to improve surface finishes while increasing the strength of the material. This technology will result in decreasing crack formation and propagation, increasing the fatigue life of treated products. The new surface finish process will improve the quality of the printed parts while decreasing production time.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. This solution is based on the development of a cooling system to support mechanical finishing processes. The solution is a device that uses pressurized compressed air, already available in most industry environments, to cool the substrate surface during the finishing process instead of using traditional coolants. The process can be applied to any additive manufactured metal part, slowing down crack initiation in processed surfaces. The aim of this technology is to become a preferred secondary processing method for additive manufactured metal parts. The improvement in surface quality should result in an increase in the use of additive manufacturing as a repair technique.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
