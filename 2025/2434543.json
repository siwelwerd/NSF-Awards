 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact of this I-Corps project is the development of innovative water purification technology utilizing biobased nanocomposite for the removal of a wide range of contaminants from water. This sustainable, cost effective, and scalable solution addresses the global challenge of providing access to clean drinking water quickly and conveniently in all kinds of emergencies or disasters. A sustainable and energy efficient solution for water purification could improve public health and quality of life by reducing water borne diseases. This project could also enhance crop yields and food production by providing clean water for irrigation. This fast water pollution mitigation technology can remove the disadvantages of commercial filters. \r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. This solution is based on development of a sustainable, cost effective, multifunctional, and scalable water purification technology that addresses the global challenges of providing access to safe, clean water, especially during emergencies or disasters. The present technology consists of a modified, novel, composite filter material using biochar embedded silver nanoparticles extracted from agricultural waste. The use of silver nanoparticles has exhibited high bioactivity and antimicrobial properties towards common bacteria like E. coli and are non-toxic in comparison to disinfection agents like chlorine. The water cleaning technique is adsorption, which is simple, energy efficient, fast, and does not require a centralized water purification unit to generate potable water. In comparison to other adsorbents, the fabricated nanocomposite does not generate any chlorinated bye products. The project utilizes functionalized biochar, which is abundant and economically-friendly compared to other sorbent materials used in commercial water purification systems. The fabricated purifier can fill the gap of conventional wastewater treatment systems at an affordable price and can pave the way for future innovations in sustainable water technologies.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
