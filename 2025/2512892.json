 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supports the 2025 Gordon Research Conference and Gordon Research Seminar on Atmospheric Chemistry. The theme of the conference is \u201cUnderstanding the Atmosphere via Molecular Processes and Global Impacts.\u201d  This conference brings together researchers from universities, government laboratories, and private research institutes, to promote the discussion of information and ideas on topics of contemporary interest in atmospheric chemistry. The conference  concentrates on the latest developments in the field, including the fundamental understanding of chemical processes from the molecular level to global impacts on Earth and space.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this symposium lies in bringing together leaders and scholars covering a broad range of research in the field of atmospheric chemistry, including research on the sources, sinks, transport, transformation and impacts of gases and aerosols in the atmosphere through models, observations, and experiments. This conference will have sessions on the following topics: atmospheric chemistry as a driver and consequence of climate change, chemistry in the remote and biogenic environments, multiphase processes in atmospheric chemistry, new insights into reactive nitrogen, pinning down our understanding of chemical mechanisms, exploring known and emerging air pollutants, challenges in indoor air chemistry, fires fueling atmospheric chemistry, and atmospheric composition from space. The broader impacts of the symposium derive from the exchange of ideas that help to focus the research community on the most pressing questions in atmospheric chemistry.  Young scientists are invited to the Gordon Research Seminar that immediately precedes the conference. The Gordon Research Seminar provides an opportunity for young scientists to meet, network, and exchange ideas with leaders in the atmospheric sciences. The Gordon Research Conference and Gordon Research Seminar on Atmospheric Chemistry create a broad intellectual impact on the atmospheric scientific community.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
