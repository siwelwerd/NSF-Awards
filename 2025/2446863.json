 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact of this I-Corps project is the development of a seaweed-based coating to preserve the freshness of perishable produce. Currently, about one-third of fresh produce is lost post-harvest, equating to about 40 billion pounds of food, $50 billion in revenue losses, and 8% of greenhouse gas emissions annually. These losses pose a significant threat to both U.S. and global food security. The goal for the technology is to develop a carbon-negative, edible coating derived from seaweed that can extend the shelf life of perishable produce by twofold or more. This technology may reduce food loss across the supply chain, from farmers to retailers, increasing profits for stakeholders and potentially enhancing consumer intake of fruits and vegetables. The aim of this project is to reduce spoilage of highly perishable and fragile produce grown in the U.S. such as berries, mushrooms, peaches, and others.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of a produce preservation technology. This technology uses a seaweed-based edible coating and manufacturing process and a precision coating process that applies the coating to fresh fruits and vegetables to extend their shelf-life. The seaweed extracts are derived from farmed seaweed using a green biorefinery method that eliminates the use of harsh chemicals. The coating is formulated into an edible coating ingredient that is shelf-stable. The coating material is easily dissolved in water prior to the use and applied using a precision spray technology that is quick drying (up to 4x faster than dip coating) and reduces material usage (<20% material compared to dip coating). In addition, the coating is compliant with the Food and Drug Administration's Generally Recognized as Safe requirements, and U.S. Department of Agriculture-Organic standards. Lab results show that the coating reduces the weight loss from respiration and fungal spoilage in strawberries, each by more than 50% compared to the no-coating control.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
