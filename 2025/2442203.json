 "awd_abstract_narration": "Plants and pollinators share a fascinating relationship, with flowers attracting insects like bees using colors, scents, and shapes, while rewarding them with nectar. This interaction is essential for pollination and food production. Surprisingly, recent studies show that plants can \"listen\" to the sound of pollinators, such as the buzzing of bees, and respond by producing sweeter nectar. How plants achieve this remains a mystery. This award aims to uncover the physical and molecular mechanisms that allow plants to detect and respond to sound. The principal investigator (PI) proposes that the plant cell wall acts like a filter, vibrating at specific frequencies, while structures called Hechtian strands help transmit these vibrations to the cell's interior. This process could trigger changes inside the cell, leading to the production of sugars and other responses critical for pollination. By studying these processes in detail using cutting-edge tools and techniques, this award will provide new insights into how plants interact with their environment.\r\n\r\nBeyond advancing scientific knowledge, this project has practical applications in agriculture. Understanding how sound influences nectar production could lead to innovative methods for boosting crop yields and supporting pollinator populations. Additionally, the educational outreach program will bring this exciting science into classrooms, inspiring the next generation of scientists and making complex ideas about plant biology accessible and engaging for all.\r\n\r\nThis project is jointly funded by the Physics of Living Systems and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
