 "awd_abstract_narration": "The workshop \"Around singularities in Poisson geometry\" will take place August 4-8, 2025 and will be hosted by the Banff International Research Station (BIRS) at the Institute of Advanced Study in Mathematics (IASM) in Hangzhou, China. Its aim is to bring together researchers in Poisson geometry, foliation theory, and representation theory to study an array of questions related to singularity theory in the Poisson setting. The program will feature surveys on three of the most active topics in this area, followed by research talks, a series of open discussions, and several events designed to promote the engagement of early-career participants. The goal of these activities is to introduce the participants to new mathematical perspectives on Poisson singularity theory, and to create an opportunity for new interdisciplinary collaborations. The purpose of this award is to support the participation of US-based researchers in this international event.\r\n\r\nThe rich geometric behavior of Poisson spaces around singular points, where the rank of the Poisson bivector drops, is governed by a subtle interplay of geometric and algebraic phenomena. The workshop will focus on three interrelated problems in Poisson singularity theory: normal form theorems, deformations, and desingularization. The surveys and talks will address these problems as they occur in an array of geometric settings, including differential geometry, foliation theory, holomorphic geometry, the theory of Lie algebroids and Lie groupoids, algebraic geometry, and geometric representation theory. It will give participants an opportunity to apply current methods in one discipline to open problems in another, fostering a new dialogue around singularities in Poisson geometry. More details can be found at https://www.birs.ca/events/2025/5-day-workshops/25w5442.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
