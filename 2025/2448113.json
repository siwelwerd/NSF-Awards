 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant is in partial support of a three-day symposium to identify research gaps and needs for ambient energy buildings. The symposium is targeted to be held in the fall of 2025 at Ghost Ranch, New Mexico. Ghost Ranch is a historic and fitting location for this ambient energy focused event, as the site includes passive solar cabins. Registration will be limited to approximately 55 in-person and 30 virtual participants from all facets of building research, education, policy, and industry. Ambient energy for buildings offers promising contributions for handling energy challenges. Much of the energy use in homes is directed towards maintaining comfortable temperatures, such as heating and cooling, and ambient energy approaches address both these functions. Moreover, regular household activities like hot water, lighting, refrigeration, and cooking can be powered more sustainably with ambient approaches. The abundant energy offered by the natural environment\u2014sourced from the sun, wind, sky and earth\u2014holds untapped potential. Further, by weaving in natural light and designs inspired by nature, living spaces can be transformed into more comfortable and health-promoting environments. Ambient-conditioned buildings can serve not only as a cornerstone for architectural advancement but can also significantly contribute to environmental sustainability, societal well-being, and educational development. The symposium aims to be a hub of innovation, bringing together luminaries from diverse fields such as architecture, design, engineering, and education. Anticipated key outcomes of the symposium include (1) a roadmap for integrating ambient energy and passive solar into modern building practices, (2) cross-disciplinary collaborations formed to spearhead new projects and research in the field, (3) a collection of best practices, case studies, and recommendations to guide policymakers and industry leaders in adopting sustainable practices, and (4) a website that will serve as a hub that houses the items just listed.\r\n\r\nThe 21st century presents a dual mandate: to counteract climate change and ensure the wellbeing of the global populace. A pivotal player in this scenario is the building sector. The startling fact is that in the US, buildings dominate energy consumption charts, utilizing a significant proportion of electricity and natural gas. Their contribution to carbon emissions is also high. To tackle climate change effectively, there must be a focus on the building sector. While there has been enthusiasm about turning buildings \"green\" and achieving net-zero standards, the transition is moving more slowly than expected. Projections suggest that by the mid-century, a substantial portion of electricity will still be tied to fossil fuels. And, with urban sprawl and increasing infrastructure, building footprint is set to expand, potentially exacerbating the fossil fuel conundrum. This necessitates a rethinking of the current approach, expanding it to more fully embrace ambient energy for buildings.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
