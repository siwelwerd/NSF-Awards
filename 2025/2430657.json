 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 2025 Summer Research Institute in algebraic geometry is a large scale, three week long conference that will be held at Colorado State University in Fort Collins, Colorado, from July 14 to August 1, 2025. Plenary lecture series (accessible to the entire algebraic geometry community) will be scheduled during the mornings, and invited research seminars in the afternoons. Each week will explore several relatively focused themes, however the Summer Research Institute will stress the unity of the subject through smooth transitions from one theme to another. The proceedings of the Summer Research Institute will be published by the American Mathematical Society, and are expected to serve as a central reference source for algebraic geometers. This grant will support housing for 150 graduate students, postdocs and early career researchers in Colorado State University dormitories. The Institute is expected to play a pivotal role in the professional development of young researchers and influence their path for years to come.\r\n\r\nThe research themes covered by Institute activities include a wide cross-section of modern algebraic geometry: moduli of higher-dimensional varieties, birational geometry in positive and mixed characteristics and connections to commutative algebra, geometry of moduli, analytic methods in algebraic geometry, enumerative geometry, combinatorial aspects of algebraic geometry, hyperk\u00e4hler varieties and derived categories, geometric aspects of Hodge theory, O-minimality and arithmetic aspects of Hodge theory, connections between algebraic geometry and topology, p-adic geometry, p-adic Hodge theory, and Shimura varieties, Varieties over global fields. The lectures will be delivered by top experts in each field with a reputation for excellent exposition. The Institute is expected to foster interactions and collaborations between experts from different areas of algebraic geometry.
