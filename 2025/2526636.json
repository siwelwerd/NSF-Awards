 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supports a two-day meeting for leaders and researchers from the National Science Foundation (NSF) CyberTraining and Strengthening the Cyberinfrastructure Professionals Ecosystem (SCIPE) programs. The event will be held alongside the meeting for the NSF Cyberinfrastructure for Sustained Scientific Innovation (CSSI) program. It will serve as a platform for participants to advance the mission of the CyberTraining and SCIPE programs by exchanging progress and experiences in training Cyberinfrastructure (CI) professionals, disseminating best practices in training CI professionals among the CyberTraining and SCIPE communities, emphasizing the importance of these programs to colleagues from the CSSI program; and creating opportunities for collaboration to advance the training of CI professionals both within the CyberTraining and SCIPE communities and across the CSSI community.\r\n\r\nThe CyberTraining/SCIPE PI meeting aims to advance the community-building efforts of previous workshops by providing a platform for principal investigators (PIs) to share technical information about their projects with peers, NSF program directors, and other stakeholders, including the CyberTraining, SCIPE, CSSI, and Computational and Data-enabled Science and Engineering (CDS&E)  communities. These workshop interactions will support the continued development of CI and SCIPE professionals, who will go on to advance, deploy, and utilize the nation's CI resources and services. These professionals will accelerate research in science and engineering, furthering the impact of NSF support. This meeting will include multiple NSF programs, implement highly interactive program activities, and encourage reports from participants in small group discussions. These impacts will be assessed by various metrics in a final report, which will be disseminated through public services and circulated to participants and the broader scientific community.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
