 "awd_abstract_narration": "The fields of bioinformatics, genomics, systems biology, and intelligent computing have been under rapid growth during the past two decades, thanks to the advances in biotechnologies and computing power. Research in these fields requires interdisciplinary training and collaboration, which is challenging for both students and junior investigators. The International Conference on Intelligent Biology and Medicine (ICIBM) was developed in 2012, with its goal to promote information science, technology, and education to a great variety of trainees and young investigators, including trainees, faculty, teachers, scientists, and engineers, and to provide a forum for the cross-fertilization of ideas and collaboration in these areas. This award provides funding for 20 students and four keynote speakers to attend the International Conference on Intelligent Biology and Medicine (CBM) to be held in October 2024 in Houston, Texas. The trainees will participate in several activites including: i) tutorials and workshops, ii) poster session, iii) a 2 hour session with keynote speakers, iii) networking dinner with keynote speakers and the organizers. The successful completion of ICIBM 2024 will help these trainees and junior investigators learn cutting-edge technologies from distinguished speakers and tutorials and workshops, share their exciting research works, build collaborations, gain advice from other peers, and build better careers in the rapidly evolving data science and artificial intelligence fields.\r\n\r\nThis award will provide support to develop and provide a series of interdisciplinary, educational and scientific events in ICIBM 2024, with a specific focus on data science and artificial intelligence. The conference program will include distinguished lectures from four keynote speakers and four eminent scholars, four tutorials and workshops, a technology innovation session, a poster presentation session, and an Artificial Intelligence on Big Data: Promise for Early-stage Trainees session. As before, the conference will provide abundant collaborative and interactive opportunities, and encourage educational and interactive initiatives for both junior and established researchers. ICIBM will develop program and events to support the career development of talented trainees and young scientists, including underrepresented minorities, women, and persons with disabilities. The financial support will cover the expenses for 4 keynote speakers, as well as allow the organizers to support 20 trainees to actively participate in all scientific and technical sessions at ICIBM 2024 through travel grants.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
