 "awd_abstract_narration": "The study of languages, or linguistics, is essential to develop an understanding of human communication and cognition. This conference contributes to improving our understanding of languages by bringing together scholars from a variety of fields to discuss different methodological areas of linguistics. The discussions and collaborations resulting from the symposium promote fresh perspectives and ways to think about language, as well as the development of new interdisciplinary research approaches. These new approaches impact how we come to understand the processing of languages in the brain (for example, what is involved in learning a language and more efficient ways to do so), as well as how languages are used (for example, the systematic ways that languages change when they come into contact). Examples of broader impacts include that scholars at different career stages benefit from exposure to a wide range of methods and perspectives, equipping them with the tools and knowledge to innovate in their own research and the future of the field.\r\n\r\nThis conference has a focus on theorizing methods. The event includes a series of keynote talks, invited panel presentations, and general sessions promoting the exploration of emergent research initiatives. Sessions focus on enhancing the understanding of language processing, language acquisition, and language use across different linguistic communities. Focus is placed on the use of methodological triangulation (combining multiple sources of data) to capture both the ways in which language is processed and the reflective nature of language use. Conference attendees also engage with new approaches to science communication. This conference, along with the research and communications that follow, contribute to the goal of fostering public understanding of educational and scientific activities. By encouraging systematic methodological discussions among scholars at various career stages, the symposium provides a platform for researchers to engage in dialogue about methods and the nature of linguistic data.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
