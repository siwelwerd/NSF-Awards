 "awd_abstract_narration": "Wildfires are increasing in frequency and intensity, posing serious challenges to soil health, agricultural productivity, and ecosystem recovery. In October 2024, wildfires in Western North Dakota burned over 110,000 acres, significantly impacting croplands, rangelands, and unmanaged ecosystems. Soil microbial communities, which drive nutrient cycling, carbon sequestration, and plant recovery, are particularly vulnerable to fire-induced disturbances. Disruptions to these microbial processes can lead to long-term declines in soil fertility, reduced crop yields, and compromised land productivity, threatening both local economies and national food security. However, the dynamics of microbial recovery in human-managed systems remain poorly understood. This RAPID project takes advantage of a critical time-sensitive window to investigate wildfire-driven shifts in microbial communities and soil function before they are obscured by seasonal agricultural activities. Without immediate study, key microbial and biochemical transitions may go undocumented, limiting our ability to develop effective recovery strategies. By tracking microbial composition, functional genetic activity, and soil toxicity across different land-use types, this research will provide much-needed insights into ecosystem recovery dynamics. Findings will inform sustainable land management strategies, ensuring that agricultural soils remain productive and resilient in the face of increasing wildfire disturbances. The study will also support North Dakota\u2019s agricultural sector by guiding post-fire recovery efforts that protect soil fertility and mitigate nutrient loss, benefiting both local and national food security.\r\n\r\nThis study integrates high-resolution microbial and biochemical analyses across three critical post-fire time points: immediately after the fire (November 2024), pre-planting (March 2025), and post-growing season (September 2025). Soil samples will be collected from burned and unburned sites within agricultural, rangeland, and unmanaged ecosystems to compare microbial recovery trajectories. Next-generation sequencing of bacterial and fungal markers will assess microbiome diversity, while digital PCR will quantify functional genes related to nitrogen fixation, phosphate solubilization, and carbon cycling. Soil toxicity and respiration assays will evaluate microbial activity and overall soil health. Multivariate statistical analyses and microbial network modeling will be applied to identify key drivers of microbial resilience and functional restoration. This interdisciplinary approach will provide critical data to policymakers, land managers, and researchers working to mitigate the ecological and agricultural consequences of wildfires. Outreach efforts through extension services, field days, and public engagement will ensure that research findings translate into actionable strategies for sustaining fire-affected landscapes.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
