 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial impacts of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project are in developing a groundbreaking architecture for thermal imaging lenses that are smaller, lighter, less expensive, and use abundant semiconductor materials such as silicon. This innovation aims to reduce the size and weight of traditional commercial thermal lenses by a factor of two, leveraging new advancements in nanotechnology. The innovation will enhance scientific and technological understanding by offering a mathematical solution to key practical issues. The first market segment targeted is thermal imaging for unmanned aerial vehicles in defense and security applications, using a business-to-business model. This advancement would not only strengthen the U.S.'s leadership in optics and innovation but also support new engineering, scientific, and manufacturing capabilities. The project aligns with national priorities, such as those supported by the CHIPS Act, by leveraging existing infrastructure. Additionally, this project will contribute to workforce development by training a diverse group of students in cutting-edge STEM fields. The proposed technology will provide a durable competitive advantage and be a key factor in enabling the commercial success of the innovation.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to address key technical challenges that have limited the practical application of flat lenses in commercial imaging systems. The primary research objectives are to determine whether the proposed Zernike Double Metalens Cooke Triplet can simultaneously eliminate both image noise and chromatic aberration, achieving high-quality imaging with much fewer optical elements to gain superiority over size and weight when compared to commercial lenses. This will mark a breakthrough in lens architecture with flat optics, moving the technology from research labs to real-world applications. One of the objectives is to mathematically solve a highly non-linear system of coupled equations using a mix of several algorithms to obtain a feasible solution for addressing the undesired large chromatic aberration in flat lens design while keeping a high efficiency. Another objective is to eliminate image noise with the proposed unique architecture while still maintaining a practically feasibly optical system for harsh environments. The project will advance a first prototype in collaboration with payload developers in the aerial imaging systems. The successful completion of this R&D effort will lay the foundation for further commercialization, with the ultimate goal of integrating the technology into commercial imaging sensors.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
