 "awd_abstract_narration": "In many families the division of household labor is unevenly distributed between parents, however little is known about how differential division of labor in a household may impact children\u2019s development. This project investigates how family experiences relate to children\u2019s thinking about fairness and their aspirations for future work and family life. The broader impacts of this project include research training in developmental science and behavioral methods for graduate and undergraduate students in STEM, and broad dissemination of the research findings to the public.\r\n\r\nThere has been limited research into how children\u2019s experiences with their immediate home environments \u2013 namely their family\u2019s division of labor \u2013 impact their cognitive development. This project takes a socio-cognitive developmental approach by focusing on a relatively underexplored contributor to young children\u2019s cognition: the experience of within family division of labor. In a series of studies, the project investigates (1) how family division of labor is associated with children\u2019s own future expectations for both career and family life, (2) how naturally occurring distinct family structures (e.g., two-parent versus single-parent households) may influence young children\u2019s understanding of how family labor can be divided, and (3) whether alternative examples can influence children\u2019s beliefs about their future family lives and career aspirations. The project uses behavioral and observational data from parents and children, including experimental and survey approaches, to test possible causes of children\u2019s career and family life aspirations.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
