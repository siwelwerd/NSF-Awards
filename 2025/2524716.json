 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project provides funding for students from U.S. institutions of higher learning to attend the 2025 Cyber-Physical Systems and Internet-of-Things Week (CPS-IoT Week 2025). Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are a characterized by a tight integration of computational components and their physical environment that they and interact with.  Autonomous vehicles, electrical grid, and oil refineries are all examples of large-scale cyber-physical systems.  Designing such systems and ensuring their safety and security requires a highly specialized workforce that is critical to long-term competitiveness of the U.S. economy.  CPS-IoT Week is a premier research venue for cutting-edge CPS design.  Increased participation of US-based undergraduate and graduate students at CPS-IoT Week 2025 significantly contributes to the development of forward-looking CPS workforce.\r\n\r\nCPS-IoT Week is being organized in Irvine, CA, in May 2025.  It is comprised of several top-rated conferences on various aspects of CPS design.  The project provides travel support for U.S.-based students who will otherwise not be able to attend.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
