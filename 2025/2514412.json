 "awd_abstract_narration": "Natural and man-made disasters pose a serious threat to individuals, assets, and society. As such, public safety organizations and first responders are increasingly reliant on Information Communication Technology (ICT) to perform their duties. Disaster management requires a set of capabilities, which includes resource management, access to relevant data and information, and robust and resilient communications. In support of these needs, the RESCUE project will design a three dimensional (3D) networks architecture that exploits the advances in the field of next generation wireless networks to provide a prototype solution such that an integrated communications system for disaster relief operations is realized. Additionally, an innovative massive multiple access mechanism and a dynamic spectrum sharing model will be introduced to increase the public safety system\u2019s capacity and improve the spectrum utilization, respectively, during the relief operations. A new Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) solution will be proposed to support scenarios of Global Positioning System (GPS) denial by utilizing the next generation networks technology of Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS). The outcomes will have long-lasting benefits for the communications, and in turn the well-being, of the victims and first responders during disaster relief operations.  Furthermore, the project will provide unique training for graduate and undergraduate students at the crossroads of reinforcement learning and next generation networking technologies.\r\n\r\nThe RESCUE project will introduce a novel 3D networks architecture that exploits terrestrial and aerial base stations to provide the necessary redundancy of communications during disaster relief operations. A novel massive multiple access mechanism will support the victims and first responders\u2019 connectivity, and a robust dynamic spectrum sharing model will improve the spectrum utilization during disaster scenarios characterized by increased traffic demand. Innovative mechanisms to support the extended communications coverage, the mobility management, and the efficient resource management of the limited communications resources will be designed via utilization of the next generation wireless networks\u2019 technologies of Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces, Intelligent Omni-Surfaces, and the Integrated Access and Backhaul.  A new positioning, navigation, and timing solution will support the disaster relief operations in cases of GPS-denial scenarios or indoor environments by exploiting the next generation wireless networks\u2019 technologies.  A thorough testing and evaluation of the proposed 3D networks architecture and the supporting modules will be performed by following a simulation, emulation, and in-field iterative testing approach. The novelty of the RESCUE project lies in the synergistic, integrated, and pragmatic approach to efficiently utilize the next generation wireless networks\u2019 technologies to design an operational prototype that will support the connectivity of victims and first responders in public safety scenarios. The research outcomes of this project have the potential to support activities of Emergency Control Centers, such as in the City of Albuquerque.\r\n\r\nThis project is jointly funded by the CISE MSI program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
