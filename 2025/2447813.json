 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site award to the University of Nebraska Lincoln, located in Lincoln, NE, supports the training of 10 students over 10 weeks during the summers of 2025-2027.  The program, funded by the Division of Chemistry and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), offers undergraduate participants the opportunity to carry out original research projects in the areas of biochemistry, organic chemistry, chemical biology, and chemical engineering.  A Graduate student mentor works with each REU student throughout the program. Participants also learn about science communication, careers in the chemical industry, the graduate school application process, and how to disseminate research results through publications and presentations to a variety of audiences.  By the completion of this program, students develop complex analytical and communication skills and have a deeper knowledge of science and engineering careers. \r\n\r\nThis REU site offers a range of research projects in chemical assembly, including neuropeptide receptor interactions, microplastics in the environment, perovskite semiconductors, rapid analysis of drug-protein interactions, electrochemical sensors using biomolecules, adaptive surfaces, organic radicals for MRI contrast agents, and the synthesis of 2D materials such as graphene.  Students develop communication skills by presenting written, oral, and graphic interpretations of their work to an array of audiences, including REU students from other programs, graduate student mentors, faculty members, and the public through social media. Participants take two field trips to explore industrial careers, learn about careers in academia, and are trained in the responsible conduct of research, including workshops on safety and authorship ethics.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
