 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact of this I-Corps project is the development of elastocaloric cooling devices. An elastocaloric cooling device is a type of solid-state cooling technology that uses the elastocaloric effect, a phenomenon where certain materials release or absorb heat when they undergo mechanical stress (like compression or stretching) and then return to their original shape. This process is reversible and can be used to transfer heat, providing a cooling effect. Current refrigeration devices (cooling devices and heat pumps) are based on vapor-compression systems, which account for 20% of electricity consumption and 7.8% of greenhouse gas emissions worldwide. While elastocaloric cooling technology is still in the research and development stage, it has the potential for use in a wide range of applications, including air conditioning systems, refrigeration, and cooling in the electronics and automotive industries. This technology offers a promising, environmentally friendly alternative to traditional cooling systems.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the new technology. The solution is based on the development of an elastocaloric cooling device. Elastocaloric materials, a type of solid-state cooling technology, are envisioned for use for various purposes such as refrigeration and air conditioning. While elastocaloric cooling has shown promise as an alternative cooling technology, finding a method to cost-effectively fabricate these materials from high latent heat materials is essential. This technology represents an innovation in functionally-graded elastocaloric materials made through additive manufacturing. These functionally graded structures have the potential to shift the elastocaloric effect by harnessing a larger capacity of the material.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
