 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project aims to serve the national need to develop and retain highly effective Master Teacher Fellows (MTFs) of STEM who have foundational knowledge about mechatronics and the practical knowledge of and hands-on experience in the design and engineering process to effectively engage students with an integrative and inclusive approach to STEM.  This project addresses a national interest by providing advanced education and authentic, action-oriented training to support the development of STEM MTFs. The project's objective is to develop grades 6-12 STEM teachers' knowledge, confidence, and leadership skills to provide mechatronics-based lessons that include a wide range of experiential education activities to appeal to a diverse student population in their classrooms and after-school programs, thereby broadening participation in STEM. Master Teaching Fellows will earn a Master's degree in Education, a STEM teacher leader certificate, and micro-credentialing in mechatronics upon completion of the training.\r\n\r\nThis project, \"Mechatronics Integrated into STEM Teaching for Transformative Inclusive Communities (MISTTIC),\" at the University of South Florida includes partnerships with Hillsborough County Public Schools, the Florida High Tech Corridor, Advanced Manufacturing and Robotics Center (AMRoC), and the Foundation for Community Driven Innovation (FCDI). Project goals include offering support to 20 grades 6-12 STEM teachers (inclusive of STEM post-baccalaureates or in-service teachers) to become Master Teacher Fellows (MTFs) who can exhibit technological pedagogical content knowledge (Mishra, 2019) and proficiency with mechatronics. This six-year project has the potential to contribute to convergence education research focusing on transdisciplinary STEM teaching and learning and possibly contribute to increasing access to STEM pathways. The Inclusive ADDIE (analyze, design, develop, implement, and evaluate) model and the Technology Integration Matrix will be utilized to examine how technological tools are integrated into the planning and enactment of lessons and how they support meaningful learning environments. The research questions are: (1) How do MTFs plan and enact lessons and support students' interest in STEM when enacting mechatronics related activities via the lens of the Inclusive ADDIE Framework and the Technology Integration Matrix? (2) To what extent are the MTFs' STEM leadership profiles being attended to and developed while participating in the MISTTIC program? A mixed-method research design will be employed. The study results will be disseminated via journals, conferences, professional meetings, and the project's website. This Track 3: Master Teaching Fellowships project is supported through the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program (Noyce). The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 STEM teachers and experienced, exemplary K-12 teachers to become STEM master teachers in high-need school districts. It also supports research on the effectiveness and retention of K-12 STEM teachers in high-need school districts.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
