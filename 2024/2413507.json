 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is to create a sustainable technology for the degradation of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances in water and ultimately protect human health and ecosystems from their adverse effects. These environmental pollutants are difficult to destroy, but advanced electrochemical processes can transform them into harmless byproducts. Without extensive energy requirements and the need for chemical use and post-processing, this technology will offer an affordable, easily operated, and maintained on-site solution to destroy \u201cforever chemicals.\u201d \r\n\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project focuses on developing integrated advanced electrochemical processes for rapid mineralization of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances in water. Phase II aims to incorporate novel electrodes and electrochemical cell design at scale and deliver a deployable pilot scale system. Tasks include testing the system in relevant operating conditions, assessing the longevity of the electrode performance, and optimizing the operational parameters relative to rapid defluorination and low-energy consumption. Furthermore, the project will enable an in-depth system optimization to create a robust solution that operates under environmentally relevant conditions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
