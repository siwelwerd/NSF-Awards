 "awd_abstract_narration": "Extreme phenomena throughout the Universe can produce photons trillions of times more energetic than the human eye can detect. Gamma-ray astrophysics is an essential component of time domain and multi-messenger astrophysics, providing the most important link from neutrinos and gravitational waves to the electromagnetic spectrum and thereby unlocking the scientific potential of the new messengers. Gamma rays enable robust identification of the sources of these multi-messenger signals. The Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) is an international project in development to detect very-high-energy gamma rays with excellent sensitivity. An innovative telescope and camera design led by United States CTAO groups, the Schwarzschild-Couder Telescope (SCT), promises excellent performance in measuring these very-high-energy gamma rays. The prototype SCT located at the Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory in Arizona is currently being upgraded. The present project will develop data acquisition and analysis procedures to exploit the full scientific capabilities of the SCT to measure astrophysical particle accelerators that are likely sources of neutrinos and gravitational waves. The team leads the Distributed Electronic Cosmic-ray Observatory (DECO), a project that enables citizen scientists around the world to use their cell phones to detect cosmic rays and other energetic particles. DECO users span 46 states, 80 countries, and seven continents.\r\n\r\nThis research takes full advantage of the newly upgraded prototype SCT, a dual-mirror imaging atmospheric Cherenkov Telescope located next to the VERITAS array of four traditional single-mirror very-high-energy gamma-ray telescopes. The PI\u2019s team and their collaborators will realize the full potential of the Schwarzschild-Couder concept, developing a path for US contributions to the CTAO. Work to be accomplished includes (1) developing optimized waveform analysis algorithms, (2) developing optimized camera image and video analysis algorithms, (3) applying these algorithms in concert with VERITAS data analysis to understand the newly discovered ultra-high-energy Galactic particle, (4) observing and analyzing the upcoming outburst by nova T Coronae Borealis and (5) leading DECO (described above).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
