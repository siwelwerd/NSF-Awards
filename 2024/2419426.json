 "awd_abstract_narration": "The R/V Kilo Moana is a 186-foot, general-purpose research vessel built in 2002 and operated by the University of Hawaii under a charter party agreement with the Office of Naval Research (ONR). The vessel is part of the U.S. Academic Research Fleet (ARF) and is supported by the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS). Ship time is made available to academic researchers funded by the NSF, ONR, NOAA, NASA, and other federal and state agencies. This award provides funds for the purchase of instrumentation in support of the vessel's mission and its obligations to the scientific community and UNOLS. The request is for: (1) an All-In-One Weather Station identical to the one installed on the vessel to be used as a spare and as a replacement during calibration / servicing of the original station; (2) two ultra-low temperature freezers for storing oceanographic water and biological samples after collection and prior to analysis; and (3) radiometers to replace existing obsolete sensors.\r\n\r\nThe principal impact of the present proposal is under Merit Review Criterion 2 of the Proposal Guidelines (NSF 23-525). It provides infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF). The acquisition, maintenance, and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or other organization access to well-maintained, high quality, calibrated instruments for their research. It ensures collection of high-quality oceanographic data in support of science, reduces the cost of that research, and expands the base of potential researchers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
