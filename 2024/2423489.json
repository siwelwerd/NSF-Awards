 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project achieves several NSF broader impacts outcomes. First, it will advance a new granulated bioink technology to advance the rapidly growing 3D cell culture, 3D bioprinting and organ-on-chip markets, and position the United States to maintain and increase economic competitiveness in these markets on a global stage. Second, the proposed granulated bioink library will accelerate healthcare developments in drug discovery by providing realistic 3D tissue models for human disease, health, and toxicity, thereby improving the screening of drug candidates that may succeed in human trials. Finally, the team is committed to hiring and maintaining a diverse group of employees at all levels of the company and is committed to prioritizing partnerships with companies that follow the same philosophy.\r\n \r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to provide new materials and knowledge to the extrusion bioprinting and 3D cell culture community, including (1) first-of-its-kind bioinks with granulated structure based on human tissue, (2) foundational evidence linking gene activation of cells to the microenvironment defined by granulated bioinks, and (3) a platform technology to more broadly develop tissue and disease models, miniaturized organ systems, or 3D cell culture to benefit drug discovery. Structural complexity and hierarchy are hallmarks of tissues of the body. For most tissues, the extracellular matrix is organized into specific domains, together with specialized cells and signaling molecules that define tissue-specific and unique structure-function relationships. Unfortunately, few realistic models of tissue mimics, and therefore realistic human disease models are available, and current 3D bioprinting materials and technologies are limited in their ability to mimic tissue structural complexity and hierarchy. This proposal will develop a library of human based bioinks for cartilage, bone, skin, liver, and kidney. Additionally, the work will overcome the hurdle of viable cell incorporation in granular bioinks, including maintaining viability throughout a print. This work will establish new granulated bioinks as foundational biomaterials to accelerate 3D bioprinting research, drug discovery, and organ-on-chip markets.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
