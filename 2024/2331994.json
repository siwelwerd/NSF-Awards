 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this CiviL Infrastructure research for climate change Mitigation and Adaptation (CLIMA) research project is to establish a comprehensive framework for system integration, structural mechanics, and financing for nimble, adaptive, and reusable structures (NARS). The overarching idea behind NARS is to harness emerging concepts in origami-inspired deployable and reconfigurable structures for strategic, widespread and commercially viable applications in building infrastructure. These systems have the capacity to become transformative solutions for post-disaster recovery from - and adaptation to - climate change. NARS systems can offer several benefits including adaptable building plans, reusability, rapid assembly, automation in construction, and fabrication at distributed locations. The research program will establish simulation tools, design methods, experimental mechanics principles, smart financing models, and pertinent knowledge whose intent are accelerating and scaling nimble assembly, geometric adaptability, and reuse for modern construction. Virtual reality will be used to demonstrate the capabilities and potential of NARS to industry, government, and community stakeholders. The work will also contribute to the development and improvement of educational materials including: modules for a course that engages first-year students to pursue civil engineering with climate adaptable structures; lecture content for a graduate course focused on theory, analysis, and design for NARS-like systems; and graduate course use cases on contractual and financial innovation for sustainable infrastructure projects.\r\n\r\nThe specific goals of the project include exploring building system integration, structural mechanics, and infrastructure financing for NARS systems. The research will establish simulation tools that provide insights on the assembly process, load bearing capability, geometric adaptability, constructability, and the impact of performance indicators on financing of NARS. Inverse design and optimization of thick origami will discover modular and adaptable systems that integrate into modern building structures. The effort will establish new mechanics-based experimental methods to test: (a) adaptability, where a system is reshaped and/or repurposed for different loading scenarios, and (b) reusability, where a system is deconstructed and reassembled multiple times. An experimental program for the project will provide insight on the mechanics of thick origami consisting of panels and hinges. Finally, this project will establish models and methods to evaluate the lifecycle cost to construct modular and reusable structures. The work will uncover appropriate financing structures and public-private partnership contracting options for delivery, and generate insights on how broader environmental, social, and governance (ESG) implications of NARS systems can reduce the cost-of-capital.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
