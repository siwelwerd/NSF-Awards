 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant will support the Environmental Sciences: Water Gordon Research Conference at Holderness, New Hampshire. The theme of the 2024 conference is Addressing Current Challenges in Aquatic Sciences through Innovative Solutions. The week-long conference will focus on three major themes: 1) chemical and biological exposures; 2) environmental and human health impacts; and 3) innovative solutions for the management of water resources. The focus on improving water quality will benefit both human and ecological health. The immersive format of the conference will facilitate networking and collaborative exchange among participants. The development of the next generation of environmental science leaders will be fostered through interactions with leading researchers in academia, industry, and government. Diversity and inclusion in the discipline will be enhanced through scholarships for attendees from underserved groups. Educational and career development success will be assessed by surveys of all participants at the end of the conference. \r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to support the Environmental Sciences: Water Gordon Research Conference, to be held June 2024 in Holderness, New Hampshire. The conference will feature a program of thought-provoking research that strives to address today's most pressing environmental challenges. Solutions to these challenges rely on research at the intersections of traditional disciplines, which will be fostered by bringing together 190 participants to discuss innovations in water quality science. The immersive format will enable meaningful networking and exchanges of ideas among conference participants. Student and post-doctoral research trainees will be fully engaged in this immersive scientific conference. Their development as researchers will be fostered through interactions with leading researchers in academia, industry, and government. All invited presenters will be first time speakers at the meeting, which will advance the next generation of environmental science leaders. The meeting will foster diversity and inclusion in the discipline through scholarships for attendees from underserved groups. The success and impacts of the conference will be enhanced through new approaches to fostering networking and social interactions across career stages through the establishment of mentoring groups and structured social interactions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
