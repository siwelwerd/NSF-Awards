 "awd_abstract_narration": "The three-year NSF Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site: Safety Analysis and Design Nexus: Bridging Theory and Practice is hosted by Marshall University.  This project engages students in engineering research in the fields of safety analysis and design across diverse industries. Participants, particularly those attending two-year and community colleges within the Appalachian region, and those outside of STEM disciplines will be recruited for this project. State-of-the-art equipment, laboratories, and computational resources, such as the Industrial Ergonomics Lab and the Extended Reality and Infrastructure Systems Lab alongside faculty mentors, will immerse students in a dynamic and supportive atmosphere. Participants will engage in research guided by distinguished experts in Mechanical Engineering, Industrial Engineering, Biomedical Engineering, Civil Engineering, and Computer Science, Through these kinds of immersive research experiences, the program aims to connect non-STEM and STEM domains, diversify the talent pool, and empower non-STEM students with essential skills. Ultimately, this REU site establishes a pathway for individuals from non-STEM backgrounds to pursue careers in safety-focused STEM fields.\r\n\r\nThe three-year NSF Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site: Safety Analysis and Design Nexus: Bridging Theory and Practice is hosted by Marshall University.  Over a 10-week program, students will actively participate in hands-on research, collaborating closely with mentors to acquire invaluable skills and expertise in safety analysis and design. Marshall University will capitalize on its nationally acclaimed Occupational Safety and Health program. The university will provide state-of-the-art equipment, laboratories, and computational resources, such as the Industrial Ergonomics Lab and the Extended Reality (XR) and Infrastructure Systems (ERIS) Lab. Alongside faculty mentors, students will experience a dynamic and supportive atmosphere, and be guided by distinguished experts in Mechanical Engineering, Industrial Engineering, Biomedical Engineering, Civil Engineering, and Computer Science. Additionally, students will engage in themed seminars, professional development sessions, technical and career workshops, as well as laboratory and industry visits. This experiential learning framework will immerse students in authentic real-world scenarios, providing them with hands-on experience essential for acquiring the skills and competencies sought after by employers in safety-related industries.\r\n\r\nThis project is jointly funded by the EEC REU and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCOR).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
