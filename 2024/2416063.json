 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the participation of US-based students and early career mathematicians in the summer research School \"VIII Encuentro Colombiano de Combinatoria: Bridges between Algebra and Combinatorics (ECCO 2024)\" which will be held at Universidad del Cauca in Popay\u00e1n, Colombia on June 17-28 2024. The series \"Encuentro Colombiano de Combinatoria\" was established in 2003 and has grown to become a staple event in the international combinatorial community. One of the main goals of the school is to foster close interactions between mathematicians at all levels of the career, including the speakers and instructors of the mini-courses. Great value is given to establishing professional connections, mentoring, and community building.  The other important pillar of ECCO is to have a strong scientific program where participants learn directly from the experts about the most recent questions and developments in the areas of geometric, algebraic, and enumerative combinatorics.\r\n\r\nThe scientific program in this school is composed of four mini-courses with exercise sessions, two plenary talks, fifteen contributed talks, two poster sessions, two Sage Math sessions, two open problem sessions, and two professional panels. This school will focus on recent developments of algebraic and combinatorial tools inspired in geometry which have permitted answering combinatorial questions where purely combinatorial techniques might have fallen short in the past. Further details on the program will be posted on the website of the school https://ecco2024.combinatoria.co/\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
