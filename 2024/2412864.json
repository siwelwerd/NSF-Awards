 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will partially support participants at the 12th Large Hadron Collider Physics (LHCP) conference to be held at Northeastern University in Boston 3-7 June 2024.  This workshop series, usually held in Europe will be held in the U.S. and makes an opportunity for U.S. early career members to present at this prestigious conference.\r\nThe program of the 2024 edition will contain a detailed review of the latest experimental and theoretical results on collider physics, with many final results from Run-2 of the Large Hadron Collider at CERN, as well as a first look at the upgraded accelerator and detector operation in Run-3. The conference will also cover discussions on further research directions within the high energy particle physics community, both in theory and experiment. There is an 18 member Program Committee (chaired by the PI and Co-PI of this proposal) who will select the speakers and poster presenters and select the early career recipients of the funding in this proposal. Some funds will be used to provide childcare for about 6 people to allow young parents to fully participate in this conference.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
