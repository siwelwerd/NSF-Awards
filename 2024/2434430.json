 "awd_abstract_narration": "Georgia Institute of Technology, Purdue University, and Arizona State University will explore the hidden curricula in Computer Science (CS) education, referring to the knowledge, skills, and experiences students need to gain outside formal learning environments. This Computing for Undergraduate Education Transformation project aims to understand how hidden curricula impact students' well-being and success, particularly among underrepresented and first-generation students. By characterizing students' mental well-being as they navigate both formal and hidden curricula, we will develop learner-centered solutions to support their understanding of computing concepts and their gain of skills. The significance of this project lies in its potential to make CS education more inclusive and accessible. Our findings will benefit society by understanding and improving the educational experiences of underrepresented and first-generation students, enhancing their success in computing programs, and contributing to more diverse and equitable experiences in CS education. \r\n\r\nThe three-year research program will investigate hidden curricula in CS education through three primary strands: (1) identify factors from the hidden curricula, which when inaccessible to students, could pose risks to students' mental health, such as anxiety, depression, and the impostor phenomenon; (2) study students' interactions with programming environments (PEs) to characterize effective scaffolding strategies and address technical challenges; and (3) evaluate the impact of makerspaces on students' creativity, exploratory skills, and sense of belonging. The project's methodology combines qualitative ethnographic methods, participatory design, and quantitative experimental and quasi-experimental approaches. This project will emphasize the experiences of students from populations underrepresented in computing, aiming to create equitable and inclusive learning environments. The research will provide valuable insights and guidelines to improve CS education, ultimately reducing dropout rates and enabling students' success.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
