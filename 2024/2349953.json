 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Internet of Things (IoT) has become one of the most important and rapidly expanding technologies of the 21st century. The data collected by IoT devices can improve efficiency, enhance decision-making processes, enable automation, and create new applications and services across numerous sectors. IoT technicians need to have skills that go beyond foundational computing knowledge. The goal of this project is to increase the number of skilled technicians entering the IoT workforce with a focus on recruiting and supporting students from underrepresented populations. The project will align Miami Dade's IoT certificate with workforce needs, increase enrollment in the program, and raise awareness of the need for IoT technicians in the local community. A larger, more varied IoT workforce will result in a more efficient digital landscape.\r\n\r\nThis project will incorporate Smart Cities, Smart Grids, and Smart Homes technologies, critical subfields within the broader IoT landscape, as part of the IoT certificate updates. These technologies are prevalent in South Florida as the region undergoes a digital transformation. The revised IoT certificate will allow students to acquire a comprehensive understanding of IoT's underlying principles and applications, enabling them to embrace and contribute to these emerging fields. The project will utilize an external evaluation team to ensure the integrity of the evaluation process and to complete formative and summative evaluation reports to inform the grant team and assist with improvement. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the Nation's economy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
