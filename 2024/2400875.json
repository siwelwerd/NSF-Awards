 "awd_abstract_narration": "The widespread use of artificial intelligence (AI) in industries like healthcare, education, finance, and manufacturing necessitates the need for a skilled AI workforce. The goal of this project is to create a program that will increase the pool of work-ready students who are qualified for employment as AI technicians. The program will create new career AI technician pathways and make use of problem-based learning experiences to stimulate engagement and interest in AI careers. The resulting program will feature a summer bridge, high school after school program, industry engagement, faculty professional development, and evidence-based practices designed to enhance enrollment and retention. A secondary goal of the project is to increase the number of low-income and nontraditional students entering the AI workforce. \r\n\r\nThe project will test the hypothesis that early exposure to AI through problem-based learning positively impacts enrollment and credential attainment. Research will focus on how problem-based learning experiences can spark interest and engagement in AI careers. The project will contribute to the knowledge base of case study teaching methods in enhancing the achievement of learning objectives in AI. The evaluation plan will identify the impact of the program on the target audience and will provide feedback to the project team to adjust the program as needed. The evaluation design includes clear and specific student performance objectives with measurable qualities. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the Nation's economy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
