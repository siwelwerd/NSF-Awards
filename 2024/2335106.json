 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project seeks to revolutionize how high-precision antenna dishes for satellite communications and radio astronomy are constructed. By developing an optical metrology system capable of measuring large antenna dishes with micron precision in minutes, this project addresses a critical bottleneck in the production of high-accuracy, low-cost, mass-manufactured antenna dishes. Current metrology methods like holography and photogrammetry are slow, costly, inconvenient, and lack the accuracy required for future dishes. The commercial impact of this project targets the growing multi-billion-dollar market of satellite communications and radio astronomy, with an addressable segment valued at approximately $2.3 billion for the next-generation Very Large Array (ngVLA) alone. The goals of this project not only promise to enhance global connectivity and defense communication networks but also support groundbreaking discoveries about the universe.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this project lies in its pioneering approach to optical metrology, stretching the capabilities of current systems to their limits for measuring objects up to 18 meters in diameter outdoors. The research objectives focus on overcoming fundamental challenges such as maintaining high precision and accuracy over large areas, construction of lightweight and portable hardware, and designing a system that is ready to be deployed by antenna technicians. Anticipated results include a prototype system capable of significantly advancing the field of optical metrology and providing a scalable solution for the high-volume production of precision antenna dishes. This innovation will produce significant advancements in satellite communication and radio astronomy by streamlining the construction and maintenance of high-precision dishes.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
