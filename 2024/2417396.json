 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the advent of Industry 4.0, cyberinfrastructure (CI) technologies have been increasingly reshaping the construction management and safety (CMS) industry. The Internet of Things (IoT) revolutionizes data acquisition by seamlessly connecting devices and sensors on construction sites. Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) dramatically transform data analysis, enabling predictive insights and decision-making. Robotics technology enhances construction automation, significantly improving efficiency and worker safety. Furthermore, advancements in cybersecurity are crucial for protecting against the increasing threats of cybercrime, securing data integrity across construction operations. Despite the transformative potential of these advanced CI technologies, the CMS industry remains one of the least digitized sectors globally. This lag in digital adoption can be largely attributed to a lack of exposure to these technologies and a deficiency in the necessary skillsets required for their effective implementation. \r\n\r\nRecognizing this gap, this project is plans to develop CI training modules tailored specifically to the CMS domain. The overarching aim is to equip trainees and students with practical, industry-specific skills. It will encompass four key training modules: integration of IoT, ML/DL, robotics, and cybersecurity within the CMS field, covering essential aspects such as hardware, software, networking, and understanding cyber-attacks and defenses. Key tasks of this project include a) developing and conducting in-person ConstructionCI training sessions each summer of the project period, b) creating interactive online training modules that will be available permanently under the Creative Commons Attribution (CC-BY) license, c) integrating these training materials into both undergraduate and graduate curricula at the home institution of the investigators. The anticipated outcome of this project is to equip students with advanced ConstructionCI skills, fostering innovation and driving the digital transformation within the construction industry, thus preparing them for the future demands of this evolving sector.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
