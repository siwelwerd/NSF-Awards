 "awd_abstract_narration": "To advance and transform the nation's research enterprise, authentic partnerships and inclusive collaborations are critical. The long-standing and largest consortium of Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) in the Atlanta University Center (AUC) will leverage its partnership to create a shared resource support model designed to reduce systemic barriers to competitiveness and strengthen the research enterprise within the AUC and ultimately, the nation. The goal of the AUC-GRANTED Project is to synergistically expand the research support and service capacity within and across four AUC HBCUs (Spelman College, Morehouse School of Medicine, Morehouse College, and Clark Atlanta University), creating a research enterprise hub that has the potential to serve as a national model and roadmap for emerging research institutions and other HBCUs as they seek to expand and strengthen their research enterprises by leveraging existing capabilities, cultivating strategic partnerships, and implementing effective practices. \r\n\r\nTo broaden participation in and strengthen the nation's research enterprise, innovative strategies and solutions must be employed to advance the geography of innovation, increase access for HBCUs, and enhance the research support infrastructure at emerging research institutions.  The AUC-GRANTED Project leverages the strengths, assets, and expertise of the AUC research ecosystem while focusing on its human capital (i.e., people), processes/policies/procedures/ practices, and platforms for the purpose of rapidly and deliberately moving toward more competitive proposal development, more efficient research administration, and more effective post-award management. The project is designed to: (1) augment the knowledge management and exchange of research leadership in the AUC and at other regional institutions; (2) enhance research development capacity to support ideation and competitive proposal development; (3) strengthen the research administration infrastructure at AUC institutions; and (4) create and implement an AUC-wide Office for Research and Technology Commercialization. The expected outcomes include strengthening the research enterprise within the AUC; generating a national model for collaboration between emerging research institutions to advance the nation's research agenda; sharing knowledge, resources, and effective practices; and diversifying the nation's workforce of STEM professionals and leaders.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
