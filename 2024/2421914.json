 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports participants at the 2024 and 2025 editions of the Prairie Analysis Seminar. The Fall 2024 event will be held in October 2024 at the University of Kansas; the Fall 2025 event will be hosted by Kansas State University (date to be determined). The Prairie Analysis Seminar is an ongoing collaboration between the mathematics departments at Kansas State University and the University of Kansas. Since its inception in 2001, the conference has showcased the research of a diverse group of mathematicians working in analysis and partial differential equations. The event provides participants in early career stages with the opportunity to present their work via contributed talks, to get advice from experts, and to expand their professional networks. In addition, the event promotes the participation of underrepresented and underserved groups in mathematics, in particular, researchers from smaller colleges and universities in geographical proximity to the host institutions.\r\n\r\nInvited speakers at the Prairie Analysis Seminar are leading scholars well known for their contributions to active areas of research within analysis and partial differential equations and for their ability to communicate with a broad mathematical audience. Each event features an invited principal speaker, who gives two one-hour lectures, accompanied by two invited speakers who each give a one-hour lecture. An important component of the seminar is the time reserved for short talks by early career participants, including advanced Ph.D. students and postdocs. The conference also includes a session for discussion of open problems suggested by conference participants. \r\n\r\nhttps://www.math.ksu.edu/research/centers-groups/group/analysis/prairie_seminar.html\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
