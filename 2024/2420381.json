 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project provides travel and registration costs for graduate students, early career researchers and presenters to attend the 2024 Gordon Research Conference and Seminar on Rock Deformation. The conference will be held from August 3rd to August 9th, 2024 at Bates College in Lewiston, Maine. The Gordon Research Conferences and Seminars provide an international forum for the presentation and discussion of frontier scientific research. The presentations and discussions will span a variety of topics pertaining to rock deformation, including mechanics of icy materials, deformation of near-surface materials, fault heterogeneity and slip behavior, earthquake processes and hazards, the brittle-ductile transition, deep subduction processes, lower crustal dynamics, and mantle rheology. The Gordon Research Conferences and Seminars provide a unique opportunity for early-career scientists to come together in a highly stimulating and non-intimidating environment to discuss current research and build networks that can lead to a lifetime of collaboration and scientific achievement. In addition, the project will contribute to broadening of participation of underrepresented groups in science, technology, and mathematics (STEM) through recruitment of participants from underrepresented groups. \r\n\r\nThe Gordon Research Conference and associated Gordon Research Seminar will foster development of new research directions in rock deformation and will contribute to the development of a diverse and globally competitive STEM workforce. The conference program includes topics of societal relevance that bear on the understanding of geologic hazards such as earthquakes and landslides, climate hazards such as glacial motion, and green energy solutions such as geothermal energy extraction.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
