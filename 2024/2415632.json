 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader/commercial impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project lies in addressing the critical environmental challenge of water contamination, which poses significant risks to aquatic ecosystems, drinking water quality, and recreational water bodies. Traditional remediation technologies are often unsustainable and generate large amounts of waste. This project aims to develop an innovative solution that is both sustainable and cost-effective. This would enhance the ability and capacity to manage and remediate contaminated water sources. Environmental pollution, particularly water contamination, often impacts marginalized and resource-limited communities due to cost and deployment challenges. The proposed technology addresses these challenges comprehensively. By advancing the technology for sustainable environment remediation, this project aligns with the National Science Foundation's mission to promote the progress of science and secure national health, prosperity, and welfare. The successful implementation of this project is expected to result in substantial environmental benefits and improved sustainable practices. Additionally, the project holds significant commercial potential, as it addresses a widespread industrial need. This could create opportunities for job creation. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe primary technical innovation of this project is the development of a nanocomposite coating with oleophilic (oil-attracting) and hydrophobic (water-repelling) properties that can be applied to any porous materials (such as sponge or foam) for efficient oil capture from water. This novel approach ensures that the absorbed pollutant can be selectively removed and recovered, and the sponge can be reused. The goals of this research include scaling up the synthesis of the nanocomposite while maintaining its complex nanostructured architecture. Also, to validate its multifunctionality via \u2018mix-n-match\u2019 due to its flexible form factor that renders a \u2018Swiss Army knife\u2019 remediation approach for various pollutants, including oil, heavy metals, excess nutrients, and toxic substances. The project will use a vertical integration approach to understand and control factors such as flow rate, reaction time, and nanoparticle nucleation and growth. Large-scale pilot studies will replicate real-world conditions to ensure the practicality of the technology in industrial applications. Analytical characterization techniques will be used to continuously validate the consistency of the nanocomposite properties, ensuring its effectiveness and reliability. Additionally, the project will fabricate a mobile prototype for industrial-scale testing, replicating real-world conditions to demonstrate the technology's easy adaptability.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
