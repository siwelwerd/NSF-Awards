 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader/commercial impact of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project lies in generating a novel sustainable, climate-resilient food source through development of lupine hybrids. By focusing on US-native, drought-tolerant lupines, this project will introduce alternative high-protein, low-water, native-derived options to traditional protein crops\u2019 ecological footprint. This project will enhance food security while increasing productivity from marginal lands with native crops\u2019 reduced input needs- aligning with NSF priorities toward ecological and public health stewardship. Project outcomes will provide more sustainable options for farmers than traditional commodity crops- without sacrificing land profitability. By introducing a protein-rich, low-water-use alternative crop, the project will promote consumers\u2019 access to nutritional density. As demand for plant-based protein grows, commercialization of these cultivars could position them toward the lead of a burgeoning plant protein market. This will support one FT position and one researcher to screen hybrids for desired traits to enable Phase II hybrid selection and patent protection. Upon Phase II completion, the project will move toward commercialization. Following this, at least 3 FT and 3 PT employees in R/D, Product Manager, Business Development and other roles will be filled to support projected growth.\r\n\r\nThis project proposes rapid domestication and commercialization of novel, native-derived lupines to address the need for sustainable, climate-resilient crop protein sources. This initiative focuses on development of heterozygous F1 lupine hybrids, incorporating the pauper allele from the 'Amiga' cultivar of European White lupine (EWL, Lupinus albus) into four drought-tolerant, US-native species (Lupinus arizonicus, Lupinus stiversii, Lupinus succulentus, Lupinus arbustus). This allele confers reduced alkaloid content, enhancing lupines\u2019 palatability without sacrificing the drought and disease resistance of native lupines. Phase I of the project will generate these hybrids through genetic marker-accelerated introgression of the pauper allele while overcoming challenges, including potentially reduced fertility from aneuploidy among US-native and EWL parents. The project\u2019s comprehensive approach includes PCR-based genetic analysis to confirm presence of the pauper allele, alkaloid profiling to ensure the trait's expression in various tissues, and evaluation of growth and yield. Intellectual property protection is a cornerstone of our strategy, ensuring novel cultivars' commercial viability while maintaining control over the seed-to-consumer cycle to safeguard company innovations. Resulting crops will bolster modern agricultural resilience with a focus on sustainability, reduced crop inputs, and improved nutritional value, aligning with our aim to utilize native biodiversity for food security.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
