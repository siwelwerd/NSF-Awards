 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this research project, the PI and Co-PI team will study particle emissions from brakes and tires with a focus on both atmospheric chemistry and climate impacts. In particular, this team will quantify the contribution of brake and tire particle emissions on the total air pollutant burden. These, and other non-exhaust emissions, are of growing importance as the vehicle fleet shifts away from fossil fuels and towards electric engines. This shift means that the overall contribution of exhaust-based emissions decreases while the contribution of non-exhaust-based emissions increases. Specifically, the project team will: (1) develop a custom dynamometer that will be used to mimic real driving conditions in a laboratory setting in order to measure brake and tire emissions; (2) take field measurements of non-exhaust emissions will be taken in collaboration with a local community organization, and (3) simulate brake- and tire-wear emission scenarios via modeling. This research project will support two postdoctoral researchers and two graduate students, as well as one summer undergraduate student, and K-12 education and outreach will be conducted.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, this project will: (1) quantify both the gas and particle emissions from selected brakes and tires as a function of brake and tire types and driving cycles; and (2) identify unique tracers that can be measured in field studies to estimate their contributions to the air pollutant burden. Gases will be measured using proton transfer reaction mass spectrometry, chemical ionization mass spectrometry, whole air sampling into canisters and onto solid sorbents, and trace gas analyzers. Particle size and number distributions will be determined using a scanning mobility particle sizer and aerodynamic particle sizer, and their composition measured using thermal desorption chemical ionization mass spectrometry, high resolution aerosol mass spectrometry and filter/impactor collection for offline analysis by liquid chromatography. Field studies to measure tracers and associated brake- and tire-wear emissions will be carried out with site selection being done in collaboration with a local community organization.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
