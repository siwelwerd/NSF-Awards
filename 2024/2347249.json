 "awd_abstract_narration": "Quantum computing has emerged from science fiction into reality, promising transformative advancements across various sectors, including but not limited to aerospace, drug design, machine learning, and cybersecurity. However, quantum computing is a double-edged sword for cybersecurity. While it can potentially enhance security protocols, criminals can leverage its power to break modern cryptography and launch quantum attacks. Recognizing these challenges, the National Security Agency\u2019s roadmap mandates a 10-year migration plan to post-quantum cryptography (PQC) for all national security systems. This initiative highlights an urgent need for skilled professionals in quantum information science and technology (QIST), specifically PQC. Yet, academia currently lacks the pedagogical infrastructure to meet this demand, particularly for underrepresented groups in STEM, creating a gap between educational preparation and industry needs. \r\n\r\nThe Active and Immersive Learning of Post-Quantum Cryptography for Diverse STEM Students (AIM-PQC) program bridges the gap for underrepresented groups in STEM and pans out their career paths in QIST by offering innovative education and training models. This program comprises a six-week on-ramp training workshop featuring active and immersive learning, followed by eight weeks of applied experiential learning through internships with industrial partners or research labs, complemented with community building and mentoring activities. This structure not only equips participants with critical skills but also integrates them into a supportive community, fostering a pipeline of talented individuals ready to contribute to national security in the era of quantum computing. The AIM-PQC program will bring a cohort of community college students, transfer students, graduate students, instructors, researchers, companies, and government agencies to build a QIST community collectively, reinforcing the leadership of the USA in the global quantum race.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
