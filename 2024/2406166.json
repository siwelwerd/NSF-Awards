 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) through Targeted Infusion Projects supports the development, implementation, and study of evidence-based, innovative models and approaches for improving the preparation and success of HBCU undergraduate students so that they may pursue science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) graduate programs and/or careers. The goal of this project is to develop a curriculum infused with education and research in artificial intelligence and robotics with a focus on STEM and STEM-Business undergraduate education and research partnerships at the University of the District of Columbia (UDC).\r\n\r\nThe project aims to accomplish this goal by 1) developing an innovative Artificial Intelligence and Robotics (AIR) certificate program; (2) enriching the undergraduate student and faculty research experiences; and (3) increasing the enrollment and retention rate of UDC students across STEM and business programs. The institution-wide AIR certificate program established through the collaboration between UDC\u2019s School of Engineering and School of Business has the potential of benefitting students across diverse STEM disciplines and providing a validated replicable model for other similar institutions in the nation, empowering and transforming students as leaders in the 21st Century workforce.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
