 "awd_abstract_narration": "CHIPS-in-Space is an ambitious alliance poised to revolutionize national semiconductor technology and open new frontiers in manufacturing through the unique conditions afforded by microgravity. The US accounts for a mere 12% of global chip production, a stark decrease from the 37% held in the 1990s. The CHIPS Act of 2022 has been introduced to revitalize and return semiconductor manufacturing to its American roots. With the US striving to reclaim its dominant position in the semiconductor sphere, the industry grapples with material scarcities and inefficiencies in production. Ascending to global leadership necessitates a surge in resources and innovative technological advances. The boundless expanse of space offers a wealth of resources, while microgravity presents novel environmental conditions conducive to pioneering technologies and yielding unmatched quality and efficiency in semiconductor production.\r\n\r\nThe Alliance is envisioned as a dynamic and multifaceted ecosystem dedicated to formulating, examining, and integrating solutions and strategies to cement US leadership in space-based Semiconductor Manufacturing. Spearheaded by the Texas Semiconductor and Space Institutes at Texas A&M, the Alliance will comprise a collaborative network of research and educational entities, national agencies, laboratories, industry leaders in semiconductors and space, industry integrators, market analysts, and workforce development organizations across the nation. This collaborative platform is designed to generate synergies between the public and private sectors, fostering innovations and mitigating risks through a robust public/private partnership. The Alliance is committed to creating a diverse and inclusive environment that addresses the needs and interests of the US\u2019s varied communities, ensuring equitable access to in-space semiconductor fabrication, innovation resources, education, and workforce development at both local and national levels.\r\n\r\nThe Alliance is anticipated to transform society, especially within semiconductors in space. Its impact is multifaceted: (a) Pioneering Scientific and Technological Breakthroughs. The absence of buoyancy, sedimentation, convection, hydrostatic pressure, and the elimination of containers or substrates in microgravity foster distinct differences in crystal growth, fluid dynamics, heat transfer, and surface chemistry. These unique conditions are expected to drive technological leaps in nanofabrication, substrate-free 3D manufacturing, and monolithic integration, propelling forward fields like neuromorphic and quantum computing. (b) Cultivating an Interconnected Terrestrial-Space Manufacturing Ecosystem. Space\u2019s expansive nature allows for a seamless resource production, distribution, and transportation flow, drastically cutting costs and delays inherent in terrestrial chip fabrication. Besides the physical attributes of microgravity, space operations benefit from unfettered access to high vacuum environments, limitless solar energy, and more effective energy harvesting methods, all of which are vital for powering in-space production facilities. (c) Strategizing for Advanced Manufacturing and High Throughput. In-space manufacturing operations will be predominantly managed by autonomous systems, ranging from robotic arms to sophisticated full-body robots, whose operation will be overseen by a highly-skilled, Earth-based workforce. These human-led cyber-physical teams will be integral in orchestrating fab floor activities, developing sophisticated workflow architectures, eliminating bottlenecks, optimizing equipment downtime, minimizing part rejection rates, and crafting cutting-edge cyber-physical interfaces. Additionally, they will be responsible for providing comprehensive training programs and ongoing education.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
