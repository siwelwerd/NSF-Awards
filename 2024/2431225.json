 "awd_abstract_narration": "Oklahoma faces frequent extreme weather events like tornadoes and storms, disrupting the state's energy grid. This project seeks to enhance community resilience against climate and environmental instabilities by integrating the Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) technology equipped with electric school buses (ESBs) into Oklahoma energy grids. V2G technology allows these ESBs to supply power back to the grid, offering a sustainable energy solution. This initiative aims to flip the community-university dynamic and empower civic partners to co-design a research-to-innovation solution to improving grid stability during emergencies, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and promote public health. By showcasing the benefits of V2G in a real-world setting, the project could serve as a model for other regions. This work aligns with NSF\u2019s mission to promote the progress of science by investing in research to expand knowledge in science, engineering and education. This work is not only critical for addressing immediate climate-related challenges but also for building a resilient and sustainable future for communities.\r\n\r\nThe project will integrate V2G-equipped electric school buses (ESBs) into Oklahoma\u2019s energy grid to enhance community resilience to climate disasters such as tornados and storms. In Stage 1, a Community Advisory Board (CAB) with stakeholders from Public Schools, Oklahoma Gas & Electric, Association of Central Oklahoma Governments, Indian Nations Council of Governments, City of Oklahoma City, ESB Manufacturers and other community partners will co-design the research plan, set goals, and refine research questions. Preliminary testing and data collection will be conducted to understand community needs and technical requirements. In Stage 2, field tests and simulations will assess the effectiveness of V2G technology during power outages and peak demand. The project will analyze economic and environmental benefits, including cost savings and reduced greenhouse gas emissions, and develop a decision-making support platform for policymakers. By leveraging civic partners\u2019 expertise, the project aims to create a scalable model for community resilience through innovative energy solutions.\r\n\r\nThis project is in response to the Civic Innovation Challenge program\u2019s Track A. Climate and Environmental Instability - Building Resilient Communities through Co-Design, Adaption, and Mitigation and is a collaboration between NSF, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Department of Energy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Our project, \"Recharge-OK,\" addressed these challenges by exploring how Electric School Buses (ESBs), equipped with Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) technology, can enhance energy resilience in local communities.</p>\r\n<p>Our team successfully formed a Community Advisory Board (CAB) comprising diverse civic partners, including Shawnee Public Schools, Gordon Cooper Technology Center, Oklahoma Gas &amp; Electric (OG&amp;E), Association of Central Oklahoma Governments (ACOG), Indian Nations Council of Governments (INCOG), City of Oklahoma City Office of Sustainability, IC Bus (ESB manufacturer), InCharge Energy (bi-directional charger developer), and academic institutions such as the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences (OUHSC), Oklahoma State University (OSU), and University of Oklahoma (OU). These partners provided strategic guidance for integrating ESBs with local power grids. We completed comprehensive feasibility studies and community assessments, revealing significant potential for ESBs to stabilize energy supply during emergencies and peak demand. Technical analyses conducted by our team showed ESBs, with their large battery capacities (up to 315 kWh per bus), could effectively store renewable energy overnight and discharge it during peak hours or outages. This capability not only boosts energy resilience but also supports grid stability and renewable energy use.</p>\r\n<p>Through extensive community engagement, including nine structured community meetings, workshops, training sessions for emergency responders, and educational outreach to schools, Recharge-OK significantly raised public awareness about sustainable energy solutions and disaster preparedness. Over 60 community members actively participated in various project activities, fostering greater understanding and trust in V2G technology.</p>\r\n<p>Beyond logistical coordination, the project creatively enhanced its visibility and outreach by developing a distinctive project logo, an engaging theme song, and an interactive project website. The website served as a central resource hub, providing project updates, meeting documentation, technical resources, and stakeholder engagement materials, effectively unifying messaging and broadening public engagement. Additionally, a project satisfaction survey was conducted to gauge community feedback and perceptions regarding V2G technology implementation. Survey results indicated high levels of satisfaction, with 83&ndash;92% of respondents reporting \"extremely satisfied\" and 8&ndash;17% \"somewhat satisfied\" across evaluation categories including overall satisfaction, alignment with community needs, innovation in addressing urgent challenges, quality of information shared, and readiness for future project phases.</p>\r\n<p>Our initiative also laid the groundwork for scalable applications beyond Shawnee, Oklahoma.
