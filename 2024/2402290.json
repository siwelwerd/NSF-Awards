 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national interest by engaging two-year college faculty in a workshop aimed at developing new data science associate degree pathways. By fostering collaboration and knowledge exchange, this project seeks to create a robust community of practice that will connect faculty working on such programs with one another and provide them with essential knowledge and skills needed to evolve this field of study. This endeavor will expand programming for students to pursue exciting new career paths in an emerging field. This initiative aligns seamlessly with the mission to advance the frontiers of knowledge, strengthen the Nation's scientific infrastructure, and cultivate a diverse, skilled workforce.\r\n\r\nThe Two-Year College Data Science Initiative project will support a workshop for two-year college faculty working to develop data science programs at their institutions.  Workshop topics include forming interdisciplinary teams, examining exemplary data science curricula, establishing partnerships with baccalaureate institutions, researching regional workforce needs, and program evaluation. After the workshop, participants will continue to connect as a community of practice (CoP) within the American Mathematical Association of Two-Year Colleges (AMATYC). Participants will develop skills and confidence needed to create data science transfer programs at their institution, including a plan for program development, initiating articulation agreements with partner institutions, and plans for program development and evaluation. The NSF IUSE: Innovation in Two-Year College STEM Education (ITYC) Program\u202fseeks\u202fto accelerate\u202fthe impact of and advance knowledge about emerging and evidence-based practices in undergraduate STEM education at two-year colleges.\u202f\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
