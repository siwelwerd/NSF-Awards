 "awd_abstract_narration": "People readily organize themselves into social groups because groups serve an important function. Social groups create a sense of belonging and safety, and they help define a person's sense of who they are. Although creating a sense of belonging for \"us\", social groups can also make other social groups into \"them.\" This distinction between \"us\" and \"them\" can lead to conflict and competition. Furthermore, numerous indicators suggest that intergroup conflict is on the rise. One explanation is that people sometimes struggle with feeling empathy for members of other groups. Empathy does indeed explain why people engage in helpful and cooperative behavior.  But it does not explain why people seek to harm members of other groups. This project focuses on a different and less understood social emotion called schadenfreude. Schadenfreude is when people feel good at another person's pain. It is especially likely to occur when group dynamics are competitive, and it thrives under perceived threat and when \"us\" versus \"them\" conditions prevail. This project develops the idea that schadenfreude is a significant cause of harmful intergroup conflict. A better understanding of this under-studied social emotion creates a stronger foundation for developing interventions that promote intergroup cohesion and harmony.\r\n\r\nThis project investigates the importance of schadenfreude to intergroup harm and advances basic understanding of the cognitive mechanisms that allow schadenfreude to flourish. One set of studies identify whether empathy and schadenfreude both require the same cognitive components, such as perspective taking. A second set of studies assesses the importance of threat in feeling schadenfreude, manipulating whether increased perceptions of intergroup threat also increase the level of schadenfreude felt towards outgroups. A final set of studies examine the connection between schadenfreude and willingness to engage in intergroup harm. A strong emphasis of the project is an integration of research and education, including training minoritized scientists, collaborating with organizations focused on equity and social justice, and disseminating research to interdisciplinary communities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
