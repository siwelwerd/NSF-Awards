 "awd_abstract_narration": "Drosophila melanogaster is a powerful model organism in neuroscience due to its genetic tractability, conservation of key biological pathways with humans, rapid life cycle, and the availability of sophisticated genetic and behavioral tools. Research using Drosophila not only enhances our understanding of fundamental neurobiological processes but also provides critical insights into human brain health and disease, facilitating the development of new therapeutic strategies. The Drosophila Neurobiology: Genes, Circuits and Behavior course at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL) provides a critical entry point for scientists who wish to use Drosophila as a platform for research and teaching in neuroscience. The proposed course (2024-2026) will provide advanced training in genetic, molecular, cellular, behavioral, and computational approaches for studying the neural basis of fly behavior. The immersive experience consists of inquiry-based, hands-on laboratory sessions and intensive lecture series taught by leading experts in the field. Students are provided with an opportunity to learn cutting-edge and cross-disciplinary techniques that can be deployed throughout their careers.   The Drosophila Neurobiology course makes a broad impact by teaching students how to use multi-disciplinary approaches to address fundamental questions in neuroscience. At the close of each course, each student becomes a conduit through which research laboratories can gain information on the newest integrative approaches in Drosophila neuroscience. Additionally, the course provides a platform for young scientists to hone pedagogical skills. The course actively encourages the participation of the full spectrum of diverse talent in STEM, with the long-term vision of making the Drosophila neuroscience community an engine for increasing diversity in neuroscience. \r\n\r\nThe \u201cDrosophila Neurobiology: Genes, Circuits and Behavior\u201d course at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL) is a three-week summer course designed to introduce students to a wide variety of topics and techniques, including cutting-edge approaches for studying nervous system development, activity and connectivity, as well as complex behaviors and disease models. Daily research seminars present comprehensive overviews of specific subfields of nervous system development and function or focus on state-of-the-art techniques and approaches in Drosophila neuroscience. Expert guest lecturers discuss their findings and experimental approaches and bring along their own assays and techniques for students to learn in the laboratory part of the course. This hands-on portion of the course is centered on inquiry-based projects, utilizing the different morphological and physiological measurements and behavioral paradigms learned during the course. Collectively, the course provides a comprehensive and practical introduction to modern experimental methods for studying the neural basis of behavior in Drosophila. Since many Drosophila neuroscience research techniques are easily adapted for use in STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) education, both researchers and educators benefit from attending the course. Course faculty are committed to integrating research, teaching, and mentorship. In parallel, the course is broadly impacting educational circles by cultivating generations of Drosophilists who excel at both research and teaching. Critically, the course also provides instructors, lecturers and teaching apprentices with opportunities to explore new ways of teaching neuroscience with Drosophila, which can then be implemented beyond CSHL.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
