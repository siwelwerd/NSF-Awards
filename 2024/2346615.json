It will take place on the campus of the university from noon of Friday, May 31, 2024, to the early afternoon on Sunday, June 2, 2024. It is expected that about 40 researchers will attend the conference, many of whom will give a talk. \r\n\r\nThe Zassenhaus Groups and Friends Conference, formerly known as Zassenhaus Group Theory Conference, is a series of yearly conferences that has served the mathematical community since its inception in the 1960s. The speakers are expected to come from all over the country and will cover a broad spectrum of topics related to the study of groups, such as representations of solvable groups, representations of simple groups, character theory, classes of groups, groups and combinatorics, recognizing simple groups from group invariants, p-groups, and fusion systems.\r\n\r\nThe conference will provide group theory researchers in the US a forum to disseminate their own research as well as to learn about new and significant results in the area. The conference will provide a particularly inviting environment to young mathematicians and will inspire future cooperation and collaborations among the participants. It is expected that it will have great impacts on the group theory research community. The organizers will make great effort to attract a demographically diverse group of participants including women and racial and ethnic minorities. More information can be found at the conference website, https://zassenhausgroupsandfriends.wp.txstate.edu/\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
