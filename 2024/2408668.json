 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) grant supports innovative research that aims to advance the field of additive manufacturing, promoting scientific progress and national manufacturing workforce. Additive manufacturing, or three-dimensional (3D) printing, allows for the creation of three-dimensional objects from digital models, enabling the production of complex and customized parts. This project focuses on acquiring a multi-material laser powder bed fusion (MM L-PBF) machine at Southern University and A&M College (SUBR), a Carnegie R2 institution, one of the largest historically black colleges and universities (HBCU) in the USA. This cutting-edge equipment facilitates the concurrent 3D printing of up to three different materials with high fabrication resolution, overcoming the limitations of traditional single-material systems. The MM L-PBF system will enable pioneering and fundamental research into the interactions and joining of multiple materials, resulting in components with unique composition distribution, microstructural characteristics, and properties. By providing hands-on experience with advanced manufacturing technologies, the project will enhance STEM education and workforce development, particularly among underrepresented groups. This initiative will help position the U.S. as a leader in the advanced manufacturing of multi-materials, fostering innovation and inclusivity in STEM fields, and inspiring future generations of engineers and scientists, especially from underrepresented minorities.\r\n\r\nThe acquired MM L-PBF machine features selective powder deposition recoaters, enabling the simultaneous deposition of three materials in a single build. This capability allows for fabricating parts with varied material properties, gradient compositions, gradational interfaces, and complex internal structures with dissimilar metals, which are not achievable with traditional methods. The system includes a 1200 W Fiber Laser with adjustable beam size and shape, a heated build platform, and advanced process monitoring units like an on-axis monitor and dual pyrometers. These features support detailed analysis and optimization of the 3D printing process, aiding in the development of robust process-structure-property-performance relationships for multi-material additive manufacturing. Research with this equipment will address challenges such as brittle intermetallic compounds at metal interfaces, effective joining of different metals, and optimization of process parameters using computational modeling and machine learning. The project aims to deepen understanding in multi-material additive manufacturing, advancing fields like aerospace, biomedical engineering, and electronics. The MM L-PBF system\u2019s capabilities will drive transformative research into multi-material interactions, thermal dynamics, and microstructural characteristics of printed components, contributing to advancements in science and technology nationally and globally.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
