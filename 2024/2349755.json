 "awd_abstract_narration": "This National Science Foundation award provides funding for participants of the Mid-Atlantic Topology Conference, which will take place March 23 and 24, 2024 at Northeastern University in Boston. The conference will focus on a broad overview of trends in topology currently at the forefront of research, including geometric group theory, geometric and topological data analysis, applied and computational topology, higher category theory, and motivic homotopy theory. This conference will further advance the growing diversity within algebraic topology, as well as the strength and coherence of the East Coast topology community. It is the latest iteration in a series of recurring conferences aimed at uniting the increasingly active topology groups in this geographical area.\r\n\r\nThe conference will feature nine 45-minute talks spread over two days. Speakers have been chosen with particular emphasis on gender representation. They are predominantly early career researchers and hail from public and private institutions alike. Advertising and funding will be targeted to prioritize inclusion of participants from underrepresented populations, continuing a strategy proven to be successful in the last iteration of the conference. The conference will provide graduate students and postdoctoral researchers with invaluable networking and community building opportunities and will strengthen the regional fabric of the field of topology. Further \r\ninformation is available at https://sites.google.com/northeastern.edu/matc2024/home.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
