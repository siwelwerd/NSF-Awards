 "awd_abstract_narration": "This collaborative project examines the multi-sectoral determinants of health in low-income communities. The research uses a multi-sectoral approach by examining the impacts of multiple sectors such as water and sanitation, nutrition, and housing on health outcomes. This multi-sectoral approach strengthens our understanding of the intersecting factors that impact health disparities across the world. Systematic scientific study across all these sectors expands the understanding of the impacts of health policy that can improve health outcomes for underserved communities globally.  The broader impacts of this project include training in anthropological science and public health methods for high school students in the Baltimore City Public Schools; undergraduate and graduate students at Johns Hopkins University; and a public health student at the sub-awardee\u2019s institution. Research results will be made available to policymakers and will focus on the science-driven improvement of health services for the populations most in need. Findings tracing the history of multi-sectoral collaborations will also be made available via a public archive .  \r\n\r\nThe investigators specifically study global programs that involve multi-sectoral collaborations.  The research uses both qualitative and quantitative methods to investigate the impacts of the formulation, interpretation, translation, and implementation of health policies at local, national, and transnational scales. Systematic scientific study of the multiple sectors that impact health delivery and health outcomes through in-depth, on the ground research will provide data that can be used be improve large public health programs and to improve the living conditions of underserved communities globally. This research makes significant interventions in medical and biocultural anthropology, and the science of public health.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
