 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the upcoming conference \u201cStatistical and Dynamical Combinatorics,\u201d taking place at MIT from June 26th to June 29th, 2024. Participants will include a broad and diverse spectrum of mathematicians including distinguished leaders, junior researchers and graduate students. Statistical and dynamical combinatorics has emerged as a topic of intensive research interest, studying different ways in which objects can be moved around and associated numbers that track different aspects of this movement.  Mathematical tools from both probability and combinatorics play a key role in analyzing these situations, and there is a strong need for the two communities to come together to work on them.  \r\n\r\nTopics will include the following highly active areas: (1) Large scale randomness, (2) Markov processes, and (3) Dynamical algebraic combinatorics. All of these areas involve the use of statistics associated with combinatorial objects, each of which often admits multiple equivalent descriptions. Translating between the various forms in which these statistics and objects appear is one of the highlights of the subject. The conference website can be found at https://dept.math.lsa.umich.edu/~speyer/JIM/ .\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
