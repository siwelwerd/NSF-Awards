 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant supports travel for US participants in the program \"Discrete integrable systems: difference equations, cluster algebras and probabilistic models,\" that will take place October 20 to November 1, 2024 at the International Center for Theoretical Sciences in Bangalore, India. The program includes a one-week introductory school, including three lecture series by experts in cluster algebras, integrability and probability, directed at graduate students and early career mathematicians. This will be followed by a one-week conference that will include presentations by senior researchers in the field. The grant will support the travel of early career mathematicians from the US to the conference, where they will interact and form research collaborations with researchers and leading experts from around the world.\r\n\r\nThe program focuses on three interrelated aspects of discrete integrability at the interface of mathematics and theoretical physics, which have seen intense research activity of late: (1) The study of singularities of integrable difference equations and ultra-discretization of these equations, such as box-ball systems. (2) The interplay between discrete integrable systems and cluster algebras, with applications to discrete geometry and statistical mechanics. (3) Applications to integrable probability, solvable vertex models and the theory of symmetric functions. The program webpage is https://www.icts.res.in/program/DISDECAP2024.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
