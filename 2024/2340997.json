 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the rapidly evolving realm of augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) systems, robust user authentication is vital due to the unique challenges posed by these immersive environments. Traditional authentication methods like PINs, passwords, facial recognition and fingerprints are proving inadequate and vulnerable to attacks. This vulnerability is further exacerbated by the nature of immersive environments, where users' attention is often diverted from external stimuli, making traditional authentication methods less reliable. Additionally, biometric methods face challenges such as susceptibility to presentation attacks, where adversaries attempt to deceive the system using fake biometric data, further emphasizing the necessity for advanced authentication mechanisms tailored specifically for AR and VR systems. This project aims to address these challenges by leveraging Electroencephalography (EEG) signals, which measure the electrical activity in a user's brain. The objective is to develop and revolutionize user authentication methods to both secure and enhance human-computer interaction within AR/VR environments.  Additionally, the proposed effort includes educational activities for both undergraduate and graduate students; and activities for broadening participation in STEM fields. Through research, education, and outreach efforts, the project seeks to shape the trajectory of emerging technology toward a more secure and equitable digital landscape.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this work is to develop novel user authentication algorithms tailored specifically for AR/VR systems. The idea is to harness EEG signals of the user's brain to develop user authentication algorithms that are not only secure but also lightweight and user-friendly. By exploring how users' brains respond to various stimuli like visual cues or auditory prompts, the research seeks to create authentication methods that seamlessly integrate into the AR/VR experience. Through comprehensive analysis, including investigation into various attack models such as spoofing attacks, the project aims to ensure the robustness and reliability of authentication performance in real-world scenarios. Novel longitudinal studies for permanence and persistence analysis will be conducted to enhance the authentication system's effectiveness. \r\n\r\nThis project is jointly funded by Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace and by the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
