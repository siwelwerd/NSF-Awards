 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project will develop the first model-based statistical approach to perform entity\r\nresolution for streaming data contexts and will address the issue of scalability in both online and\r\noffline scenarios. With the ubiquity of data, linking multiple data sets is a crucial first step in\r\nmany types of inference for myriad applications including healthcare, official statistics, ecology,\r\nand fraud detection and national security. Entity resolution is the task of resolving duplicates\r\nin two or more partially overlapping sets of records, or files, from noisy data sources without a\r\nunique identifier. Statistical approaches to entity resolution are advantageous because they provide\r\ninterpretable parameters and quantify uncertainty in the linked records. Linking becomes more\r\nchallenging when the data update over time, termed streaming or online data, or when the data\r\nscale is massive. Currently no statistically model-based approaches exist to resolve entities in an\r\nonline way. Relatedly, the nature of streaming data exacerbates the challenge of scalability in\r\nthat the number of records to be linked accumulates. The methods will be made accessible to\r\npractitioners and other researchers through open-source software and the project will additionally\r\nprovide educational and professional training and mentoring to graduate students.\r\n\r\nThis project will expand model-based entity resolution into the streaming data space through\r\nthe formulation of new models and novel computational algorithms. Specifically, this project aims to\r\nimprove scalability of Bayesian entity resolution models through approximate sampling techniques,\r\nsuch as variational inference, and develop fast updating of a Bayesian entity resolution model in a\r\nstreaming data context, resulting in the first Bayesian entity resolution model updating strategy\r\nthat can handle streaming data contexts for massive data sets. A limitation of existing methods for\r\nstreaming inference with Bayesian models is that the pool of samples to be updated will converge to\r\na degenerate distribution as the process is repeated many times, which guarantees poor quality of\r\nmodel fits in a streaming setting. This issue will be addressed with introduction of a novel Markov\r\nchain Monte Carlo sampler for streaming Bayesian inference, which will improve existing methods\r\nby combining filtering ideas with a highly parallelizable transition kernel.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
