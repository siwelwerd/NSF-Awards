 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-technical abstract:\r\nIn order to make the next generation of computers more energy efficient, new materials that can replace copper wires and silicon chips need to be discovered. One class of candidate materials are those envisioned to constitute spin-based electronic or \"spintronic\" devices. This project studies spin and lattice properties of two-dimensional magnetic materials potentially relevant for spintronics applications. The research team uses a highly technical experimental capability available at national labs to shoot neutrons at materials and detect the quanta of energy and momenta absorbed, a process called neutron scattering. Because neutrons do not have a charge but carry spin, the way that they scatter provides unprecedented insight into magnetic properties of materials. In addition to potential technological applications, the project provides deeper insight into the fundamental nature of magnetism in condensed matter systems. Broader impacts of this program will include training of graduate students, particularly women and historically under-represented minorities, and hosting undergraduate and high school students during the summer.\r\n\r\nTechnical abstract:\r\nTwo dimensional (2D) magnetism plays an important role in many exotic condensed matter phenomena like quantum spin liquids, anyons, topological magnetic excitations, and high-temperature superconductivity. For both fundamental understanding and practical applications of 2D magnetism, it is important to determine magnetic orders and interactions that govern the ground states and spin dynamics of these materials. This project involves an innovative experimental program that integrates national lab based neutron scattering experiments with single crystal synthesis and characterization at the principle investigator's lab to gain a fundamental understanding of the charge, spin, and lattice interactions in bulk 2D honeycomb and kagome lattice structure magnetic materials. The project provides training of young scientists at the graduate and post-graduate levels, strategically coupled with a concentrated under-represented minority recruitment component created with collaborators at Prairie View A&M University.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
