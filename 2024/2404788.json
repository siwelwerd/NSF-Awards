 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Chemical Theory, Models and Computational Methods program in the Division of Chemistry, Eric Bittner of the University of Houston will study excited state dynamical processes in low-dimensional materials. Low-dimensional electronic materials are of current interest for their potential application in optical electronics, quantum information science, and light-harvesting technologies.  The Bittner group will concentrate on cutting-edge electronic materials with the potential to transform technology in sectors like computing and renewable energy. Dr. Bittner will lead efforts to demystify the interactions of these materials with light\u2014a key step for their transition from laboratory to market. His team will apply quantum physics theories to predict behaviors essential for advancing quantum technology. Additionally, they will work to develop methods that convert disruptive quantum noise into a tool for improving information processing. This project will include the training of PhD students and postdoctoral fellows in the strategic domain of quantum information science, an emerging technology in science today.\r\n\r\nThis research aims to make a significant leap in non-linear coherent techniques and theoretical innovation for probing environmental effects on quantum spectroscopy and photon statistics. The goal is to deepen our grasp of quantum-matter interactions and set the stage for breakthroughs in optoelectronics that could broadly benefit industry and society. The intellectual merit lies in the novel quantum-optical methods proposed to elucidate environmental influence on quantum phenomena, to enhance our fundamental knowledge and to foster scientific collaboration. This research projects seeks to tackle pivotal questions on how environmental dynamics influence quantum systems, and in this way to provide important insights into fields like quantum computing and information theory. The broader impacts include potential technological advancements in telecommunications and energy, improved educational frameworks in quantum physics, and the possibility of uncovering new scientific territories that could revolutionize our understanding of quantum mechanics and condensed matter physics.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
