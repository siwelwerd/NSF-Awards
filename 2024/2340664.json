 "awd_abstract_narration": "PART 1: NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis project focuses on the study of bottlebrush polymers (BBPs), a type of synthetic polymer that has unique, densely branched molecular structures. These polymers have potential applications in areas such as healthcare, electronics, and sustainability. The key challenge is understanding and controlling the variable structures of BBPs to create new properties and functions. This research seeks to develop methods for creating BBPs with precise molecular characteristics, aiming to establish a clear connection between their designed molecular architecture and their physical properties. Furthermore, the project aims to engage and educate the next generation of scientists, particularly focusing on underrepresented groups in STEM. In developing educational programs and resources, the project aims to enhance diversity in STEM fields in Louisiana and prepare students for future careers by providing practical experiences and knowledge in polymer science.\r\n\r\n\r\nPART 2: TECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThe planned research aims at a comprehensive understanding of the structure-property relationships of precision synthetic bottlebrush polymers (BBPs). Specifically, it will develop strategies for preparing BBPs with discrete side chains, functional moieties, and fully discrete structures/derivatives. The goal is to determine how the structural precision of building blocks influences the physical and transport properties of the resulting BBPs. Additionally, the project will investigate topology-driven molecular principles governing thermomechanical properties of BBPs with highly strained backbones and multiblock architectures. This could allow for the control of glass transition behavior based solely on side-chain physics. The third objective is to study the impact of designer topology on new properties and assembly behaviors with an emphasis on multiblocks and stimuli-activated systems. Beyond scientific objectives, there are broader impacts aimed at promoting STEM diversity in Louisiana through educational initiatives including an open-source electronic workbook on polymers, a research experience program for K-12 and undergraduate students, and bi-annual academic-industry workshops discussing advances in polymer science.\r\n.\r\nThis project is jointly funded by the Polymers Program in the Division of Materials Research (DMR) and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
