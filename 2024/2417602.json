 "awd_abstract_narration": "The IEEE International Conference on Quantum Computing and Engineering 2024 (QCE), scheduled for September 15th\u201320th in Montr\u00e9al, Qu\u00e9bec, Canada, is an event that brings together a diverse group of participants, including researchers, scientists, engineers, entrepreneurs, developers, students, practitioners, educators, and programmers. It's an initiative co-sponsored by several IEEE societies such as the Quantum Initiative, Computer Society, Communications Society, Photonics Society, Council on Superconductivity, and technically co-sponsored by the Technology & Engineering Management Society and the Electronics Packaging Society. The conference serves as a multidisciplinary forum for discussing the challenges and opportunities in quantum computing and engineering.\r\n\r\nThis proposal provides travel support for approximately twenty undergraduate and graduate students in the United States to attend this premiere conference. The travel awards will target first-time attendees and under-represented minority students, recognizing the importance of conference participation in their educational journey and addressing the often-limited availability of travel funds. This initiative is beneficial not just for the students, but also for the broader research community and the Quantum Information Science and Engineering workforce, as it fosters the development of new talent and brings fresh perspectives to the field.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
