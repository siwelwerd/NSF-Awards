 "awd_abstract_narration": "In partnership with Argonne National Laboratory (ANL), this project will investigate the structure, behavior, and dynamic change of single atom catalysts (SACs) on electrified surface for use in electrochemical processes. These atomically dispersed catalysts are efficient, stable, and affordable and they hold immense potential for clean fuel generation technologies. The project will harness the cutting-edge X-ray absorption fine structure absorption facilities available at ANL\u2019s Advanced Photon Source (APS). By combining this powerful in-situ/operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) with highly sensitive, fast-responding electrochemical mass spectrometry (EC-MS), the research team will probe the dynamic behavior and change of SACs as well as local microenvironments adjacent to catalysts in electrolyte during electrochemical processes of green hydrogen production and carbon dioxide conversion. The knowledge gained from this research has potential to advance the science and technology for climate crisis mitigation and clean energy production. The project will offer a multidisciplinary education that spans diverse fields, such as spectroscopy, materials engineering, surface science and electrochemistry. Moreover, it presents a valuable opportunity for graduate, undergraduate, and high-school students to actively contribute to advancements in the energy and environmental sectors. \r\n\r\nThis Research Infrastructure Improvement Track-4 EPSCoR Research Fellows (RII Track-4) project will provide a fellowship to an Associate professor and training for a graduate student at the University of Kentucky Research Foundation. This work will be conducted in collaboration with researchers at Argonne National Laboratory. The research team will collaborate scientists at the APS. Together, they will develop advanced in-situ/operando spectroscopic techniques to unveil previously inaccessible information, including (1) insights into catalyst structure, agglomeration/reconstruction, and activation/deactivation; (2) real-time observations of dynamic changes in local electrolyte environment; and (3) exploration of complicated reaction pathways. Owing to the efficient utilization of noble or non-noble metal atoms, SACs can dramatically reduce manufacturing and maintenance costs of electrochemical devices. SACs have the well-defined arrangement of active sites involving single atoms, serving as an ideal platform for studying catalyst behaviors and local environments. The investigation of SACs structure, behavior and fate will be organized through the following specific tasks, designed to uncover the fundamental aspects of these processes: learning X-ray absorption spectroscopic technique and conducting ex-situ XAS to examine the structure and local environment of single-atom catalysts; establishing in-situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy during electrochemical hydrogen production; and combining operando X-ray spectroscopy with EC-MS simultaneously during electrochemical processes for hydrogen evolution and carbon dioxide conversion. This project will focus on two specific SACs, namely platinum atoms individually dispersed on transition metal dichalcogenide support and copper atoms coordinated with nitrogen in a carbon network. The research team aims to gain transformative knowledge about the structure, distribution, behavior, and changes of single or clustered catalyst atoms during green hydrogen production and carbon dioxide conversion.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
