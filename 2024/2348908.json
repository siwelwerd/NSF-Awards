 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary objective of this project is to examine solutions to a broad class of equations that can be described as nonlinear waves. These mathematical equations model a wide range of physical phenomena arising in fluid dynamics (oceanography), quantum mechanics, plasma physics, nonlinear optics, and general relativity. The equations being studied range from semilinear to fully nonlinear, and from local to nonlocal equations, and we aim to investigate them in an optimal fashion both locally and globally in time. This research develops and connects ideas and methods in partial differential equations, and in some cases also draws a clear path towards other problems in fields such as geometry, harmonic analysis, complex analysis, and microlocal analysis. The project provides research training opportunities for graduate students.\r\n\r\nThe strength of the nonlinear wave interactions is the common feature in the models considered in this proposal, and it significantly impacts both their short-time and their long-time behavior. The project addresses a series of very interesting questions concerning several classes of nonlinear dispersive equations: (i) short-time existence theory in a low regularity setting; (ii) breakdown of waves, and here a particular class of equations is provided by the water wave models; and (iii) long-time persistence and/or dispersion and decay of waves, which would involve either a qualitative aspect attached to it, that is, an asymptotic description of the nonlinear solution, or a quantitative description of it, for instance nontraditional scattering statements providing global in time dispersive bounds. All of this also depends strongly on the initial data properties, such as size, regularity and localization.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
