 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is a novel therapeutic approach for detecting and treating cancer in companion animals. The project aims to develop a medical instrument when utilized with a novel proprietary molecular therapeutic compound, will visualize, target and effectively eliminate cancerous cells. The system aims to become a standard approach for the $3B companion pet cancer diagnostics and treatment annual market and create a new diagnostic and therapeutic approach.\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop a low-cost instrument for use in standard veterinary clinics that will visualize and monitor the delivery and effectiveness of the photosensitive compound molecule silicon naphthalocyanine nanoparticle (SiNc-NP), for targeting and eliminating cancer cells in an animal model. Preliminary invitro evidence indicates SiNc-NP differentiates cancerous tissue from non-cancerous, and can identify and kill the cancerous tissue upon an evoked response. This project proposes to yield a cost effective, manufacturable and robust multimodal instrument enabling veterinarians to utilize SiNc-NP as a cancer treatment in a standard clinic.  The technology development to be completed during this phase includes integration of light optics, mechanical and electronics design, and software engineering to develop an instrument capable of imaging both the visible spectrum (400-700nm) and near infrared (~800nm) and present the user with an integrated and aligned single video stream that differentiates cancerous and non-cancerous tissues. The instrument also directs high intensity radiation onto the SiNc-enabled cancerous tissue and measure the tissue temperature to indicate when the temperature and exceeded the targeted temperature (5-50C) for the minimum duration (~>10 minutes) sufficient for killing the cancerous tissue.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
