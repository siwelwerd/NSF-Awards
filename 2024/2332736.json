 "awd_abstract_narration": "Due to increasing numbers of satellites, particularly in non-Geostationary (nGSO) orbit, impacts from optical reflections to key astronomical systems such as the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) are anticipated to be profound without mitigation. Such mitigation may take several forms, but predictions of satellite locations and brightness will likely play a key role in avoidance of optical interference. This work includes development of software designed to produce these predictions based upon observed tracking data for satellites, and produce expected errors introduced in ground-based astronomical observatories. This will make better avoidance of such errors possible.\r\n\r\nThis work brings together a consortium of experts to quantify and ultimately mitigate impacts on two key LSST science goals as well as develop software for use by ground-based astronomers. The PIs intend to leverage a collaboration with Aerospace Corporation to produce predictive data on satellite brightness and location. Brightness predictions will make use of a novel tool, Lumos-Sat, that enables Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) fitting to both laboratory and on-orbit observational data. Further, data collected through a network of engaged observers at the IAU Centre for the Protection of the Dark and Quiet Sky from Satellite Constellation Interference (CPS) SatHub, as well as early LSST data, will be analyzed to validate the accuracy of the software (\u201cSatChecker\u201d) predictions. This information will be used to develop an analysis of errors introduced by satellite streaks in LSST observing programs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
