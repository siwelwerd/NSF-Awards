 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded by the Major Research Instrumentation Program and the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program. Kean University is acquiring a highly sensitive triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (LC-MS-MS). This state-of-the-art equipment will support multidisciplinary research and research training across all levels. The instrument combines liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry, enabling precise quantification of complex compounds and facilitating rapid decision-making. Its application in quantitative analysis of small molecules, peptides, and proteins in diverse matrices is crucial for research in Marine Science, Forensic Science, Environmental Science, and Materials Science at Kean University. Moreover, this instrument will provide valuable research training opportunities for high school students through the Summer Scholars Research Program and undergraduate students enrolled in research-focused courses. The availability of LC-MS/MS will greatly benefit STEM students, particularly underrepresented minorities, at Kean University by preparing them for future careers and inspiring pursuit of graduate studies. Faculty and students from the Department of Biology, the Department of Chemistry and Physics, and the School of Integrative Science and Technology will have access to this instrumental resource. Other users include collaborators from Emporia State University, North Carolina State University, and The University of Texas at Austin, Ocean County College, and researchers from local startup companies. Overall, a broad representation of students, faculty and researchers will be encouraged to pursue science and advance their careers in STEM.\r\n \r\nAcquiring the LC-MS/MS will enable Kean University faculty and students to participate in multidisciplinary research projects: (1) identify and accurately determine the composition of street drug samples, natural plants, and biological samples; (2) study chiral pharmaceuticals in water systems, to investigate water quality; (3) study the distribution and concentration levels of organic toxins released by harmful algal blooms species in both New Jersey freshwater and coastal environments, to help to establish water quality baselines of understudied New Jersey coastal environments; (4) deconstruct the structural complexity and fundamental mechanistic details of organic nano-structure formation, which will guide experimental synthesis endeavors to make progress in the rational design of new self-regulated and co-assembled materials: (5) evaluate the effects of xenobiotics on the development of the black blow fly, and better understand the entomological aspects of decomposition, and (6) characterize the adsorption and interfacial interactions of synthesized nanoparticles (NPs) with biomolecules, to investigate the cellular uptake and apoptosis inducement of hybrid NPs in cancer cell lines. These projects aim to establish research foundations, provide data for forensic toxicology labs and medical examiner offices, and inform policy decisions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
