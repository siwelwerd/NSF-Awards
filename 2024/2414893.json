 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports participation of students and early-career scientists in the Science Policy Colloquium of the American Meteorological Society. The Colloquium addresses the need for interaction between policy makers and researchers who have domain expertise in areas relevant to policy decisions. It provides an opportunity for researchers interested in decision support to interact with policy makers and learn about policy making. Each year the Colloquium brings 20 to 40 participants to Washington DC for two weeks of intensive interactions with scientist-leaders from the legislative and executive branches, executives from NGOs, policy analysts, science journalists, and other stakeholders working in the policy arena. In addition to in-person dialog and interaction Colloquium participants are given pre-assigned reading and work through group exercises and case studies to learn about the policy making process. Funds provided through this award support the participation of 15 graduate students and early-career scientists in the Colloquium. NSF-funded participants are selected through a competitive process, based on the applicant's potential and accomplishments.\r\n\r\nThe primary broader impact of the award is the development of a cohort of researchers in disciplines related to weather and climate who can provide decision support for policy decisions in these areas. Such decision support is increasingly valuable as stakeholders and decision makers at all levels of government face a growing variety of challenges related to the management of weather and climate risk. Many researchers are interested in providing decision support, but the education and experience of scientists does not adequately prepare them to perform this role.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
