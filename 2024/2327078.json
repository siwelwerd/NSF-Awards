 "awd_abstract_narration": "This SBIR Phase I project will work to revolutionize the precious metal commodity market through asteroid mining. The company aims to identify and mine near-Earth asteroids containing Platinum Group Metals (PGMs), which are crucial components in various US industries such as automotive, electronics, medical devices, pharmaceuticals, renewable energy systems, and consumer goods. Currently, the United States relies heavily on non-US sources of PGMs and other critical minerals, most of which are outside the free world. AstroForge's technology will increase the economic competitiveness and national security of the US by providing a domestic source of these critical metals.\r\n\r\nThe SBIR Phase I project involves developing an ablative refining process for in-situ asteroid mining, using laser heating to process complex asteroid ore for separation and extraction of platinum group metals. This approach to developing a refinery in space is compatible with the mission goals and constraints, such as rapid extraction of PGMs to reduce radiation dose. The project also aims to address the environmental impact of traditional refining methods on Earth by creating a new system for refining metals in space that does not rely on chemical processes and their associated toxic waste production.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
