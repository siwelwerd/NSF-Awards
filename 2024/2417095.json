 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national interest by advancing understanding of science centers\u2019 engagement of mentors with students. The project will place sixty undergraduates in R&D internships at a science- and technology-focused museum. 75% of students will be from underserved populations. Mentors will come from the local chapter of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), with student recruiting through IEEE chapters at the University of Texas at San Antonio, Texas A&M University-San Antonio, St. Mary\u2019s University, and Trinity University. Local context for the project is its location, Port San Antonio, the redevelopment agency for the former Kelly Air Force Base campus. The Port ecosystem features cybersecurity, aviation, advanced manufacturing, robotics, information technology, and 18,000 jobs at technology-focused employers. The Port is located among some of the most economically segregated communities in the nation. Research will build on the current internship and mentorship literature and will lead to a framework that science centers and others can follow to maximize important intern and mentor outcomes.\r\n\r\nEach year of this project, a team of five students from each university will develop exhibits that demonstrate application of advanced technology. Project research will pursue the question \u201cCan internship impacts can be achieved with a science center acting as an intermediary between universities and industry?\u201d Sub-questions will address student academic learning, application of knowledge, learning of 21st century and social-emotional skills, impact on student persistence and entry into STEM careers, and the effectiveness of professional associations as mentors. Using a mixed methods approach driven by those questions, students, mentors, faculty, and staff will share their experiences. Researchers will use open-ended survey questions, interviews and focus groups throughout exhibit development to deepen understanding of the students' internship experiences. Data collected will enable formative evaluation, and those data will support emergent analysis using a constant comparative paradigm. Dissemination will be pursued through peer-reviewed academic journals, through IEEE publication channels, via public sharing of research artifacts, and for the general public. The NSF IUSE: EHR Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through the Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
