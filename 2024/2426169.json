 "awd_abstract_narration": "The NT24 conference, scheduled from June 23-28, 2024, at MIT in Cambridge/Boston, Massachusetts, U.S.A., marks the 24th iteration of one of the most influential scientific gatherings in the field of nanoscience and technology. This conference serves as a forum for the discussion of a wide range of topics, including synthesis, processing, functionalization, properties, characterization, theory, simulation, and applications of nanomaterials. The unique format of NT24 includes plenary morning sessions, parallel afternoon symposia sessions, and evening poster sessions, fostering interaction and networking among attendees. In addition to its scientific contributions, NT24 aims to honor the legacy of the late Professor Millie Dresselhaus, a pioneer in nanotechnology and the founder of the NT conference series.\r\n\r\nThe NT24 conference, scheduled from June 23-28, 2024, at MIT in Cambridge/Boston, Massachusetts, U.S.A., marks the 24th iteration of one of the most influential scientific gatherings in the field of nanoscience and technology. This  The technical aspect of NT24 will encompass presentations on computational challenges, nanomaterials for energy and electronics, fundamental properties of 1D and 2D materials, macro-materials, carbon nanomaterials in biology and medicine, and synthesis techniques. The conference will allocate funds from NSF to enhance diversity by supporting the attendance of graduate and post-doctoral students, early career faculty, and students from underrepresented groups. Specifically, NSF funds will be used to cover registration and travel costs for attendees, facilitating broader participation and ensuring a robust perspective on nanotechnology advancements. NT24 aims to produce a publication outlining the current state, challenges, and future directions of nanoscience and nanotechnology, particularly concerning sustainability, furthering its commitment to scientific exchange and mentorship in the field.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
