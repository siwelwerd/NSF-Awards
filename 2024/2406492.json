 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) through Targeted Infusion Projects supports the development, implementation, and study of evidence-based, innovative models and approaches for improving the preparation and success of HBCU undergraduate students so that they may pursue science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) graduate programs and/or careers. The goal of this project is to increase graduation and retention rates at Talladega College by providing early exposure to undergraduate research, strategic professional development, and academic support to incoming students, promoting enhanced learning and personal growth.\r\n\r\nThe project's activities will be based on evidence-based learning methods designed to enhance student knowledge and understanding. Key components include a two-week early arrival orientation, mentoring on transitioning from high school to college, introductions to STEM majors and careers, presentations by Talladega professors and guest speakers from national labs and industry, and engagement in short-term research activities. In addition, weekly mentoring sessions will provide ongoing encouragement and support. The societal benefits will be realized as students participate in summer research opportunities and reflection workshops to assess their intellectual growth, academic behaviors, and research skills. The project will assess its impact on student retention, graduation, and career outcomes, with the goal of establishing a model program for early undergraduate research. An external consulting group will also assist in developing evaluation plans and metrics to measure the program's efficacy, ensuring that it effectively contributes to the field of STEM education and broadens participation among underrepresented groups. Ultimately, this initiative will potentially increase retention rates and graduation rates at Talladega College, contributing to the national interest by broadening and fostering a skilled STEM workforce.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
