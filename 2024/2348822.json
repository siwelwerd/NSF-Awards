 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the renewal of the Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site hosted by Old Dominion University (ODU) in partnership with Jefferson Lab. The site provides opportunities to ten undergraduate students each summer for ten weeks of research on topics in accelerator and nuclear physics. Students are housed at Jefferson Lab and their research projects are located there. They are part of a vibrant national laboratory community, which includes faculty and graduate students from around the world, as well as undergraduates from other summer programs, both at Jefferson Lab and at ODU. Mentors are chosen carefully for each student, based on their interests, and care is taken to ensure that each project progresses well over the course of the program. Both accelerator and nuclear physics are research areas with applications of important societal impact, including in the areas of medicine, basic science, homeland security, and energy production. By exposing undergraduates to these exciting fields, the program will increase the flow of talented students into these areas, whether that be a graduate program in accelerator science, nuclear science, or jobs in industry. \r\n\r\nStudents can choose from experimental and theoretical projects. They develop their communication skills by presenting a talk in the ninth week and writing a final paper on their work and presenting a poster on the last day. There are two scientific/technical/professional development talks scheduled each week for the undergraduates, in addition to the many other regular activities at the lab. The students also receive training on technical writing, and each student will be encouraged and mentored to present his/her results at a conference during the academic year following their summer research.  This site is supported by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
