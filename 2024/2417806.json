 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 11th Coronal Loops Workshop will be held at the Instituto de Astrofisica de Canarias, La Laguna, Tenerife, Spain, from June 25th \u2013 June 28th, 2024. The Loops Workshop series originated in 2002 motivated by the fact that theory was not able to explain in simple terms the coronal loop observations from missions like TRACE and SoHO. Since then, the Coronal Loops Workshop series has become a common setting for researchers to discuss in detail the basic physical processes behind the formation, evolution, and disappearance of coronal loops in solar active regions. This is a crucial discussion because it addresses one of the fundamental questions in all of space science: how the solar corona is heated to million-degree temperatures. \r\n\r\nThe objectives of the workshop are to discuss the past, present and future of coronal loop theories and observations, their interrelation, and to advance our overall understanding of the physical processes that determine loop properties and govern their behavior. The main topics that Loops XI will address are: high (spatial/temporal) resolution observations of coronal loops, observations and simulations of loop cooling, reconciling 0/1-D hydrodynamic and 3-D magnetohydrodynamic models and community-driven topics (e.g. plasma diagnostics, heating mechanisms and DKIST observations). The workshop has also been very supportive of the attendance and participation of students and early career post-docs. Previous awards have been used to support travel for students to present their research at the workshops. The 2024 workshop aims to broaden participation with travel support, and those recipients will have the unique experience of touring several of the solar telescopes at the Teide Observatory.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
