 "awd_abstract_narration": "Stellar astrophysics, pivotal for understanding stars from their inception to demise, holds significant implications for life on Earth and beyond. Our Sun, vital for terrestrial ecosystems, also poses risks through solar flares that can disrupt modern technology. This project aims to enhance stellar models by simulating turbulent plasma flows within stars using cutting-edge computational tools. By refining our understanding of these dynamics, this project aims to improve predictions of stellar evolution and to better comprehend and mitigate solar impacts on Earth. This investigation supports a commitment to diversity and education in STEM fields. The Principal Investigator's involvement in NSF S-STEM programs will provide undergraduate and master's students with hands-on research experience, fostering the next generation of scientific leaders. Through leadership roles in prestigious summer programs, the PI aims to empower women in geophysical fluid dynamics and theoretical astrophysics, ensuring a diverse and inclusive future for these fields. \r\n\r\nThis research team aims to advance stellar astrophysics by refining the rotational mixing models crucial for stellar evolution codes. They will address its limitations through direct numerical simulations and multiscale asymptotic analyses. Specifically, they will map the parameter space governing rotational turbulence, integrating complex factors such as stellar rotation profiles and buoyancy frequencies. The project further aims to incorporate the influence of convective zones on differential rotation, a factor currently overlooked in existing models. These innovations will culminate in a new generation of rotational mixing models, implemented and validated within the MESA framework. By rigorously testing against asteroseismic observations, this project aims to provide the astronomical community with more accurate tools to decipher stellar interiors and evolutionary pathways.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
