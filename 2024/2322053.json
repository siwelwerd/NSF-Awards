 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is a novel sensitive x-ray imaging platform based on a quantum approach to photo-detection. This project will leverage recent advancements in Quantum Dots/Graphene technology to demonstrate its suitability and superior performance for x-ray-based imaging medical capital equipment. This novel technological approach aims to provide an X-ray diagnostic imaging platform with superior performance and lower potential price points than semiconductor detector paradigms. The commercial impact is a novel detector array platform for the $16 billion annual x-ray imaging market, focusing on the $6.9 annual computed tomography (CT) scanner subset of the market. \r\n\r\n \r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop a functional prototype for a novel Quantum Dots (QD)/graphene nanohybrid x-ray array detection platform for use in medical diagnostic capital equipment. This initiative aims to design and quantify the critical attributes of a novel quantum sensor platform for x-ray capture, down-conversion, and detection of down-converted low-energy photons.  During this first phase, experimental tests will be completed. The results will be used to design and develop a prototype detector array with a QD-layer design onto rigid and flexible substrates for scalability onto large X-ray imaging systems. The completed prototype system will then be tested and validated for performance versus existing platforms. This Phase 1 project will quantitatively benchmark several critical attributes (cost, sensitivity, efficiency, preliminary safety) for a novel x-ray imaging nanohybrid platform versus current hybrids for future commercial integration.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
