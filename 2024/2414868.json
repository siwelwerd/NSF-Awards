 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact of this I-Corps project is based on the development of a medical device in the form of a smart scale that measures the growth of babies over time. Current growth screening methods are inefficient, because they require pediatricians to take three separate measurements, plot those measurements on four growth curves (height, weight, head circumference, and weight/ length) and interpret the meaning of those measurements over time. The potential advantages of this medical device include early identification of growth concerns, standardization of measurement taking and interpretation across medical providers, and the prevention of late diagnoses of treatable growth disorders. The standardized data collection related to growth rate could also help develop metrics and diagnostics connecting patterns of growth and how changes in growth rate could be indicators of disease. Overall, the broad applicability this device has the potential to improve early detection of infant disease and take preventive action.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. The solution is based on the development of a novel medical device in the form of an infant smart scale that includes an electronic, head-measuring circumference band and limb-length measurement tool. This innovative approach integrates a physical length measuring mat, sophisticated electronic measuring system, and an evidence-based algorithm to assess growth metrics over time. This device provides an instant, clinically relevant, and evidence-based growth screening report that can be automatically integrated into the electronic health record (EHR). The purpose of this medical device is to simplify how pediatricians identify, triage, and risk-stratify patients based on their growth trajectories.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
