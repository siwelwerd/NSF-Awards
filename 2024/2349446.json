 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of new technologies and innovative teaching methods that integrate into current nursing education systems to improve training and better equip nurses for clinical work. This approach could ultimately reduce medical errors among early-career nurses. The potential societal impact lies in potential savings by Medicare and other insurance providers who typically bear the financial burden of medical malpractice costs. It is expected that this new technology will provide low-cost access to high fidelity simulation and education to nursing education institutions across the US.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on the development of medical simulation to enhance nursing education using augmented reality (AR). The proposed approach will use AI-driven AR scenarios, combined with novel haptic feedback devices, to provide a high-fidelity simulation experience. Artificial Intelligence Driven AR includes the use of conversational holographic patients and process-aware scenarios through which to guide trainees. The haptic feedback devices include new wearable force-feedback modules and thermal feedback modules that allow trainees to feel and interact with virtual objects and, more importantly, holographic patients.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
