 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Sustainable Land and Water Resources Research Experience for Undergraduates (SLAWR REU) introduces undergraduate students to Earth systems science. The SLAWR process honors tribal communities. It places participants at the core of the program design. Students do research at three sites and two of these are Native American communities. Sites form one larger research community where students learn the entire research process. REU participants receive professional development in tribal research protocols and learn scientific communication, research ethics, team science, and goal setting. Participants write weekly research summaries and blog posts and create a Story Map that blends a research paper with personal reflections. Finally, REU participants create posters that are then delivered through conference presentations.\r\n\r\nSustainable Land and Water Resources Research Experience for Undergraduates (SLAWR REU) advances the National Academies of Sciences\u2019 (2022) vision for interdisciplinary Earth systems science that explores interactions between physical, natural, and social processes through weaving of Indigenous knowledge \u2013 which is fundamentally integrative, holistic, and relational \u2013 with Western knowledge to advance scientific understanding and support tribal management decisions. The SLAWR REU has deployed a new framework for undergraduate research to increase the participation of all students, particularly Native Americans and underrepresented minority students, in the multiple disciplines that advance Earth systems sciences. The goal of SLAWR is to increase the participation of all students, facilitate novel discoveries through the integration of multiple knowledges, advance a culture of inclusivity within academia via a transformative learning process that centers communities where research is being conducted and places the participants themselves at the core of the program design. This REU is designed to be transformative to the student participants and overhaul institutional capacity for inclusive excellence by increasing interaction between tribal communities, tribal colleges, and research-intensive institutions. The program centers on a process-focused research paradigm that incorporates 1) rigorous mixed methods and predictive systems approaches to Earth sciences; 2) community-based participatory research processes, 3) indigenous research methods, and 4) research ethics. In addition to the research paradigm and skill building, the program also prioritizes student skill development in communication, community, and personal growth through holistic mentoring that is student-tailored, culturally-based, and family and community focused. REU projects will address tribal research questions intended to support tribal management goals. Results will be shared with tribal authorities and community members as well as the broader scientific community via peer-reviewed papers with undergraduate authors and conference presentations/posters supporting both tribal land and water resource management and advancing our fundamental understanding of the Earth systems studied.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
