 "awd_abstract_narration": "PART 1: NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\n\r\nSemicrystalline polymers comprise ~70% of all synthetic plastics, and they are pervasive in daily life in packaging, transportation, and high-technology applications like microelectronics. Semicrystalline polymers are often used in the form of multicomponent polymeric materials, e.g., multilayer polyethylene/poly(ethylene terephthalate) films for packaging and carbon fiber-reinforced composites for transportation. A key feature of these multicomponent materials is the presence of a large quantity of polymer/polymer or polymer/filler interfaces. Understanding the effects of these interfaces on polymer crystallization is essential to the predictive design of multicomponent materials with desired crystalline structures and properties. Unfortunately, such a fundamental understanding is lacking. This project will work toward closing the fundamental knowledge gap in interfacial effects and polymer crystallization, using a new fluorescence technique with a nanoscale spatial resolution. The fundamental knowledge gained from this research will advance the development of new multicomponent materials with optimized crystalline structures and properties, which can contribute to a broad range of applications such as food packaging and biomedical devices. This project will provide an integrated research and educational experience for graduate students, undergraduate students, and high-school students, including members of underserved groups. The principal investigator and students will also develop education-oriented online videos and hands-on demonstrations to engage the general public and attract K-12 students into STEM fields.   \r\n \r\n\r\nPART 2: TECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis project\u2019s research goal is to advance fundamental understanding of the interfacial effects on crystallization in multicomponent semicrystalline polymers, using a new fluorescence technique with a nanoscale spatial resolution. The principal investigator (PI) plans to achieve this goal by strategically placing trace amounts of \u201creporter\u201d (i.e., crystal-sensing) fluorescent dye labels at controlled distances from interfaces to elicit fluorescence-based information about local crystallization and thus interfacial effects. Towards this goal, the PI and students will pursue three research thrusts: (1) Understand the role of fluorescence as a crystallization-sensing mechanism by selectively placing the dyes in rigid vs. mobile amorphous fraction regions to deconvolute their contributions to the overall fluorescence; (2) Study near-interface crystallization by location-specific fluorescence and complementary methods such as grazing-incidence X-ray scattering; (3) Unveil polymer/polymer and polymer/substrate interfacial effects on crystallization and their perturbation length-scale. Material studies will focus on degradable poly(L-lactic acid) (PLLA) as a model semicrystalline polymer to advance the design of new PLLA-based multicomponent materials with desired structures/properties and improved sustainability, including multilayer films, composites, blends, and block copolymers. The education/outreach plan will broaden the reach and benefits of this CAREER research at multiple levels: (1) The PI and students will reach out to the general public through online educational videos on semicrystalline polymers; (2) The PI will develop a new lab module on plastic packaging and leverage the existing research programs at ASU to train graduate students, undergraduate students, and high-school students on polymer synthesis and characterization; (3) The PI and students will develop hands-on demonstrations at ASU Open Door to stimulate local K-12 students\u2019 interest in polymers and STEM careers.\r\n.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
