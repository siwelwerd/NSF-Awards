 "awd_abstract_narration": "Despite the incredible success of the Standard Model of Particle Physics, there are still significant unsolved mysteries. The PI and co-PI will conduct experimental and theoretical research to investigate the use of quantum sensors to address some of these outstanding problems in fundamental physics. This work will be performed in synergistic collaboration with Laboratoire Aime Cotton, Orsay, France. The students and postdoctoral researchers on the project will be trained in the principles of quantum sensing and work to greatly improve the sensitivity of measurements by using novel quantum states.\r\n\r\nThe research team will investigate alkali-metal atoms trapped in solid cryogenic matrices. Prior work by the PI's group has shown that ensembles of these atoms have excellent spin coherence times, along with the other properties needed for quantum sensing. Additionally, it is possible to create large-number samples which offer extremely good prospects for statistical sensitivity. Even more promising, this prior research has suggested that nonclassical spin superposition states may offer significantly longer ensemble spin dephasing times, which would be advantageous for experiments looking for symmetry violation using spin. The researchers will generate and investigate the properties of these nonclassical superposition states. In collaboration with the Orsay group,  the researchers will investigate the potential of this system for measurements of the parity-violating nuclear anapole moment in cesium, as well as possible future experiments searching for time-violating electric dipole moments.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
