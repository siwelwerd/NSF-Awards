 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides travel support for conference registration, accommodations and air travel for student attendees at the Ninth North American Industrial Engineering and Operations Management (IEOM) Conference; Washington, DC; 4-6 June 2024. The theme of the conference is \u201cOperational Excellence in the Industry 4.0 era\u201d. Eligible students must be enrolled full-time at a US college or university. Preference will be given to students from underrepresented groups in engineering. Students will be required to present a research paper or poster at the conference.\r\n\r\nStudents who attend and participate in the IEOM Conference will have a unique opportunity to engage in networking with attendees from over 45 countries. Industries are facing challenges from disrupting smart technologies. Students will have opportunities to attend conference keynote addresses, technical sessions, industry solutions, and Industry 4.0 sessions. They will meet the outstanding industry speakers who bring experience and extensive knowledge. The contacts that are developed at this event will add value to the students who may be seeking job opportunities. Students will develop relationships for future research opportunities and collaborative partnerships. Engagement with industry, academia and other students will be a great learning environment in the field of science, engineering and education to prepare students in the cyber-physical systems and disruptive technologies.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
