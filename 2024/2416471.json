 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national interest by transforming introductory social sciences education through innovative, project-based learning that integrates essential modern digital skills such as data analytics, programming, computer graphics, video production, and web development. By introducing a scalable model in the Introduction to Psychology course, which attracts high numbers of women and students from underrepresented groups, the initiative aims to empower students with critical technical skills from the outset of their academic journey. Emphasizing engagement with digital tools and interdisciplinary inquiry, the project seeks to enrich disciplinary content learning while inspiring students to explore and excel in digital technology fields. This approach aligns with NSF's strategic goal to \u201cempower STEM talent to fully participate in science and engineering.\u201d Through collaborative efforts between content experts and technology educators, this project aims to set a new standard for integrating digital literacy into introductory courses, fostering creativity, independence, and career readiness among students nationwide. \r\n\r\nThe project will include a redesign of the introductory psychology course by integrating modern digital workforce skills with disciplinary content, incorporating tools such as Python, Adobe Express, and HTML, aiming to deepen students' understanding of psychology concepts through practical applications. Supporting resources will be curated to aid student engagement, representation, and action across various digital projects. Scaffolding will provide both in-class and out-of-class support, utilizing peer mentoring, pair programming, and teachable agents to enhance learning experiences and build a sense of belonging. The initiative also emphasizes the creation of open educational resources (OER) to freely distribute instructional materials and share student learning artifacts, promoting inclusivity and accessibility in education. The project's evaluation will employ both formative and summative assessments to measure outcomes related to digital skills, academic performance, and career intentions among diverse student populations, aiming to validate the effectiveness of the project-based curriculum in enhancing student engagement and learning outcomes. The NSF IUSE: EDU Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through the Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
