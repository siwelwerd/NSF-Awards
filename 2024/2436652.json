 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support to 25 US-based graduate students to attend the 2024 Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS), to be held Oct 14-18 in Salt Lake City, Utah.  CCS is the flagship conference of the Special Interest Group on Security, Audit and Control of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM).  The conference brings together information security researchers, practitioners, developers, and users from all over the world to explore cutting-edge cybersecurity ideas and results. CCS 2024 will include multiple technical tracks across a wide spectrum of cybersecurity topics, with over 240 papers, pre-conference and post-conference workshops, tutorial and poster sessions, and panel discussions. Participation in the conference is a valuable opportunity for students and is an important part of graduate education in cybersecurity.\r\n\r\nStudents will have the opportunity to observe high-quality presentations and interact with senior researchers in the field both in the main conference and the associated workshops. This can lead to community-based research initiatives, knowledge sharing, and positive social impacts beyond academia. The conference will involve researchers, scholars, and professionals from diverse backgrounds, allowing students to build valuable connections and collaborations.  Criteria for selection include evidence of a serious interest in the field as demonstrated by an application letter, a resume showing research outcomes, and/or a support letter from the advising faculty member. The project especially encourages participation from underrepresented groups, to broaden both perspectives and participation in the discipline.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
