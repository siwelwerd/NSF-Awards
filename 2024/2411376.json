 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ability to process large sets of data on research computing (RC) platforms has led to remarkable advances in science and engineering and has become an indispensable tool for researchers, industry professionals, and students. The importance of RC platforms and tools (and in particular those involving AI technology) has been recognized by the highest levels of the United States government, as evident by the National AI Initiative Act of 2020, which calls for the creation of a National Artificial Intelligence Research Resource (NAIRR). Unfortunately, for many individuals, RC use and adoption is hindered by the complex way in which these resources are accessed. While web browsers and smart devices have become the dominant access mechanism for remote consumer and enterprise computing services, the adoption of such mechanisms has lagged for many RC service providers, creating an accessibility gap that impedes further adoption. Open OnDemand is a mature, National Science Foundation (NSF) funded, open-source platform that enables remote web access to RC services, thereby simplifying use of those resources and facilitating collaboration. RC clients can manage files and jobs, create and share apps, run GUI applications, and utilize a traditional terminal all through a web browser from anywhere on any device because it requires no specialized client software and has a simple interface that is easy to learn and use. \r\n\r\nThe Open OnDemand community has begun to expose platform limitations and request additional features and capabilities, many of which will require significant collaborative development efforts to implement. Further adoption of this powerful platform, and the resultant scientific advances, can be accelerated via a variety of innovations: (1) Catalog, providing capabilities to conceptualize, create, modify, share, and publicize apps; (2) Classroom, focused on Open OnDemand in educational environments; (3) Customization, involving innovation in client interfaces and new technologies; and (4) Community, facilitating communications among the community. A cross-cutting aspect of the GOODLUCK project will pilot and deliver integrated sets of tools, documentation, and training materials, which researchers can select from to create an environment tailored to their research. Initial beneficiaries of these efforts include: (1) biochemists utilizing cryogenic electron microscopy (Cryo-EM) to identify the underlying mechanisms of viral action; (2) materials scientists designing new alloys from first principles; (3) art design students creating novel works via the use of generative artificial intelligence; and (4) aerospace engineers improving the performance of drones via computational fluid dynamics. In summary, the GOODLUCK effort will provide tools and processes that allow researchers to more easily and extensively utilize Open OnDemand, as well as to analyze and share their computational results, regardless of their access to RC resources or position in the research lifecycle.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
