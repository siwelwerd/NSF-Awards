 "awd_abstract_narration": "The unprecedented growth of wireless connectivity and increasing demand for high data rates necessitate a transition to the FR3 frequency band (7-24 GHz), which offers the combined benefits of extensive coverage, high capacity, and ultra-fast data rates. This project addresses the critical need for enhanced Spectrum Access Systems (SAS) within the FR3 band to ensure efficient coexistence among its diverse applications, such as mobile satellite services, radio astronomy, and various federal and commercial operations. The project undertakes the development of a precise wireless digital twin to accurately model signal propagation and enable spectrum access and management systems to improve spectrum sharing requests for general users, as well as identify optimal bands or channels at any given time and location, allowing more effective channel requests from the access systems. Additionally, it facilitates more efficient spectrum allocation in densely populated areas, minimizing interference and maximizing spectrum efficiency. The PIs will develop both individual and group-based research projects related to this proposal, actively recruit female and underrepresented students for research, and provide research opportunities for K-12 students through their institutions' outreach programs.\r\n\r\nThis research project is organized into three thrusts. The first thrust focuses on building a wireless digital twin to capture the physically-largest, static features of the environment using 3D scene representation and ray tracing tools to simulate signal propagation. This validates the core capability of accurately identifying signal transmission paths and channel quality. The second thrust aims to develop a dynamic wireless digital twin that accounts for environmental dynamics, such as human movement and changes in object positions, by optimizing real-time channel updates. The third thrust ensures the digital twin adheres to spectrum sharing regulations, prioritizing incumbent users while integrating real-time spectrum usage data to enhance predictive capabilities. This research provides a comprehensive framework for managed spectrum sharing in the FR3 band, fostering the deployment and performance of next-generation wireless networks.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
