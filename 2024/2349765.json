 "awd_abstract_narration": "This new three-year REU Site: Controlled Environment Agriculture (CEAfREU) hosted by the University of Wyoming focused on controlled environment agriculture (CEA). Global food demand will increase by 56%, with challenges such as food shortages, climate change, and rising populations exacerbating hunger crises.  Controlled environment agriculture (CEA), such as greenhouses and vertical indoor farms, is a promising solution to improve food production and support a robust and nutritious food supply across the globe. The goal of this REU program is to broaden the participation of students engaged in cutting-edge CEA research.  Eight participants each year will engage in interdisciplinary research focused on resource efficiency while maintaining optimal crop growth in CEA. Mentoring, technical skills development, and other professional training will combine students\u2019 knowledge of indigenous food with modern technologies in CEA to bridge generational gaps and promote fresh and healthy produce in tribal communities. A cohort-based approach promotes teamwork, leadership, and peer teaching while inspiring and preparing students to advance new technologies that support the future of agriculture.   \r\n\r\nThis new three-year REU Site: Controlled Environment Agriculture (CEAfREU) hosted by the University of Wyoming focused on controlled environment agriculture (CEA). This novel program supports eight rising sophomores per year to conduct convergence research in CEA. The primary objectives are to prepare students to advance creative interdisciplinary solutions to CEA, develop leadership and technical communication skills, and appreciate CEA research, education, and career opportunities beyond an undergraduate degree. The REU program supports resource-efficient CEA research while enabling students to explore advanced engineering technologies, gain knowledge about agricultural processes to optimize crop yields, and develop business skills to support sustainable CEA practices. Students will pursue one of the three research themes: (1) modeling and operation for resource-efficient CEA, (2) computer vision for monitoring crop growth and analyzing nutrient contents in CEA, and  (3) a CEA feasibility study for tribal communities. REU students will gain firsthand experience through site visits, semi-interviews, and live discussions with industry partners. Actively engaging industry partners and better understanding stakeholder perspectives will enrich student learning, ultimately benefitting their professional and potential STEM career development.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
