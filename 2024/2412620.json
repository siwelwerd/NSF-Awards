 "awd_abstract_narration": "This workshop showcases cutting-edge research in language processing, drawing inspiration from pioneering work in the field of psycholinguistics. This pioneering work was instrumental in identifying the core issues within the field and played a pivotal role in founding an annual interdisciplinary conference, now recognized as a premier event in psycholinguistics. The workshop features presentations on a variety of topics, including how grammatical structures influence our understanding of language, the insights into human cognitive processes offered by computational models, and the mechanisms behind children's acquisition of word and sound patterns. This event is strategically scheduled immediately before the annual interdisciplinary conference to enhance accessibility for students and foster engagement from scholars across the globe. \r\n\r\nPsycholinguistics, as a discipline, investigates the intricate processes that enable the human brain to associate linguistic forms with their meanings. This area of study is not only significant as basic research but also has practical implications in today's technology-driven society. Innovations such as Large Language Models and other types of artificial intelligence have brought to the forefront essential questions about how language is learned and used. As the world becomes more interconnected, there is greater demand for language education and a deeper understanding of the impact of bilingualism on cognitive and neural functioning. This workshop merges insights from various research methodologies \u2013 including behavioral analysis, computational theory, and neurobiology \u2013 to outline promising directions for future investigations in linguistics.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
