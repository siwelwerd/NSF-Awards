 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader/commercial impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project lies in transforming Sargassum seaweed, an invasive species, into low-cost nanocellulose for sustainable packaging. This innovative approach addresses the environmental challenge of Sargassum blooms while contributing to the circular economy by creating valuable products from waste. The project's potential impact includes significant environmental benefits by reducing plastic waste and reliance on non-renewable resources, stimulating economic growth in coastal communities affected by Sargassum, and fostering green technology innovation. By making biodegradable solutions more accessible and cost-effective, this project supports the national interest by promoting scientific progress, advancing national health and prosperity, and enhancing environmental welfare. The technology offers a market opportunity by providing a competitive alternative to traditional packaging materials.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project aims to develop a novel, cost-effective process for producing nanocellulose from Sargassum seaweed. The technical challenge addressed includes overcoming the high cost and energy requirements associated with current wood-based nanocellulose production methods. The research objectives are to validate a proprietary pulping process, optimize energy and water usage, and achieve efficient nanofibrillation of Sargassum dissolving pulp. The proposed research involves detailed characterization of the resulting nanocellulose, comparing its properties and production costs to those derived from hardwood pulp. Anticipated technical results include establishing a scalable method for producing high-quality nanocellulose, demonstrating reduced energy and water consumption, and providing a sustainable alternative to conventional materials. This project builds on preliminary research that has shown the potential of Sargassum-based nanocellulose to meet industry standards, with significant implications for materials science and environmental sustainability.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
