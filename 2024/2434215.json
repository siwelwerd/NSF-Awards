 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Improving Undergraduate STEM Education: Hispanic-Serving Institutions \r\n(HSI) Program, this Educational Instrumentation project at San Francisco State University (SFSU) \r\nwill strengthen undergraduate learning in Civil, Mechanical, and Computer Engineering. \r\nSpecifically, this project will secure a state-of-the-art Six Degrees of Freedom (6-DOF) Hexapod \r\nMotion Platform from Quanser Corporation, which will allow students to conduct hands-on \r\nexperiments in courses such as Dynamics, Engineering Experimentation, Structural Analysis, \r\nControl Systems Laboratory, Systems Dynamics and Mechanical Vibrations, Digital Signal \r\nProcessing, and Engineering Design Projects. An estimated 500 students and five faculty \r\nmembers will utilize the project-funded equipment each year. In addition to providing improved \r\nexperiences in engineering courses, the new equipment will also be used in undergraduate \r\nresearch and independent projects.\r\n\r\nThe goals of this project are to enrich the learning and experiences of undergraduate students \r\nby providing critical equipment in the aforementioned disciplines. The Hexapod Motion \r\nPlatform will enable students to bridge theoretical knowledge with practical application, \r\nenhancing their understanding of real-world engineering challenges and developing essential \r\ntechnical skills. This project will assess the impact of the project-funded equipment using \r\nquantitative and qualitative evaluation methods, including tracking D, F, W rates, analyzing \r\nstudent performance on relevant assessments and conducting surveys to collect feedback.\r\nThis project is funded by the HSI Program, which aims to enhance undergraduate STEM \r\neducation, broaden participation in STEM, and increase capacity to engage in the development \r\nand implementation of innovations to improve STEM teaching and learning at HSIs\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
