 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nontechnical Abstract:\r\n\r\nNovel quantum materials with exotic electronic and magnetic properties offer a unique opportunity for developing future advanced computing technologies. Two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) magnets have emerged as an ideal platform for exploring unique magnetic states and developing functional spintronic devices. Through a collaborative effort between the University of Wyoming and Colorado State University , this research delves into the unconventional magnetic properties of selected 2D vdW magnets. This interdisciplinary team employs both experimental and theoretical approaches, including nanofabrication, magnetotransport measurements, scanning tunneling microscopy, magnetic force microscopy, theoretical modeling, and first-principles calculations. These studies are expected not only to fill critical gaps in our scientific understanding but also to facilitate groundbreaking applications in spintronics-based computing. Furthermore, the project offers substantial research and educational opportunities for underrepresented minorities, first-generation college students, and female students in the fields of condensed matter physics, nanoscience, and nanotechnology. The accompanying graduate training program extends into high school outreach, collaborating with educators to integrate cutting-edge research into existing science curricula.\r\n\r\nTechnical Abstract:\r\n\r\nControllable magnetization dynamics offers a promising approach for achieving advanced computing using nanomagnetic devices, such as probabilistic bits (p-bits), voltage-controlled magnetic anisotropy, and spin-logic devices in information and communication technology applications. In this collaborative project, the research team focuses on exploring the novel magnetic properties of few-layer two dimensional van der Waals (2D vdW) magnets. The project has three primary objectives: 1) investigate the fundamental roles and behaviors of unconventional magnetic domains of the novel magnetic properties of few-layer 2D vdW magnets, 2) manipulate metastable magnetic phase transitions within these magnetic domains, and 3) uncover the mechanisms underlying magnetic switching in these materials. Various experimental and theoretical approaches are employed, including nanofabrication, magnetotransport, low-temperature magnetic force microscopy, spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy, theoretical modeling, and first-principle calculations. This research project expects to revolutionize the design and function of 2D vdW magnets, enabling the development of simple, energy-efficient, atomic-scale 2D vdW p-bits as fundamental components for the next generation of probabilistic computers. Additionally, the project's educational component provides invaluable opportunities for students and early-career researchers, equipping them with crucial knowledge and skills in advanced materials research and technology, thereby preparing them for significant contributions to the evolving field.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
