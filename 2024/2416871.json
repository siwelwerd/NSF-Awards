 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national interest by crafting a series of accessible, hands-on learning activities featuring artificial intelligence (AI) in existing computer science (CS) courses. In today's world, AI has emerged as a transformative force, reshaping industries and daily life. Given its profound impact, the cultivation of AI literacy will become an indispensable component of undergraduate CS education. This project intends to address this educational imperative by tailoring and engineering AI activities to not only augment AI literacy but also to expand AI exposure and engagement among CS students. By focusing on experiential learning rooted in real-world scenarios, the project will endeavor to overcome tangible and perceived barriers to AI education. The project has the potential to significantly advance diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility within the CS discipline.\r\n\r\nThis project team plans to demystify AI for undergraduates by presenting algorithms and models in a more accessible and engaging manner. This innovative pedagogy should promote deeper understanding, stimulate interest, and enhance retention among students, preparing them for successful careers in the field of AI. By making AI literacy more appealing and accessible, especially to underrepresented groups, the project will support efforts to cultivate a more diverse and inclusive tech workforce. Additionally, the open-source nature of the developed materials and tools will ensure that the benefits of this project can extend beyond the immediate academic community, reaching educators and learners at various levels, including community colleges and high schools. The NSF IUSE: EDU Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through its Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
