 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports US-based participants in a conference on ``Resolution of Singularities, Valuation Theory and Related Topics'' which will be held from August 5 - 9, 2024 in Morelia, Mexico. The conference will be held at Centro de Ciencias Matematicas, UNAM, Morelia. NSF will provide significant travel and lodging support for 12 U.S. participants to the conference. The funding will be for students, postdoctoral scholars and other U.S. participants who do not have other federal support. A particular emphasis will be on supporting a diversity of participants, especially from under-represented groups.\r\n\r\nThe focus of the conference is on applications of valuation theory to resolution of singularities in positive characteristic and to other areas of algebraic geometry, commutative algebra and singularity theory. Recently, there have been significant advances in this area, and this conference will cover this progress in talks by the authors of this work. The proposed gathering will provide an opportunity for researchers from diverse fields to interact and establish research connections with each other; in particular, the participants will benefit from this interaction and from seeing recent developments in the field and its relationships with other areas. The conference webpage is\r\n https://sites.google.com/view/spivakovsky60thbirthday/home/authuser=0\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
