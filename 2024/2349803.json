The workshop is organized collaboratively by PIs at Tufts University and Columbia University The workshop's primary objective is to inform the executive branch and U.S. government agencies about new technological advances and related concerns and risks related to the legal contestability of artificial intelligence used in creating government software-enabled processes, regulations, and legal proceedings. \r\n\r\nOver two days, the workshop features speakers and panels, all of whom are leading researchers in the field of artificial intelligence and the law.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
