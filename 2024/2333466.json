 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will establish and expand the BioBus STEM outreach facility to New England. \r\nBioBus is a non-profit STEM outreach organization with experience building connections between active research institutions and K-12 students. Founded in New York in 2008, BioBus has now formally expanded to New England and is building partnerships with universities and schools across greater Boston. The New England BioBus will focus in K-12 outreach at the interface between biology and imaging science. Harvard is a foundational academic partner for BioBus in this expansion. This EAGER award will bring scientists to dozens of K-12 schools across the Boston area, provide scientists with critical feedback for developing their outreach skills, and open the scientific process to the community during public events staffed by BioBus staff and active research fellows.\r\n\r\nThe activities sponsored by this award represent a unique opportunity to advance our understanding of how incorporating professional scientists into K-12 outreach can impact student outcomes. The Principal Investigator is particularly interested in student scientific identity, awareness of scientific careers, and general engagement. The investigators will also observe the impact that practical outreach training has on the efficacy and confidence of the scientist fellows participating. It is anticipated that these activities will lead to scientists that feel empowered to do more outreach and students that are excited to do science. Students with access to quality K-12 education level will be better equipped to pursue careers in STEM.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
