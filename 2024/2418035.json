 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides partial support for the 2024 Computational Materials Science and Engineering Gordon Research Conference and associated Gordon Research Seminar which will take place July 21 to 26, 2024 and will be held at the Jordan Hotel at Sunday River in Newry, Maine.  The purpose of this conference is to accelerate advancement in Computational Materials Science and Engineering. This is the second Gordan Research Conference in this series. The conference is scientifically focused on \u201cThe Role of Theories, Simulation, and Machine Learning in Materials Discovery.\u201d The objectives are to: (1) cross-pollinate ideas among disparate communities conducting CMSE research and better connect scientists and engineers across the field of Materials Science and Engineering; (2) promote the creation of testable scientific theories, algorithmic advancements, and platforms and methodologies for data-intensive research; (3) accelerate the growth of computational tools for multi-scale materials simulation; (4) provide GS and PDs with networking opportunities to interact with and learn from seasoned professionals from subdisciplines across CMSE in ways that are difficult to achieve in standard conferences and symposia.\r\n\r\nThe conference includes a GRC Power Hour designed to address challenges faced by women and all groups underrepresented in science and engineering. The intent is to support the professional growth of all members of all members of the communities served by this meeting through providing an open forum for discussion and mentoring. This activity also includes a Gordon Research Seminar organized by junior researchers for students and postdoctoral fellows. The Gordan Research Seminar takes place on the weekend prior to the start of the conference.\r\n \r\nThe Division of Materials Research in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate, together with the Civil Mechanical and Manufacturing Innovations Division and Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental, and Transport Systems in the Engineering Directorate contribute funds to this award.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
