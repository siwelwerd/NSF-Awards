 "awd_abstract_narration": "The international conference \"Frontiers in Sub-Riemannian Geometry\" will be held at the  CIRM, Marseille (France) during the week of November 25-29, 2024. The aim of the conference is to bring together researchers working in different areas of mathematics related to sub-Riemannian geometry, with different backgrounds, to share the most recent results with multiple points of view and so to foster interactions between research groups and to contribute to the training of young researchers. This award will provide support for U.S. based participants.\r\n\r\nSub-Riemannian geometry has grown significantly since the early 1990\u2019s. It is closely related to several areas in mathematics such as geometric control theory, the theory of partial differential equations, geometric measure theory, etc. Sub-Riemannian geometry also plays a major role in many mathematical applications such as robotics, quantum control, and neurogeometry. For more details, see the website:  https://conferences.cirm-math.fr/3091.html\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
