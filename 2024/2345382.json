 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader/commercial impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in addressing biodiversity loss through its unique conservation platform that provides dual-sided marketplace for biodiversity credits. The platform would support local communities engaged in on-the-ground conservation activities, advance conservation efforts by engaging with individual funders, and work with corporations to hit their biodiversity targets. It also would empower corporations to meet their social responsibilities and be compliant with emerging environmental regulations. The innovative platform is designed to connect corporations directly with conservation organizations with the aim to address the critical need for sustainable funding for conservation initiatives by streamlining the process of the development, sale, and marketing of biodiversity credits. Through the development and facilitation of biodiversity credits the project has the potential to advance scientific research and progress, generate substantial economic benefits, and enhance social welfare and environmental sustainability. These outcomes align directly with the National Science Foundation\u2019s mission, ultimately improving the quality of life for U.S. citizens. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe primary technical innovation of this project is the development of an integrated platform that provides a dual-sided marketplace for biodiversity credits. The intake tool within the platform is intended to help conservation organizations identify, develop, and sell biodiversity credits to increase sustainable funding while connecting corporations to a centralized marketplace to search and purchase these credits to meet their biodiversity targets and comply with new environmental laws and regulations. The project would leverage artificial Intelligence to analyze large datasets, provide personalized recommendations, and advance scientific research. The Application Programming Interface tool would enable businesses to streamline sustainable options for their consumers while expanding their target demographics. The project integration would enhance the platform\u2019s efficiency while ensuring both corporations and conservation organizations have the tools and support needed to address biodiversity loss.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
