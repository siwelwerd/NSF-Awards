 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact of this I-Corps project is the development of a monitoring device for chronic wounds. Chronic wounds are a significant public health problem, impacting the quality of individuals' lives and producing an immense economic burden to healthcare systems around the world. The treatment of chronic wounds in the United States alone has been conservatively estimated to cost $28 billion annually. This multi-modal imaging device working in tandem with deep learning will improve the diagnosis and prognosis of the wound healing by measuring the structural, chemical, and metabolic characteristics of wound tissues. Using this device, the changes in tissue can be quantified over the course of healing and linked to the healing status of a wound. This knowledge is then leveraged in assessing the healing status of patients with chronic wounds. The fully non-invasive, non-contact device will allow clinicians to assess the healing characteristics of chronic wounds early. This solution will enable more efficient treatment planning for wounds which otherwise will persist for months to years potentially becoming infected and causing pain, discomfort, hospitalizations, and a poor quality of life. \r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. This solution is based on the development of a fully non-invasive, non-contact device to assess tissue health. Accurate prediction of wound type and the wound healing trajectory is critical for developing an optimal wound care strategy. The technology uses multi-modal imaging in tandem with deep learning to further improve the diagnosis and prognosis of the wound healing trajectory by utilizing both the structural and chemical information as opposed to purely structural information. The multi-modal imaging technique includes near-infrared spectroscopy and fluorescence imaging to acquire the structural, chemical, and metabolic characteristics of wound tissues. This information allows clinicians to assess neovascularization which has been shown as a key indicator of chronic wound healing. The device can be used as a self-management tool to be used by patients and caregivers at home.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
