The meeting is expected to be held for two days starting March 10th, 2025. It will involve participants, including Principal Investigators (PIs), NSF Program Directors, and the organizing team. \r\n\r\nThe 2-day program will include a keynote, presentations by the PIs of featured projects, panel discussions, poster presentation, a reception, and \u201coffice hours\u201d with Program Directors. The meeting will be where PIs, Program Directors, and others meet to present and exchange information about projects supported by the NSF\u2019s CIRC and CNS's MRI Programs, discuss research infrastructure opportunities and challenges, and explore new ideas and partnerships for future work.  It is also an opportunity for the academic community to interact with government agencies interested in research infrastructure developments and advancements. The Meeting series has played a major role in growing the community across a broad range of sectors and technologies, as well as in performing outreach to parties who have an interest in learning about the program and participating as future proposers, transition partners, or sponsors.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
