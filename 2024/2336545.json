 "awd_abstract_narration": "There is an urgent need for technical experts in cybersecurity and artificial intelligence (AI) committed to serving in government roles. These individuals can provide knowledgeable and future-oriented guidance that protects national defense and resources while facilitating growth across society. The CyberCorps\u00ae Scholarship for Service (SFS) project at Boise State University (BSU) will help to meet that need by nurturing a diverse cohort of 17 scholars into cybersecurity professionals ready to serve in public sector organizations. BSU\u2019s Computer Science department provides state-of-the-art technical instruction and continuous hands-on research experiences for Undergraduate, Master's, and PhD level cybersecurity and AI students. Scholars will be equipped with the requisite knowledge and skills to safeguard AI systems while leveraging AI to enhance cybersecurity systems' efficiency and effectiveness ethically. The project is aligned with the Federal Cybersecurity Research and Development Strategic Plan,  which highlights AI and Education and Workforce Development (EWD) as key areas.\r\n\r\nThis project aims to achieve the following objectives: 1) recruit a diverse cohort interested in serving in cybersecurity, 2) build scholars\u2019 competencies at the Intersection of AI and cybersecurity, and 3) foster engagement, ensure retention, and facilitate employment. The project team will systemically engage contemporary learning science and performance-improving methods. In addition, the project team will partner with other Idaho community and four-year colleges, and existing BSU cybersecurity programs to attract and retain scholars. The project will emphasize improving the participation of members of groups underrepresented in cybersecurity and those with diverse life experiences. In addition to coursework, seminars, and mentoring support, scholars will participate in various activities, including internships and hands-on training in BSU\u2019s Institute for Pervasive Cybersecurity. \r\n\r\nThis project is supported by the CyberCorps\u00ae Scholarship for Service (SFS) program, which funds proposals establishing or continuing scholarship programs in cybersecurity and aligns with the U.S. National Cyber Strategy to develop a superior cybersecurity workforce. Following graduation, scholarship recipients are required to work in cybersecurity for a federal, state, local, or tribal Government organization for the same duration as their scholarship support.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
