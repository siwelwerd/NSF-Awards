 "awd_abstract_narration": "The International Federation of Automatic Control (IFAC) Workshop on Cyber-Physical-Human Systems (CPHS) brings together researchers and practitioners to gain understanding from a range of disciplines united in CPHS systems. This specific workshop looks to broaden participation in CPHS in the uniquely interdisciplinary and intersection of modeling, analysis and control of integrated CPHS and social and societal aspects of CPHS. The workshop is in Antalya, Turkey in December, 2024. The CPHS community is uniquely positioned to contribute to this goal. \r\n\r\nThe CPHS\u201924 includes a broad community of researchers from academia and industry. Their research includes navigation, estimation, control, communication, networking, learning, and computing and other areas. This fusion not only advances knowledge in traditional CPHS areas but also catalyzes innovation in ergonomics, assistive technology, interactive design, medical technology, public wellness, farming, and public infrastructure.  The conference is directly before the Conference on Decision and Control 2024 and located to facilitate participation in both.   The conference focus on Cyber Human systems has broad implications in multiple application domains where autonomy is becoming pervasive but requires significant integrated activity in modeling, human behavior and teaming, and consideration of societal aspects.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
