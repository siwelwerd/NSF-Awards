It is a conference of very long standing that has continued to play a formative role in the field. This award aims to increase the impact of this conference on students, particularly those from under-represented groups, by encouraging and enabling their participation, especially in cases where travel expenses would otherwise preclude their attendance.\r\n\r\nConcretely, this project assists students to attend the SPAA June 17-21, 2024 in Nantes, France, by providing $1,000 travel support to each of 15 students.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
