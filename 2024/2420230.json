 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact of this I-Corps project is the development of a kinetic fluorogenic technology. This innovation addresses the need for rapid and efficient assays in biological research, healthcare, environmental studies, and industrial quality control. Current assays are labor-intensive and costly, hindering timely responses in medical emergencies and industrial testing scenarios. This technology offers precise testing capabilities, demonstrated by rapid malondialdehyde quantification in chicken meat, and can be applied to diverse sectors. Initially the target audience is meat and feed industries, including quality control, government inspection, and accreditation bodies. This technology enhances diagnostic accuracy, ensures food safety, stimulates economic growth in biotechnology, and fosters scientific discoveries across fields. \r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. This solution is based on the development of a kinetic fluorogenic technology, aiming to transform existing assays by offering rapid and precise chemical and biological testing capabilities. The technology is based on a comprehensive understanding of features tailored for process and quality controls in meat processing and feed production sectors. The technology has the potential to transform various sectors, enhancing diagnostic accuracy, ensuring food safety, streamlining industrial processes, and stimulating economic growth in biotechnology and diagnostics.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
