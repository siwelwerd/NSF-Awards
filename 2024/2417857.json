 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact of this I-Corps project is the development of learning engagement and assessment software applications in multi-person virtual reality (MVR). The learning environment is poised to undergo a major reformation, and MVR may be used to augment, and possibly replace, the traditional classroom learning environment in the near future. Using this technology, schools may benefit by being able to gain knowledge on their students\u2019 behaviors, especially the degree of learning engagement. In addition, the application may be used to educate users on how the brain organizes concepts or items into a network. The solution also provides scenarios for users to create, save, and share their own networks based on various themes.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. The solution is based on the development of a multi-person virtual reality (MVR) system that allows for the automatic assessment of students\u2019 learning engagement through non-invasive biometric indicators. These indicators include eye movement characteristics, haptic interactions, and/or hemodynamic activities in the frontal lobes of the brain. Specifically, an MVR semantic network learning application has been created to assess users\u2019 (students\u2019) learning engagement, gauging their active involvement in the learning process within MVR environments. During the learning process, various multimodal measurements are synchronized in real-time in response to the learning task or tasks, then the learning engagement level of each user is automatically computed and visualized.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
