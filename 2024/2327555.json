 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-Technical Abstract:\r\n\r\nMagnetic frustrated systems offer a captivating exploration of physics, where diverse forces prevent the formation of a simple magnetically ordered pattern, leading to various quantum states, from exotic spin patterns to superconductors. The Shastry-Sutherland Lattice (SSL) model plays a crucial role in interpreting quantum magnetism, offering insights into transitions under different conditions, such as pressure and magnetic field, resulting in the formation of novel magnetic patterns. Understanding these phenomena isn't just about uncovering the mysteries of the universe; it's about shaping the future of technology, as in the realm of spintronics, where these insights can drive innovative advancements. For instance, leveraging the principles of spintronics can enable the development of more efficient electronic devices. This could mean faster and more energy-efficient computers, as well as improved communication devices, significantly enhancing the way we connect and process information. Inspired by SSL model breakthroughs, this proposal suggests exploring a new family of similar compounds to deepen our understanding and propel technological progress. The project focuses on practical research, including synthesizing materials, conducting experiments to measure thermodynamic properties, and employing advanced scattering techniques for further insights. Beyond the scientific aspects, the project places emphasis on education, involving graduate and undergraduate students and fostering diversity in science. Collaboration between different institutions is actively encouraged, promoting participation in educational programs and internships to contribute to the broader scientific community.\r\n\r\nTechnical Abstract: \r\n\r\nThe initial realization of the Shastry-Sutherland Lattice (SSL) model in SrCu2(BO3)2 (SCBO) unveils a complex phase diagram, particularly in the study of magnetization plateaus under high magnetic fields and the potential hosting of topological triplons. However, understanding these emergent states in SCBO poses challenges due to technical experimental obstacles, such as the need for high magnetic fields and high pressures at low temperatures. In response, this research focuses on a new rare-earth-based SSL model family of compounds, allowing for more accessible investigations of field- and pressure-induced phenomena. The research plan includes synthesis, in-house thermodynamics measurements, and advanced spectroscopy experiments in collaboration with national user facilities. Ongoing collaboration with expert theorists provides crucial analysis and interpretation of the experimental results.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
