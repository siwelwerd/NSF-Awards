 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER) award funds research that deals with development of methods used to evaluate the safety and integrity of existing concrete structures. After decades of infrastructure expansion, we find ourselves responsible for an increasing inventory of aging and deteriorating concrete structures nearing the end of their service life and in need of structural assessment. Managing this growing inventory of deteriorating concrete structures poses a significant challenge for the civil engineering community. In this context, this research project will answer the following fundamental question: How can simultaneously occurring deterioration mechanisms, which were not accounted for during the design phase, be effectively considered in the assessment of reinforced concrete structures? The combined effects of corrosion of steel reinforcement, alkali-silica reaction, and freeze-thaw cycles on the integrity of concrete structures will be investigated. These deterioration mechanisms, although extensively studied individually, lack comprehensive understanding when it comes to their interactions, coupling phenomena, and overall impact at the structural level. The research effort is integrated with the education and outreach plan that intends to promote excellence in structural engineering. Furthermore, hands-on activities in undergraduate classes and interactive demonstrations at recruitment events aim to increase student engagement and foster a deeper understanding of structural engineering principles.\r\n\r\nThe overarching goal of this research is to provide a robust framework for the systematic assessment of concrete structures. To achieve this goal, the following specific research objectives were formulated (1) Identify, characterize, and validate at the material level the synergistic effects between the deterioration mechanisms affecting the performance of RC members, (2) Create and validate a numerical method for structural-level characterization that integrates the material-level findings, (3) Develop a holistic structural assessment method and a systematic procedure for model validation and calibration to help ensure accuracy and reliability across different existing modeling approaches. The research objectives will be accomplished through a seamless integration of experimental and analytical phases strategically designed to address all three core research objectives of the project. The approach taken in this project is distinct in two ways: (1) it emphasizes the integration between material-level and structural-level responses, providing insights into overall behavior and enabling informed societal risk and hazard mitigation assessments, and (2) it specifically investigates the structural-level implications of the coupling of deterioration mechanisms. This project will allow the PI to advance knowledge in the field of structural assessment of reinforced concrete structures, and establish her long-term career in developing advanced modeling techniques.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
