 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the Institute for Qualitative and Multi-Method Research (IQMR) and its associated Research Group in Qualitative and Multi-Method Analysis. The Institute is a two-week training program held each summer at Syracuse University. IQMR promotes the teaching and application of qualitative research methods and their combination with complementary analytic techniques in social science and cognate disciplines. Institute attendees are junior faculty and graduate students from the United States and overseas. The overall goals of the Institute and Research Group are to enable Institute attendees to create and critique methodologically sophisticated qualitative and multi-method research; to encourage the development of, and the publication of scholarship focused on, qualitative and multi\u2010method research techniques; and to foster the continued growth of a collaborative community of scholars who use qualitative research methods. To date, more than 3,000 early career researchers have been trained on advanced qualitative methods at IQMR.\r\n\r\nThe Institute for Qualitative and Multi-Method Research (IQMR) is a two-week, intensive training program held each summer at Syracuse University. The program promotes the teaching and application of qualitative research methods and their combination with complementary analytic techniques across social science disciplines. IQMR is now firmly established as the premier venue for intensive instruction on, training to conduct, and preparation to teach such methods. The Institute provides high-level, carefully designed instruction for a large and diverse group of attendees drawn from a wide national and, increasingly, international constituency. Through June 2023, over 3,000 graduate students and junior faculty have received instruction on advanced methods at the Institute. In addition to the pedagogical program, an associated Research Group meets for a one or two-day authors' workshop during each Institute's two-week duration. The Research Group provides authors with in-depth feedback on their draft scholarship in the field of methodology, thus supporting the work's publication and directly enhancing and expanding the core canon of research on qualitative and multi-method research.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
