 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Annual Digital Forensic Research Conference (DFRWS) is a long-running security and privacy conference that focuses on topics around digital forensics and attracts a variety of academic, industry, and law enforcement participants.  This award will support student travel to the 24th edition of this conference, to be held July 2024 in Baton Rouge.  Funding this travel will expose undergraduate and graduate students to state-of-the-art digital forensic research while connecting them to the larger community of digital forensics researchers and practitioners.  Students will also be encouraged to present posters on their own work to both promote their ideas and get expert feedback.\r\n\r\nThis grant will provide travel support to about 15 students who otherwise have limited travel funding and so might not be able to attend.  Criteria for selection include first-time attendance, participation in poster sessions, availability of travel funding, and diversity in terms of participant and institutional backgrounds.  Through these efforts, the award will support digital forensics workforce development of value to national security.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
