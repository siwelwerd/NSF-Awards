 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national interest by providing undergraduate research opportunities for students from a minority serving two-year college as a way to better prepare students to earn associates degrees or transfer to baccalaureate STEM programs. Increasing support for students from historically underrepresented groups to participate in STEM research has the potential to diversify the STEM workforce and further the mission to remain globally competitive as a nation. By establishing an undergraduate research learning community, this project enables diverse student populations to collaborate with faculty mentors and build professional networks that enhance future research and employment prospects. Over three years, 75 new students majoring in fields such as applied mathematics, computer science, physics, chemistry, biology, or engineering will participate in research experiences, with at least 50% transferring to a four-year institution within two years of enrollment. Ultimately, this project broadens participation in STEM academic degree pathways, contributes to expanding the workforce talent pool, and enhances the STEM field's innovative capacity.  \r\n\r\nThe primary goal of this project is to increase the graduation and transfer rates of students who have been historically underrepresented in STEM through the implementation of sustainable and evidence-based undergraduate research experiences. This will be achieved through activities such as recruitment and outreach, faculty mentorship, structured research courses, dissemination, and transfer assistance. The research component of this project seeks to: (1) generate knowledge about student satisfaction and persistence in STEM, (2) identify factors that enhance engagement, retention, and career readiness at a two-year Hispanic-serving institution, and (3) provide data on the impact of undergraduate research experiences on student persistence and likelihood of pursuing advanced degrees.  The following will be collected to monitor project improvement and success: descriptive profiles on targeted students, data on project processes, activities, and performance, success in achieving objectives, and recommendations for improvement. Additionally, the project intends to improve students\u2019 understanding of STEM subjects and their application in real-world situations and produce novel academic and scientific knowledge through dissemination and publication of research findings. The NSF IUSE: Innovation in Two-Year College STEM Education (ITYC) Program seeks to accelerate the impact of and advance knowledge about emerging and evidence-based practices in undergraduate STEM education at two-year colleges.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
