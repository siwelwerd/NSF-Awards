 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace (SaTC) program, a flagship initiative by the National Science Foundation (NSF), addresses critical cybersecurity challenges from a socio-technical perspective. By delving into deep scientific and engineering issues and considering human behaviors, SaTC aims to advance the field of cybersecurity and privacy. Given the escalating national significance of cybersecurity, effective communication between program officers, researchers, and government funding agencies becomes paramount. A robust SaTC community will drive innovation, identify novel research avenues, prevent duplication, and enhance graduate education opportunities.\r\n\r\nThis project encompasses the 2024 SaTC PI meeting venue and conference logistics, including registration, audio-visual support, communications, and meeting space in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The meeting local host will be CyLab, the Carnegie Mellon University Security and Privacy Institute. The planning date for the conference is September 4-5, 2024. The 2024 SaTC Principal Investigator (PI) meeting will help enhance: 1) Coordination and Collaboration: The meeting will convene SaTC-funded researchers, government representatives, and industry stakeholders. The primary goals are to stimulate coordination and collaboration among PIs working on diverse projects; 2) Interdisciplinary Partnerships: The meeting seeks to foster new collaborations between SaTC researchers and experts from other disciplines, enriching the cybersecurity research landscape; 3) Knowledge Exchange: By sharing experiences and lessons learned, the meeting aims to facilitate the transition of research findings into practical applications; 4) Education and Career Development: The meeting serves as a platform to exchange ideas and methods for enhancing education, recruitment, and career pathways in cybersecurity.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
