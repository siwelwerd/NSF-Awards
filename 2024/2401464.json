 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the participation of US-based researchers in the Conference on Solvable Lattice Models, Number Theory and Combinatorics that will take place June 24-26, 2024 at the Hamilton Mathematics Institute at Trinity College Dublin.  Solvable lattice models first arose in the description of phase change in physics and have become useful tools in mathematics as well. In the past few years a group of researchers have found that they may be used to effectively model quantities arising in number theory and algebraic combinatorics. At the same time, other scholars have used different methods coming from representation theory to investigate these quantities.  This conference will be a venue to feature these developments and to bring together researchers working on related questions using different methods and students interested in learning more about them.\r\n\r\nThis conference focuses on new and emerging connections between solvable lattice models and special functions on p-adic groups and covering groups, uses of quantum groups, Hecke algebras and other methods to study representations of p-adic groups and their covers, and advances in algebraic combinatorics and algebraic geometry.  Spherical and Iwahori Whittaker functions are examples of such special functions and play an important role in many areas. The website for this conference is https://sites.google.com/bc.edu/solomon-friedberg/dublin2024.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
