 "awd_abstract_narration": "As Artificial Intelligence (AI) research becomes more experimental and critical research breakthroughs occur using large amounts of data, the availability of computing for AI research is paramount to new AI innovations.  This workshop will identify opportunities to increase the use of advanced computing for AI research. It will highlight how AI researchers currently run large computations while discussing data and computing needs for AI research.\r\n\r\nThis workshop aims to synthesize requirements for open national infrastructure to support AI research. The workshop will bring together the AI research community and the high-performance cyberinfrastructure community to identify requirements and current challenges for the envisioned open research resources for AI.  Discussions will be held concerning AI researchers' current approaches to accessing computing resources and other infrastructure.  Participants will also discuss how AI researchers access existing national cyberinfrastructure resources and the possible vocabulary gaps and training needs.  Participants will identify community needs for AI research resources and unique requisites that the field of AI presents for cyberinfrastructure.  A workshop report will summarize discussions and synthesize initial requirements for computing resources, data, testbeds, and other cyberinfrastructure services to support AI research.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
