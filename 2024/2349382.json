 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site will host ten students over an eight-week period, engaging them in collaborative group research projects focused on diverse areas within applied mathematics. Through research meetings, students will develop advanced skills such as leveraging content knowledge in research problems and recognizing connections between theory, methods, and models. The program aims to equip students with invaluable educational and research skills, enhancing their readiness for graduate programs and STEM careers. A key objective is to promote diversity in STEM by recruiting  a number of participants from underrepresented groups and veterans. Additionally, the REU site will provide mentoring training for faculty and graduate students to effectively support students from diverse backgrounds, empowering them to excel in mathematics.\r\n\r\nThis REU program will provide undergraduate students with vigorous and motivating collaborative research experience in broad areas in Applied Mathematics, including Financial Mathematics, Biomathematics, and Mathematical Fluid Dynamics and Geophysics. Students will be prepared for the research through an intensive workshop on computing with Matlab. Additionally, students will participate in a workshop on mathematical writing using LaTeX and receive instruction on delivering effective presentations, preparing posters, and writing papers. Students will have the opportunity to disseminate their research findings by presenting at mathematics and interdisciplinary conferences, as well as publishing papers in journals, which will be freely accessible. Moreover, the REU site will equip students with the necessary training and confidence to apply for graduate programs in Mathematics, inspiring them to pursue careers in STEM fields.  Additional information on this REU program can be found at https://sites.google.com/view/fsu-math-reu.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
