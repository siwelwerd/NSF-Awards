 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will help us better understand sea ice, which is a major component of our climate. Sea ice is composed of many individual pieces and this project will study how these ice pieces break and deform. The researchers aim to create a new sea ice model to accurately model the behavior of ice pieces and use it to explain observations. This project will not only enhance our scientific knowledge but also bring real-world data analysis and modeling techniques into classrooms, train new scientists, and provide valuable opportunities for students in oceanography by organizing educational summer programs. The project's outcomes will be shared with the broader scientific community to help them learn more about sea ice and the Earth\u2019s climate.\r\n\r\nThis project addresses the critical need to enhance our understanding and modeling of sea ice processes, which play a significant role in shaping our climate. Existing climate models, with their coarse resolution, oversimplify sea ice dynamics. However, when examined at smaller scales, sea ice reveals itself as a complex system of interacting ice pieces with varying sizes, thicknesses, and shapes. The primary objectives of this project are to refine the representation of small-scale sea ice processes and establish clear connections to large-scale sea ice dynamics. The study focuses on modeling the deformation and fractures of sea ice pieces through a synergistic combination of data analysis, advanced numerical modeling, and theory development. The research's innovative aspect lies in the creation of a fundamentally new sea ice model that explicitly captures the life cycle of individual sea ice pieces. Validation of the model will utilize satellite sea ice observations. This model will be used to explore how statistical characteristics of the sizes and thickness of ice pieces are influenced by their collision and deformation physics. This approach aims to discern the impact of small-scale processes, like collisions and fractures, on larger sea ice characteristics that are crucial for improving sea ice representation in climate models. This model will be publicly accessible to benefit the broader polar oceanography community. Beyond scientific advancements, the project has a significant educational component. It intends to integrate scientific data analysis and modeling techniques into graduate and undergraduate classrooms, offering a comprehensive graduate-level course on sea ice dynamics. The incorporation of contemporary research material into polar oceanography and climate dynamics classes further contributes to educational outreach. Additionally, the initiative includes an annual summer program, Data Science in Oceanography, designed to attract talented students to graduate programs in oceanography. This program aims to provide ocean education and research mentoring, particularly to students who might not otherwise have such opportunities. The project's broader impact extends to the training of new polar scientists, supporting a Ph.D. student and numerous summer undergraduate students engaged in research activities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
