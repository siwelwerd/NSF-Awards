 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-Technical Description:\r\nFibrous biomaterials are very helpful in medicine as they support cell growth, aid tissue function, and deliver drugs to specific parts of the body. Recent advancements have made it possible to add fluorine, a special chemical, to these materials, which helps with imaging. This project aims to enhance the design of these fluorinated biomaterials for medical use. The team has three main goals: 1) to create fibers that can release drugs in a controlled manner; 2) to develop gels that change with temperature; and 3) to use imaging techniques to view these materials inside the body without surgery. Their approach allows them to precisely control how these materials interact with other molecules, form gels, and produce imaging signals. This is promising for developing new treatments that can be tracked inside the body. The project aims to create innovative medical materials that can both treat and allow doctors to see inside the body. It also helps train future scientists and engineers by involving students from various fields such as chemical engineering, materials chemistry, electrical engineering, and biomedical engineering. Additionally, as part of their outreach, the team will engage with the Urban Assembly Institute for Young Women, a school with many underrepresented students. They plan to offer educational modules that include lessons on fluorine, proteins, and virtual lab experiences, aiming to inspire and educate students in grades 6-12 about science and technology, promoting diversity in these fields.\r\n\r\nTechnical description:\r\nFibrous biomaterials offer valuable advantages in creating scaffolds for cell growth, supporting tissue function, and maintaining composition and localization for drug delivery. With advancements in synthetic and chemical biology, it is possible to incorporate non-canonical amino acids (NCAAs) bearing fluorine for imaging purposes. This proposal aims to enhance the design of fluorinated protein fibers and hydrogels through three key objectives: 1) generating coiled-coil fluorinated fibers for drug encapsulation; 2) developing fluorinated coiled-coil upper critical solution temperature hydrogels; and 3) assessing the potential of coiled-coil fluorinated fibers and hydrogels as 19F Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS)/(MRI) Imaging agents. Recently the principal investigator\u2019s group in collaboration with key collaborators demonstrated the incorporation of trifluoroleucine (TFL) in a designed coiled-coil protein that exhibited enhanced thermostability and small molecule binding in protein fibers. It was hypothesized that a 19F nuclei-dense coiled-coil could serve as a sensitive 19F MRS/MRI Imaging theranostic agent, with tunable supramolecular assemblies achievable through NCAA incorporation of TFL. This interdisciplinary approach allows precise control over small molecule binding behavior, gelation, and MRS/MRI signal, holding significant promise for theranostic applications where both therapeutic delivery and non-invasive imaging are crucial.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
