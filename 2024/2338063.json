 "awd_abstract_narration": "Quantum computers can help solve some of the most complex problems in physics, chemistry, material design, optimization, and machine learning. One of the leading challenges in building quantum computers\u202fis to demonstrate robust quantum information processing in the presence of\u202fquantum noise. In the last decade, tremendous theoretical and experimental\u202fprogress has been made toward realizing fault tolerant quantum\u202fcomputation. While\u202fthese advances have made possible several proof-of-principle logical qubit\u202fexperiments, scaling quantum systems to the\u202fquantity and quality of logical\u202fqubits needed by many applications requires a new generation of systems tool flows.\u202fThe goal of this project is\u202fto develop a practical architecture based on\u202fheterogeneous superconducting qubits, as well as its crucial compiling and benchmarking\u202ftools,\u202fthat will allow applications to be executed fault tolerantly while requiring\u202ffewer resources, bringing closer the goals of practical quantum\u202fadvantage on\u202fnear-term hardware. Education and outreach activities will make advances toward creating a sustained and sustainable pipeline from K-12 through graduate levels. \r\n \r\nThis project envisions a fault-tolerant architecture based on\u202fsuperconducting circuits where cheap, noisy qubits and expensive,\u202ferror-corrected qubits can co-exist. Intelligent compilation software will be\u202fdeveloped to map applications onto this heterogeneous architecture,\u202fwhile achieving\u202fsignificant resource savings for fault tolerance. By drawing deeply on ideas from\u202fquantum information and computer architecture,\u202fthe program creates new\u202fopportunities for interdisciplinary collaboration and exposes a broader\u202faudience to quantum computing through\u202fopen lectures, software libraries, and\u202foutreach events.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
