 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project develops a data platform that collects data and tools for analysis that can be used to study, prevent and respond to pandemics.  The name of this platform is the Data Access Platform for Human Mobility in Epidemiology (DAPHME).  The DAPHME platform contains global positioning satellite (GPS) datasets that are privatized, so that data can be made available to researchers and policy-makers at minimal cost and without the need for extensive computing resources.  Because more people will have access to the data and to repositories of tools for processing and analyzing the data, more people will be able to contribute to the understanding of the spread and prevention of disease.  DAPHME promises to significantly improve the nation's capacity to model and mitigate the effects of future pandemics and is a strategic investment in public health infrastructure.\r\n\r\nThe DAPHME project improves access to mobility data through several coordinated actions. First, it creates and arranges data sharing agreements with various location data providers for platform users. Second, it reduces data access costs by providing analytical tools and servers, along with a subscription model that helps keep the platform financially self-sustaining. Third, it develops methods and mobility metrics specifically for epidemiological research to make analyses more efficient. Finally, it builds a community of researchers through networking to enhance their research projects and encourages the widespread development of new code and methods. The project will positively impact the replication of research results, the validation and broader use of data, and the effectiveness of tools designed to combat public health emergencies.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
