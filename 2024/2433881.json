 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact of this I-Corps project is based on the development of an intracranial device to treat neurodegenerative disease, such as Alzheimer\u2019s or Parkinson\u2019s.  Current treatment devices involve helmets or headwear, and stigma around these bulky devices affects patient self-esteem and deters patient usage. This technology aims to be mostly intracranial (with the potential exception of small, flush hardware extracranially), and thus, may be associated with better patient satisfaction and well-being. Furthermore, given the estimated $655 billion spent yearly on neurodegenerative diseases in the United States, this technology has potential for financial impact if successful in slowing progression or alleviating symptoms of neurodegenerative diseases. \r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. The solution is based on the development of an intracranial device that works through cellular photobiomodulation (PBM) to treat neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer\u2019s or Parkinson\u2019s. This approach creates minimally invasive burr holes over affected regions of the brain, which would be closed with a direct targeting photobiomodulation device to apply the therapy uncompromised by attenuating obstructions. For example, PBM holds promise as a postsurgical healing tool, especially in surgeries that require burr holes, by eliminating the need to penetrate additional tissue to reach clinically relevant structures. This device could deliver therapeutic benefit for certain neurological afflictions and could contribute to a better understanding of the mechanisms of PBM therapy that may inform targets for novel therapies.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
