 "awd_abstract_narration": "This NSF award will support 8 undergraduate students for 8 weeks at Auburn University in each of the summers 2024-2026. The program is a continuation of NSF funded REU programs conducted by the proposers at Auburn in 1999, 2000, 2005-2008, and 2010-2023. The REU will focus on research problems in algebra (computational algebra, Groebner bases) and discrete mathematics (graph theory, graphs and hypergraphs, information and coding theory, and number theory). The program will have a positive impact on undergraduates pursuing graduate training in the mathematical sciences and supports NSF's vision of developing a diverse scientific workforce. This project is jointly funded by the Mathematical Sciences Research Experiences for Undergraduates Sites Program (DMS REU Sites) and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).\r\n\r\nThe pattern of activities will be: intensive introduction to problem areas in the first two weeks, capped by an obligatory \"ice-breaker\" presentation by each participant in the third week, followed by a \"research institute\" phase in the remaining five weeks, capped by a final presentation by each participant. During the research institute phase, there will be frequent talks given by faculty and graduate students of the host department, visiting mathematicians, and the participants themselves, but the main feature of that phase will be the research carried on by the participants, in various combinations with faculty, graduate students, and by themselves. The purpose of the program is to give the participants an authentic experience of mathematical research with the goal of exciting students about going to graduate school and pursuing academic research careers. As in past years, research results will be published in books or refereed journals and presented at research conferences. More information on the program can be found at https://cws.auburn.edu/apspi/pm/mathreu.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
