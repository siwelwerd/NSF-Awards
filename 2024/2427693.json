 "awd_abstract_narration": "The United States manufacturing sector uses materials that can be dangerous if not managed properly, posing risks to workers and the public. HazMat operators respond to and mitigate these risks, while facing personal contamination. First responders need personal protective equipment (PPE) that meets high standards and is resilient to environmental hazards while in use. This ReDDDoT project aims to proactively manage these hazards grounded in the framework of Community Risk Reduction, which emphasizes stakeholder engagement and data utilization to mitigate risks. The Materials Advancement through PRECEDE-PROCEED for Safety (MAPPS) project identifies factors affecting HazMat operators' health and designs engineering solutions to address these factors. It aligns with the National Science Foundation's (NSF) mission to advance health, prosperity, and welfare by improving workplace safety through engineering solutions. In the context of ongoing research, this project stands out by integrating cutting-edge sensing technologies to create PPE that can detect and alert to hazards in real-time. This approach not only enhances safety for first responders but also has the potential to impact other fields by advancing materials science and occupational safety. This project promises significant advances by fostering interdisciplinary collaboration and leveraging novel materials and technologies. Its potential impact extends beyond immediate safety improvements, contributing to theoretical understanding and methodological innovation in hazard management and PPE design.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this ReDDDoT project is to create PPE that can detect and respond to hazards in real-time, improving safety for first responders and other users. The approach includes collaboration with material scientists, healthcare providers (e.g., nurses), and disaster response specialists. The scope of this planning project spans needs assessment through initial design evaluation. The project employs the PRECEDE-PROCEED framework, which involves identifying factors that influence HazMat operators' health and designing engineering solutions to address these factors. By systematically incorporating stakeholder\u2019s (end-users and materials scientists) input and leveraging novel materials and technologies, the project aims to develop PPE that is both effective and improves end-user experience. This planning project has the potential to make significant contributions to materials science and occupational safety by advancing theoretical understanding, developing innovative methodologies, and fostering interdisciplinary collaboration. The outcomes will inform future research and policy, ultimately leading to safer and more effective PPE for those working in hazardous environments.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
