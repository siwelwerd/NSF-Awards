 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project addresses the critical need for advanced training in microelectronics physical assurance, inspection, and metrology, a field essential to the integrity and security of electronic components in the global supply chain. With the enactment of the CHIPS Act, the United States is focused on strengthening domestic microelectronics manufacturing. However, there is a significant shortage of skilled labor capable of performing physical test and assurance tasks, primarily due to the high costs and limited availability of traditional laboratory facilities as well as the complexity of the subject matter. This project leverages Virtual Reality (VR) technology to enhance accessibility and engagement for education. VR's interactive 3D graphics and immersive simulations offer an innovative solution to personalize learning experiences and engage students effectively. VR MiPA aims to incorporate gamification elements to facilitate student progress tracking. Hosted by the University of Florida\u2019s SeCurity and AssuraNce (SCAN) lab and supported by experts in VR interaction design and digital learning environments, the VR training will be integrated into an existing course to enrich the curriculum and transform how physical assurance, inspection, and metrology education is delivered. \r\n\r\nVR MiPA will develop interactive VR modules featuring 3D graphics and simulations, the incorporation of gamification to motivate and track student learning, and the integration of this training into an existing microelectronics course at the University of Florida. The technical approach involves collaboration between experts in microelectronics physical assurance, VR interaction design, and educational technology. The project will conduct a comparative study of learning outcomes between VR-based training and traditional on-site training using quizzes and surveys to assess student performance and engagement. Additionally, the project will collect and analyze user behavior data from the VR application to evaluate its effectiveness and impact. Dissemination efforts will extend the VR training to a broader audience including professional trainees and K-12 educators through web-based platforms and industry conferences. VR MiPA is expected to make significant contributions to the fields of human-computer interaction; educational technology; and microelectronics assurance, inspection, metrology with aims to prove insights into the efficacy of VR as a training tool in STEM education and enhance workforce development in microelectronics. \r\n\r\nThis award is co-funded by the NSF Improving Undergraduate STEM Education (IUSE: EDU) Program and Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) Program. The NSF IUSE: EDU Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. The NSF AISL Program supports research on the design, development and impact of STEM learning opportunities and experiences for the public in informal educational environments. This project is further supported by the Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace (SaTC) program, which funds proposals that address cybersecurity and privacy, and in this case, cybersecurity education. The SaTC program aligns with the Federal Cybersecurity Research and Development Strategic Plan and the National Privacy Research Strategy to protect and preserve the growing social and economic benefits of cyber systems while ensuring security and privacy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
