 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project aims to meet the national need to prepare well-qualified and experienced STEM secondary teachers who are committed to teaching in high-need school districts and are prepared for the future of education. Noyce Scholars will be part of a community of practice that includes regional stakeholders, practicing teachers, and education experts committed to elevating and promoting the teaching profession. Within this community, the scholars will be mentored through their clinical internships and induction years by educators at various stages of their careers. Educational opportunities will focus on educational leadership and the future of education, including the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) in the STEM classroom.\r\n\r\nThis project at Ramapo College of New Jersey includes partnerships with Bergen Community College (BCC) and Secaucus and Hawthorne high schools. The project goals include increasing the number of students pursuing secondary certification in mathematics, chemistry, biology, physics, and earth science at Ramapo College to a total of 45 graduates with STEM secondary licensure, including the 16 Noyce Scholars prepared to teach in a high-need school district. Current and future STEM teachers will learn to utilize AI and other technological advancements in the classroom. Additionally, a course plan will be developed for transfer students from BCC who wish to complete their secondary licensure at Ramapo College within three years. The project evaluation will monitor the Noyce Scholars from recruitment through their induction years, assessing recruitment pathways, program activities, and induction support. The project outcomes will be disseminated to local and regional partners, the broader educational community, and the Ramapo College community. This Track 1: Scholarships and Stipends project is supported through the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program (Noyce). The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 STEM teachers and experienced, exemplary K-12 teachers to become STEM master teachers in high-need school districts. It also supports research on the effectiveness and retention of K-12 STEM teachers in high-need school districts.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
