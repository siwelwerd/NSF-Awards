 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides NSF support to broaden participation in three co-located conferences -- the IEEE International Symposium on High-Performance Computer Architecture (HPCA), IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Code Generation and Optimization (CGO), and ACM SIGPLAN Symposium on Principles and Practice of Parallel Programming (PPoPP) -- held in Edinburgh, Scotland in March 2024. The HPCA/CGO/PPoPP symposia are widely recognized as top-tier venues in the fields of Computer Architecture, Compilers, and Parallel Programming, respectively. Students attending these conferences benefit from exposure to intellectually stimulating research, gaining access to cutting-edge techniques, methodologies and technologies, while engaging with senior researchers in their areas of expertise.\r\n\r\nThis travel grant aims to increase the impact of these conferences by enabling the participation of additional students who might otherwise be hindered by financial constraints. The award will help defray the cost of conference attendance for 24 students. The selection process for students will consider a combination of criteria, including merit, financial need, underrepresentation (with a focus on gender, minority status, and geographic diversity), and seniority (with a preference for more junior students). The award further enriches the diversity of conference attendees, ensuring a well-balanced representation of underrepresented and other groups among the participants supported by the grant. The conferences are committed to selecting at least 25% of their participants from underrepresented minority and gender groups.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
