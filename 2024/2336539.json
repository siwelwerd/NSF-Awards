 "awd_abstract_narration": "The current cybersecurity landscape highlights the importance of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) as critical enhancements to traditional security measures in effectively safeguarding the national cyberspace. This project aims to establish a new CyberCorps\u00ae Scholarship for Service (SFS) program at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV) to cultivate a group of cybersecurity experts skilled in AI/ML for government service. The UNLV curriculum integrates computer science and cybersecurity and is bolstered by AI/ML research focused on national infrastructure protection. In addition, this SFS program is designed to attract and mentor high-caliber undergraduate and graduate students and proactively engage with local high schools and community colleges to fortify the talent pipeline. In line with UNLV's recognition as the nation's fourth most diverse institution and its designation as a Minority-serving and Hispanic-serving Institution, the program will emphasize increasing the participation of underrepresented and female students in cybersecurity. \r\n\r\nThis project leverages UNLV's existing resources and expertise to equip graduates for an immediate impact in government cybersecurity roles. It embodies a comprehensive educational approach that merges theoretical knowledge with practical experiences and develops soft skills. Students engage in extensive cybersecurity and AI/ML training through academic coursework, online modules, and industry-recognized certifications, all designed to enable them to detect, thwart, and prevent cyber-attacks using AI/ML techniques. Direct mentorship with dedicated research supervision facilitate independent research into pressing cybersecurity challenges. Moreover, students refine their practical abilities by participating in cyber competitions, attending conferences, completing summer internships, and obtaining real-world experience through the unique cybersecurity clinic program, where they work with actual clients. The cybersecurity clinic also helps students improve their soft skills, including report writing, public speaking, project management, and leadership. UNLV students also contribute to cybersecurity educational initiatives aimed at high school students and consistently participate in federal and industrial cybersecurity events. UNLV\u2019s multifaceted educational approach is designed to nurture well-rounded cybersecurity professionals prepared to contribute to the workforce immediately.\r\n\r\nThis project is supported by the CyberCorps\u00ae Scholarship for Service (SFS) program, which funds proposals establishing or continuing scholarship programs in cybersecurity and aligns with the U.S. National Cyber Strategy to develop a superior cybersecurity workforce. Following graduation, scholarship recipients are required to work in cybersecurity for a federal, state, local, or tribal Government organization for the same duration as their scholarship support.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
