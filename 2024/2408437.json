 "awd_abstract_narration": "The solar corona, the Sun\u2019s outermost atmospheric layer, is a region of higher temperature and lower density than the photosphere, presenting ongoing challenges in understanding its heating mechanisms. The continuous heating of the corona is believed to be driven by magnetic field disturbances at the base of magnetic flux tubes. The Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope (DKIST) has capabilities expected to detect signatures of these heating mechanisms. This proposal focuses on characterizing high-frequency transverse waves observable with DKIST. Results from this project will advance knowledge across various fields, such as astrophysics and laboratory plasma physics, contributing to a broader understanding of stellar phenomena and plasma dynamics. The project will the develop a new show at Fiske Planetarium that will translate complex solar physics concepts into an accessible format for a diverse audience, extending its impact globally through online availability and fostering public scientific literacy. The principal investigator will mentor a REU student each year, adopting a personalized, responsive mentoring approach to instill a sense of ownership and independence in their projects. \r\n\r\nLeveraging DKIST\u2019s advanced instruments, this project has the potential to revolutionize understanding of the fundamental heating mechanisms of the solar corona and enhance the ability to predict and mitigate the impacts of space weather events. This project will conduct a comprehensive investigation into the transverse wave fluctuations within coronal lines, utilizing the unmatched spatial, temporal, spectral, and polarimetric resolutions offered by the DKIST. The team will use computational models to interpret the observed spectral lines, accounting for line-of-sight effects, non-equilibrium ionization, and comparing the derived geometry with a 3D coronal model. The results will provide a clearer understanding of Alfv\u00e9n wave amplitudes and their role in the solar atmosphere, thereby enhancing the ability to accurately model the energy transfer processes in the solar corona and chromosphere.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
