 "awd_abstract_narration": "Particulate matter is a significant air pollutant, and it has been linked to premature cardiovascular and respiratory deaths in metropolitan areas, as well as lung cancer. Since the recycling of these highly concentrated hazardous carcinogenic materials is not yet viable, tons of these air pollutants are released into the air every day. This research program aims to re-purpose toxic combustion waste as a valuable material for energy storage applications. The study will generate knowledge about the relationship between the physical properties of particulate matter-based materials and their electrochemical performance in energy storage devices. The integration of research and education will be achieved via several mechanisms, including developing an electrochemical elective course for college students, workshops for high-school teachers, and outreach activities for local high school students from underrepresented populations. Student researchers in the program will be trained in the interdisciplinary areas of engineering, electrochemistry, material science, and physics. Educational efforts will strengthen the pipeline of engineers for industries involved in developing cleaner technologies. \r\n\r\nThis project aims to identify the relationship between the electrochemical and physical properties of carbon-based waste in energy storage applications as a charge-storage material and as a conductive carbon additive. The project has three specific aims. The first aim is to develop methodologies to capture and process particulate matter from environmental waste sources such as marine and ocean-going vessels. The particulate matter generated from these sources contains additional pollution elements, such as sulfur. The second aim is to characterize the physical, chemical, and electrochemical properties of particulate matter for Li-ion and Na-ion batteries by conducting a series of microscopy, spectroscopy, and electrochemical measurements. The third aim is to identify charge storage mechanisms and chemo-mechanical stability of particulate matter-based electrodes by conducting in-situ stress/strain measurements and ex-situ structural, chemical, and morphological characterizations. Innovative advancements in recycling and re-use of toxic particulate matter in energy storage devices will contribute to reshaping design of energy management and environmental systems.\r\n\r\nThis project is co-funded by the CBET Environmental Sustainability program and the CBET Electrochemical Systems program.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
