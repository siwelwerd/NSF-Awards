 "awd_abstract_narration": "The annual Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS) is the flagship conference of the Special Interest Group on Security, Audit and Control of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM). The conference brings together information security researchers, practitioners, developers, and users from all over the world to explore cutting-edge cybersecurity ideas and results. CCS 2023 hosts multiple technical tracks with over 240 papers, pre-conference and post-conference workshops, tutorial and poster sessions, and panel discussions. Participation in the conference is a valuable opportunity for students and is an important part of graduate education in cybersecurity.\r\n\r\nThis award provides travel support to encourage participation in the 2023 ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security by students who normally encounter difficulty attending. Criteria for selection include evidence of a serious interest in the field as demonstrated by an application letter, a resume showing research outcomes, and/or a support letter from the advising faculty member. This project especially encourages participation from underrepresented groups.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
