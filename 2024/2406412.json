 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) through Targeted Infusion Projects supports the development, implementation, and study of evidence-based, innovative models and approaches for improving the preparation and success of HBCU undergraduate students so that they may pursue science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) graduate programs and/or careers. The goal of this project is to enhance educational opportunities for students at Southern University (SU) and A&M College by integrating cutting-edge technologies and industry-aligned projects into undergraduate curricular and providing students with hands-on experience and exposure to real-world challenges through industry partnerships.\r\n\r\nThe project's activities build upon a successful STEM educational model called the Computer Engineering Research Lab (CERL) developed at SU. The original CERL model focused on electronics-based projects and how those projects can be made more versatile using computer engineering and embedded microcontrollers. Through strategic partnerships with industry leaders like Entergy, Boeing, and Shell, this project will develop advanced educational tools in emerging technology fields for the engineering curriculum. In support of the curriculum, the student research aspect of the project will focus on activities related to the Internet of Things, energy storage, renewable energy, robotics, automation, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. The project will also develop summer research programs and workshops for high and middle school students. This expansion will allow a broader array of disciplines and educational levels to participate and will foster innovation and prepare students for leadership roles in emerging fields.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
