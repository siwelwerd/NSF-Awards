 "awd_abstract_narration": "The next generation of wireless systems will largely be deployed in radio spectrum that is shared, not only between commercial networks such as cellular and Wi-Fi, but also with various incumbents such as federal radar systems and fixed microwave links. Mid-band spectrum (now being defined to extend up to 24 GHz) is becoming the workhorse of wireless networks due to the favorable propagation and system characteristics that balance range with bandwidth. Recent spectrum allocations confirm these spectrum priorities: in 2020, the US made available 1.2 GHz of spectrum in the 6 GHz band (5.925 - 7.125 GHz) on an unlicensed, but shared, basis. Similarly, the CBRS band (3.55 GHz \u2013 3.7 GHz) is shared with Navy radars. The mid-bands are also very congested, leading to the need for more, and better, spectrum sharing.\r\n\r\nSpectrum Sharing Sandbox (S3) will be a data platform that will enable measurements and experiments on deployed 6 GHz and CBRS networks thus enabling the CISE community to develop a better understanding of how different types of sharing are performing in the real world. Commercial CBRS and Wi-Fi 6E devices will be deployed in multiple indoor and outdoor environments on the University of Notre Dame campus and will offer (i) the ability to verify propagation and interference characteristics in realistic deployed environments; (ii) select I/Q captures of adjacent channel and co-channel interference scenarios using software-0define-radios (SDRs); and (iii) rich Layer 1 - 2 data captures for AI/ML algorithm development and testing.\r\n\r\nAn experimental platform such as S3 does not exist today in academia or industry. S3-enabled real-world experimentation and measurements will drive future spectrum policy in new shared bands, such as the 7 - 8 GHz band. All relevant research outcomes from the community will be presented to the appropriate spectrum regulatory bodies, such as the FCC and NTIA, for maximum policy impact. High-school and undergraduates will also have access to S3 via existing Summer Scholar and REU programs at SpectrumX and Notre Dame that prioritize under-represented minorities. The data-sets that are created will be available to the entire CISE community and contribute to other NSF-funded programs such as Colosseum, RFDataFactory and ns-3.\r\n\r\nThe project web-site is: https://spectrumsharingsandbox.org/. All experiment descriptions, measurements, publications, software, workshop proceedings, tutorial materials, webinar recordings and other outcomes of this project will be maintained for 3 years and remain accessible via the website after the completion of the project.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
