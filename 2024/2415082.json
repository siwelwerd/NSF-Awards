 "awd_abstract_narration": "Solar eclipse event on April 8, 2024, provides an excellent opportunity to scientists for engaging in outreach efforts and to investigate the influence of reduction in the ionizing source on our Earth\u2019s atmosphere. This workshop intends to organize educational activities at the University of Texas at Arlington (UTA), which is on the path of totality. It means that the moon completely obscures the sun and for this event in April, the totality will last for about 4 minutes.  This short period of darkness offers a direct observing window where people can observe solar corona using safety goggles and collect data using scientific instruments. Scientists at UTA plan to take advantage of the upcoming solar eclipse and will use their state-of the-art Planetariums and telescopes to create public awareness and bring K-12 students to these facilities.\r\n\r\nThe scientific workshop will be held for two days between April 8 \u2013 10, 2024. Prior to this event, several activities are planned to enable proper dissemination of information about the solar eclipse to K-12 students. The team will distribute educational materials and safety goggles by visiting different schools in the area between March 18 \u2013 31, 2024. Technical support from International Astronomical Union (IAU) to facilitate observations using UTA telescopes and their access to public is also planned. This workshop will promote inter-disciplinary collaborations, encourage interactions between students and space-scientists. UTA will host several scientific instruments to address questions about (a) the spatial and temporal variability of Corona during totality and (b) response of the ionosphere-thermosphere system to solar eclipse? To investigate the first topic, use of professional four Maxvision ED80 telescopes (narrowband) and two spectral telescopes in a relative broad wavelength will be used. Several GNSS receivers will be used to explore the effects of solar eclipse on the Earth\u2019s ionosphere-thermosphere region. This grant is in response to NSF 23-014, \u201cDear Colleague letter: Great American Solar Eclipses 2023 and 2024\u201d to support science, education and outreach activities related to Solar Eclipses.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
