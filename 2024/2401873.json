 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dynamic binary translation (DBT) is a technology that converts executable code from one type of computer architecture to another. This process is crucial for various applications, like hardware emulators and software testing tools. However, creating an efficient and accurate DBT system is very challenging. These systems often encounter bugs and performance issues that can severely affect their reliability and usability.\r\n \r\nThe aim of this project is to improve DBT systems by developing methods to detect and fix hidden bugs and performance problems. The project introduces new verification techniques to identify bugs and practical methods to test performance. These advancements are expected to significantly enhance the reliability, usability, and efficiency of DBT systems. By making these improvements, the project will help expand the use of DBT technology across different applications that require precise and efficient systems. Additionally, the project includes teaching and mentoring activities to support a rich learning environment, providing research opportunities for undergraduate students.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
