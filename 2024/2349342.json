 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-year REU Site: Sensor Science and Engineering is hosted by the University of Maine (Umaine). Sensor science and engineering research ranges from basic theoretical studies to the design, fabrication, and testing of prototype sensor devices, with medical, environmental and industrial applications. This focus will provide a wide range of state-of-the art, interdisciplinary research and problem-solving opportunities for REU participants majoring in any STEM discipline. These experiences will also motivate participants to continue to graduate education for careers in research and development. Ten students each year will be recruited, with half of the student cohort coming from institutions with limited research opportunities for undergraduates and half from groups historically underrepresented in STEM. REU participants will work closely with faculty mentors and teams of undergraduate and graduate students to solve real-life research problems that impact society. In addition, REU students will share their research experiences with middle and high school students and teachers through special community outreach workshops. They will also disseminate research results through campus presentations and professional journals and symposia. \r\n\r\n \r\nThis three-year REU Site: Sensor Science and Engineering is hosted by the University of Maine (Umaine). Students will conduct research advancing their knowledge of engineering, chemistry, physics, and/or biology. Sensor science and engineering research ranges from basic theoretical studies to the design, fabrication, and testing of prototype sensor devices, with medical, environmental and industrial applications. This focus will provide a wide range of state-of-the art, interdisciplinary research and problem-solving opportunities for REU participants majoring in any STEM discipline. Sensor science and engineering provides an ideal context for demonstrating interdisciplinary scientific/engineering content and methodology. The ability to solve problems using an improved understanding of mathematics, chemistry, biology, physics, and engineering is central to this REU site.  Half of the student cohort will come from institutions with limited research opportunities for undergraduates and half from groups historically underrepresented in STEM. All participants will be on site for ten weeks each summer, working at specialized sensor science and engineering research facilities such as the Frontier Institute for Research in Sensor Technologies. REU participants will interact with faculty research mentors, graduate students, post-docs, technicians, visiting scientists, and middle and high school teachers. These kinds of interaction will help students develop strong communication skills and learn how to work across disciplines as required in a growing number of professional environments. REU participants will develop and deliver a presentation within a context similar to a national or international conference and share results from their research at a middle or high school. \r\n\r\nPartial funding for this proposal was provided through NSF's Improving Undergraduate STEM Education (IUSE:EDU) program.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
