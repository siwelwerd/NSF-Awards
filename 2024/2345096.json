 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project aims to serve the national need for preparing highly qualified mathematics teachers, a critical factor in maintaining the nation's competitive edge and addressing educational disparities in high-need communities. The Metropolitan College of New York (MCNY) Teaching Fellowship Program seeks to address the shortage of well-prepared secondary mathematics teachers by developing and supporting teachers with strong content knowledge, cultural sensitivity, and technology skills. This initiative is distinguished by its collaboration with the National Science Teaching Association (NSTA) and four high-need high schools in New York City to prepare two cohorts of teaching fellows. The program will offer a fourteen-month Master of Science in Education (MSED) majoring in Math Education, along with ongoing activities such as customized professional development modules for practicing teachers, technology workshops, and mentoring. These efforts aim to equip Fellows for effective teaching in high-need schools, fostering improved educational outcomes and teacher retention. The expected outcomes include enhanced mathematics education in underserved areas and the creation of a supportive network for preparing and retaining mathematics teachers, addressing a vital national interest in STEM educational equity and excellence.\r\n\r\nThis project at MCNY includes partnerships with the NSTA and four high-need high schools, The Eagle Academy for Young Men, Bronx High School for Medical Science, Bronx Collegiate Academy and Bronx High School of Business. The project intends to develop 20 new mathematics teachers over the program's six-year duration. Project goals encompass recruiting and certifying secondary math teachers through a comprehensive MSED program, integrating culturally responsive teaching practices and technology skills, and retaining mathematics teachers through a supportive network and peer-based mentoring model. The theoretical basis of the project rests on the proven impact of strong content knowledge and pedagogical skills on student achievement, with an emphasis on the need for teachers who are culturally and technologically adept. The project will adopt a mixed-methods approach to investigate the program's impact on developing highly qualified STEM teachers and retaining them in high-need schools. Research methods will include the teaching fellows' retention rate, interviews and surveys, and assessment of program components such as the mentoring program, community support, and professional development. The intellectual merit lies in the program's potential to contribute new knowledge on effective mathematics teacher education models, while broader impacts include enhancing mathematics education in high-need areas, developing leadership among STEM educators, and disseminating best practices. Evaluation will involve tracking the preparation, retention, and impact of teaching fellows on student learning, with findings shared through workshops, conferences, and publications to benefit the wider STEM education community. This Track 2: Teaching Fellowship project is supported through the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program (Noyce). The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 STEM teachers and experienced, exemplary K-12 teachers to become STEM master teachers in high-need school districts. It also supports research on the effectiveness and retention of K-12 STEM teachers in high-need school districts.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
