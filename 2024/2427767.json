 "awd_abstract_narration": "In a collaboration between the NSF Eddie Bernice Johnson INCLUDES Initiative and the NSF Research Experience and Mentoring (REM) programs, EArly-concept Grants for Exploratory Research (EAGERs) are awarded under NSF Dear Colleague Letter 24-062 to broaden participation and develop the workforce in microelectronics through research experiences and structured mentoring. This project is developing a scalable, replicable model for microelectronics research and clean room training through Virtual Reality (VR)/Augmented Reality (AR) and experiential learning. Access to specialized facilities and equipment for microelectronics research is limited in many parts of the United States. The model that results from this project is expected to transform student training at universities that do not have access to clean rooms. An iterative AR/VR development process and summer research program, are being used to advance learning outcomes and training in microelectronics and semiconductor manufacturing.\r\n\r\nThis project promotes research and \u201cinnovative approaches to developing, improving, and expanding evidence-based education and workforce development activities and learning experiences at all levels of education in fields and disciplines related to microelectronics,\u201d in alignment with the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022. Funding for this project is provided by the NSF Directorate for Engineering.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
