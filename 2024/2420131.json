 "awd_abstract_narration": "The global decline of bee populations impacts the sustainability of agriculture and biodiversity, with substantial ecological and economic ramifications. The causes of these collapses are multifaceted, including parasites and viruses. The Bee Health and Ecology Research Objective (Bee-HERO) provides 18 U.S. undergraduate students from historically-marginalized groups with an international research experience studying bee parasites and viruses at The Centre for Honey Bee Research at the Swedish University for Agricultural Sciences. This project addresses systemic inequities in access to research experiences, which act as a barrier to retention and success of undergraduate students from historically under-represented groups in academic science, by creating opportunities for students to engage in international research exploring health threats to bee populations. To foster the development and success of every participant, each Bee-HERO student cohort engages in five program components as part of their IRES experience, which is designed to provide personalized mentorship, research training, and professional development. Bee-HERO students also gain valuable experience in science communication by presenting their findings to the public and to their academic peers at a scientific conference. They will also develop lasting personal and professional relationships to support their ongoing success and development via extended professional networks.  \r\n \r\nThe Centre for Honey Bee Research at the Swedish University for Agricultural Sciences is a premier bee research institute in Sweden. Notably, the center is home to a unique population of honey bees (Apis mellifera) that are resistant to the ectoparasitic mite (Varroa destructor) - one of the most significant global threats to honey bee health and beekeeping. Bee-HERO students conduct research in the laboratories of Drs. Barbara Locke Grand\u00e9r and Joachim de Miranda. Experiments within the Locke Grand\u00e9r lab focus on resistance mechanisms and host characteristics of the mite-resistant honey bee population. Experiments in the de Miranda lab focus on broader aspects of disease ecology across bee species by investigating what drives pathogen transmission among bees and the effects domestic bees have on wild bee populations. Bee-HERO projects have broad implications for bee health, including practical applications for managing domestic bee populations and understanding the effects of domestic bees on wild bee populations. As bees are a key pollinator, results are expected to have far-reaching implications for agriculture and ecology, as well as theoretical value for disease ecology and pathogen evolution. This program also contributes knowledge on the impact of international research experiences for undergraduate students from historically-marginalized groups on their interest and confidence in, and preparedness for, careers in STEM.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
