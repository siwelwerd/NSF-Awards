 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposal is used to support the Southeastern Logic Symposium (SEALS), an annual series of weekend conferences in mathematical logic held at University of Florida during the first weekend of March. In each installment of the series, the conference brings together researchers in two selected subfields of mathematical logic to foster cooperation and exchange of information. Each installment will host three senior plenary speakers and about 35 participants in the early stages of their career giving talks in two special sessions. There are satellite colloquium talks on the shoulders of the conference weekend as well, encouraging the participants to stay longer and cooperate on their research projects.\r\n\r\nThe proposal is used to support the Southeastern Logic Symposium (SEALS), an annual series of weekend conferences in mathematical logic held at University of Florida. In each installment of the series, the conference brings together researchers in two selected subfields of mathematical logic to foster cooperation and exchange of information. The paired subfields may include model theory/set theoretic dynamics, or descriptive set theory/computability, or choiceless set theory/Polish group actions. The target audience for the conference includes mainly researchers from advanced graduate students to postdocs to early career professors without personal travel grants. The website for the 2024 edition is https://people.clas.ufl.edu/r-tuckerdrob/seals-2024/\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
