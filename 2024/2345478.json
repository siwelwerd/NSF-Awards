 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of an Autonomous Underwater Robotics (AUR) system designed to enhance the management and sustainability of municipal drinking water infrastructure. By providing detailed inspection data for underground water pipe networks, the AUR system addresses the need for efficient, proactive maintenance strategies in the face of aging drinking water infrastructure. The commercial viability of the project is underscored by the potential to reduce the economic burden of water loss, which is estimated at $7.6 billion annually due to leaks, and $2.6 billion for emergency repairs. With a scalable solution that can locate leaks and assess pipe conditions before critical failures occur, this technology stands to support asset management within municipalities and water authorities, enabling smarter, data-driven decisions. The impact of the commercialized AUR technology can extend beyond the drinking water space to potentially include oil pipelines and pressurized sewer systems.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on the development of Autonomous Underwater Robot (AUR) technology that operates at scale in municipal water systems. The AUR system is adapted from gliding robotic fish, an underwater robot that combines features of robotic fish and an underwater glider to achieve high maneuverability and long-duration operations for environmental monitoring.  By efficiently detecting leaks, AURs enable water operators to pinpoint areas requiring immediate repair. This proactive approach could help conserve water and save costs for municipalities. Additionally, the AUR\u2019s capability to assess pipe thickness could aid in the preventative maintenance of thinning water mains and the resulting water loss and service disruptions for the community. The technology also enables the AUR to stay within the water pipe system beyond a hydrant-to-hydrant inspection segment, which allows for drinking water service to remain active during inspection and requires fewer regulatory approvals. Long-distance pipe inspections could reduce inspection related costs 70 \u2013 80%, allowing municipalities to manage drinking water assets and transfer cost savings to other capital projects.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
