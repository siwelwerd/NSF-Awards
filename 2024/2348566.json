 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will fund a conference on Asymptotics in Complex Geometry to be held at Northwestern University, March 7-10, 2024. The purpose of this conference is to gather experts in the field of complex geometry, to report and understand the recent exciting discoveries and techniques. A common theme will be asymptotic techniques, in complex and algebraic geometry. The conference will facilitate collaboration across diverse areas within this subject and will introduce the rapid developments in this area to a new generation of mathematicians.  The conference will be widely advertised to attract broad participation. \r\n\r\nIn recent years, there has been much progress, including several major breakthroughs, in complex geometry.  Much of this work lies at the intersection of two seemingly disparate fields:  nonlinear geometric PDE and algebraic geometry.  The existence of solutions to nonlinear PDEs in complex geometry, such as Kahler-Einstein metrics or constant scalar curvature Kahler metrics, is inextricably tied to algebro-geometric conditions involving subvarieties and algebraic degenerations.  At the heart of these deep correspondences are questions of asymptotics. This conference will bring together experts on a wide range of related topics: PDEs in complex geometry; Non-Archimedean geometry; K-stability of singularities; Pluripotential theory.   \r\nThe conference website is: https://sites.google.com/view/asymptotics/\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
