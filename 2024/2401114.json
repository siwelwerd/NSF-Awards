 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the past half century, cutting-edge discoveries in mathematics have occurred at the interface of three major disciplines: number theory (the study of prime numbers), representation theory (the study of symmetries using linear algebra), and geometry (the study of solution sets of polynomial equations). The interactions between these subjects has been particularly influential in the context of the Langlands program, arguably the most expansive single project in modern mathematical research. The proposed research aims to further these advances by exploring geometric techniques in representation theory, especially motivated by questions within the context of the Langlands conjectures. This project also provides research training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students.\r\n\r\nIn more detail, reductive algebraic groups over local fields (local groups) and their representations control the behavior of symmetries in the Langlands program. This project aims to develop connections between representations of local groups and two fundamental geometric constructions: Deligne-Lusztig varieties and character sheaves. Over the past decade, parahoric analogues of these geometric objects have been constructed and studied, leading to connections between (conjectural) algebraic constructions of the local Langlands correspondence to geometric phenomena, and thereby translating open algebraic questions to tractable problems in algebraic geometry. In this project, the PI will wield these novel positive-depth parahoric analogues of Deligne-Lusztig varieties and character sheaves to attack outstanding conjectures in the local Langlands program.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
