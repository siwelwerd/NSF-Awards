 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact of this I-Corps project is the development of a technology designed to enable fully autonomous drone charging. The autonomous system is created by developing a charging platform and adapting drone electronics for wireless charging. Autonomous wireless charging presents significant commercial opportunities across various sectors by enabling more efficient and independent drone operation. This technology can reduce labor costs and oversight in logistics and delivery services, agriculture, and emergency response services. The agricultural and delivery sectors are identified as first adopters due to their high maturity and technology readiness. Moreover, the ongoing deliberations about establishing regulatory frameworks for drone use are expected to open new opportunities for charger deployments. The autonomous charging technology and upcoming drone corridors can extend the drone reach and allow long-range and intercity drone flights. The high technology readiness level of the developed system makes it immediately deployable as soon as the commercial and legal framework is established. \r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translational potential of the technology. The solution is based on the development of a high-power wireless drone charger with an integrated charging platform localization and alignment system. The alignment mechanism identifies the drone's position in the platform and promptly begins the wireless charging process within 30 seconds. The designed power converters are based on highly efficient wide bandgap semiconductor devices, which lead to improved gravimetric power density and flight distance with a single charge. The unique approach utilizes wireless charging pads for drone detection, coil alignment, and power transfer, offering a robust solution and eliminating the need for complex alignment circuits. The 700-W fully autonomous wireless charging system is the highest-power-level charger designed with an integrated alignment mechanism that does not require an additional sensing system. The system can also be modified for standalone operation using renewable energy sources such as solar energy for remote deployment. This deployment can be especially helpful in remote areas where electrification still needs to be reached or the power grid may not be present or reliable.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
