 "awd_abstract_narration": "Traditional ultrasound imaging and sensing systems have limitations in resolution and specificity, often requiring direct contact with the medium under investigation through a coupling medium. However, in biomedical diagnosis, this direct contact can cause irritation, resulting in discomfort. As a scientific research tool, direct contact often leads to pollution of samples or inconvenience in operation. To address these issues, this project aims to develop integrated non-contact ultrasound generation and detection systems capable of achieving high-resolution and highly specified detection and imaging for biological functional imaging and biomechanical characterization. The developed non-contact systems can provide the scientific research and biomedical community with a very useful tool for specific biochemical and functional observations at a very small scale. The developed systems can also offer the tissue engineering community a non-contact and non-destructive method for characterizing the mechanical properties of their developed tissues. This project will provide research training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students and will promote the engagement and interest of high school students in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) through its outreach activities. \r\n\r\nThis project aims to develop and validate systems that integrate broadband ultrasound generation using both photoacoustic and air-coupled ultrasound techniques. These systems will incorporate a compact fiber optic Sagnac interferometer capable of multiband detection to accommodate different spatial resolution requirements and enable the detection of transverse ultrasound waves for biomechanical characterization of biological tissues. The integration of these non-contact ultrasound generation and detection techniques will enable non-contact tissue functional imaging with optical resolution, as well as non-contact biomechanical characterization of tissues. The research plan represents the first systematic study exploring the potential applications of a compact fiber optic Sagnac interferometer in biological tissue imaging. The compact fiber optic Sagnac interferometer could become a powerful, affordable, and attractive tool for enhancing biomedical diagnosis and research, offering improved accuracy and non-contact capabilities. Additionally, for the first time, this project investigates the feasibility of using the compact fiber optic Sagnac interferometer for multiband non-contact photoacoustic signal detection in biological tissue, particularly, in the ultra-high-frequency range, up to 400MHz. Success in this endeavor could replace the current expensive piezo-based single transducer in high-frequency ultrasound detection. Furthermore, the research plan introduces non-contact air-coupled ultrasound-induced transverse waves to evaluate cardiovascular path biomechanical properties, opening doors for engineered tissue mechanical characterization using this proposed non-contact ultrasound generation and detection technique.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
