 "awd_abstract_narration": "This joint proposal between the University of Minnesota, USA, Indian Institute of Technology at Ropar, and Indian Institute of Technology at Delhi, India under US- Meity program involves an international multidisciplinary team that proposes to develop semimetals quantum materials-based magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) for energy-efficient Stochastic Computing Computational Random-Access Memories (SC-CRAM) for applications in stochastic and neuromorphic computing.  Quantum materials with unconventional properties have recently captured the attention of the scientific community. These materials play a crucial role in the development of magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs), specialized devices that exploit their unique properties. MTJs are building blocks for memory and computing on a nanometer scale that can switch between different magnetic states. One of the exciting aspects of this project is the development of a new kind of computing technology, known as Stochastic Computing Computational Random-Access Memory (SC-CRAM) using these MTJs. This new computing technology promises to be much more efficient than what is currently available. The team will combine theoretical research, material synthesis (making the materials), and advanced manufacturing techniques to bring this vision to life. Overall, the project aims to push the boundaries of current computing technology, making future computing faster, more efficient, and capable of handling more complex tasks with less energy consumption. The outcome of our proposal will directly impact industries engaged in the development of technology for unconventional computing. It will also benefit society by expanding present computation beyond the limits of classical computers. The joint team will reach out to underrepresented groups including recruiting individuals of diverse backgrounds and cultivate a welcoming and vibrant work environment that promotes mutual respect, effectiveness, and professionalism. The joint team will continue mentoring high school and undergraduate students both in India and the US by offering summer projects and interactive public lectures. Online databases and short courses on quantum materials and unconventional computing will be built and offered. \r\n\r\nThe data handling and energy consumption of computing systems are growing exponentially at unsustainable levels. To address these challenges, new concepts and technologies need to be developed urgently. Unconventional computing is a broad and interdisciplinary field, encompassing various approaches with the common goal of expanding computation beyond the limits of classical computing paradigms. This proposal aims to address this urgent societal need by using the unique properties of quantum materials. The primary objective is to develop quantum materials-based magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) to implement energy-efficient computing paradigms. The goal is to surpass the constraints of traditional computing systems by introducing Stochastic Computing Computational Random-Access Memory (SC-CRAM), which will be built upon the foundation of quantum materials-based MTJs. A systematic and interdisciplinary approach will be employed, combining theoretical calculations, material synthesis techniques, and advanced fabrication methods. The aim is to understand fundamental aspects of quantum materials and spintronics and translate this knowledge into technological applications.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
