 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the support of the Chemical Catalysis Program in the Division of Chemistry, Professor Forrest Michael of the University of Washington is studying the development of new catalysts (catalysts are chemical additives that help a reaction occur or proceed more rapidly) for the construction of organic molecules. Many commonly employed reactions utilize transition metal based catalysts as the key active component; however, the relative cost, abundance, and toxicity of these species is a cause for concern. It is vitally important that new, less expensive and more sustainable catalysts are developed. Because of their much greater abundance and lower cost, the Michael group is studying underexplored chalcogen (sulfur, selenium, and tellurium) catalysts. These catalysts offer novel reactivity and selectivity when compared to more traditional transition metal systems. In addition to its impact on catalysis, this work is more broadly relevant because it is allowing small molecules that have novel biological, pharmaceutical, and materials properties to be accessed more sustainably. In addition to the broader impacts of the science, Professor Michael is also impacting education, mentoring, and training through his work with the Center for Excellence in Education and the Research Science Institute. These endeavors largely involve exposing domestic and international high school students to cutting-edge research in chemistry.\r\n\r\nWith the support of the Chemical Catalysis Program in the Division of Chemistry, Professor Forrest Michael of the University of Washington is studying the novel stoichiometric and catalytic properties of organochalcogen complexes for application in a variety of synthetic transformations. Structure-activity relationships, including investigations of the steric and electronic properties of ligated chalcogen species, are being evaluated. Through these efforts they are developing a much greater understanding of how ligand design can be used to influence key properties of a variety of potential catalytic intermediates. Several novel catalytic reactions are being developed in parallel with stoichiometric studies, including the introduction of simple basic amines into organic compounds via C-H activation and alkene addition reactions, as well as a new type of covalent phase transfer catalysis. Ultimately, this work will expand the range of catalytic activity enabled by organochalcogen species and allow for more sustainable synthesis of complex organic molecules.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
