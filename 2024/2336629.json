 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is a continuation of the successful CyberCorps Scholarship for Service project at the University of Alabama in Huntsville (UAH), J.C Calhoun Community College, and Northeast Alabama Community College. Thirty-two students will be awarded two-year or three-year scholarships to study in various cybersecurity related degree programs. After graduation, all scholarship recipients will be placed in Federal, local, state, or tribal government jobs related to cybersecurity and serve in government for a period equal to the length of their scholarships. UAH is designated a National Center of Academic Excellence in Cyber Defense Education (CAE-CD) and a Center of Academic Excellence in Cyber Research (CAE-R) by the National Centers of Academic Excellence in Cybersecurity (NCAE-C). \r\n\r\nSFS scholars at the three partner institutions will major in computer science, computer engineering, cybersecurity engineering, electrical engineering, or information systems at the bachelor\u2019s, master\u2019s, or Ph.D. level and will undertake a prescribed set of cybersecurity courses in their major. Students will also participate in the UAH Cyber Force Incubator program where they will work on research in partnership with federal partners at the US Army, Federal Bureau of Investigation, and Missile Defense Agency. Students will also be paired with mentors who are former recipients of scholarships. UAH Center for Cybersecurity Research and Education staff will work closely with students to help them find internships and post-graduation jobs that meet the placement requirements of the program.\r\n\r\nThis project is supported by the CyberCorps\u00ae Scholarship for Service (SFS) program, which funds proposals establishing or continuing scholarship programs in cybersecurity and aligns with the U.S. National Cyber Strategy to develop a superior cybersecurity workforce. Following graduation, scholarship recipients are required to work in cybersecurity for a federal, state, local, or tribal Government organization for the same duration as their scholarship support.\u202f\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
