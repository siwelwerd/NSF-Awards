 "awd_abstract_narration": "This conference is in response to NSF DCL 23-108 on Conferences on Clean Energy Topics. Wind energy is among the leading technologies to meet the global clean energy goals. As the market for onshore wind energy systems is maturing, development of offshore wind energy farms is emerging to be a new frontier for commercial deployment. This conference grant, Great Lakes Offshore Wind (GLOW) Energy-Research Assessment will benefit society through the scientific dissemination of knowledge towards renewable, sustainable, and clean energy in the United States Great Lakes region. The interdisciplinary research, from engineering to social science, will include methods for increased public scientific literacy and engagement, and the development of a diverse and globally competitive STEM workforce surrounding wind energy technologies. The outcomes of the conference will include new pathways for research and education that will improve collaboration among a diverse range of academic institutions, industry, and state agencies, including full participation of individuals underrepresented in STEM, including women, persons with disabilities, and tribal communities. Societal impacts also include improved STEM education and educator development, and enhanced infrastructure for research and education in relevant and interdisciplinary topics of sustainability and clean energy. \r\n\r\nThe GLOW workshop activities are aimed to advance knowledge and understanding in fields of electrical, marine, aerodynamic, structural, legal, regulatory, social, and environmental systems with a common goal to identify challenges that stand in the way of realizing offshore wind energy stems on the Great Lakes and formulate convergent research questions to overcome the challenges. All the research initiatives in the area of offshore wind energy have been focused on the west and east coastal region nationally, and in the North Sea region internationally. The Great Lakes region is a unique ecosystem with a vast potential for untapped wind energy resources. Many of the states that surround the great lakes are net energy importers. Thus, successful formulation and sustained research in the area will transform the energy economics of the region. The workshop will consist of virtual pre-conference thematic listening sessions followed by live sessions with a mix of presentations and active work sessions. Post-conference evaluation, review and refining of the whitepaper will serve as a touchstone to assess the success of the workshop.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
