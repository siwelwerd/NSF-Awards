 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will provide support for a \u201cCyber Physical Systems (CPS) Rising Stars\u201d workshop to be held in May 2024 at the Link Lab, a center of excellence in CPS within the University of Virginia\u2019s School of Engineering. The primary goal of the workshop is to identify and mentor outstanding Ph.D. students and recent PhD graduates who are interested in pursuing careers in CPS fields. A secondary but equally important goal of the workshop is to broaden participation in CPS by identifying CPS Rising Stars paying special attention to institutional diversity and non-traditional backgrounds in selection.\r\n\r\nThe workshop provides participants with insights about navigating the early stages of CPS careers, particularly in academia. Participants also have opportunities to share their research and to network with faculty in Link Lab and peer CPS Rising Stars from across the country. By attending this workshop, participants can initiate new collaborations with researchers and gain professional mentors that can support them in their career advancement. \r\n\r\nThis will be the third consecutive CPS Rising Stars Workshop hosted at the Link Lab. This year\u2019s workshop will be modeled after the two prior successful workshops. Taken together, the three workshops are impacting CPS by building a cadre of early career researchers in CPS. CPS Rising Stars are taking impactful positions in academia, government, and industry, positively impacting not only core CPS research but also a variety of domains that apply CPS principles to challenges facing society.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
