 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Improving Undergraduate STEM Education: Hispanic-Serving \r\nInstitutions (HSI Program), this Educational Instrumentation project at the University of \r\nHouston-Clear Lake will strengthen undergraduate learning in Mechanical Engineering, \r\nEngineering Physics, and Aerospace Engineering. Specifically, this project will secure a metal \r\nadditive manufacturing (AM) machine, which will allow students to: (i) be engaged in hands-on learning by incorporating metal AM technology into core engineering courses, such as Materials Science, Manufacturing Processes, Engineering Physics Design Project, Composite \r\nMaterials, Additive Manufacturing, and Senior Design/Capstone Projects, and (ii) to compete \r\nin state and national level design and manufacturing challenges. An estimated 180 students \r\nand six (6) faculty will utilize the project-funded equipment each year. In addition to \r\nproviding improved experiences in different engineering courses, the new equipment will \r\nalso be used to conduct undergraduate research on AM alloy development and extreme \r\nenvironment materials. This equipment will also facilitate manufacturing, prototyping, and \r\ncharacterization for senior design/capstone projects. \r\n\r\nThe goals of this project are to enrich the learning and experiences of undergraduate students \r\nby providing critical hands-on metal AM experiential learning experience in Mechanical\r\nEngineering, Engineering Physics, and Aerospace Engineering courses. The project will \r\ncontribute to the academic and manufacturing communities by producing educational and \r\nresearch content in metal 3D printing including design for manufacturing, principles of metal \r\nAM, process development strategies for AM, process-structure-property relationship in \r\nmetal AM, and applications. The findings will be disseminated through open-source lecture \r\ncontent, conferences, and publications, thereby advancing the state of knowledge in \r\nengineering education and AM that are critical for US manufacturing competitiveness in the \r\nglobal economy. The project will assess the impact of the project-funded equipment using \r\nthe milestones of (i) timely receipt and installation, (ii) number of faculty and student \r\ntraining, (iii) number of the developed hands-on projects using this 3D printer, (iv) support \r\nof senior design projects and student design challenges (v) tracking matrices such as usage \r\nlogs to maintain detailed logs of system usage, including hours of operation, types of projects, \r\nand number of users. This project is funded by the HSI Program, which aims to enhance\r\nundergraduate STEM education, broaden participation in STEM, and increase capacity to \r\nengage in the development and implementation of innovations to improve STEM teaching \r\nand learning at HSIs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
