 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Eleventh Annual Graduate Student Mini-conference in Computational Mathematics is held on April 20-21st, 2024 at the Clemson University campus in Clemson, South Carolina. Over approximately the past decade, the annual graduate student mini-conference has played a unique role in providing an accessible forum for graduate students to present their work within a supportive environment, establishing a setting that is conducive to collaboration, and supporting students in traditionally underrepresented groups. The Eleventh Graduate Student Mini-conference in Computational Mathematics aims at preserving this tradition and providing a comfortable forum for graduate students to share their recent research findings, network, and discuss emerging topics at the frontier of computational mathematics. This conference serves the interests of the United States by nurturing the next generation of mathematicians, scientists, and STEM workforce of the nation, and by promoting the progress of science.\r\n\r\nThe Eleventh Annual Graduate Student Mini-conference in Computational Mathematics will bring together a wide group of students and researchers in the field of computational and applied mathematics.  It focuses on emerging topics in the field of computational mathematics and cutting-edge interdisciplinary research connecting mathematics with other science and engineering disciplines. The conference is designed to provide a scientific research forum to graduate students for presenting their research findings and starting collaborations to advance their career opportunities. Funding from the NSF will help cover travel expenses for graduate students and plenary speakers of the conference. The conference organizers are committed to supporting the participation of graduate students, recent Ph.D.s, and researchers from underrepresented groups. The conference website is https://qingshanchen.github.io/miniconf2024/miniconference_2024.html\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
