 "awd_abstract_narration": "This new three-year REU Site: Interdisciplinary Research Experience for Undergraduates in Materials Science and Engineering at UTRGV is hosted by the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley (UTRGV) to support ten undergraduate students each year in cutting edge and comprehensive engineering research for 10 weeks. REU students will engage in hands-on learning experiences in materials science and engineering to enrich their skills in the interrelationship between structure-processing-properties and performance of materials and nano/biomaterials. One goal is to expand participants\u2019 knowledge and understanding of the technical aspects of research and use diverse materials in real applications. UTRGV offers students opportunities to experience immersive research in a highly relevant engineering discipline and located in a unique section of the country. Students will be encouraged to present their experimental results at local and national conferences. Participants will also explore advanced degree opportunities to further their education and research at Masters and Ph. D in materials science and engineering level.\r\n\r\nThis new three-year REU Site: Interdisciplinary Research Experience for Undergraduates in Materials Science and Engineering at UTRGV is hosted by the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley (UTRGV). This site focuses on research and scientific discovery in materials science and engineering and nano/biomaterials. The REU site is an interdisciplinary research program covering multiple areas related to materials science and engineering, such as polymers nanocomposites for device fabrication, carbon nanotubes, carbon nanofibers, nanocomposite brush for sensors and semiconductors, nanomaterials for Lithium-ion batteries and nano/biomaterials for biosensors and tissue engineering related applications. Students will learn how to use advanced characterization, synthesizing and fabrication techniques of materials and nano/biomaterials. Objectives of the project include strengthening participants\u2019 academic, research, technical writing and speaking, safety, and professional capabilities and interests; enhancing participants\u2019 understanding of academic ethics and improving their research skills; and improving the inclination and readiness to pursue graduate studies. Students will be encouraged to present their experimental results at local and national conferences. Participants will explore advanced degree opportunities to further their education and research at Masters and Ph. D in materials science and engineering level.\r\n\r\nThis Site is supported in part by funds provided to the National Science Foundation by the Semiconductor Research Corporation.\r\n\r\nThis project is supported in part by the HSI Program, which aims to enhance undergraduate STEM education, broaden participation in STEM, and build capacity at HSIs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
