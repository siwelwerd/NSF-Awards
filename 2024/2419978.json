 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Internet Society Symposium on Vehicle Security and Privacy (ISOC VehicleSec) is an emerging venue for research around new theories, technologies, and systems that address the security and privacy issues that arise as vehicles become increasingly autonomous and connected.  This award will support student travel to the 2nd edition of VehicleSec, to be held on February 26 in San Diego.  Funding this travel will allow students to share their knowledge, experience, and research work with internationally recognized researchers in vehicle security and privacy.\r\n\r\nThis grant will provide travel support to about 14 students who otherwise have limited travel funding and so might not be able to attend.  Criteria for selection include having the need for funding, being a first-time attendee, and having an accepted paper in the workshop or the co-located Network and Distributed System Security Symposium.  In alignment with the workshop's overall goal to bring together a variety of academic and industry researchers, the selection committee will also seek to fund students from a wide range of personal, professional, and institutional backgrounds.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
