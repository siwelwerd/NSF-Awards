 "awd_abstract_narration": "The southeastern region of Wisconsin is experiencing an increasing demand for skilled, younger workers in the manufacturing industry. In Kenosha, a city with a rich manufacturing history, efforts are being made to revive its once prosperous manufacturing industry through the development of the Kenosha Innovation Neighborhood (KIN). Currently, the KIN zip code has high unemployment rates, low socioeconomic status, and low educational attainment among its residents with a significant portion of the population being from groups underrepresented in STEM. To address these challenges, LakeView Technology Academy (LTA), a choice STEM high school in the Kenosha Unified School District (KUSD), will be relocating to the KIN. Gateway Technical College has already established a strong partnership with LTA, demonstrating its commitment to its expansion and relocation. As part of this collaboration, the college will occupy a dedicated space at LTA for technical education classes to benefit the local community. Additionally, Gateway will utilize the LTA classroom and lab facilities to offer dual credit programming to high school students in the KUSD. To meet the demands of the manufacturing industry, the college will introduce Computer Numerical Control (CNC) dual credit courses at LTA for all high school students in the KUSD. By actively recruiting students from economically disadvantaged areas, Gateway aims to enhance STEM education opportunities for a diverse population. This initiative aligns directly with the National Science Foundation's dedication to fostering a diverse and skilled workforce, contributing to national efforts in this field.\r\n\r\nThis project aligns with the national objectives of the ATE program, aimed at fostering economic growth and competitiveness through equitable access to high-quality education and training in cutting-edge technologies. Its primary aim is to cultivate a more inclusive and proficient workforce in manufacturing by offering CNC training and education to individuals from diverse backgrounds. The project's scope encompasses four key goals: (1) the successful implementation of Gateway Technical College\u2019s CNC pathway as dual credit courses at LakeView Technology Academy, (2) the recruitment of a diverse student body to the CNC pathway at LakeView Technology Academy, (3) the provision of work-based learning experiences to all students in Gateway\u2019s CNC pathway at LakeView Technology Academy, and (4) the provision of comprehensive support to new program students, including guidance, resources, and exposure, as they navigate their technical education and career paths. The relocation of LakeView Technology Academy to the Kenosha Innovation Network signifies a significant step towards revitalizing the manufacturing industry in Kenosha. By offering access to STEM education and valuable work experiences, this project seeks to empower underrepresented students and equip them with the requisite skills for successful careers in the manufacturing sector. Through this endeavor, we aim to garner further insights into the efficacy of inclusive education practices in technical fields and identify strategies to advance diversity and equity in STEM education and industries. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced technology fields that drive the nation\u2019s economy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
