 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mechanical resonators are fundamental components in diverse demanding applications, including smartphones, telecommunications, medical devices, and quantum information technologies. Their ability to adapt dynamically to a wide range of frequencies, signals, external stimuli, and conditions is essential, making tunability a key driver for the next leap in technological innovation. This research investigates an innovative resonator with superior tunability, far exceeding the current capabilities. The broadband resonator will enable the sensing and exploration of devices operating under thermal fluctuations, where traditional theories break down. These advancements will contribute to fundamental research, the semiconductor industry, and national security. This project will also provide multidisciplinary scientific training at the intersections of nanotechnology, mechanics, electronics, manufacturing, and materials, nurturing the future American scientific and engineering workforce. Research findings will be integrated into various undergraduate and graduate courses and enrich the NSF-funded Nanotechnology Undergraduate Education program at SUNY Binghamton.\r\n\r\nMicro- and nanoscale mechanical resonators are transforming numerous technology arenas, from physical, chemical, and biological sensing and signal processing to communication and quantum computing. However, existing mechanical resonators suffer from less-than-desired frequency tunability, partially due to built-in strain from the manufacturing process. This project will investigate an innovative nano-opto-electro-mechanical resonator with frequency tunability orders of magnitude higher than current benchmarks. The superior tunability of the resonator will be achieved by engineering the strain of its ultrathin nanomechanical resonating element across a broad range, down to a strain-free state. The broadband tunability will be studied using micro-electromechanical actuation and nano-optomechanical transduction techniques. Pushing the boundaries of resonator adjustability will facilitate advanced adaptive sensing. Leveraging the unique capabilities of the broadband tunable sensing platform, this research will also explore how the ultrathin resonator\u2019s performance is modulated by thermal fluctuations, which remains at an early stage of understanding. This new knowledge will transform the design and understanding of micro/nanodevices using atomically thin materials.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
