 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) through Targeted Infusion Projects supports the development, implementation, and study of evidence-based, innovative models and approaches for improving the preparation and success of HBCU undergraduate students so that they may pursue science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) graduate programs and/or careers. The goal of this project is to enhance undergraduate computer science education at Winston-Salem State University (WSSU) using the integration of esports as a tool for cultural expression and innovation.\r\n\r\nThe project aims to accomplish this goal by 1) creating a cutting-edge esports lab; 2) developing five esports-infused modules for the computer science curriculum and an esports educational game; 3) hosting game development workshops, organizing esports tournaments, and developing a guest speaker series; and 4) facilitating faculty workshops. This initiative will strengthen computer science education at the institution, and enhance the enrollment, retention and graduate rates of students pursuing computer science degrees. In addition, the research study is designed to test and assess the impact of the esports-infused modules on student learning experiences in the computer science program at WSSU. This project will lead to the better preparation of students for careers in the competitive fields of esports and computer science and address the national shortage of skilled professionals in these fields.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
