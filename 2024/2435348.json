 "awd_abstract_narration": "Technician education is centered on providing hands-on, practical training closely simulating real-world scenarios. Faculty who teach in technician education programs are at the forefront of educating a rapidly expanding workforce, while simultaneously facing the challenge of meeting the needs of an existing workforce that is rapidly aging out. These dynamics underscore the demand for innovation and effective teaching methods catering to a new generation of learners while ensuring the transfer of knowledge and skills from experienced technicians. Traditional educational methodologies and digital tools struggle to stay apace of industry, and may fail to provide the immersive, hands-on experience central for preparing the next generation of technicians. X-Reality (XR), which includes Augmented and Virtual Reality (AR and VR), has the potential to reshape the approach technician education. This collaborative project (KonnectXR) will develop an enterprise-level platform optimized for educational systems and make it available to educators across the nation. \r\n\r\nKonnectXR will bridge connecting traditional learning management systems (LMS) with the immersive world of XR. By incorporating Single-Sign On (SSO) capabilities, the platform will allow instructors and students to transition smoothly between their learning management system (LMS) and individual or collaborative XR environments and will mimic moving between classrooms and labs in a physical school. A focus on Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)-compliant encryption will address the critical need for data security in an increasingly digital educational sphere. The project goals address the need to improve technician education through accelerated integration of XR technology into the technician classroom. Four goals guide the project team. First, is to integrate Single Sign-On (SSO) capabilities with FERPA-compliant encryption that implements Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI) protocol 1.3 to enable seamless LMS interoperability, with testing against Blackboard, Canvas, and D2L Brightspace. Second, is to develop and validate a multi-user networking framework to support at least 50 simultaneous users with sub-25ms latency. Third, is to create and implement six XR lab experiences in four ATE domains that incorporate Universal Design for Learning (UDL) principles, plus six accompanying tutorials and associated instructor implementation resources. Fourth, is to conduct user experience research studies with 30 instructors and 100 students to analyze effectiveness and refine the design to maximize accessibility and adoption. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
