 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many trace elements (TEs) such as iron are required for the growth of phytoplankton in the ocean, and their availability can limit biological production. One important pathway by which these scarce elements are delivered to surface ocean waters is through aerosol particles in the atmosphere. This project will address important questions about the variability in the atmospheric delivery of iron and other TEs to the surface waters of the North Atlantic Ocean near Bermuda through aerosol sampling, laboratory experiments, and modeling. Increased accuracy of atmospheric deposition and aerosol iron solubility representation will improve global biogeochemical models and our understanding of how changes in climate may influence the marine carbon cycle through changes in atmospheric iron deposition. The project will provide opportunities for undergraduate and graduate student involvement and support an early-career scientist. Data will be posted on the BCO-DMO website and made widely available to scientists working in similar fields by being included in the SCOR Working Group 167 (Reducing Uncertainty in Soluble aerosol Trace Element Deposition) data compilation. \r\n\r\nThis project will conduct a two-year time-series of size-fractionated aerosol sampling at the Tudor Hill Marine Atmospheric Observatory in Bermuda to accomplish four goals: \r\n1.\tAnalyze temporal variations in the size distribution of aerosol Fe and other bioactive, pollutant, and tracer TEs, as well as major cations and anions over the western North Atlantic Ocean and link these variations to aerosol sources and transport pathways. \r\n2.\tApply a range of chemical extractions to size-fractionated and bulk North Atlantic aerosols to quantify lower and upper estimates of potentially bioavailable Fe and explain trends in bulk aerosol Fe solubility in the context of variations observed in size-fractionated aerosols. \r\n3.\tUse elemental ratios, Fe stable isotopes, Fe-mineralogical partitioning and redox state, and air mass back trajectories to directly probe the chemical controls on aerosol Fe solubility as a function of aerosol particle size and source over a two-year period. \r\n4.\tParameterize concurrently measured meteorological conditions to model deposition velocities for each aerosol size-fraction during weekly sampling periods, thereby constraining supply rates of total and soluble TEs to North Atlantic surface waters. \r\nThe results of this study will provide a deeper understanding of the factors influencing trace element solubility in North Atlantic aerosols and the role that aerosol size distribution plays in these variations. Rates of dry deposition calculated using size-fractionated aerosol collections will give a better understanding of the potential overestimation of bioavailable trace element supply rate that may arise from previous calculations based solely on bulk aerosol concentrations. This project will thus improve representation of atmospheric trace element solubility and deposition flux in global and regional deposition models.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
