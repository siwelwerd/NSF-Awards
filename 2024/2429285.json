 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact of this I-Corps project is the development of a drug discovery research tool. Currently, drug discovery research relies on animal testing of the potential new drugs. This technology is designed to simulate the human tumor microenvironment and reduce reliance on animal testing.  The solution closely mimics human physiological responses, and may offer an alternative for drug testing, reducing the need for testing in animal models and addressing ethical concerns in research. In addition, this technology may enhance drug efficacy and safety assessments, leading to more successful therapeutic outcomes and reducing the time and cost of the drug development processes.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. The solution is based on the development of microfluidic cell culture technology that creates dual-gel cell culture matrices. The goal is to create a drug discovery research tool to enable the study of cellular responses under conditions that closely mimic those in human tissues including tumor tissues. This cell culture device enables individual control of relevant biophysical properties of the matrices, including flow induced stresses on cells.  The device also allows for co-culture of two or more types of cells with a well-controlled number ratio and spatial distribution. This technology may facilitate a deeper understanding of how drugs interact with tumor cells, providing critical insights that could lead to more targeted and effective cancer treatments.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
