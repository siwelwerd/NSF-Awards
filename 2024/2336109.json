 "awd_abstract_narration": "The United States (U.S.) has a significant shortfall of highly trained cybersecurity professionals entering the government workforce, which has direct impacts on the security of the nation. The University of Arizona (UArizona) is uniquely positioned to train expert information security professionals who can synergistically leverage artificial intelligence (AI) methods, principles, and techniques to proactively tackle and automate emerging cybersecurity challenges. The UArizona project will  renew and redefine the AZSecure AI for Cybersecurity (AI4Cyber) SFS program to further expand and develop training of service motivated students to be critical public defenders of America\u2019s cyberspace. Scholars will be trained with  innovative multidisciplinary curriculum and collaborative research efforts. They will be prepared to  fulfill their U.S. Government Service protecting the nation against cyber-crime and cyber-disruptions. The scholars will obtain their graduate degrees in Management Information Systems (MIS), Cybersecurity, Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) or Computer Science (CS). \r\n\r\nThe AZSecure AI4Cyber SFS program will fuse advanced graduate research to education and experiential learning through advanced graduate research to train cybersecurity professionals in AI4Cyber methods. The cross-disciplinary curriculum includes dedicated cybersecurity and AI coursework taught by world-class faculty mentors. Furthermore, the AZSecure AI4Cyber program will build an AI4SFS community by contributing meaningful curriculum, producing skilled cybersecurity professionals, fostering AI4Cyber faculty, and through the dissemination of AI4Cyber materials via publications, tools, and presentations for other SFS institutions. The AZSecure AI4Cyber SFS program renewal will support the building of a community of cybersecurity professionals committed to the protection of American cyberspace. To improve diversity in the science and technology sectors, the UArizona AZSecure AI4Cyber SFS program will promote inclusion by recruiting underrepresented minorities (URMs), women, and military personnel. This renewal will help to establish a sustained, institutionalized cybersecurity education program with profound benefits for both Arizona and the nation. Utilizing Arizona's unique position, which includes a higher proportion of Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs) and a notable number of military bases compared to many other states, the program intends to draw from a varied and skilled pool of candidates.  The program's recruitment strategies are focused on significantly improving diversity in both the qualified applicant pool and a corresponding percentage of the accepted SFS scholarship recipients.\r\n\r\nThis project is supported by the CyberCorps\u00ae Scholarship for Service (SFS) program, which funds proposals establishing or continuing scholarship programs in cybersecurity and aligns with the U.S. National Cyber Strategy to develop a superior cybersecurity workforce. Following graduation, scholarship recipients are required to work in cybersecurity for a federal, state, local, or tribal Government organization for the same duration as their scholarship support.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
