 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 2024 IEEE-EMBS International Conference on Biomedical and Health Informatics (BHI\u201924) is a premier flagship conference sponsored by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBS), focusing on informatics and computing in healthcare and life sciences. BHI\u201924 will take place from November 10 to 13, 2024, in Houston, Texas. The theme of BHI\u201924 is \u201cDeep Medicine and AI for Health.\u201d It will provide a unique platform for cross-disciplinary researchers to showcase their research on big data analytics and machine learning addressing challenges in biomedicine. An important mission of BHI\u201924 is to promote the participation and engagement of undergraduate and graduate students, especially women and students from under-represented groups. The NSF Student Travel Award will support this goal by providing travel awards to qualified students, especially encouraging students from under-represented groups and those who lack funds to attend the conference.\r\n\r\nWith NSF support, the investigator expects to provide travel awards to approximately 20 student participants to encourage their attendance at BHI\u201924. The conference will offer student awardees opportunities to present their research, expand their knowledge, network with world-class researchers, and broaden their collaborations. Additionally, participants will have access to keynote speeches from world-renowned researchers, career and technology panels, special sessions, workshops, and tutorials. The investigator will particularly promote diversity and equity by aiming to allocate at least 25% of the awards for students from under-represented groups (women, African American, Hispanic, economically disadvantaged, and others) and first-time attendees to the conference.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
