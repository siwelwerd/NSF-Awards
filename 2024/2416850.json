 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Georgia has a dynamic program for broadening participation and R/V Savannah plays an important role. Broader impacts of the proposal are connected to student engagement in research and education activities on board in support of a variety of NSF, NOAA, EPA and institutionally funded programs. The vessel also supports engagement with the public through dock-side tours and open house events, including an annual Marine Science Day that attracts approximately 2500 participants. The ship serves as a host for a two-day NSF-funded REU cruise for students from Savannah State University and universities nationwide.\r\n\r\nR/V Savannah is a local class research vessel Owned by the University of Georgia, Skidaway Institute of Oceanography. The ship is a multipurpose research vessel that has been designated a University National Oceanographic Laboratory System vessel and is a member of the U.S. Academic Research Fleet (ARF). R/V Savannah is ideal for biological, chemical, physical, and geological oceanographic studies in estuarine and continental shelf waters throughout the southeastern US Atlantic and Gulf Coasts. https://www.skio.uga.edu/marine-ops-2/rv-savannah-2/.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
