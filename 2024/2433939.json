 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Computing in Undergraduate Education (CUE) Pathways project is a partnership led by Miami Dade College, Houston Community College, and Maricopa County Community College District, in collaboration with a network of school districts and industry partners. The goal of this collaboration is to improve underrepresented students\u2019 entry access to artificial intelligence (AI) degrees from community colleges by developing scalable strategies that support high school students and adult learners. The project will establish entry pathways into AI education and best practices on how to recruit, retain, complete and transition underrepresented students in AI programs. The broader impacts of the project include the dissemination and adaptation of pedagogical practices, strategic initiatives, and academic entry pathways with other institutions of education committed to advancing knowledge and implementing practical applications to broaden participation of underrepresented students in AI fields of study. Pedagogical expertise and college program preparation frameworks for the emerging and rapidly changing AI workforce is replicable and sustainable at other institutions working with underrepresented populations including high school students and adult learners.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this CUE Pathways project will be accomplished through the following objectives: (1) to develop and disseminate an AI Framework for high school students to be adequately engaged and prepared for a two-year AI degree program at a community college.; (2)  to develop and implement an AI Teacher Academy to train high school teachers on properly preparing underrepresented students for educational pathways and careers in AI; (3) to adequately engage underrepresented and underserved high school students in academic AI-related activities including camps and dual enrollment courses as an entry pathway to community college AI degree programs; and (4) to implement strategies to support underrepresented and underserved adult learners joining two-year AI programs at community colleges. This goal and objectives will be met via the following activities: high school AI Framework development and dissemination; AI Teacher Academy development and implementation; camps; dual enrollment; AI Readiness training; and faculty professional development.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
