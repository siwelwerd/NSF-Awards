 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Conference on Enumerative and Algebraic Combinatorics will take place at the University of Florida in Gainesville, Florida, February 25-27, 2024. The conference will feature 25 invited and contributed talks by leading researchers in the field as well as a poster session. By bringing together those working in both the Enumerative and Algebraic Combinatorics communities, attending researchers will have ample opportunity to learn about recent developments and develop new mathematics.\r\n\r\nThe aims of the conference are to present outstanding recent developments in both enumerative and algebraic combinatorics, with a particular focus on their overlap. Specific topics will include standard Young tableaux, permutations, partially ordered sets, symmetric functions, lattice paths, and compositions, all of which are amenable to both enumerative and algebraic study.  For more information see the conference web page: https://combinatorics.math.ufl.edu/conferences/sagan2024/\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
