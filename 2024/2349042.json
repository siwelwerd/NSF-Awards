 "awd_abstract_narration": "Boise State University will offer a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site which will provide students with meaningful and impactful learning and research experiences, concentrating specifically on blockchain technology and its applications in security. Blockchain technology is undergoing a fundamental shift in the way information is stored, secured, and distributed. This groundbreaking technology has the potential to not only improve the safety and security of established societal processes but also to enable the creation of entirely new systems that were previously inconceivable. The diverse applications of blockchain extend across various domains, encompassing decentralized identity management, securing supply chains through end-to-end traceability, and enhancing the security of health information systems for medical providers. This project is designed to achieve three key objectives. First, it aims to prepare students for collaborative research, fostering their professional development by emphasizing the acquisition of skills essential for effective teamwork and cooperative problem-solving. Second, the program seeks to cultivate a robust and diverse pool of applicants who possess the knowledge, skills, and expertise required to emerge as future leaders in the field of blockchain technology. Finally, the project aims to contribute to the development of the next generation of computer scientists by actively promoting the involvement of qualified individuals from underrepresented groups in STEM. \r\n\r\nThroughout the REU program, participants will be introduced to the fundamental principles and operational aspects of blockchain technology. The approach involves engaging 10 participants every year in collaborative, team-based research with the goal of exploring and prototyping innovative solutions to the technical challenges that currently limit the full potential of blockchain. Dissemination strategies encompass making instructional and evaluation materials available on the project website under a creative commons license. Additionally, reporting on the REU process and student outcomes will take place at academic conferences and in academic journals specific to computer science, including computer science education, social science, and education disciplines.\r\n\r\nThis project is jointly funded by the NSF CISE REU Program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
