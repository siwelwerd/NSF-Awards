 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support the 2024 Signal Transduction in Engineered Extracellular Matrices Gordon Research Conference and Seminar; Southern New Hampshire University, Manchester, New Hampshire; 20-26 July 2024, which builds on prior Gordon Research Conferences (GRC) and Gordon Research Seminars (GRS) on Signal Transduction by Engineered Extracellular Matrices (STEEM) to explore questions that will define the next decade of work in engineered microenvironments for next-generation biology, disease modeling, and therapeutics. Conference session topics include how the field can combine mechanics and molecular reporters to create living/dynamic materials; develop bio-instructive materials capable of understanding cell heterogeneity and cell death mechanisms; exploit multi-scale modeling and systems biology to predict material and cell coevolution; and determine the influence of sex and ancestry on cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) signaling.\r\n\r\nOver the past quarter-century, the GRC and GRS on Signal Transduction by Engineered Extracellular Matrices (STEEM) has served as the premier venue for sharing and discussing cutting-edge developments in ECM science and engineering. The objectives of the 2024 GRC include: (i) Be a forum in which information and ideas are freely exchanged between researchers of diverse and complementary backgrounds to discuss the emerging technologies at the interface of materials and cells. (ii) Support a diverse set of young and early career investigators by exposing them to new and exciting ideas and opportunities in an environment that encourages collegial interactions. (iii) Bring together scientists across all experience levels, from trainees to senior scientists, and represent diverse fields of expertise and professional settings, from academic labs to national labs to small and large biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, to foster meaningful, long-lasting collaborations and (iv) Encourage lasting collegial interactions and initiation of collaborations between young, mid-career, and senior investigators of diverse fields. The conference will broaden participation from diverse audiences and will provide networking opportunities to both early career scientists and scientists historically underrepresented in the field.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
