 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of California San Diego (UCSD)'s Scripps Institute of Oceanography (SIO) will host a Research Expereince for Undergraduates (REU) Site. The REU program will bring ten undergraduates to SIO each summer for three years. The program is a 10-week summer program that invites undergraduate students from across the country. Program components include a comprehensive research project, research seminars, professional development workshops, field trips, and participation in a research symposium. The primary goal of this REU site is to attract and retain a diverse pool of talented undergraduate students in marine and earth science and related fields. After the summer internship, the students will also be encouraged and supported to present at a national research conference. The program will pilot a remote participation model for students with on-site accessibility issues.\r\n\r\nThe breadth of ocean-related sciences at Scripps makes it accessible to students from practically all science and engineering disciplines, including physics, chemistry, geology, mathematics, ecology, physiology, molecular/biotechnology, environmental sciences and technology/computer science. Examples of possible research topics include: examining seismic data from a variety of offshore and onshore locations to assess potential earthquake triggers; investigating how marine microbes obtain the chemical nutrients they need from seawater; using data from cooperative fisheries partners to understand the dynamics of sensitive species; using modern tools to understand global dust transport; using historical data to understand the dynamics of Earth\u2019s magnetic dynamo; looking at the impact of subglacial freshwater discharge on grounding line and ice shelf stability; using remotely sensed data to better understand polar ocean currents; data assimilation and inverse problems in Earth science; using cutting edge technology to better understand aerosol transfer between the ocean and the atmosphere; investigating how microbial interactions present opportunities to ameliorate anthropogenic impacts in marine environments. Students receive a stipend, travel funding to attend the program and housing for the duration of the program. Students may receive support to present their research at scientific conferences. The goal of this REU site is to attract and retain a diverse pool of talented undergraduate students in marine and earth science and related fields.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
