 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal supports the 57th annual Spring Topology and Dynamical Systems conference (STDC), hosted this year at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte.   The conference encourages participation from a broad spectrum of mathematicians at different career levels and diverse backgrounds and implements a recruitment strategy that starts with establishing a diverse cohort of session organizers.  Elements of the conference include providing pathways to including mathematicians into the community, such as dissemination of results through the conference affiliated journal Topology Proceedings.   Conference funds will be used to support graduate students and early career participants, as well as established mathematicians without other sources of travel support and invited speakers.\r\n\r\nThe 57th STDC will be the latest in an annual series that began in 1967 and will continue its tradition of bringing together researcher from the around the world and from a range of currently active areas of topology.  Over the years, the conference has structured itself around a core of special sessions representing strands of topology-related fields of interest.  The 57th STDC will feature sessions focused on Continuum Theory, Dynamical Systems, Geometric Group Theory, Geometric Topology, and Set-Theoretic Topology.  More information about the conference is available at: https://pages.charlotte.edu/stdc2024/.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
