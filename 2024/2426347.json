 "awd_abstract_narration": "Plant breeding is pivotal in addressing the three priorities for U.S. agriculture: plant health, production, and products; food safety, nutrition, and health; and bioenergy, natural resources, and the environment. Developing improved plant breeding practices is crucial for overcoming future agricultural challenges, including climate variability and the need for secure, sustainable, and nutritious food supplies. Each year, the National Association of Plant Breeders (NAPB) holds an annual conference that highlights cutting edge interdisciplinary research and the methodologies and technologies applied by today's plant breeders. In addition, this meeting seeks to educate young scientists on the latest methods for developing sustainable plants and provide a platform for networking and collaborations, ensuring that discoveries translate into commercially relevant products with real-world impact. NSF funds will be used to provide travel awards to students and early career investigators, especially those from underrepresented groups in STEM, to participate in the annual NAPB conference to be held July 21-25, 2024, in St. Louis (MO). \r\n\r\nThe 2024 NAPB Annual Conference will serve as a dynamic platform for scientists and professionals from diverse backgrounds to present research findings, network, discover cutting- edge research, and foster collaborations. By championing diversity and inclusion, the conference aims to enrich the plant breeding community with a broader range of perspectives, fostering more innovative research and improved agricultural practices. The event is poised to make significant strides in advancing the field of plant breeding, addressing key agricultural challenges, and cultivating a collaborative and inclusive community, thereby contributing to global food security and sustainable agricultural practices.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
