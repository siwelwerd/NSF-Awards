 "awd_abstract_narration": "Researchers and practitioners from multiple disciplines have drawn on the theory of contextual integrity to address challenging privacy issues. More recent efforts in contextual integrity include operationalizing contextual integrity and what it means, discovering contextual norms for privacy, capturing users' privacy expectations in varied contexts, as well to analyze regulations and using contextual integrity to establish research ethics guidelines. Given the breadth of interests, perspectives and challenges, it is important to bring this diverse community of researchers using contextual integrity together to discuss what has been learned from the projects using contextual integrity theory and how to move forward to leverage contextual integrity for enhancing privacy preserving systems and policies.\r\n\r\nThis project funds travel for the sixth Annual Symposium of Applications of Contextual Integrity that assembles computer scientists, engineers, legal scholars, social scientists and ethicists to foster communication between the various communities of researchers and practitioners using the theory of contextual integrity as a framework to reason about privacy. The Symposium develops new collaborative interdisciplinary research partnerships around the theory of contextual integrity between existing communities in industry, academia, and government, and establishes a body of significant literature for future work on privacy enhancing systems. The Symposium also broadens participation in computing by providing travel grant awards and in-person mentoring opportunities to a diverse set of students with financial need from a wide range of institutions and demographics.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
