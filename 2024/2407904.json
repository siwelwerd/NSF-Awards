 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is jointly supported by the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) and the Chemistry Research Instrumentation (CRIF) programs. Illinois State University is acquiring a a single crystal X-ray diffractometer (SC-XRD) with a micro-focused Cu source and 80 K to 400 K variable temperature sample control capabilities to support the research of Professor Gregory M. Ferrence along with colleagues Christopher G. Hamaker. This instrument facilitates research in the areas of organic, organometallic, and metalorganic (coordination) chemistry. In general, an X-ray diffractometer allows accurate and precise measurements of the full three-dimensional structure of a molecule, including bond distances and angles, and provides accurate information about the spatial arrangement of a molecule relative to neighboring molecules. The research facilitated by the instrument has profound broader impacts in that it enhances the education of a large population of ISU Chemistry students in courses spanning the curriculum, including undergraduates, graduate students, and high school teachers. The instrument also supports early career faculty and the new instrument will enhance the profile and impact of their research, leading to increased production and retention of faculty. By encouraging their participation, the team will attract additional external users which will only be feasible with the new instrument\u2019s reduced collection times.\r\n\r\nThe award is aimed at enhancing molecular structure and crystal engineering research and education at all levels. The SCXRD system features a copper micro-source paired with a high-performance area detector and equipped with variable temperature control. The acquisition of an instrument with Cu radiation will allow unambiguous absolute structure determination, an important advancement for many of the instrument users, and the high-performance area detector will facilitate measurements on wide ranging crystals in terms of atomic content, micron sized samples, and weakly diffracting specimens, in many cases requiring an hour or less for an individual data set collection.  Variable temperature capability paired with data collection speed will allow examination of both thermal affects on crystals as well as the measurement of kinetics of solid-state transformations.  In addition, the new SCXRD will also allow their (PI, co-PI, internal and external collaborators\u2019) research students to maximize their research experiences. Contrary to large blocks of time required for synthesis, SCXRD workflow can be relatively easily \u2018chunked\u2019 to mesh, in particular, with undergraduate students\u2019 intense course loads and complex schedules. Accommodating \u2018modern\u2019 students provides the opportunity to engage a more diverse student population, which enhances production of impactful research and quality of student education. The shorter data collection times will also make it practical to include data collection as well as data analysis into laboratory courses.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
