 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Division of Chemistry and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) Dr. Gayan B. Wijeratne at the University of Alabama at Birmingham will investigate the chemistry of small molecules with heme iron centers such as the ones that activate oxygen in human biology. These model systems can be extremely versatile, yet straightforward probes for comprehending the complicated mechanistic details that govern oxygen mediated reactivities in biology. Dr. Wijeratne and his team will utilize these powerful tools in shedding light on yet unknown knowledge that can lead to pathways for efficient syntheses of complex molecules, and the discovery of catalysts that can enhance the efficiency of catalysts of oxygen reduction benefiting alternative energy applications. This work will involve bio-inspired design and synthesis of fresh model systems that combine organic and inorganic synthetic toolkits, and analyses of reactivities that draw parallels to biological functionalities. As well, a broad variety of cryogenic spectroscopic tools will be employed, offering a uniquely specialized skillset to contributing high-school, undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral researchers. Outreach and educational aspects of this project will involve the orientation of Birmingham City high school students toward Regional Science Fair via a newly designed Science Club program. Proposed efforts will strive to bridge the gap of scientific literacy of youngsters in the City of Birmingham, which is one of the most income-segregated school districts in the country.   \r\n\r\nHeme-containing dioxygenases play pivotal roles in human physiology, disease progression, and aging, consequently attracting substantial research interests within the past decade. However, exact mechanistic details concerning these are only faintly understood. Heme superoxide adducts are presumed to be active oxidants in heme dioxygenases, however, details pertaining to their definitive involvement in the actual enzymatic mechanism remain elusive. Synthetic model systems have long-served as powerful tools in addressing such mechanistic ambiguities, but synthetic heme superoxide adducts are often found to be sluggish oxidants. This anomaly calls for revaluation of explicit modeling of synthetic systems with direct relevance to their biological mode of action. Comprehension of mechanistic details of such model systems can also be of direct benefit for the design of superior synthetic methodologies targeting important complex organic molecules and homogeneous dioxygen reduction catalysts to be used in alternative energy applications. Proposed research will address this gap in knowledge by generating a library of synthetic heme superoxide model systems with divergent structural properties, and thorough investigation into how such structural modulations would influence their reactivity signatures. This work will vertically advance the fundamental understanding of reactivity-governing geometric, electronic, and non-covalent structural properties of mid-valent heme-oxygen intermediates, introducing a new era of heme-oxygen model chemistry. Outreach activities of this project will directly benefit the majority of underrepresented high schoolers in the Birmingham, Alabama area through cutting-edge research opportunities and high-quality one-on-one mentoring opportunities geared toward strengthening their preparatory phase for Regional Science Fair.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
