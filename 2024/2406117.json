 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) through Targeted Infusion Projects supports the development, implementation, and study of evidence-based, innovative models and approaches for improving the preparation and success of HBCU undergraduate students so that they may pursue science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) graduate programs and/or careers. The goal of this project is to improve understanding of artificial intelligence's (AI) mathematical foundations and the incorporation of AI concepts in a classroom setting at Alabama State University.\r\n\r\nThe project aims to accomplish this goal through three primary activities: 1) Develop, educate, and evaluate new AI courses that immerse students in current methods through hands-on learning; 2) Establish an AI laboratory and involve students and faculty in AI research; and 3) Foster early exposure and interest in AI among high school students. The project idea of integrating AI ideas into mathematics and computing courses coupled with practical research experiences with faculty and industry professionals will provide students with a strong mathematical foundation to comprehend and use AI in practical problem-solving scenarios. The project will also evaluate the influence of AI courses on student learning and employment. By equipping students with these advanced skills, the project will expand the nation\u2019s AI workforce and broaden participation in the STEM workforce.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
