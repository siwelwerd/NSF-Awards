 "awd_abstract_narration": "This travel grant will provide opportunities to students for attending the 4th International Conference on Smart Grid Synchronized Measurements and Analytics (SGSMA) 2024 that will be hosted by The George Washington University in Washington DC in the Spring of 2024. It is anticipated that the subsidy provided through this grant will significantly increase the number of US students participating in the conference. The student program will include tours of local attractions in the area, competition of data anomaly and event detection, Ph.D. Dissertation competition, paper, panel, and tutorial sessions. Measures will be taken to encourage the participation of women and minority students.\r\n\r\nSGSMA 2024 is unique in that it is a one-of-a-kind international conference with a strong focus on synchronized measurements in electric power systems, applications, and analytics. The event will be planned with multiple student-focused events. Attendees will get the opportunity to present their research, and also learn about each other's work and have a broad perspective on the main research topics that are being studied in the community. It will also provide attendees with ample opportunities for professional networking with the power system industry.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
