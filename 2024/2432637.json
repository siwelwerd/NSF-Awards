 "awd_abstract_narration": "Semiconductors are fundamental to modern technology, driving advancements in fields such as communication, healthcare, and national security. To maintain global competitiveness in the semiconductor industry, the U.S. must cultivate a skilled and diverse workforce. However, many young individuals, particularly those who are neurodivergent, lack opportunities to engage with the foundational elements of electronics in a hands-on and creative manner. This project will investigate how neurodivergent youth can stimulate community-centered learning of electronic circuits through playful arts-based practices in underserved public spaces. The project aims to amplify engagement with electronics and semiconductors by integrating musical circuit bending, which involves creatively manipulating circuits to produce new sounds or effects, into informal learning settings during public events where music and technology are interdependent. Recognizing neurodiversity as a baseline, the project seeks to generate informal teaching and pop-up learning practices that cater to the unique characteristics of all learners. By introducing practical skills through an early-intervention STEAM-based approach, the project will create multiple pathways into the world of circuits and semiconductors. Utilizing the HOMAGO (Hanging Out, Messing Around, Geeking Out) framework, the project will connect youth through hands-on, minds-on, hearts-on, and social-on experiences. This initiative will directly impact 12 neurodivergent youth community educators who will participate in a one-week intensive course on electronic circuits and subsequently facilitate workshops on circuit bending at two community pop-up events, engaging at least 100 pop-up attendees. This effort aligns with the goals of the CHIPS and Science Act to increase interest in STEM fields by supporting the growth of the semiconductor workforce in Arizona. Partnerships with local community colleges offering accelerated semiconductor workforce training programs will further reinforce this project.\r\n\r\nThis EAGER project will introduce circuits and semiconductor technology to neurodivergent youth community educators using arts-based informal learning methods in underserved public spaces. The study will employ a STEM-rich tinkering approach, focusing on experiential learning and the HOMAGO framework to enhance meaningful and multisensory learning. Circuit bending offers an innovative, cost-effective approach to engaging with electronics, fostering creativity and problem-solving. The project will involve 12 neurodivergent youth community educators who will receive training to facilitate pop-up learning events, fostering personalized learning that adapts to the individual needs of neurodiverse learners and encouraging expression and social interaction. Additionally, up to 20 students in total will participate in the circuit bending course for free. The project will host two pop-up events, each engaging at least 50 attendees per event with the potential to impact many more, providing participants with circuit bending kits and educational materials. The research team will utilize mixed methods research design to collect both quantitative and qualitative data, analyzing engagement patterns and the development of STEM identities among participants. Data collection will include video journals, interviews, quizzes, surveys, and video recordings of pop-up events. Anticipated project outcomes include increased interest in STEM careers, enhanced leadership skills among neurodivergent youth, and a greater public understanding and appreciation of semiconductors and electronics. This project will promote inclusive, diverse learning environments and contribute to workforce development in the semiconductor industry. This project is funded by the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program, which supports projects that: (a) contribute to research and practice that considers informal STEM learning's role in equity and belonging in STEM; (b) promote personal and educational success in STEM; (c) advance public engagement in scientific discovery; (d) foster interest in STEM careers; (e) create and enhance the theoretical and empirical foundations for effective informal STEM learning; (f) improve community vibrancy; and/or (g) enhance science communication and the public's engagement in and understanding of STEM and STEM processes.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
