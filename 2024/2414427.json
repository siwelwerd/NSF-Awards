 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Alaska Fairbanks (UAF) requests funds for oceanographic instrumentation that is needed to carry out NSF-supported scientific research on board the R/V Sikuliaq, a vessel operating as part of the U.S. Academic Research Fleet (ARF). The specific suite of instrumentation requested includes a wireless electronic counter block for the vessel's winch that would enhance safety during operations; a networked data storage unit for storing all science-collected data onboard the vessel and ensuring separation between ship's operational and science party IT systems enhancing cybersecurity. In addition, a survey-grade Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) is requested for surveying underneath the vessel in instances of damage caused by ice and for scientific operations. Finally, a ceilometer will be purchased to identify the base of the clouds and allow planning of drone flying operations for ice detection. This would also enhance the suite of atmospheric parameters collected by the ship.\r\n\r\nThe principal impact of the present proposal is under Merit Review Criterion 2 of the Proposal Guidelines (NSF 23-525). It provides infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF). The acquisition, maintenance, and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or other organization access to well-maintained, high-quality, calibrated instruments for their research. It ensures the collection of high-quality oceanographic data in support of science, reduces the cost of that research, and expands the base of potential researchers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
