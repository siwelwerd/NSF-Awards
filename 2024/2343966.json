 "awd_abstract_narration": "Identity-based discrimination is a global problem that reduces opportunities for people from disadvantaged groups; yet its sources, evolution, consequences, and what can be done about it are little studied by economists. This award funds research that collects large survey data over long periods of time to study the causes of identity-based discrimination, how it has changed over time, consequences, how it is affected by policies designed to reduce it.  It will conduct interviews to collect information about current and historical discriminatory practices, policies to combat such practices, and the responses of discriminatory practices to these policies across many jurisdictions and make this data set available to researchers.  The dataset will allow researchers to study many aspects of identity-based discrimination and how to combat it.  The research will use the data to study political, social, and economic factors that have reduced identity-based discrimination.  While providing large data set and evidence on the causes and changing nature of identity-based discrimination, results of the research will provide guidance on policies to reduce identity-based discrimination.  The results could lead to improved fairness and efficiency in labor markets, better use of resources, increase productivity and economic growth, and establish the US as a global leader in reducing identity-based discrimination.  \r\n\r\nThis award will fund research that collects a large-scale dataset on the causes and evolution of identity-based discrimination.  The research will survey individuals on the contemporary presence of 15 forms of discrimination in their area, as well as any changes in these practices over their lifetimes in thousands of locations and use the information to construct a panel data on prevalence of discriminatory practices over the past 50 years.  Besides making this data available to other researchers, the PI will use the data to test which political, economic, and social factors have reduced discriminatory practices.  The research results together with those of scholars who will utilize this data, have the potential to advance understanding of effective discrimination reduction strategies.  In addition, this research results will provide guidance on policies to reduce identity-based discrimination and improve the lives of marginalized people around the world as well as establish the US as the global leader in reducing discrimination and providing equal opportunity for all.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
