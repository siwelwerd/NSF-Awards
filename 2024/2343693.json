 "awd_abstract_narration": "Young learners need opportunities to build critical awareness surrounding AI. To rapidly expand inclusive access to AI education, K-12 educators need activities that (a) are low-cost, (b) do not require specialized technology, (c) can be led with little prior knowledge of AI and used in settings with time constraints and competing curricular needs, and (d) have clear learning objectives and tie-ins across  disciplines. \u201cUnplugged\u201d activities that are playful, hands-on learning experiences that foster learning about AI without programming can address these constraints. This project will create a public repository of unplugged activities for fostering middle school aged youth\u2019s age-appropriate understanding of AI. The aim is to broaden access to AI education, especially for learners underrepresented in STEM. This proposal was received in response to the Dear Colleague Letter (DCL): Rapidly Accelerating Research on Arti\ufb01cial Intelligence in K-12 Education in Formal and Informal Settings (NSF 23-097) and funded by the Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program, which supports projects that build understandings of practices, program elements, contexts and processes contributing to increasing students' knowledge and interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and information and communication technology (ICT) careers.\r\n\r\nThe project team will explore three key research questions: 1) how can we design a set of unplugged activities that empower young adolescent learners to learn about AI through the lens of their own bodies and identities?; 2) How do adolescents and educators perceive unplugged AI literacy activities?; and 3) Are unplugged activities e\ufb00ective at fostering middle-school learners\u2019 AI literacy, especially as it relates to AI\u2019s impact on their lives? Researchers will engage in iterative design-based research to develop up to 15 unplugged activities that span a variety of AI literacy learning objectives and relevant cross-disciplinary connections. Research design includes  interviews with 20 to 30 adults including teachers, parents, and after-school group leaders as well as  20-30 teens who will engage with the activities and o\ufb00er feedback. Teens will additionally complete a retrospective post-test to assess learning. This project will contribute an open-source repository of AI literacy activities that will be widely disseminated amongst parents and educators. In addition, this project will contribute an evidence-based understanding of whether and how unplugged resources can support young adolescents\u2019 learning about AI, including design recommendations that can be used to guide future interventions. This work will result in new theories about the ways in which adolescents learn about AI through their bodies and the lens of their personal identities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
