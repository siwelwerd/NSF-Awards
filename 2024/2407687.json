 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace (SaTC) program, a flagship initiative by the National Science Foundation (NSF), addresses critical cybersecurity challenges from a socio-technical perspective. By delving into deep scientific and engineering issues and considering human behaviors, SaTC aims to advance the field of cybersecurity and privacy. The PI meeting will highlight research accomplishment made by the SaTC funded researchers and create a venue to stimulate coordination and collaboration amongst SaTC PIs working on different topic areas and cross disciplines. Breakout sessions, and networking opportunities will foster creativity and help carve out novel research directions. PIs can explore interdisciplinary research opportunities beyond their own study domains. Two-day intense interactions among researchers from different disciplines will lead to new insights, cultivate new collaborations, and help create new research ideas on improving education, recruitment, and career development in cybersecurity.\r\n\r\nThe proposal seeks PI support for developing the program for the two-day bi-annual PI meeting to bring together researchers from across the Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace (SaTC) program in the fall of 2024. The PI will serve on the organizing committee to take on tasks such as identifying and inviting keynote speakers, determining breakout and tutorial topics, as well as organizing sessions to highlight NSF projects.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
