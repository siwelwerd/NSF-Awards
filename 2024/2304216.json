 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop the first universally aware software for ransomware protection with a proactive approach to stop incoming file-based and file-less attacks. The number of ransomware attacks launched globally has grown substantially over the years. To exploit previously undiscovered weaknesses and conduct more effective attacks, cybercriminals take advantage of the rising number of workers accessing business networks from home through a virtual private network (VPN) while working remotely. Current ransomware countermeasure solutions are not comprehensive and generally fail in tackling sustained and persistent attacks. Moreover, the current solutions track threats only at the operating system level and can be disabled. This solution features universal awareness based on a combination of characteristics related to user, ransomware, non-specific environment indicators, and non-ransomware metrics. The comprehensive ransomware detection, remediation, eradication, and data recovery solution enable unmatched protection from cyberattacks and allow timely detection and shutdown of cyberattacks thus, significantly reducing the amount of compromised data. This enhanced protection will have security benefits for a wide range of critical infrastructures, ranging from energy and finances to the protection of medical data.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to develop an advanced ransomware countermeasure (ARC) platform which will represent the most advanced and effective protection against ransomware attacks.  The technology will enforce four synergistic actions: (1) precondition observation and characterization, (2) incoming interactions validation, (3) internal contents observation and characterization, and (4) outgoing interactions validation. In this project, the research and development efforts will be dedicated towards the (1) the development of the framework of communication between the inoculator and watch-dog and its deployment for effective countermeasure, (2) design and development of user-friendly interface providing simple user experience, (3) seamless integration of the ARC platform with existing Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tools, (4) implementation of artificial intelligence/machine learning models in the ARC platform for the effective defense against zero-day ransomware exploits, and 5) validation of the ARC platform against known ransomware to ensure the proper function of all the modules. The successful completion of the SBIR Phase II activities will deliver a fully functional, commercially viable product with general availability that can seamlessly run/work along with existing SIEM tools and successfully defend against known ransomware attacks and zero-day exploits.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
