 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to meet the rapidly expanding need for AI jobs by establishing an experiential learning pathway in the emerging Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence (TAI) technology for diverse learners into careers in Artificial Intelligence (ExLAI). ExLAI aims to provide a diverse pool of individuals enrolled in associate degree community college programs in STEM with experiential learning opportunities that deepen knowledge and skills in Artificial Intelligence (AI) fields. There are two major pathways through ExLAI program: (1) Direct Career Pathway: Upon completing the eight-week training, community college students are equipped to secure internships and embark on a rewarding full-time career within the field of AI; and (2) UC Immersion Pathway: Students gain entry into the esteemed UC Computer Science (CS) department, undergoing comprehensive AI training and participating in mandatory Cooperative Education (Co-op) experiences. Through this, the ExLAI program will enroll 180 ExLAI scholars over three years, with each cohort trained for eight weeks, 20 hours per week.\r\n\r\nExLAI partners with four STEM-focused community colleges as well as five companies that will provide industrial experiential mentoring to the scholars. ExLAI\u2019s goal will be achieved by fulfilling the following objectives: (1) Create a robust experimental AI learning pathway program for ExLAI scholars. The ExLAI Program will enroll 30 community college associate degree ExLAI scholars per cohort and two cohorts each year. As a pathway program, it will begin as an eight-week summer program for 60 community college associate degree students each year to develop their confidence as future computer scientists and engineers in TAI. Our recruiting efforts will focus on underrepresented minority (URM), female, and low-income students. The program will then expand to provide targeted, trustworthy AI education, developing in-depth TAI research skills. Each scholar will work with a mentor and conduct research on the assigned project for at least ten hours per week; (2) To increase the capacity for the education of TAI professionals through experimental learning. The ExLAI Program will work closely with UC\u2019s Office of Career Services (OCS), Co-op, and NSF ExLENT program to connect diverse industry employment sectors and enhance placement services provided to ExLAI scholars; (3) Expand UC\u2019s CS/TAI research, development capabilities, and infrastructure. UC provides a unique research, development, and education environment focused on TAI issues that collectively foster interactions with a wide range of stakeholders; and (4) Strengthen partnerships among UC, community colleges, industry employment sectors. The collaboration between the ExLAI program and the Co-op program/OCS is positioned to enhance internship/full-time job opportunities for participants in the industry.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
