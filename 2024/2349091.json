 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-year renewal Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site program, hosted by the Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) Department at Montana State University (MSU), focuses on a central theme of \"Our sustainable future: Remote sensing, smart systems, and innovative devices.\" The program offers state-of-the-art, interdisciplinary research experiences spanning the applications of this theme to diverse and talented cohorts of undergraduates including from institutions with limited or no research opportunities. Ten students each year will engage in diverse activities and research opportunities catering to a wide spectrum of backgrounds and interests, learn about graduate studies, and engage in professional development skills (such as communication through presentations and writing research articles). The primary objective of this REU site program is to provide each undergraduate participant with a ten-week intensive and immersive research experience within a highly collegial environment of collaboration with faculty mentors and other students. The program focuses on the development of the technical skills and critical-thinking abilities of the participants and on their exposure to substantive, representative research activities aimed at solving important problems using technologies related to the core theme. The interdisciplinary nature of the research efforts will also help participants see how various academic disciplines come together to solve important problems.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis three-year renewal Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site program, hosted by the Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) Department at Montana State University (MSU), focuses on a central theme of \"Our sustainable future: Remote sensing, smart systems, and innovative devices.\" The primary objective of this REU site program is to provide each undergraduate participant with a ten-week intensive and immersive research experience within a highly collegial environment of collaboration with faculty mentors and other students.

An individual, faculty-mentored research project will be the centerpiece of each student\u2019s experience, supplemented by seminars, workshops, and other curated learning and support opportunities. The program includes industrial researchers in the seminar series and visits to local companies. \r\n\r\nThis site is supported by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program. Additional funding is provided through NSF's Improving Undergraduate STEM Education (IUSE: EDU) program in the Division of Undergraduate Education.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
