 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funding for the 2024 Spring and Fall Redbud Geometry/Topology Conferences, the first of which is to be held April 12-14, 2024, at Oklahoma State University. These conferences are part of an ongoing series of conferences held at universities in Arkansas and Oklahoma, intended to increase interaction and collaboration among early career and established mathematicians in the area. The Spring meeting will feature talks by prominent speakers from across North America, as well as a graduate student workshop. The Fall meeting will take place at the University of Oklahoma, and it will predominantly consist of talks by early-career mathematicians from the EPSCoR regions of Arkansas, Oklahoma, and surrounding states.\r\n\r\nMany interesting results have linked low-dimensional topology and group orderability. These results have provided evidence for a prominent conjecture addressing which three-manifold groups are left-orderable, and have made progress towards a classification of bi-orderable three-manifold groups. The 2024 Spring Redbud Geometry/Topology Conference will bring together leading researchers to discuss these developments. The invited speakers are: Idrissa Ba (University of Manitoba), Adam Clay (University of Manitoba), Nathan Dunfield (University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign), Cameron Gordon (University of Texas at Austin), Ying Hu (University of Nebraska, Omaha), Tao Li (Boston College), Rachel Roberts (Washington University in St. Louis), Dale Rolfsen (University of British Columbia), and Hannah Turner (Georgia Institute of Technology). The conference begins with a workshop designed to enhance the experience of graduate students and junior researchers. The workshop will feature expository talks by Clay, Gordon, and Rolfsen. More information is available at the conference website: https://math.okstate.edu/conferences/redbud/\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
