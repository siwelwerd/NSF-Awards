 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-technical Abstract:\r\nThe project holds significant potential to advance the field of continuous-time quantum walk, an important and versatile model with broad interdisciplinary applications such as graph analytics, quantum chemistry simulation, and cryptography. This research can enhance quantum software tools and foster collaboration across diverse fields, including quantum physics, mathematics, and programming languages. Additionally, the project integrates a robust educational component, focusing on cultivating the next generation of quantum computing talent, particularly among underrepresented demographics. By developing new course materials incorporating quantum walk concepts, the project aims to deepen students' understanding of quantum physics, algorithms, and graph theory, thus promoting diversity and inclusivity within STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) education. Dissemination efforts will ensure widespread visibility and adoption of the project's findings, fostering a collaborative and vibrant quantum computing community.\r\n\r\nTechnical Abstract: \r\nThe project aims to develop high-fidelity quantum transport protocols using continuous-time quantum walks, leveraging unique properties to transcend the limitations of standard quantum walks. This includes designing protocols that violate conventional limitations, such as monogamy and speed limits of perfect state transfer, with applications in dynamic state transfer and cryptography. The project also focuses on designing robust quantum search algorithms on realistic networks, analyzing the effects of noise and perturbation, and optimizing quantum search on specific graph structures. Additionally, a new domain-specific quantum programming system will be developed to support continuous-time quantum walk applications, featuring language primitives and optimization algorithms tailored for this model. These efforts collectively contribute to advancing the theoretical foundations, algorithmic capabilities, and practical implementation of quantum computing applications using continuous-time quantum walk, ultimately enriching the broader quantum information science and engineering ecosystem.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis award was jointly funded by the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences, Office of Strategic Initiatives; and the Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering, Division of Computing and Communication Foundations.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
