 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop lightweight, compact, and all-semiconductor-manufactured optical devices based on metasurface technology. The manufacturing process of conventional optical devices involves techniques that face challenges in integration, assembly, and testing as well as long turnaround times and high costs. This lens technology, called metalenses, is superior to conventional lenses, which are typically made of glass or plastic.  Metalenses are made from arrays of nanostructures, and these nanostructures interact with light at the nanoscale, allowing for precise control of the light properties.  This project will significantly reduce the complexity of fabrication process where metalenses will be integrated with a semiconductor laser diode in a conventional manufacturing facility without the need for any additional or special equipment.  The novel metalenses will be engineered and made of special multilayered thin films with high reflectivity. The metalenses will have wide application across a spectrum of industries, including, but not limited to, imaging, sensing, telecommunication, aerospace, and defense. The realization of this project will amplify global competition within the photonics industry and increase the competitiveness of the United States. It will increase employment opportunities across diverse high-tech domains, including chip manufacturing, photonics and optics.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to address the limitations of conventional methods for the control of laser beams. The innovation offers a novel approach to design and fabricate a spatial-dispersion-engineered metalens through cost-effective wafer-scale manufacturing.  The metalenses will have the potential to replace the distributed Bragg reflectors (DBRs) in both top- and bottom-emitting Vertical Cavity Surface Emitting Lasers. This goal is to achieve either low (< a few degrees) or high divergence (> 30 degrees) angles. The metalenses will be designed with a proprietary algorithm and special code based on an application programming interface linking and enabling data exchange between different design software and will have design flexibility such that wavelengths of interest could be achieved by linearly adjusting each film thickness followed by an optimization. The project's key objectives are (1) the validation of the concept and exploration of its limitations, (2) the experimental fabrication and characterization of the designed metalenses, and (3) the development of scalable manufacturing pathways for the integration of such metalenses with laser chips.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
