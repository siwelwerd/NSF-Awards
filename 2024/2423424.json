 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader/commercial impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project involves the development and evaluation of the Crop Ecosystem Monitoring, Analysis, and Prediction (CropMAP) tool. This project addresses the critical need to support food security profitability by optimizing resource management and decision-making through advanced monitoring and predictive analytics in crop production. The significance of this research lies in its potential to enhance agricultural productivity and sustainability across the United States, thereby improving the lives of farmers by increasing yield outputs and reducing losses. Furthermore, the successful commercialization of CropMAP could generate substantial economic benefits, including increased tax revenues and job creation in the agricultural sector. By aligning with NSF\u2019s mission to advance the progress of science, this project contributes to the scientific understanding of agricultural ecosystems and impacts related fields such as environmental science and economics.\r\n\r\nThis project represents a significant technical innovation in the field of precision agriculture through the development of the CropMAP tool, a high-risk effort with substantial potential for high impact. CropMAP integrates novel algorithms and models with real-time data feeds for enhanced monitoring and predictive analytics of crop conditions. The primary innovation involves the application of machine learning techniques to satellite images and climate data to predict crop yields, water usage, and soil health more accurately than current methods allow and the use of artificial intelligence to make actionable insights timely available to technical and non-technical users. The goals of this project are to validate these models' effectiveness in real-world settings and to establish a scalable framework for its application across various agricultural contexts. The project will employ rigorous methodological approaches, including the use of time-series image analytics and data-driven diagnostic models, to achieve these objectives. Through its focus on innovation and scalability, the project aims to set a new standard in agricultural practices, ultimately facilitating better resource management and sustainability.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
