 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Sixth International Conference on Quantitative Ethnography (ICQE24), to be held in the fall of 2024 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, co-hosted by the University of Pennsylvania and Drexel University, will build the capacity of NSF-supported communities to benefit from the highly promising research methodology of quantitative ethnography. Quantitative ethnography addresses the challenge of conducting rich qualitative analyses by using statistical techniques to warrant grounded, quantitative claims about thick qualitative descriptions. Quantitative ethnography can be applied to many contexts including STEM education research, learning analytics, learning sciences, and the social sciences more broadly. \r\n\r\nThe funding will support doctoral students and early career scholars\u2019 participation in the conference in order to build their skills in quantitative ethnography and grow the community of scholars. Doctoral students and early career scholars will attend a workshop at the beginning and end of the conference geared specifically towards building their technical skills as well as connecting them with mid-career and senior scholars well-versed in quantitative ethnography. They will also have the opportunity to learn from and engage with a slate of multi-disciplinary symposium speakers who use quantitative ethnography, who will also be supported through this funding. The conference activities will provide opportunities for skill development and community building within the quantitative ethnography community of researchers.\r\n\r\nThis project is supported by NSF's EDU Core Research (ECR) program. The ECR program emphasizes fundamental STEM education research that generates foundational knowledge in the field. Investments are made in critical areas that are essential, broad and enduring: STEM learning and STEM learning environments, broadening participation in STEM, and STEM workforce development.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
