 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to develop advanced techniques for building structures on the Moon using 3D printing technologies, focusing on understanding and addressing the challenges posed by the Moon's unique environment. By investigating the materials and conditions necessary for constructing resilient lunar habitats, the research addresses fundamental issues related to space exploration and sustainability. This project is significant because it not only advances the field of space engineering but also has the potential to benefit society by fostering innovations that could be applied to building disaster-resistant structures on Earth. The study supports education by offering multidisciplinary training in engineering, material science, and artificial intelligence, and promotes diversity by involving underrepresented students in STEM from New Mexico State University. Furthermore, the project aligns with NSF's mission to promote scientific progress: By improving our ability to construct habitats in extreme environments, this research supports long-term human space exploration, contributing to future missions to Mars and beyond, and ensuring the safety and resilience of both extraterrestrial and terrestrial structures.\r\n\r\nThe primary objectives of this research are (1) to quantify the uncertainties present in additively constructed lunar structures operating under microgravity and extreme lunar conditions and (2) to establish and enhance the predictability of structural behavior and the reliability of these structures. This project will undertake a comprehensive investigation into the various uncertainties affecting the system, including those in materials such as lunar regolith and potential metal alloys such as magnesium alloy, environmental loads such as thermal loads and moonquakes, and uncertainties inherent in the structural geometries and additive construction processes. Additionally, it will examine uncertainties arising from our existing knowledge, especially extraterrestrial conditions, and employ correlation modeling to understand the interdependencies among these factors. Advanced statistical methods, including Bayesian approaches, alongside cutting-edge artificial intelligence techniques, will be employed to model these uncertainties comprehensively. Once established, these models will be used to construct probabilistic models and analyze the fragility of proposed lunar structures under the specific challenges posed by microgravity and extreme lunar conditions. The intellectual merit of this proposal lies in its approach to systematically address the uncertainties associated with materials and environmental conditions critical to the sustainability of lunar structures. The integration of uncertainty quantification with advanced probabilistic modeling provides a novel methodological framework that will significantly enhance the prediction and management of risks in extraterrestrial construction. This research will utilize state-of-the-art analytical techniques, facilitated by collaborations with NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center, to push forward the boundaries of current knowledge in space habitat construction.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
