 "awd_abstract_narration": "As nations compete in the rapidly advancing field of quantum technology, it is imperative for rural states like Wyoming to bolster their research and educational capacities in quantum information science (QIS). One prominent branch of QIS is quantum computing. Over recent years, we have seen the successful creation of quantum computer prototypes across various platforms. Yet, their practical applications remain restricted. A major challenge facing current superconductor-based quantum computers is noise interference, which can easily disrupt quantum states. Motivated by this, researchers at the University of Wyoming have speculated that two-dimensional (2D) materials, exhibiting single crystalline properties down to the atomic scale, might pave the way for the next generation of quantum computers. With the support of this fellowship, the PI will gain invaluable training experience, expanding his skills in designing and characterizing superconducting qubits. Concurrently, this will foster the development of infrastructure at the University of Wyoming, bringing benefits that will endure long after the fellowship concludes.\r\n\r\nThe NSF EPSCoR RII Track-4 Research Fellows project will provide a unique opportunity for an Assistant Professor and a postdoctoral researcher from the University of Wyoming to collaborate with the leading experts in quantum computing at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL). The primary objective of this research fellowship is to design, create, and characterize superconducting qubits constructed entirely from 2D materials. This endeavor could herald the dawn of a new generation of quantum computers, marked by heightened fidelity and largely increased coherence times - a significant advancement eagerly anticipated by the quantum computing community worldwide. At the University of Wyoming, the research team is poised to harness a diverse toolkit of methodologies, from the preparation and handling of 2D materials to the fabrication and characterization of 2D superconducting Josephson junctions. The close collaboration with LLNL offers the most critical edge. With access to LLNL's world-class quantum computing test beds, the Wyoming team will receive training and gain hands-on experience in superconducting qubit design, creation, and characterization. While the immediate fruits of this fellowship are undeniably enticing, its lasting impact on the research and education capabilities in quantum information science at the University of Wyoming promises to extend well beyond the fellowship's conclusion.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
