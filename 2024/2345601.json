 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader/commercial impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is rooted in addressing the pervasive challenge of hard water\u2014a condition affecting over 85% of households in the United States, leading to significant economic and environmental burdens. Hard water, characterized by high concentrations of calcium and magnesium, contributes to the inefficiency of water-using appliances, increases maintenance costs, and necessitates the use of environmentally harmful water softening methods. This project proposes an innovative, environmentally friendly solution to softening hard water without the use of salts, which are traditionally discharged into water systems, causing pollution and exacerbating regulatory challenges. The significance of this research lies in its potential to provide millions of U.S. citizens with access to soft water, thereby improving quality of life, reducing household expenses, and contributing to the preservation of natural water resources. Additionally, by offering an eco-friendly alternative to current water softening methods, this project aligns with the National Science Foundation\u2019s mission of advancing the health, prosperity, and welfare of the nation, while also possessing the commercial potential to create jobs and generate tax revenue.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis project introduces a significant technical innovation in the field of water treatment through the development of a novel electrochemical process for softening hard water without the addition of salts. Unlike existing technologies that rely on ion-exchange resins or chemical conditioners, this project employs a unique method based on redox flow cell technology to selectively remove calcium and magnesium ions from water. This high-risk effort is characterized by its attempt to overcome the limitations of current water softening systems, including high operational costs, environmental impacts, and maintenance challenges. The goals of this research include achieving a softening capacity suitable for the average American household, ensuring water safety standards, and demonstrating the system's long-term durability and cost-effectiveness. The research will employ a combination of electrochemical engineering, material science, and fluid dynamics to optimize the design and operation of the softening system. By addressing the technical hurdles associated with membrane durability, electrode stability, and system efficiency, this project aims to bring a groundbreaking solution to the market, setting a new standard for sustainable water treatment technologies.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
