 "awd_abstract_narration": "The \"Expanding Use-Inspired AI Research and Instruction Across Campus\" project, led by Bowie State University (BSU), Maryland's oldest Historically Black College and University (HBCU), aims to bridge the significant gap in Artificial Intelligence (AI) education and research for African Americans and other underrepresented groups. Despite AI's profound impact on modern society, these communities remain largely absent from the field, risking their exclusion from the critical fourth and fifth industrial revolutions. BSU's multidisciplinary initiative seeks to counter this trend by integrating advanced AI advancements, including Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLM) like GPT-3 and GPT-4, into its curriculum and research activities. This endeavor is not just about technological advancement; it's a push towards inclusivity, aiming to ensure that the AI workforce of the future is as diverse as the society it aims to serve. This initiative aligns with the National Science Foundation (NSF)'s mission because it broadens the participation of underrepresented groups in science and engineering, thereby enriching the field with diverse perspectives and fostering a culture of inclusion and innovation.\r\n\r\nThe project is structured around five key objectives designed to embed AI deeply into BSU's academic and research environments. These include establishing a state-of-the-art computing infrastructure to support AI research and education; conducting targeted training and workshops for faculty and students; creating a faculty learning community focused on AI; offering AI research opportunities and disseminating outcomes; and developing competency-based AI curriculum modules across targeted disciplines such as Biology, Education, Computer Science, Criminal Justice, Finance, and Economics. Methodologies entail a blend of direct instruction, hands-on workshops and training, and faculty-student collaborative research, all supported by the latest advancements in Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-3 and GPT-4.\r\n\r\nThis project is co-funded by the Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP), which provides awards to strengthen STEM undergraduate education and research at HBCUs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
