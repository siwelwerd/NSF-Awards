 "awd_abstract_narration": "Early childhood years are critical for developing the foundational knowledge, skills, and attitudes for later success in STEM. Young children learn science best when they actively engage with topics that are meaningful to their everyday lives. Artificial intelligence can help in developing science learning content and making it more interactive, but inherent social, racial, and linguistic biases in AI-generated materials make this undertaking risky. Our project involves direct participation from parents in under-resourced Latino families in co-designing AI-based educational materials. Their participation can help reduce potential biases in the produced materials. University and community partners will jointly work with AI to first create bilingual science stories rooted in Latino identity and then to make those stories interactive. This initiative leverages storytelling\u2013a major form of cultural capital in the Latino community\u2013to foster children\u2019s scientific curiosity and engagement, while also helping build community members\u2019 AI literacy skills. The project will contribute important knowledge about how AI can be effectively and equitably harnessed by and with diverse communities in support of their values and education, aligning with key National Science Foundation objectives.\r\n\r\nThe project utilizes participatory design with Latino families in California and Michigan to create 24 Spanish-English culturally relevant e-books for Latino children aged 4-7, employing generative AI for rapid, iterative content development. The e-books will feature a bilingual AI-powered conversational agent that allows children to dialogue directly with the story characters, as well as family discussion prompts to encourage parent-child interaction. After the 24 interactive e-books are piloted and iteratively improved, a randomized control trial will be carried out with 120 Latino families to evaluate the impact of e-book use on children's science knowledge and engagement and on parent-child science communication. Subsequent improvements will prepare the e-books for free national distribution, significantly broadening STEM learning opportunities for diverse children, particularly in Latino communities.\r\n\r\nThis Integrating Research and Practice Project is funded by the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program, which supports research on the development and impact of STEM learning opportunities in informal educational environments. This project is also partially funded by the Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program, which supports projects that build understandings of practices, program elements, contexts and processes contributing to increasing students' knowledge and interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and information and communication technology (ICT) careers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
