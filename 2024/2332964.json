 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the 21st century, the educational landscape is undergoing a seismic shift, with Artificial Intelligence (AI) emerging as a pivotal force reshaping the contours of teaching and learning, especially in the realm of science education. As educators, policymakers, and researchers grapple with the challenges and opportunities presented by this technological juggernaut, this project underscores the imperative to weave AI's transformative potential seamlessly with the foundational principles of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI). The vision driving this initiative is twofold: harnessing the unparalleled capabilities of AI to revolutionize educational experiences while ensuring that these innovations are accessible, relevant, and beneficial to every student, irrespective of their background or circumstances. By energizing the cutting-edge advancements of AI with the timeless values of DEI, this project envisions a future where education is not only technologically advanced but also deeply equitable, adaptable, and centered on the holistic development of students. The overarching ambition is to chart a course where the next generation, regardless of socio-economic, racial, or cultural backgrounds, can fully tap into the myriad benefits that AI-infused science education offers.\r\n\r\nThis project is anchored in a comprehensive, multi-pronged strategy designed to delve deep into the multifaceted dimensions of AI's role in science education. Drawing from a rich reservoir of insights, including the visionary perspectives articulated by the U.S. Department of Education and groundbreaking research spearheaded by current luminaries, the initiative is poised to craft a strategic roadmap for the seamless, effective, and equitable integration of AI into science education. Central to this endeavor is the project's unwavering commitment to three-dimensional learning, an avant-garde feature of the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS). This innovative approach, harmoniously aligned with AI and DEI, promises a comprehensive educational experience that transcends traditional pedagogical boundaries, fostering a learning environment that is both immersive and inclusive. The project's methodology is characterized by its collaborative spirit and iterative nature. Through a series of strategic community-led workshops, participants from diverse backgrounds will converge to share insights, challenges, and strategies, fostering a rich tapestry of perspectives. This collaborative ethos extends to in-depth research initiatives, where participants, ranging from seasoned experts to budding scholars, will embark on exploratory journeys to unravel the nuances of AI in science education. Continuous feedback loops, characterized by rigorous reviews and refinements, will ensure that the project's outputs remain aligned with its DEI-centric vision.\r\n\r\nThis project is funded by the Discovery Research preK-12 program (DRK-12) that seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models, and tools. Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
