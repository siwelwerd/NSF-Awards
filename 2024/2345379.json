 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Improving Undergraduate STEM Education: Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSI Program), this Track 2 project aims to improve recruitment and retention of students from underrepresented groups in STEM at California Baptist University (CBU) in Southern California. The 3 Pasos (3 Steps) Program seeks to strengthen STEM by bridging the gap for students from populations that have historically been underrepresented in STEM; these students can sometimes struggle to find their place in STEM. This may be due to socioeconomic factors, first-generation college student status, or gaps in preparation in high school. The 3 Pasos Program will seek to reach a breadth of students to increase diversity, equity, and access to STEM careers. By incorporating research opportunities, mentorship, and hands-on learning, the program will lessen retention and recruitment gaps for students from underrepresented populations in STEM fields and graduate programs. Understanding students\u2019 backgrounds and cultures will allow a family-type program to inspire high school students to pursue their full potential, impacting both the institution and the local communities it serves.\r\n\r\nThe 3 Pasos (3 Steps) Program at CBU is poised to revolutionize STEM education, emphasizing diversity, equity, and access, aligning with CBU's commitment to these principles. Knowledge generation efforts through research and evaluation is achieved by this innovative initiative which will reshape the landscape of undergraduate STEM education by incorporating applied research exposure, qualitative and quantitative reasoning, and hands-on technological experiences. The program's overarching goal is to prepare students, irrespective of background, for success in STEM undergraduate programs, careers, and graduate education. Through strategic phases such as awakening interest during high school, innovative teaching transitions, and collaborative research within Familia-Cohorts, the program will reshape STEM education at CBU. Featuring elements like summer research experiences, teaching seminars, mobility programs, and workshops, the comprehensive and impactful educational journey it offers aligns seamlessly with NSF's mission, making it an ideal investment in the future of diverse and equitable STEM education. This project is funded by the HSI Program, which aims to enhance undergraduate STEM education, broaden participation in STEM, and build capacity at HSIs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
