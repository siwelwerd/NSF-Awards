 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biological systems are rife with communication from micro (cell-to-cell) to macro scales (inter- organismal), and information can be transmitted through diverse mechanisms (e.g., kinase cascades, hormones, electrical potentials). Signaling systems are not always simple linear flows of information. Some signals are recognized by multiple receivers, and multiple signals might converge to activate a response. Understanding signals, their sources and receivers, and downstream consequences of a signal are at the heart of molecular biology, including molecular plant science. The 2024 Gordon Research Conference on Plant Molecular Biology and associated Gordon Research Seminar will assemble a diverse group of researchers to present and discuss the latest research in plant molecular biology through the lens of information is transmission. In addition to presentations from international experts, the conference will include short talks selected to highlight late-breaking research and poster presentations for early career researchers. Students and postdocs are also encouraged to attend the associated Gordon Research Seminar, an opportunity to present their research among their peers.\r\n\r\nThe conference program is organized around different scales of communication, including molecular signaling, cellular and intercellular communication, long-distance signaling, and inter-organismal interactions. In addition to exploring specific scientific questions, the conference will highlight important concepts in communication, including spatial and temporal regulation, branching versus converging pathways (one-to-many versus many-to-one), and signal fidelity. Improving communication between scientists of different career stages, nationalities, and cultural backgrounds is also an important goal of the meeting.\r\n\r\nThis conference will be co-funded by the Plant Biotic Interactions Program and the Plant Genome Research Program in the Division of Integrative Organismal Systems.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
