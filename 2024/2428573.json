 "awd_abstract_narration": "ALGECOM (algebra-geometry-combinatorics) is a series of biannual one day conferences. The central goal is to promote collaboration and regular interaction among Midwest students and faculty. Both (non-local) senior and early career mathematicians will be invited as speakers. ALGECOM is now a tradition in the Midwest going back to 2009. It has involved over fifty institutions. This grant will fund participant travel to six conferences, the first of which, ALGECOM XXIV is planned to be at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities. A subsequent edition will occur at The Ohio State University. Both of these venues are new to the series. The conference website is at https://sites.google.com/view/algecom-main/algecom-main.\r\n \r\nEach session of ALGECOM consists of four talks as well as a student poster session. Dissemination of research at the border of algebra, geometry and combinatorics is the main intellectual merit of the series. There is a wealth of Midwest departments with individually small ALGECOM-related research groups. These one-day conferences provide the stimulus for research collaboration among these groups. An effort has been made to encourage the attendance of graduate students, recent graduates, and untenured faculty. In terms of broader impacts, there are ongoing efforts to recruit members of underrepresented groups in mathematics as participants and speakers. These efforts are enhanced by NSF support, as it allows for invitations to mathematicians from a geographically larger region.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
