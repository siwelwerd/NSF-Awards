 "awd_abstract_narration": "Annually, bacterial wilt disease of cucurbits (BW), primarily caused by the bacterium Erwinia tracheiphila (Et)\u2014a phylogenetic relative of the well-known E. coli\u2014inflicts substantial damage on cucumber and melon crops throughout the eastern United States and across the world and across the world. This pathogen severely threatens the cultivation of cucumbers, squash, pumpkins, and melons, resulting in considerable economic losses due to reduced yields and the increased costs associated with managing the disease. This project is designed to address these challenges by exploring the genetic interplay between the host plants and the pathogen. The foremost aim of this project is to screen, identify and characterize natural resistance traits within cucumber accessions, as cucumbers are particularly vulnerable to this disease. The goal is to leverage these insights to develop sustainable and environmentally friendly management strategies for these critical agricultural resources. Moreover, the scope of this research extends beyond laboratory and field investigations; it encompasses broader societal impacts through educational and outreach activities aimed at underrepresented minority groups within the scientific community. Key initiatives include the mentorship of minority students and the organization of biotechnology-themed summer camps for middle schoolers. This project is intended not only to enhance our understanding of a tough agricultural challenge but also to stimulate interest in the sciences among young students. By doing so, the project seeks to cultivate a diverse and inclusive community of future scientists, enriched with individuals from varied backgrounds and perspectives.\r\n\r\nThis project seeks to elucidate the genetic underpinnings of host-pathogen dynamics within the BW pathosystem, specifically focusing on interactions between the pathogen, Erwinia tracheiphila and cucurbit hosts. A comprehensive screening of diverse natural cucumber and melon populations will be conducted to identify phenotypes that exhibit resistance to this pathogen. The use of genomic approaches, the sequence and analysis of the Et genome will be performed to uncover genetic determinants of pathogenicity and host interaction in the pathosystem. A mutant library of Et will be constructed to facilitate a functional genomics analysis aimed at identifying and characterizing key virulence and host-interaction genes. This approach will integrate both targeted mutagenesis and subsequent phenotypic analysis of mutants under controlled conditions to validate the role of these genes in disease progression and host interaction. The combination of pathogen genome characterization and functional genomic validation is intended to dissect complex disease mechanisms at a molecular level. The data generated will be critical for advancing our understanding of the molecular interactions defining host susceptibility and pathogen virulence. Insights from this research are expected to drive the development of BW-resistant cucurbit cultivars and inform targeted, sustainable disease management strategies that could significantly mitigate crop losses due to BW. By bridging advanced genetic sequencing technologies with functional genomics, this interdisciplinary project sets the stage for major breakthroughs in managing bacterial wilt. Additionally, it provides a training ground for emerging scientists, enhancing their skills in modern biotechnological approaches and contributing to our capacity to tackle complex plant disease problems.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
