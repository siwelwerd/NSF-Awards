 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the global contamination issues of per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) \u2013 also known as \u201cforever chemicals\u201d \u2013 in drinking water resources. The technology aims to develop a proof-of-concept, cost-effective technology that destroys PFAS chemicals even at very low levels and converts them to non-toxic. benign products in an ambient environment. Ultimately, the project team aims to provide improved water sustainability and safeguard public health. The project is aligned with the American Innovation and Competitiveness Act by advancing of the health and welfare of the American public. Initial demonstration of these impacts is expected to be felt in the water-scarce and economically fast-growing inland southern California region for both centralized and decentralized water treatment. \r\n\r\nThis effort focusses on the development of a highly efficient and cost-effective photochemical treatment system for the destruction of PFAS in drinking water resources. Using a novel tunable deep ultraviolet light (a.k.a. vacuum ultraviolet or VUV), the technology aims to achieve nearly complete destruction of PFAS without generating secondary waste streams or toxic byproducts in drinking water. VUV light is one of the most accessible and efficient water ionization photon sources because it takes advantage of abundant water molecules as photon sensitizers, can be readily generated from common UV lamps, and is easy to control and operate. Tuning this light source in conjunction with other benign chemicals creates a highly reactive environment for efficient destruction of PFAS, converting waterborne PFAS into non-toxic fluoride. The effort will involve combination of chemical kinetics investigation, advanced chemical analysis, and technology scale-up in collaboration with potential customers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
