 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project focuses on wireless communication technolog, specifically the development of a special semiconductor known as silicon carbide (SiC), which has the potential to revolutionize the industry. Unlike traditional semiconductors, SiC can operate at much higher power levels and in harsh environments, making it ideal for wireless communication devices. Currently, the industry predominantly relies on gallium nitride (GaN) semiconductors, which are not only rare but also mostly imported, raising national security concerns.  By demonstrating that SiC can match or even surpass the performance of GaN in radio frequency (RF) applications, this project aims to pave the way for a robust SiC RF semiconductor industry within the United States (U.S.). The RF switch market alone is estimated to be worth $2 billion by 2024. A successful SiC RF switch product would not only capture a significant share of this market but also establish the U.S, as a leader in RF semiconductor technology.  The project has the potential to create jobs, foster innovation within the domestic semiconductor industry, and enhance national security by reducing reliance on foreign-produced semiconductor materials. \r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will produce commercially competitive RF switches made from SiC. The RF switches are intended for use in sub-6 GHz cellular infrastructure applications, such as base stations, where high power and ruggedness are difficult to achieve in conventional silicon-based technologies. SiC and, more specifically, SiC metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs), have gained significant market share in the electric vehicle industry. In contrast, SiC MOSFETs are essentially non-existent in the RF industry. The main reasons are poor mobility, resulting in high on-state resistance, and high off-state capacitance. For an RF switch, the product on-state resistance and off-state capacitance are critical specifications, with lower numbers being better. This project develops two semiconductor innovations to reduce these factors while handling high power levels. Research focuses on developing the semiconductor fabrication processes to produce an RF switch integrated circuit product that is competitive with existing high power RF switches, such as those made from GaN having insertion losses less than 0.8 dB up to 6 GHz, isolation of around 20 dB, and handling high peak RF power levels of 50 dBm/100 W.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
