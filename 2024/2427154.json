 "awd_abstract_narration": "The fundamental principles that govern the behavior of systems in the quantum regime have advanced into the center of modern science and technology today. From quantum sensing and quantum-secure communication to quantum analog simulation and novel paradigms for computation, quantum principles offer a plethora of new technologies to explore. This project, centered around a flexible apparatus to create arrays of dilute-gas Bose-Einstein condensates for quantum-state engineering and quantum control, greatly enhances the educational scope and technological capabilities at the University of San Diego, a primarily undergraduate institution. The project leverages expertise and guidance from the Fundamental Quantum Physics lab at Washington State University and a collaboration with Quantum Design, a leading industry partner in the area of quantum technologies. In addition to performing cutting-edge research investigating principles of quantum control to generate novel quantum states with arrays of ultracold atoms, the project also contains a strong educational component including the development of modules for a quantum science curriculum, and a San Diego Quantum Seminar Series to connect with the broader community.\r\n\r\nModern quantum technologies promise revolutionary advancements in areas including sensing, computation, and secure communication. One of the most flexible platforms for investigating quantum dynamics is provided by ultracold atoms. This project employs a highly versatile setup comprised of an array of dilute-gas Bose-Einstein condensates arranged in mesoscopic traps. The setup includes advanced imaging in conjunction with a digital micromirror device to conduct novel studies in quantum-state engineering. The multi-step research program addresses elements from fundamental quantum physics with a focus on the realization of non-Hermitian procedures and the study of non-Hermitian Hamiltonian dynamics and their applications to enhanced quantum sensing. While ultracold atoms are a particularly powerful testbed for quantum technologies, the underlying principles of quantum information science are relevant to a large and diverse range of quantum platforms. Through cooperation with Quantum Design, a leading industry partner, avenues for leveraging this universality are explored. From an educational perspective, this project invites undergraduate students in physics, biophysics, mathematics, computer science, and engineering at the University of San Diego to gain valuable knowledge and experience in systems research and development and in quantum science. Close collaboration with Washington State University provides a venue for exchanges of students, expertise, and ideas, as well as a connection to a large and vibrant quantum network in the Pacific Northwest.\r\n\r\nThis award is co-funded by the Advancing Informal STEM Learning program.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
