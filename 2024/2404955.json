 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMP) program supports efforts to significantly increase the numbers of students matriculating into and successfully completing high quality degree programs in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) disciplines. LSAMP also supports the production of scholarly research in STEM broadening participation. Particular emphasis is placed on transforming undergraduate STEM education through innovative, evidence-based recruitment and retention strategies, and relevant educational experiences especially of racial and ethnic groups historically underrepresented in STEM disciplines. These strategies facilitate the production of highly competitive students motivated to pursue graduate education or careers in STEM. For the United States to remain globally competitive, it is vital that it taps into the talent of all its citizens and provides exceptional educational preparedness in STEM areas that underpin the knowledge-based economy.  Alabama A&M University (AAMU), partner institution in the Alabama Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation, is an Historically Black 1890 Land Grant University which will host its first LSAMP Bridge to the Doctorate (BD) program for the 2024-2026 academic years.  \r\n\r\nThe overarching goal of the proposed project is to augment educational and research opportunities in the fields of biology, physics, food science and plant/soil science for 12 academically talented students, thus increasing the numbers of students on the pathway to STEM graduate degrees. An integrated and comprehensive approach of academic support will be employed that includes multi-layered mentoring, advising, financial support, research, and STEM professional development over 24 months. An utilization-focused evaluation will be conducted. The results of this project will be disseminated widely through national publications, educational institutions and social media outlets focusing on STEM graduate education.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
