 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides participant support for younger and broader groups of researchers to attend the Titans of the Tiny Symposium at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, 12-13 July 2024. The symposium focuses on research and development activities in nanoscience and nanotechnology in the last thirty years, as well as perspectives for the future. World renowned researchers present their research results on nanoscience and nanotechnology in oral sessions. The symposium impacts the materials science, chemistry, physics, biology, and engineering communities. Priority is given to participation by women and under-represented minorities, which promotes diverse participation at the symposium. This award benefits the nation through the education of a skilled science and engineering workforce, which is better prepared to provide transformative solutions to the challenges in their chosen fields. This symposium plays an important role in supporting and sustaining the field of nanoscience and nanotechnology, which has important applications in energy, medicine, microelectronics, and quantum technologies, which are National priorities.\r\n\r\nThis participant support is expected to benefit the students\u2019 and young researchers\u2019 professional, scientific, and technical development. Attendance at the symposium gives the students and young faculty a broader view of nanoscience and nanotechnology, its fundamentals, and specifically its impact in surface coordination chemistry, catalysis, photonics, theory and modeling, microscopy, particle synthesis and shape control, metal-organic framework and supramolecular chemistry, organic materials, life and bioscience, lithography, polymer synthesis, materials discovery, and manufacturing. At the symposium, concepts and challenges in nanoscience and engineering are identified and presented, and attendees chart new paths forward in the field and rally a new generation of researchers toward them. The symposium is attended by US and international researchers, which provides an opportunity for a variety of perspectives to be presented and discussed. The symposium is an opportunity for participants to showcase their scientific accomplishments and interact with peers and colleagues in academia, government laboratories and industry.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
