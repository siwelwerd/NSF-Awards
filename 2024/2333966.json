 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports participation in a conference on group theory in Fairfield, CT on December 2nd, 2023. This conference is the inaugural meeting of a planned annual conference series that will focus on various fields of algebra, on a rotating basis. Group theory, the theme of this first year, is a very active field of mathematics with important applications such as in cryptography. This event will help facilitate the creation of a cohesive algebraic community in New England and the New York metropolitan area. The NSF funding will allow for travel support of graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and early career faculty. The meeting is intended to re-create local networking opportunities in algebra, which became less frequent as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, and to create mentoring opportunities for early career mathematicians. \r\n\r\nThe first meeting of the Fairfield Algebra Regional Meeting (FARM) will consist of a series of talks for a daylong event. There will be four longer plenary talks (45 minutes or longer). There will also be three slots for half-hour talks for invited speakers and contributed talks (run in parallel). The talks will give the opportunity to showcase mathematicians from different career stages. A variety of different areas of group theory will be represented, including applied group theory, finite groups, infinite groups, and geometric group theory. More information is available at the conference website http://faculty.fairfield.edu/pbaginski/FARM2023/index.html\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
