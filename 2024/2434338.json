 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Texas at El Paso will pilot a Computing Alliance of Hispanic Serving Institutions (CAHSI) Embedded Ethics in Computer Science (CS) approach that integrates ethical reasoning into CS core courses through contextualized open-source, embedded ethics modules focused on Artificial Intelligence (AI). AI is a key driver that has the potential to positively impact the day-to-day operations of our citizens, business, and regional economic development in underserved communities. On the other hand, AI-based products may be harmful or unjust, especially if ethical considerations are not deliberated during the development of such systems. Preparing future CS and AI graduates to consider the ethical and social implications of their work is essential in assuring that such systems are fair, equitable, and inclusive. It is imperative that development of AI products involves researchers and developers who are prepared to consider ethical and social implications of their work and who have lived experiences that bring to bear their unique perspectives to technological solutions. This Computing in Undergraduate Education Transformation project will create modules that can embed ethical AI concepts into core CS courses. The modules reinforce the importance of ethical considerations, particularly concerning AI, as part of computing education. Students will be exposed to thinking through the ethical and social implications of their work and attuned to decision making using an inclusive and intersectional lens. The proposed work is a fundamental step for investing in AI education at Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs). \r\n\r\nFormed in 2006 with funding from NSF\u2019s Broadening Participation in Computing and INCLUDES programs, CAHSI has a distinguished history of working with HSI computing departments to learn from each other, adopt effective and promising practices, and move toward systemic change. This project will bring together six CAHSI institutions, each involving a faculty member from CS and another with deep expertise in philosophy or ethics to integrate ethical reasoning into CS core courses through contextualized open-source embedded ethics modules focused on AI. The effort will be based on key concepts and learnings from Harvard\u2019s Embedded EthiCS and Northeastern\u2019s Value Sensitive Design (VSD) approaches, which embed ethical dilemmas throughout the CS curriculum. Experts on both approaches will consult on the project and assist in transferring the innovative approaches from Embedded EthiCS and VSD to Hispanic-Serving Institutions. Led by CAHSI with its effective collective impact approach, the project team will bring together experts who have knowledge about Hispanic Servingness, effective pedagogical practices, ethics, and AI. Departmental chairs at the institutions on the pilot project are committed to changes in the CS curriculum. The novelty of the project is: (a) the open-source ethical modules resulting from the project will be enhanced with instructional notes, scenarios, and assignments/exercises that are contextualized with the local experiences of the students, community, and institution; and (b) the documentation supported by the CAHSI Collaborative Learning Community will facilitate adoption beyond CAHSI. The pilot will result in open-source modules contextualized for HSIs and a model for providing the support needed for other institutions to adopt the approach and adapt the modules. CAHSI Ethics in CS modules developed by this project will be made available through open-source repositories for adoption and enhancements by those within the CAHSI alliance and beyond. Industry and governmental entities will benefit from students graduating with competencies in ethical AI.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
