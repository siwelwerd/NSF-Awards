 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Major Research Instrumentation Project (MRI) supports the acquisition of a Time-of-Flight Aerosol Chemical Speciation Monitor with eXtra resolution (TOF-ACSM X) and a Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer (SMPS) in order to conduct aerosol research at northern high latitudes. These instruments will enable research in several key areas including urban air pollution under cold and dark conditions, aerosol production from boreal forest fires, biogenic secondary organic aerosol chemistry, and indoor air quality. Major broader impacts include new understanding which could help bring Fairbanks and Alaska into air quality compliance, as well as advancing air quality and climate research for ten University of Alaska faculty members. In addition, the instruments will facilitate the mentoring of undergraduate and graduate research projects, give students training on air quality and mass spectrometry, provide critical information on emission control strategies, and broadly address air quality concerns in Alaska\r\n\r\nResearch projects to be enhanced by this instrument acquisition include new research into urban air pollution in both cold and dark conditions, the response of secondary sulfate formation to primary sulfur emission controls, the main contributions to surface aerosol concentrations following reductions in sulfur and wood smoke, the chemical composition and evolution of boreal forest fire smoke, among other topics. Results will be shared with the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation (ADEC), the Fairbanks North Star Borough (FNSB) air quality division and affected communities. Additionally, high school and middle school students will be engaged via the Alaska Statewide High School Science Symposium and Science Fair. Finally, a series of videos will be produced to demonstrate the importance of aerosol and air quality, which will reach affected Alaska tribal communities, among others in Alaska.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
