 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is a novel, surgically implanted device for treating female stress urinary incontinence (SUI). Nearly 50% of women in the U.S. will suffer from stress urinary incontinence with age resulting in over 40 million suffering women by 2050. No pharmacological solutions currently exist and mesh-based midurethral slings (MUS) are the mainstay surgical option, even though they are associated with various long-term complications, challenges, and risks. Furthermore, all SUI repair products on the market are polypropylene mesh-based with no alternatives available. This project aims to address this gap in options with a mesh-free, sling-free, outpatient transvaginal repair device for female urinary incontinence.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to develop and validate a novel, transvaginal surgical procedural technology for treating stress urinary incontinence. This project progresses findings from the SBIR Phase I project which demonstrated functional proof-of-concept biomechanical feasibility. This Phase II project aims to further the surgical procedure and system in a manner suitable for human use. The scope of technical activities includes design optimization, mechanical testing and validation, surgical procedure validation, biocompatibility testing, and histological characterization in a series of benchtop, cadaveric, and animal studies. The scope of the activities will be conducted in accordance with practices needed to demonstrate chronic implanted safety and efficacy in pre-clinical models in order to gain eventual U.S. regulatory approval.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
