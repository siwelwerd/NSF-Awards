 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biomedical imaging is essential for physicians to diagnose diseases quickly and safely without complex invasive procedures. However, most imaging techniques struggle to penetrate the body deeply or capture the intricate details of small biological entities like cells and biomolecules. This project proposes a groundbreaking solution by developing a technology that combines deep tissue imaging with the ability to discern extremely small cellular components. Utilizing ultrasound waves and near-infrared light, this approach is set to offer unparalleled insights into both tissue depths and cellular behavior, potentially changing the way diseases are diagnosed and treated. Doctors will find this initiative particularly beneficial, as it will equip them with advanced tools for more precise internal assessments, contributing to superior treatment plans. Furthermore, the project is committed to making this innovative imaging technology both affordable and accessible, empowering physicians to make more informed decisions regarding patient care. The project also aims to promote educational equity by providing enhanced research opportunities and STEM resources to underserved communities and underrepresented groups in STEM. It endeavors to introduce science and engineering education to young students in local schools, preparing them for diverse STEM careers. Through an interdisciplinary, student-focused educational approach that incorporates multimedia, research, and teamwork, the project seeks to nurture a future workforce in STEM fields.\r\n\r\nBiomedical imaging is essential for rapid and precise clinical diagnoses, yet it struggles with achieving both deep tissue penetration and high spatial resolution. Traditional methods like MRI, CT, and ultrasound offer deep tissue screening but lack details at the cellular or organ levels, whereas optical bioimaging techniques provide high resolution at the organelle level but with limited penetration depth due to photon-tissue interactions. To address these challenges, this project introduces an innovative biophotonics approach by developing near-infrared (NIR) mechanochemical biophotonic transducers. These transducer molecules are designed to harness ultrasonic waves to trigger NIR chemiluminescence, merging the depth of ultrasound imaging with the high resolution of NIR imaging. This synergy aims to reveal molecular and sub-cellular structures in deep tissues facilitated by gas droplets to amplify imaging signals. With high-resolution, multicolored, and 3D imaging capability at unprecedented depths, this technology has the potential to enhance medical diagnostics and personalized treatments significantly. The project focuses on creating non-invasive imaging tools and pioneering new research avenues in ultrasound induced biophotonics. This advancement could facilitate affordable deep-tissue imaging techniques, significantly impacting clinical decision-making and patient care experience.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
