 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national interest by effectively preparing students to pursue careers in data science and data analytics that address current trends in both academia and industry. Importantly, this project seeks to respond to the increasing demand for data science expertise through an innovative data analytics minor that combines data science with the development of communication skills. These critical skills include understanding ethical considerations around data analytics, self-efficacy in team communication, and effectively communicating findings to various stakeholders in appropriate formats. A new collaboration between the math department and the writing center bolsters the potential impact on students pursuing a variety of STEM degrees.  Through a combination of professional development for faculty and curricular revision of existing courses, this project aims to transform the student experience at Simpson College and provide a model for other small liberal arts institutions. Ultimately, this project has the potential to positively impact the prosperity of the STEM workforce and many STEM-adjacent industries and professions. \r\n\r\nThe project seeks to accomplish the following four objectives. First, is to increase the number of students in the revised data analytics minor. Second, is to improve data analytics self-efficacy and competency for students completing the minor. Third, is to create a STEM communication repository of resources. Fourth, and finally, is to contribute to a better understanding of data fluency self-efficacy, competencies, and course outcomes resulting from collaborations between writing across the curriculum (WAC) experts, writing centers, and data analytics faculty. Many WAC initiatives focus on written power skills, and despite growing interest, there are few useful models of how written, oral, visual, and electronic (WOVE) skills should be integrated into STEM pathways. The math department and the writing center will work closely together to develop, put into practice, and evaluate the effectiveness of the WOVE interventions and the self-efficacy pedagogies. This collaboration will advance evidence-based practices for improving data fluency and for integrating WOVE into the teaching of data science, an undertaking that, so far, has been bereft of comprehensive and practical research findings. The project seeks to explore questions centered on student self-efficacy and communication by modifying skills evaluation instruments and conducting faculty interviews. Project outcomes and results will be disseminated broadly through publications, presentations, workshops and repositories. The NSF IUSE: EDU Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through its Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
