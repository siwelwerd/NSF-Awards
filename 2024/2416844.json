 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Chemical Structure and Dynamics (CSD) program in the Division of Chemistry, Professor Claudio Margulis of the University of Iowa and Professor Andrew Nieuwkoop of Rutgers University are investigating the structure and dynamics of ionic liquids (ILs) and more specifically what they call their \u201cliquid inside a liquid\u201d behavior using a variety of experimental and computational techniques. A challenging aspect of the work is that it deals with an \u201cin-between\u201d dynamical regime in which ILs are too viscous for sophisticated liquid-state NMR techniques but too soft for solid state NMR; this challenge extends also to the computational realm as highly viscous ILs, such as those close to their glass transition, are difficult to simulate. The PIs will use a combination of advanced NMR techniques, scattering, and computer simulations, to jointly investigate intra- and inter-ionic dynamics in an atom-selective manner for a set of selected ILs. Collaboration with Prof. Sharon Lall-Ramnarine from Queensborough Community College and her students as well as other scientists will continue to broaden the reach of the work.\r\n\r\n\r\nProfessors Margulis and Nieuwkoop will probe whether the charge network present in all ILs and the apolar domain present for some ILs, each slow down at a different rate; in other words, if the charge network (the matrix) \u201crigidifies\u201d first and only at lower temperature do the secondary motions of the apolar domain slow down. The study of specific ILs across a range of temperatures could also shed light on structural population changes in the condensed phase. Their discoveries could impact our understanding of fundamental phenomena such as how ions move on time scales relevant to transport phenomena; they could also shed light on recently discovered, but not yet understood, liquid-liquid phase transitions in ILs. Finally, Professors Margulis and Nieuwkoop will continue to engage students from community college, graduate students, and postdocs as well as colleagues at symposia and conferences where vibrant scientific exchanges on ILs will take place.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
