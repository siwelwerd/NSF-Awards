These MSCs are bound by an organic backbone within a fibrous mesophase, forming an ideal hybrid material where the inorganic and organic components are nearly equal in proportion. Recent work revealed their ability to self-organize into complex, hierarchical structures, displaying intriguing optical characteristics. These findings open up new avenues in understanding and manipulating the self-assembly of such hybrid materials. The goal of the project is to explore the chemical formation mechanisms of these hybrid materials, focusing on their fibrous scaffold backbone, and modifying their composition to cover a wider range of the optical spectrum. This research is poised to significantly advance knowledge in materials chemistry, particularly in the control and organization of hybrid materials. It explores the fundamental principles of self-assembly, potentially leading to new synthetic methods and deeper insights into natural self-assembling systems. The societal benefits of this research are manifold. Optical metamaterials, for instance, have potential applications in advanced technologies like sensors, energy storage, and biomedicine. This project also focuses on educational and diversity aspects, including mentoring underrepresented groups in science, developing outreach programs, and creating educational materials to inspire future scientists. The integration of research with education and outreach ensures that this project not only advances scientific knowledge but also contributes to the national health, prosperity, welfare, and the education of a diverse, skilled workforce.\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\n\r\nA distinct goal of materials chemistry is to develop self-assembling hierarchical materials from nanoscale building blocks. Deciphering the intricate interplay between structure and property in these systems stands as a pivotal enabler for the rational design of advanced optical devices and paves a pathway towards emulating the structural sophistication found in nature. Among the synthetic building blocks that could be used, colloidal, inorganic magic-sized clusters (MSCs) emerge as compelling candidates. The main objective of this project, funded by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program in the Division of Materials Research, is to elucidate the formation mechanisms of MSC-based materials, particularly investigating how chemical interactions within these clusters lead to fibrous self-organization and the resulting unique properties. The experimental approach for these investigations includes modifying the chemical composition of the MSCs, specifically targeting the organic scaffold component, to understand its role in the fibrous mesophase formation. The project will also develop a library of optically active films within the visible range. By focusing on the fundamental aspects of nanoparticle self-assembly and the interplay between chemical composition and physical properties, this project aims to contribute significantly to the field of materials chemistry, specifically in the area of hybrid nanomaterials. The understanding gained from this research could have broader implications for the synthesis of novel materials with tailored optical and structural properties. The outcomes have wide-ranging societal implications, including potential applications in advanced technologies. The project also commits to education and diversity, mentoring underrepresented groups, and developing educational resources, aligning with NSF's mission to advance science, national health, prosperity, and welfare.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
