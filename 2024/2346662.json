 "awd_abstract_narration": "Since the 1890s The University of New Hampshire (UNH) has maintained its two scientific quality natural history collections\u2013the Albion R. Hodgdon Herbarium and the UNH Collection of Insects and Other Arthropods\u2013for research, teaching, and outreach. With over 913,000 specimens combined, these collections are the largest and most active in New Hampshire, and they are the best representation of historical and contemporary plant and insect diversity for New Hampshire, as well as macroalgae for coastal New England and adjacent Canada. Recently, the two collections were united under the umbrella of the UNH Natural History Collections Complex to establish a hub for biodiversity research and education at UNH, and a new natural history collection space has been designated as part of a major renovation of the biology building. By providing modern, high capacity, compacted cabinetry specifically for the long-term storage of plant and insect specimens, this award will ensure the health, accessibility, and expansion of New Hampshire\u2019s premiere natural history collections. This award will enable UNH\u2019s natural history collections to support current and future research on the distribution and diversity of biodiversity in response to natural and anthropomorphic forces, serve as a reference for organism identification, provide teaching material for courses in biology and natural resources, train new biodiversity professionals, and engage the public in with New Hampshire\u2019s natural heritage.\r\n\r\nPlanned activities of this project include (1) Acquisition and installation of two full sets of modern cabinetry for natural history specimens on compactor rail systems \u2013 one for the Albion R. Hodgdon Herbarium and the UNH Collection of Insects and Other Arthropods \u2013 to prevent environmental damage to existing specimens and allow for the expansion of both collections for a minimum of 30 years; (2) A lecture series focused on the research applications of natural history collections for understanding the biodiversity of New England; and (3) Dissemination of mobile outreach kits for K-6 classrooms in New Hampshire. The expected outcomes will address (1) The preservation, growth, and increased long-term accessibility of vital scientific infrastructure at UNH and for the state of New Hampshire; (2) Increased use of collections and exposure to biodiversity for diverse courses at the University of New Hampshire; and (3) Enhancement of grade school curricula that fosters awareness of biodiversity.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
