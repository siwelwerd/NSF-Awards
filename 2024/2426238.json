 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support meetings of the Pacific Northwest Geometry Seminar (PNGS) to be held at the University of British Columbia (2025), Seattle University (2026) and Lewis & Clark College (2027).   Active researchers in geometry are scattered throughout the various colleges and universities involved in the Pacific Northwest Geometry Seminar. The PNGS meetings will bring these researchers together for consultation, collaboration, and stimulation of new ideas, and will give graduate students an excellent opportunity to see the broader picture of research in geometry. The meetings are also valuable for the growing number of geometers working at some of the smaller universities in the region, such as Pacific University, Seattle University, and Idaho State University. Conference support will be especially targeted toward graduate students, early career researchers and members of groups underrepresented in mathematics. \r\n \r\nThe meetings will feature five to six invited research talks by leading experts in differential geometry and geometric analysis, as well as three to four shorter talks by junior researchers or graduate students.  The meetings will also include discussion sessions in which the speakers and participants assess the state of various areas in geometry and highlight open problems in these areas.  For the first meeting at the University of British Columbia the grant will support travel of US based participants only.   More information can be found on the conference website:  https://sites.google.com/view/pnwgeometryseminar/home.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
