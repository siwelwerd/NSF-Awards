 "awd_abstract_narration": "High-performance composite materials, known for their combination of lightweight, high stiffness, strength, and toughness, have the potential to significantly reduce operational costs and enhance the performance of assets in industries such as energy, automotive, and aerospace engineering. Despite notable recent advancements, there is currently a lack of an effective predictive modeling and optimization framework to aid in designing these advanced composite materials, considering the optimal nonlinear behavior and complex geometries of the constituents. This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award addresses this challenge through an integrated educational and research program. The research program focuses on advancing the state-of-the-art composite modeling and design capabilities for composites involving nonlinear behavior and potential damage under extreme loading conditions. This framework will be utilized to uncover the fundamental relationship between the microstructure's constituent properties, geometries, and structural performance. A comprehensive educational plan is to train the next generation of professionals with a strong background in composites to meet the nation\u2019s growing demand for high-performance materials. \r\n\r\nThe goal of this CAREER award is to elucidate the microstructure-property-performance relationship for composite materials by developing and exercising an efficient and accurate multiscale reduced order modeling and design framework. First, an adaptive multiscale reduced order model for rapid multiscale analysis and probing of the material response space will be developed. The model will consider realistic composite material behavior with a focus on viscoelastic behavior and damage of the matrix, damage of the reinforcement, and cohesive debonding of the material interface. The multiscale model will be thoroughly verified against direct numerical simulation and validated using experimental data for different hybrid composites. Finally, the model will be incorporated into a multi-resolution gradient-based reduced order design (material and shape) framework that enables the efficient design of hybrid composite microstructures. The modeling and design framework will empower us to develop advanced composites with tailored mechanical properties. It also has the potential to inform and guide advanced manufacturing techniques, facilitating precise fabrication of materials with optimized microstructures.\r\n\r\nThis project is jointly funded by the Mechanics of Materials and Structures (MoMS) program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
