 "awd_abstract_narration": "Meniscus injuries are common in the United States, with over one million people needing surgery every year. Inner meniscus injuries present a challenge due to their inability to heal naturally as the inner zone lacks blood supply. Due to the poor intrinsic healing capabilities of the inner avascular meniscus, poor functional healing even after surgical repair often leads to tear propagation, meniscus deterioration, and subsequent osteoarthritis (OA). While current treatments alleviate symptoms, there are no options that can consistently induce healing of inner meniscus tears. There is a need for innovative strategies that promote functional healing and improve quality of life. This Engineering Research Initiation (ERI) project aims to develop a new type of bioadhesive using a substance called hydrophilic polydopamine (hPDA). Polydopamine (PDA) resembles the structure of adhesive proteins secreted by marine mussels, showcasing robust wet adhesion to diverse materials. Unlike traditional PDA, which is insoluble in water, hPDA is water-soluble and also exhibits strong adhesion properties. This project will test this hPDA-fueled bioadhesives in lab settings to see how well it supports meniscus repair. If successful, this could lead to better treatments for meniscus injuries, reducing pain and improving mobility for many people. Further benefits to society will be achieved through graduate and undergraduate student education, mentoring, and training at South Dakota State University.\r\n\r\nThis ERI project proposes to synthesize and characterize water-soluble hPDA from PDA particles and thin films, which will then be incorporated into hydrogel-based bioadhesives. The specific objectives of this project are to: (1) understand the mechanism of adhesion of hPDA with meniscus tissue and different hydrogel components and (2) develop a bioadhesive that provides improved mechanical integration and stability, promoting accelerated healing through meniscus tissue repair and regeneration. This ERI project will test hPDA-fueled bioadhesives in vitro to evaluate their degradation behavior and regeneration potential using an explant culture model. The successful completion of this project has the potential to significantly advance the field of meniscus repair by providing a more effective treatment option. Additionally, this research could extend to the repair of other musculoskeletal connective tissues such as cartilage, tendon, and bone.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
