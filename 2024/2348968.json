 "awd_abstract_narration": "The three-year REU Site: Plastic Initiative at the University of Rhode Island will be hosted by the University of Rhode Island (URI). The URI Plastics Initiative actively involves students with the issue of plastic waste in the U.S. and worldwide, especially how the effects on coastal areas. With the rise in plastic use and pollution, the project will engage ten participants each year in research ranging from different ways to detect and clean up plastics to providing advice to chance negative consumption patterns and making a positive impact on our environment. During the 10-week program, students will have the opportunity to investigate and understand the causes and consequences of plastic pollution and design and implement possible solutions.  Working with a diverse student cohort and faculty mentors, participants will engage with a variety of stakeholders, providing non-academic perspectives, and contribute to the understanding of plastic pollution, along with preparing for the next generation of science and engineering professionals in this field.\r\n\r\nThe three-year REU Site: Plastic Initiative at the University of Rhode Island will be hosted by the University of Rhode Island (URI). The REU Site URI Plastics Initiative is an interdisciplinary educational program addressing the urgent challenges of local plastic waste management, with the focus on mitigating its impact on coastal ecosystems. Motivated by the increasing demand for plastics and pollution rates, the initiative encompasses research areas such as the development of advanced tools for detecting plastics, microplastic removal techniques, investigation into ecological and human health impacts of plastics, and exploration of societal and economic interventions. The program aims to assess the interdisciplinary participation's impact on teaching and learning, mentorship effects, and the influence of networking and collaboration. Broader impacts include diverse student recruitment, fostering collaborations with institutions in Rhode Island and beyond, providing non-academic perspectives, and contributing to the understanding of plastic pollution, thereby positively impacting the next generation of science and engineering professionals. The initiative's outreach efforts extend to partnering with the Guiding Education in Math and Science Network initiative for K-12 science teacher training.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
