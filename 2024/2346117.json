 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this Pathway to Enable Open-Source Ecosystems (POSE) Phase II project is to further develop the ecosystem for the Open-Source Leg prosthesis, which gives researchers access to a fully capable, standardized hardware and software platform. The intent of the Open-Source Leg is to lower the barrier to studying the challenges of controlling robotic prosthetic legs, which is among the greatest obstacles hindering their widespread use and clinical impact. The Open-Source Leg enables researchers to more easily study and compare different control strategies without the prohibitive cost of developing a robotic leg from scratch. The overarching goal of this research is to accelerate the impact of the Open-Source Leg through the development of open-access materials and community interaction. \r\n\r\nTo realize this vision, the aims of this project are threefold. First, the team will foster community engagement through purpose-built scaffolding mechanisms, including continuous communication with users, development of educational resources, and community events. Secondly, the team will further enhance its open-source infrastructure, leveraging web-based development tools for continuous integration and deployment. Finally, the team will assess and act upon the effectiveness and sustainability of the Open-Source Leg ecosystem to ensure its success and establish a foundation for long-term sustainability.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
