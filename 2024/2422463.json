 "awd_abstract_narration": "This BCSER Individual Investigator Development (IID) project will build the PIs expertise in STEM education research study design, research methods, and data analysis techniques to complement their Biological science expertise. In addition, to planned professional development the project will support a pilot STEM education research project. The pilot is designed to result in new knowledge about artificial intelligence (AI) based tutoring tools and their efficacy in undergraduate biology classrooms on Biology instruction and student learning outcomes by performing a meta-analysis of the existing literature. This work is important because of the increasing use of AI-based tools in STEM classrooms.\r\n\r\nThe project will result in a systematic review of existing research studies that have examined the use of AI-based intelligent tutoring systems in undergraduate biology courses and a meta-analysis to assess effectiveness of these AI-based tools in enhancing undergraduate biology student learning. The work is also expected to result in the identification of potential areas where further research may be necessary on these AI-based tools. Project findings will be shared through publications and presentations. The success of this project will be assessed through regular meetings with the mentors and/or advisory board.  \r\n\r\nThe project is supported by NSF\u2019s EDU Core Research Building Capacity in STEM Education Research (ECR: BCSER) program, which is designed to build investigators\u2019 capacity to carry out high-quality STEM education research.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
