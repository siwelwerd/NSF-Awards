 "awd_abstract_narration": "NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\n\r\nResearch in quantum materials has led to the discovery of many novel materials with exotic physical properties, which are essential for future technologies. A special group of material known as iridium oxides has attracted much attention because they promise to help us understand unusual quantum states. Extreme conditions such as high pressure could reveal unexpected quantum states that are useful for advanced technologies. This project, supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program in the Division of Materials Research at NSF, aims to systematically explore new quantum states in iridium oxides under high pressure. It also provides thorough training for all participating students, as well as visiting students and professors through the visiting scholar program, focusing on advanced experimental and computational techniques for creating and studying a wide range of materials in the principal investigators' laboratories.\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\n\r\nQuantum phenomena driven by strong spin-orbit coupling are among the most important topics in modern materials chemistry and physics communities. This project aims to elucidate the complex relationship between crystal structure, chemical bonding, and strong spin-orbit coupling in iridium oxides, synthesized under high pressure and high temperature. Experimentally, the research will focus on exploring Ruddlesden-Popper structural motifs, Srn+1IrnO3n+1 (n= 1, 2, and infinity) to understand exotic magnetism, Mott Insulators, electronic behaviors, and potential for superconductivity. Chemical doping will be systematically applied to adjust electron counts and elicit a variety of quantum states. Concurrently, theoretical simulations, utilizing Dynamic Mean Field Theory (DMFT), will offer vital insights into the intricate interactions that facilitate the emergence of exotic quantum states in iridates. The project will enable transformative research in using high pressure and high temperature to assist quantum materials discovery and study. The outreach and educational initiatives will enhance broader impacts by fostering the development of the next generation of scientists in quantum materials and high-pressure techniques. This includes the establishment of annual workshops and visiting scholar programs, with a priority for women and underrepresented minority students, to cultivate a diverse community of experts in this cutting-edge field.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
