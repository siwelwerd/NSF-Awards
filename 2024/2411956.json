 "awd_abstract_narration": "Numerous studies have found that racially marginalized students in STEM and other disciplines tend to exhibit quantifiably better outcomes when at least some of their instructors are racially marginalized scholars. However, there is insufficient research on how and why this phenomenon occurs. Several competing explanations have been proposed, but to date there is little causal evidence to establish which explanation(s) are correct, in part because of fundamental methodological challenges. \r\n\r\nThe Amplifying Diverse Voices in STEM Education (ADVISE) project will use a cluster randomized experiment across four HSIs and five PWIs to test the causal effects of bringing racially marginalized guest lecturers into college STEM courses. The overarching goal of this collaborative project is to better understand and compare individual- and group-level psychological and sociological processes such as student belonging, stereotype threat, classroom climate, and instructor pedagogy, and how guest lectures may affect these processes in ways that can promote equitable and effective STEM education. Outcomes, mediators, and moderators will be measured using repeated-measures surveys and FERPA-compliant institutional data on student course grades and persistence in STEM majors. Internal and external project evaluation will use a collective impact model to ensure effective, equity-focused STEM education research. Findings will be disseminated through academic presentations and publications as well as reports and publications for policymaker and practitioner audiences in higher education and STEM fields. Beyond basic science contributions to social psychology and sociology and applied science contributions to higher education and STEM education, broader impacts are expected to include improved experiences and outcomes for thousands of college STEM students, professional opportunities for hundreds of early-career STEM scholars, and diversified professional networks for current STEM faculty.\r\n\r\nThis collaborative project is funded by the EDU Racial Equity in STEM Education activity, which is supported by the Directorate for STEM Education (EDU). This activity supports research and practice projects that investigate how considerations of racial equity factor into the improvement of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education and workforce. Awarded projects seek to center the voices, knowledge, and experiences of the individuals, communities, and institutions most impacted by systemic inequities within the STEM enterprise. Programs across EDU contribute funds to the Racial Equity activity in recognition of the alignment of its projects with the collective research and development thrusts of the four divisions of the directorate.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
