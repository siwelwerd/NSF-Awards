 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Research Expereiences for Undergraduates (REU) site in theoretical and experimental physics at the University of Texas at Dallas (UTD) will develop the research, problem-solving, and communication skills of eight REU Fellows. The Fellows will be matched to a project from a broad range of physics topics and participate in cutting-edge, meaningful, research. Projects will include investigating quantum computing, studying materials at very low temperatures, investigating the physics of plasmas, space science research to improve telecommunications, biophysics research aimed at positive health outcomes, and projects exploring the physics of the Universe. Fellows will gain valuable teamwork skills by collaborating with graduate students and other researchers in their mentor's research group and developing their ability to work independently. Workshops and seminars will help to prepare the Fellows for graduate school and scientific careers. REU Fellows will share their scientific results with the academic community and, when possible, will be invited to participate in community outreach activities during summer. Social interactions between Fellows will be fostered through cohort-building activities.\r\n \r\n\r\nBased on their interests and any prior research experience, eight REU Fellows will be matched to an experimental, computational, or theoretical project from areas including biophysics, space sciences, plasma physics, condensed matter physics, cosmology and gravitational physics. Each Fellow will be fully integrated into their mentor's research group. Early in the program, REU Fellows will attend workshops on topics foundational to research, e.g., computer programming. They will present at weekly REU meetings, summarizing their research progress and goals for the following week. Special workshops such as scientific paper writing and graduate school applications will equip and inform Fellows. The Fellows will share their results at a campus-wide research symposium at the end of the program, and they will also be encouraged to present at conferences after the program concludes. When possible, they will also contribute to writing scientific papers based on their research. Assessment of the program will be made using questionnaires, via informal conversations with Fellows and mentors, and in consultation with an external advisory board. The program will be modified appropriately based on these findings. The program will open up the pool of potential high-tech employees essential for the nation's economic growth and prosperity. The REU Site will enhance the general infrastructure of research and education at UTD and facilitate the recruitment of graduate students who are more representative of the nation. A more inclusive student body will enrich the campus experience and have a positive long-term impact on outreach to the broader local and national community.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
