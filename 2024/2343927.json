 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Conference on Econometrics and Mathematical Economics (CEME) holds a series of annual conferences on research issues in economic theory and statistical methods for the analysis of economic data. The purpose is to stimulate discussion and research in these areas, and to investigate the application of cutting edge mathematical, statistical, and computational techniques to economic research questions. The conferences focus on a variety of topics in statistical methods and economic theory. Each topic conference meets once each year. The conferences are broadly interdisciplinary, including researchers from mathematics, operations research, and computer science. They also facilitate communication between academic scholars and government economists, since the statistical methods covered are important for many government economists. There are special workshops aimed at young econometricians and young economic theorists. Conference locations include universities around the United States.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
