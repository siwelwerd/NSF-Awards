 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 3rd Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Symposium on Computer Science and Law (CSLaw) is scheduled for March 12-13, 2024 at Boston University and online.  CSLaw provides a venue for discussion of the latest research, developments, and trends in the at the intersection of computer science and law, much of which is tightly related to cybersecurity and privacy topics. Students will attend technical paper presentations, poster sessions, and panel discussions to learn about new research findings and trends.\r\n\r\nComputer science and law have long existed in parallel, with occasional overlaps in areas such as export controls.  In recent years, the two have had increasing overlaps, so the ACM CSLaw conference was formed to address research in this area.  Most of this research focuses on security & privacy topics.  The event brings together computer scientists and law scholars in a unique venue. Providing support to students to attend CSLaw will provide knowledge sharing, increased visibility of the students\u2019 research (and awareness by the students of others\u2019 research), and career development opportunities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
