The support will be used to more fully enable participation by early career members and students. The conference will allow participants to disseminate results and have discussions surrounding the latest progress in science enabled by the low radioactive background of the underground facility including searches for dark matter, rare decays of isotopes, and accelerator based studies of neutrinos. These topics are aligned with NSF scientific program areas with the Physics Division.\r\n\r\nThis award will help fund participation in the conference by providing travel support to enable a wider range of participants with support going to early career scientists including those from underrepresented groups. These scientists will have the opportunity to present and obtain feedback by presenting at the conference (talk or poster). Furthermore, these scientists will benefit from discussions with other scientists working on similar topics and thus will transfer useful knowledge. This project is jointly funded by the experimental particle, particle astrophysics, and nuclear physics as well as the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
