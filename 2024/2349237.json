 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site and a Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) site in physics at the University of Utah.  The REU site will support eight undergraduates per year in summer physics and astronomy research projects.  The RET site will support two-four teachers per year in six a week summer cohort-based research project in experimental cosmic-ray physics.  The Department of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Utah currently offers a wide variety of research opportunities and has a rich history of developing and managing high-quality, cohort-based summer research programs both for its own students and those visiting from other institutions.\r\n\r\nThe objectives of the REU and RET programs at the University of Utah are to: 1) engage students in full-time active research; 2) provide professional development opportunities for students and mentors; 3) motivate students towards science and STEM careers by constructing an engaging, inclusive, and supportive cohort experience; 4) improve students\u2019 science literacy and oral and written communication skills; 5) engage in-service teachers in cohort-based research on experimental cosmic ray physics; 6) help teachers develop a deeper understanding of science processes and practices; 3) help teachers leverage their research experiences in their teaching practices. To accomplish these objectives, participants will engage in a variety of activities that encompass: a) rigorous and diverse research projects; b) professional and career development workshops; c) enculturation into the scientific community; d) community building; and e) personalized mentorship.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
