 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader/commercial impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to reduce the chemical use in the form of fertilizers and pesticides and promote tree crop agronomy. Lands being cultivated for centuries now mostly rely on fertilizers and other chemical solutions to maintain yields. Nutrient management plays a key role in tree metabolism, growth, yield and the aesthetics of crop, pest, and stress resistance which determines crop yields. Nutrient consumption is increasing annually with a current consumption of 19 million metric tons in US that is projected to grow to 117 Megatons in 2027. Agricultural emissions contribute to 11.2% of US emissions which challenge our sustainable development goals for 2050. The methods of application of these fertilizers negatively impacting our environment via acidification of soils, toxification of water bodies, harming pollinators, increase emissions and unnecessary economic costs. This project aims to create a single approach to address the multitude needs of tree crops, thereby promoting economic and environmental sustainability in fruit and nut tree crops. \r\n\r\nThis project focuses on designing a state of the art, unified and stand alone, easy use kit for diverse species of fruit and nut tree to provide regular nutrient, growth, biotic-abiotic stress and pest management from single node on a tree trunk that will cover the entire tree canopy while imparting zero environmental exposure. Such a quantum leap forward in chemical resource management and zero environmental toxification for holistic tree care is possible by integrating bio science and engineering to build a sustainable tree nutrient delivery kit based on Microelectromechanical systems, which bio-mimic the xylem hydraulic system, correlate the energy that drives the transport and allow for compatibility with anatomical structures. This proposal investigates the xylem hydrodynamics and tree susceptibilities to identify and obtain design conditions, needs, and risks in engineering the system. For the kit to function efficiently from single site it is important to control both axial and radials flows to achieve adequate distribution across the tree. The merit of this method is in engineering both flows and ability to distribute wide range of solutions with various viscosities, dosages and flow rates.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
