 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the summer school\r\n\u201cC*-Algebraic Quantum Mechanics and Topological Phases of Matter\u201d,\r\nwhich will take place July 29-August 2, 2024, at the University of\r\nColorado at Boulder. This workshop will be an opportunity for graduate\r\nstudents and postdocs from a wide variety of institutions and\r\nbackgrounds to learn about the interplay between algebraic\r\nquantum mechanics, topology, and condensed matter theory. There will be\r\nproblem sessions to help participants better learn the topics\r\npresented. Materials from the conference will be disseminated broadly:\r\nThe talks will be filmed and posted on the Rocky Mountain Mathematical\r\nPhysics Seminar YouTube Channel. Problem sets and course notes will be\r\nmade available on the summer school webpage. This will create a\r\npermanent resource for all those seeking to learn the topics of the summer\r\nschool. Another goal is to give some early-career researchers an opportunity to disseminate their\r\nwork. This will be done through contributed talks by junior\r\nparticipants. The event will also create opportunities for junior\r\nparticipants to interact with the speakers and more established\r\nresearchers. Funding from the NSF will make it possible to support\r\nparticipants who would not be able to attend without support and will\r\nbe primarily offered to graduate students and postdocs.  More information about the summer school can be found at https://sites.google.com/colorado.edu/caqm.\r\n\r\nThe scientific goal of the summer school is to explore how C*-algebras\r\nare used to study topological phases of matter in the thermodynamic\r\nlimit, and how methods from topology can be applied in this setting to\r\nstudy phases of quantum systems. Topics will cover background on\r\nC*-algebras and the topology of state spaces, lattice spin systems,\r\nLieb-Robinson bounds, automorphic equivalence and symmetry protected\r\nphases. In the study of quantum many-body systems with infinitely many\r\ndegrees of freedom, the thermodynamic limit is often of practical and\r\nconceptual importance. A precise mathematical description of such\r\nsystems requires the use of a C*-algebraic formulation of quantum\r\nmechanics, a formalism that comes with deep insights and technical\r\nchallenges in equal measure. C*-algebraic quantum mechanics has a long\r\nhistory, with notable discoveries in the seventies, including Lieb-\r\nRobinson bounds and the Doplicher-Haag-Roberts description of\r\nsuperselection sectors which continue to spur modern research in\r\nmathematical physics and condensed matter physics. In just the past\r\nfive years, C*-algebraic quantum mechanics has provided the basis for\r\ncutting edge research on the rigorous classification of topological\r\nphases of matter. This summer school will bring some of the foremost\r\nexperts in the field to teach the next generation of mathematical\r\nphysics, providing students with both a strong foundation in the\r\nC*-algebraic formalism and a broad view of active frontiers of\r\nresearch.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
