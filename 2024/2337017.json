 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national interest by (1) improving programs preparing novice college mathematics instructors and (2) establishing leadership development for faculty who are the Providers of teaching-focused professional development (TPD) for those novices. Extensive educational research has identified evidence-based instructional practices that support undergraduates' persistence and learning in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). For undergraduates to benefit from advancements in instructional practices, novice instructors (e.g., graduate students) need opportunities to develop expertise in those practices. For novice instructors to develop that expertise, Providers (i.e., those who facilitate TPD for instructors) themselves need opportunities to develop expertise in teaching about teaching. Providers face daunting challenges: no curricular packages (e.g., textbook, assessment items) exist for teaching graduate students how to teach mathematics. This effort builds upon previous work addressing these needs through workshops for Providers and creating a library of individual activities for TPD. Experienced Providers will assemble lessons from the library of activities, create assessments of learning about teaching, and teach new Providers about use of these packages. An innovation in the project is attention to a particular group of Providers, whose ambitions include scholarly work related to the development of novice instructors. These Provider-Scholars will be the next generation of leaders in this field. Greater Provider skill will improve instruction by novices and boost learning opportunities and outcomes for undergraduates. \r\n\r\nThe goals of the project are (1) to develop curricular packages for learning about teaching college mathematics which will be piloted by Providers and (2) to build new research-based understanding of the knowledge, skills, dispositions, and communities Providers develop as they grow professionally into Provider-Scholars and Stewards (i.e., Provider-Scholars who also have leadership roles). Project research and evaluation will use a mixed-methods convergent design so complementary data are collected concurrently or, as appropriate, sequentially. This approach combines the strengths of quantitative data collection and analysis (e.g., large sample, repeated measures) with those of qualitative methods (e.g., participant voices, rich detail). In particular, the exploratory research questions are: (RQ1) What is the nature of Provider-Scholar knowledge, skills, and dispositions for engaging in scholarly work as Stewards? (RQ2) What is the nature of Steward, Provider-Scholar, and Provider engagement in the work and community growth? Project evaluation questions are: (EQ1) To what extent is project exploratory research implemented as planned? (EQ2) To what extent is the project succeeding in developing and piloting starter packages and Provider orientation with target communities? (EQ3) How can the project do better in supporting the professional community, including stewardship and leadership capacity development? The project intends to build professional community through collaborative working groups of experienced Provider-Scholars and education researchers. Mathematics graduate students (94% of whom have teaching related responsibilities while in graduate school) will benefit from the strengthening of TPD programs achieved by equipping new Providers with \u201cstarter packages\u201d of resources informed by research findings about student-responsive teaching and learning. A robust community of Providers whose scholarly activity is about TPD will seed the next generation of leaders. The NSF IUSE: EDU Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through its Institutional and Community Transformation track, the program supports efforts to transform and improve STEM education across institutions of higher education and disciplinary communities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
