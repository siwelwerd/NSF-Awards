 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program in the Division of Chemistry, Professor Sun's group at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, is developing methods to facilitate chemical analysis by Neutron Activation Analysis (NAA), an important method for discerning the identity and abundance of chemical elements in a sample.  His innovative approach aims to eliminate the reliance on calibration materials and to extend the tools for imaging analysis, with potential applications in agriculture, industry, medicine, and the military. The project is providing valuable research training for students underrepresented in STEM, preparing them for future STEM careers.  Additionally, Dr. Sun is creating advanced course materials on \"Nuclear Activation Analysis\" which will be made available online.\r\n\r\nUnder this award, Professor Sun\u2019s group will advance the quasi-absolute method (QAM) and incorporate QAM calculations into neutron radiography to generate 3-D concentration images of target nuclides. They use neutron flux measurements and Monte Carlo simulations to optimize QAM, validate the pulse activity equation, customize NAA calculation software, and employ 3-D imaging reconstruction techniques to visualize isotopic distributions in samples. By amalgamating contemporary data mining techniques with traditional radioanalytical approaches, the overarching goal is to advance the understanding and application of nuclear activation analysis and nuclear imaging across diverse scientific disciplines.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
