 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Annual Computer Security Applications Conference (ACSAC) is a top-tier venue for quick and wide dissemination of cutting-edge research results in computer security applications. The conference's novelties are based on high-quality technical sessions, workshops, training sessions, keynotes by distinguished speakers, artifacts competition, case studies, panels, national interest discussions, work-in-progress talks, and poster sessions. The 2023 ACSAC conference consists of approximately 59 technical papers across a wide spectrum of computer security and privacy domains. The hard topic theme of the 2023 conference is \"Trustworthy Systems.\" The conference's broader significance and importance are reflected in its agenda, which explores some of the most intriguing and pressing challenges in the discipline, highlighting open avenues for further work in these areas. Participation in the conference is thus a valuable opportunity to students and is an important part of graduate education in cybersecurity.\r\n\r\nThis award provides travel support to encourage participation in the 2023 Annual Computer Security Applications Conference by students who would normally find it difficult to attend. Criteria for selection include evidence of a serious interest in the field as demonstrated by statement of research, curriculum vitae (CV) showing research output, coursework and/or project experience, a letter of recommendation from a research adviser or faculty member confirming that the student is in good standing, and a justification of financial need. Organizers encourage participation of women and students from other under-represented groups in computing.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
