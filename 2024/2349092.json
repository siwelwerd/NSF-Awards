 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-year REU Site: Exploring Intelligent Technologies Shaping Future Smart Cities hosted by   the University of Nevada, Reno is designed to engage undergraduate students in unique research experiences with cutting-edge technologies and the future of smart cities. Ten students each year will investigate technological advancements in mobility, management of solar energy, infrastructures, and operations and system security. The goal is to create young researchers who understand and can contribute to the progression of scientific knowledge by solving future technological, environmental, and social challenges in transitioning to smart and sustainable ways of living. Participants will engage in experiential learning in research labs, working closely with a faculty mentor and the research team. Students will also participate in professional development about STEM careers, the ethics of research, communication of research results, and field trips to local companies. \r\nThis three-year REU Site: Exploring Intelligent Technologies Shaping Future Smart Cities hosted by   the University of Nevada, Reno is designed to engage undergraduate students in unique research experiences with cutting-edge technologies and the future of smart cities. This unique 10-week summer program will offer students opportunities to engage in research and explore technological advancements in four key areas: mobility, management of solar energy, infrastructures, and operation and system security. The diverse expertise of faculty mentors coupled with state-of-the-art resources offers students access to 10 unique projects with hands-on in a research-focused, experiential learning environment. Research activities will be complemented by field trips to local companies featuring cutting-edge technological advancements being implemented in different sectors of the industry. A variety of professional development activities will enable participants to address the non-technical and ethical aspects of research. This REU program will give students the full experience of how research is conducted ethically, communicated effectively, applied in practice, and how it can be made accessible to others through educational outreach activities.\r\n\r\nThis project is jointly funded by the EEC REU and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCOR).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
