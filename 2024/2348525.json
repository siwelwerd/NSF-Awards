 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 21st Annual Combinatorial Algebra meets Algebraic Combinatorics (CAAC) conference is scheduled to be held at the Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al from Friday, January 26, 2024, to Sunday, January 28, 2024. Since its inception in 2004, the CAAC meeting has annually provided a unique platform for the dynamic interaction between combinatorial algebra and algebraic combinatorics. Emphasizing inclusivity, the conference has traditionally fostered a supportive environment for graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and early career researchers to engage with established mathematicians, present their work, explore new research directions, and establish collaborative relationships.\r\n\r\nOver the years, CAAC conferences have gained popularity, attracting a growing number of participants and contributing significantly to the mathematical community. The upcoming CAAC 2024 conference aims to continue this tradition by featuring four invited 50-minute lectures, contributed talks by graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, software demonstrations, and a poster session. Recognizing the importance of inclusivity, all talks will be streamed online, enabling broader participation from mathematicians unable to attend in person. The conference also seeks funding to support participants from the United States, fostering collaboration, knowledge dissemination, and the advancement of students and postdoctoral fellows in the fields of algebraic combinatorics and combinatorial algebra. Further details and updates about CAAC 2024 can be found on the conference website: https://sites.google.com/view/caac2024/home.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
