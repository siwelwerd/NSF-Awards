 "awd_abstract_narration": "This conference award is to support 17 fellowships to early career researchers presenting papers at the 26th International Congress of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics (ICTAM), to be held in Daegu, Korea, 22-27 July 2024. The ICTAM is organized under the auspices of the International Union of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics (IUTAM). This award provides partial support and networking opportunities for US early career researchers presenting research papers at the ICTAM, held every four years. It presents a unique opportunity for researchers to interact with colleagues working in mechanics from around the world, to build research and education networks and to learn about science diplomacy as it pertains to the field of mechanics.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the 2024 USNC/TAM Presenters Fellowship is to increase the number of scientists and engineers from US institutions, with an emphasis on graduate students and junior researchers, especially those who have not previously attended an ICTAM meeting. Beside the international strategic opportunity to present US mechanics on the international stage and the international experience gained by participants, the USNC/TAM mentoring activities will further advance mechanics by increasing participation and developing a cohort of junior researchers. \r\n\r\nThis project is jointly supported by the Mechanics of Materials and Structures (MoMS) Program in the Division of Civil, Mechanical, Manufacturing Innovations (CMMI) and the Fluid Dynamics (FD) Program in the Division of Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental and Transport Systems (CBET).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
