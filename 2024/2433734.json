 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact of this I-Corps project is the development of microsensors for real-time monitoring of fuel cell membrane degradation in electric vehicles. This diagnostic tool will provide researchers with valuable insights into degradation mechanisms, allowing for targeted improvements in performance and durability. By increasing the efficiency and reliability of hydrogen fuel cells, this technology will contribute to environmental sustainability. The technology also holds the promise of economic benefits by reducing reliance on limited natural resources. By exploring various market segments and conducting extensive and intensive customer discovery, starting with fuel cell electrical vehicle companies, the project will enhance the understanding of existing methods and customer challenges. The potential commercial impact on the transportation industry and companies focused on sustainable clean energy development using hydrogen fuel cell power systems will be thoroughly examined. This comprehensive approach will help identify new opportunities and refine the technology to effectively meet market demands.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. This solution is based on the development of ion-sensitive microsensors, chosen for their affordability, compactness, durability, and suitability for continuous real-time monitoring of fuel cell membrane degradation. In low-temperature proton exchange membrane fuel cells, radical attacks cause polymer chain breaks and irreversible reactions, leading to thinning of the ionomer and the release of fluorinated and other degradation materials into the reactant outlet streams. These attacks compromise the performance and stability of the membrane electrode assembly. To combat this, the technology employs highly fluoride-sensitive membranes for microsensors, integrating them into a thin insulator layer in the transistor gate. The choice of insulator layer enhances the sensor's selectivity and sensitivity. The design includes an extended gate field-effect transistor, which separates the gate from the transistor, facilitating better integration with the fuel cell exhaust system. Small changes at the gate influence the drain-source current, enabling sensitive, label-free detection at the part-per-billion level. This innovative solution aims to provide effective monitoring of fuel cell membrane degradation, thereby improving the performance and durability of fuel cells.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
