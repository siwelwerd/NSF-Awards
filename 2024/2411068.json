 "awd_abstract_narration": "The E=mc2 project develops a community-driven cyberinfrastructure for simulating cosmic events such as binary neutron star and black hole-neutron star mergers. These cosmic collisions are incredibly energetic, emitting observable gravitational waves, electromagnetic waves, and neutrinos. Such \"multi-messenger\" observations provide critical insights into general relativity, nuclear physics, and plasma physics. The insights gained through these simulations promote the progress of science and enhance national scientific capabilities. By creating an open-source, high-performance simulation software framework, the project supports education and diversity, fostering a broad and inclusive scientific community. The cyberinfrastructure integrates into the Einstein Toolkit, making it widely accessible and facilitating interdisciplinary collaborations that benefit society by advancing knowledge in fundamental physics.\r\n\r\nThe E=mc2 project aims to develop the first open-source, exascale-capable numerical relativity and general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics cyberinfrastructure with realistic neutrino transport capabilities. This involves creating new codes based on Monte Carlo and moment schemes for neutrino modeling, and high-performance software compatible with both CPU and GPU architectures. The project will leverage existing frameworks like AMReX and the Einstein Toolkit, ensuring that the developed cyberinfrastructure can fully exploit modern high-performance computing resources. Key deliverables include modules for GPU-enabled particle-based neutrino simulations, a fully tabulated equation of state module for relativistic hydrodynamics, and advanced code generation tools to optimize performance. These tools will be rigorously tested and validated to ensure reliability and efficiency. The project also includes extensive community outreach and education efforts, including summer schools and workshops to train new users and expand the user base, ensuring sustained impact and community engagement in computational astrophysics.\r\n\r\nThis award supports research in relativity and relativistic astrophysics, and it addresses the priority areas of NSF's \"Windows on the Universe\" Big Idea.\r\n\r\nThis award by the Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure is jointly supported by the National Science Foundation's Big Idea activities in Windows on the Universe (WoU) and the Physics at the Information Frontier program in the Division of Physics in the Directorate of Mathematical and Physical Sciences.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
