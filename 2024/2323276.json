 "awd_abstract_narration": "Tensegrities are special structures composed of compression struts connected by a continuous network of tension cables in a state of prestress. These structures exhibit extreme properties such as low-mass and weight, high-resilience, high-strength, and rich-tunability. These properties can be harnessed for use in engineering applications and potentially exceed the performance of currently established solutions. In addition, tensegrity structures have been used in an increasing number of engineering applications, including deployable domes, tunable antennas, and sustainable adaptive solar arrays to name a few. From a geometrical perspective, tensegrities have been shown to be scalable: applications ranging from large space structures to the micro and nano scales have proven their cross-scale applicability. Although many have viewed the prestress requirement as a hindrance to further development of tensegrity structures, this project explores this burgeoning trend by continuing to examine the premise that prestress requirements enable tensegrities to be deployable, tunable, and morphable. This research project will contribute theoretical, computational and experimental capabilities to advance the field of tensegrity structures and metamaterials, and to discover novel modes of tensegrity functionality. The research will be complemented by establishing a flexible educational and outreach program based on curriculum development, training demonstrations, and increasing awareness of these structures by disseminating our findings and tools, in addition to sharing investigator experiences broadly to the public and research communities. \r\n\r\nThe goal of the research is to achieve a deep understanding of tensegrities in order to: (i) design or find tensegrities in any geometry, with the possibility of holes and openings, allowing for application specific tensegrity designs; (ii) use additive manufacturing to conduct rapid prototyping and proof of concept of new designs; (iii) construct and manufacture large-scale application-oriented tensegrity structures (e.g. human-scale), document the experience, and disseminate the challenges and solutions; (iv) design programmable/reprogrammable tensegrity-based metamaterials and study their dynamic characteristics using a Bloch wave analysis framework; and (v) investigate the influence of prestress level to change the size and distribution of band gaps within the tensegrity metamaterial. Specifically, this project should lead to the creation and analysis of elegant Class-1 (\u201cfloating struts\u201d) reprogrammable tensegrity metamaterials, and large-scale tensegrity structures which may be used in the design of temporary shelters or structural component protection, among others. As such, it will advance the knowledge base in structures, theoretical and computational mechanics, manufacturing, and materials engineering.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
