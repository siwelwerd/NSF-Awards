 "awd_abstract_narration": "Through the Leading Inclusive Transformation in the Geosciences (LIT GEO) program, geoscientists from North Carolina Central University, University of Puerto Rico-Arecibo, and East Carolina University will develop an Intercultural Network of research and Learning Ecosystems. By leveraging the strengths of different academic institutions, LIT GEO will develop awareness strategies to contribute to culturally transformative practices in geoscience. This project will provide insight into how capacity building programs contribute to creating inclusive environments enabling diverse graduate students and post-doctoral scholars to pursue long-term careers in geoscience. Research opportunities in LIT GEO will center on community-based geoscience in North Carolina and Puerto Rico. LIT GEO will support research, training, and mentoring via: (i) a post-baccalaureate (PB) bridge program into graduate study, (ii) Master\u2019s (MS) programs, (iii) post-doctoral (PD) and faculty training in culturally relevant methodologies in teaching, mentoring, and research, and (iv) professional development for community members. \r\n\r\nLIT GEO will support: 35 PB, 16 MS students, and 4 PD scholars from diverse backgrounds and >20 faculty participating in training and research with communities. Yearly, cohorts will consist of 17 students and PD scholars, with a total of 55 non-faculty participants over 5 years. Geoscience research centered around community needs will provide tangible outcomes to residents while demonstrating the societal value of geoscience. LIT GEO will support capacity building of community organizations to connect communities and academic researchers via equitable models of partnership. The network will create long-lasting structures of cooperative and inclusive mentoring environments across institutions and with communities. LIT GEO will build upon 5 competencies (diversity, community science, communication, leadership, and data literacy) to provide capacity building. Intercultural Summits in NC and PR will provide training, workshops, and field experiences in partnership with communities facing environmental challenges. Activities throughout the year will include professional development with speakers from diverse cultures and backgrounds via an Emerging Geoscience Scholars Seminar Series, workshops that apply the core competencies, and cohort building activities that expand participant experiences and build trusting environments and cultural belonging. Institutional agreements will generate cultural transformational processes to enable internship programs, mentorship, research, and building graduate curriculum with access to courses across the network, maximizing faculty contributions among institutions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
