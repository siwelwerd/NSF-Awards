 "awd_abstract_narration": "This NSF award supports the Midwest Topology Seminar, from 2023 to 2026, a continuation of a previously supported regional conference series in algebraic topology that meets three times per year and rotates between universities in the Midwest and Great Lakes areas. The next two meetings are at Loyola University (March 2024) and Indiana University (Spring 2024). The Midwest Topology Seminar has been running continuously since the early 1970s, with at least one of the yearly meetings held in Chicago, the hub of the network, and is a long-standing, reliable, low-key, and low-cost way for participants to keep up with the field. The audiences are always large and diversified, drawing faculty and graduate students from a broad range of institutions. The Midwest Topology Seminar serves as a nexus for a vibrant community of research mathematicians, optimizing the distribution of new ideas through the field, especially among early career research mathematicians and mathematicians away from the traditional centers of research.\r\n\r\nThe Midwest is a traditional and continuing center of algebraic topology; hence there is a strong source of local speakers. Programs are augmented with featured speakers from around the country. Algebraic topology has always been broadly construed to include homotopy theory, algebraic K-theory, geometric group theory, and high dimensional manifolds; more recently the series has explored connections to algebraic geometry, representation theory, number theory, low dimensional manifolds, and mathematical physics.  Financial support will go to graduate students and research mathematicians with limited funds from other sources. The conference web site is http://www.rrb.wayne.edu/MTS/.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
