 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 2024 SIGCOMM conference will take place from August 4, 2024 to August 8, 2024 in Sydney, Australia. This proposal seeks funding to support 12 US-based graduate students for attending this conference and associate workshops. Participation in conferences such as SIGCOMM forms a central part of the graduate school experience as it provides students with an opportunity to interact with senior researchers from academia and industry and exposes them to leading-edge research in the field. In particular, students will be exposed to new ideas in emerging areas of networking, thereby broadening their intellectual horizons. In particular, the mentorship program and topic preview sessions help ensure students are engaged and get the maximum benefit from attending the conference.\r\n\r\nThis project integrates research and education of students through exposure to a premier technical meeting in computer networks and communications. Students will have the opportunity to observe high-quality presentations and interact with senior researchers in the field both in the main conference and the associated workshops. The proposed student participation will have a positive impact on the quality of their research. The travel grant co-chairs are committed to encouraging the participation of women and under-represented. The SIGCOMM conference has developed into a top-tier international conference, presenting a tremendous opportunity for students to expand their breadth of ideas, research skills, and technical perspective.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
