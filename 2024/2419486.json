 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader/commercial impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be the development of a new additive manufacturing technique for ceramic materials. Technical ceramics provide unmatched performance in harsh environment applications found throughout the energy, defense, healthcare, and IT sectors. Applications requiring miniaturization or process intensification would benefit from a novel additive ceramic manufacturing that can form internal microfeatures and combine different materials into functional layers for chemical reactions, imaging, or energy transfer. This proposal will advance from proof-of-concept to a functional prototype of a dry powder pressing additive manufacturing printer. This work will improve our understanding of the fluidization and aerosolization of ultrafine and dense nanopwders that are prone to compaction and static adhesion. The high-resolution from dry powder pressing additive manufacturing will lower monolith fabrication cost an order of magnitude to accelerate the adoption of emerging ceramic technologies. No existing ceramic production technology can combine multiple functional materials in the same layer or produce internal flow features at the proposed sub-mm scale. The technology will be leased or sold to advanced ceramic fabricators to enable further technology developments in the ceramics industry. The manufacturing will first be applied to the energy market, but has the potential to impact defense and health imaging technologies as well.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to scale the throughput capacity of a dry-powder pressing additive manufacturing technique that can fabricate multifunctional ceramic monoliths with internal flow structures. Five key capabilities distinguish dry-powder pressing additive manufacturing from existing ceramic additive manufacturing methods: i) applicability to materials not amenable to laser sintering, ii) co-deposition of multiple materials with high lateral precision, iii) densification of materials typically incapable of pressureless sintering to full density, iv) a quality control step can reject a layer prior to adhering to prior layers, and v) co-deposition of fugitive material can form internal gas routing that eliminates costly and complex ceramic sealing technology in harsh environment applications. The proposed work will advance the technology by creating a high-throughput printing system to deposit patterned 50 cm2 layers in a single pass, representing a 100x throughput increase. Automation will also address two precision targets; layer deposition below 7.5mg/cm2 and lateral resolution less than 0.5mm. The scope of work will advance the science of dry powder deposition and transfer to refine the processing capability for thinner layers and finer microfeatures while simultaneously engineering a high throughput device representative of pilot-scale manufacturing.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
