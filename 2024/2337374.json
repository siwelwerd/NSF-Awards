 "awd_abstract_narration": "Being able to talk to family, friends, and at school is very important for children. Communication devices can help people with physical disabilities. However, many communication devices need someone to touch a screen or look at words to work. This can be hard for children with cerebral palsy and other movement disorders. New brain-computer interfaces that do not require surgery could help. These could help children communicate and feel less alone. But the grid layout of these interfaces can be confusing. Real-life pictures, like photos, could make it easier. However, it is unknown how to best use them, which is the goal of this CAREER award. Thjs project will redesign brain-computer interfaces to include real-life images. This will make the devices easier for children with physical disabilities to use. College students will also learn about new brain-computer interfaces through this research. In the end, this work will help people understand and accept children with disabilities. Improving their communication will also help enhance children's quality of life.\r\n\r\nThis CAREER award helps make new communication tools for people with physical disabilities. Brain-computer interfaces often use a brain signal known as the P300 for control. Many P300 tools use grids with letters, like a 6x6 grid. Showing items in real-world scenes can help children who do not understand single grid symbols. These scenes keep real-world sizes and spaces of items, which can help with talking, and learning to use the P300 tool. This research looks at using real-life pictures in P300 brain-computers. It studies how brain activity is different between grids and scenes. It also checks how real pictures and highlighting change brain signals. Finally, researchers will find out what designs children like best. Building new communication tools can help improve children\u2019s quality of life. It also teaches students about new communication tools, preparing them for future jobs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
