 "awd_abstract_narration": "NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\n\r\nScientists are on a fascinating mission to create super-tough materials that withstand extreme conditions like blistering heat, immense pressure, and even radiation. One way to achieve this is to use a special ingredient known as \"interfaces,\" which are like secret codes in nanostructured composites that determine their unique properties. Recently, an exciting discovery was made \u2013 unveiling a new type of interface known as a \"3D interface.\" It's like adding a new dimension to materials and holds immense potential. However, there's a twist \u2013 scientists don't fully understand how these 3D interfaces function, especially when they face radiation. The focus of this research is to use a material called Cu-Nb as a model to decode the secrets of these 3D interfaces. Two primary goals have been set: firstly, to understand the inner workings of these 3D interfaces at the tiniest atomic level, essentially taking a super-close look at them. Secondly, to explore how these 3D interfaces respond when exposed to radiation. This research will recruit high school students. The aim is to inspire the next generation's interest in science and engineering by offering research opportunities, workshops, and hands-on lab experiences, and to help prepare them for careers in the energy industry. Because these new materials have the potential to revolutionize the way we build things, particularly in the realm of nuclear energy, they could make nuclear reactors safer at lower cost. But the impact goes far beyond that \u2013 it can influence various areas, such as improving electronic devices like computer transistors. So, this mission is about understanding science and nurturing students' curiosity, preparing them for exciting careers, and ultimately collaborating with energy companies to create a better, more sustainable world. \r\n\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThe PI\u2019s research fundamentally focuses on developing advanced materials with exceptional resilience to extreme environmental conditions, encompassing high temperatures, mechanical stress, and radiation exposure. The materials in question are distinguished by their intricate microstructures, particularly the interfaces existing within them, which play a defining role in dictating their properties. A novel dimension in material science was unveiled with the discovery of 3D interfaces, a relatively new and intricate class of interfacial structures. These 3D interfaces exhibit a unique character, characterized by variations in chemical and structural attributes spanning a few atomic layers to tens of nanometers along the interface's normal direction. However, the underlying mechanisms governing the behavior of 3D interfaces, particularly in response to radiation, have remained a subject of limited understanding. This research focuses on a model material system, Cu-Nb, chosen for its suitability in exploring the intricacies of 3D interfaces. The primary research objectives encompass quantifying the varying short-range structural and chemical ordering within 3D interface structures and predicting and validating the stability and transition kinetics of these 3D interfaces when exposed to radiation. This entails a multi-faceted approach involving integrated experiments and computational modeling, with cross-validation playing a pivotal role. The significance of this work extends far beyond the confines of material science and into various practical domains. It has the potential to help identify structural materials that can endure the extreme irradiation conditions found in advanced nuclear reactors, which is an ongoing and critical challenge in the realm of nuclear energy. Furthermore, the insights derived from this research could hold relevance for interface-dominant behavior in diverse contexts, including the behavior of ultra-thin doping layers in advanced electronic components, such as FinFET transistors. Beyond its technical merits, this research strongly emphasizes outreach and education. It seeks to inspire and support both university students and local high school students, especially those from underrepresented groups, in their pursuit of careers in the energy industry. This educational component encompasses research opportunities, workshops, and hands-on laboratory experiences, aligning with the overarching goal of preparing the next generation of materials scientists and engineers for a range of applications across the energy sector and beyond.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
