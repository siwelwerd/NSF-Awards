 "awd_abstract_narration": "Savannah State University (SSU) in Savannah, Georgia will host an eight-week summer Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program in marine sciences for ten undergraduate students; the program will run for three years (2024-2026). The goal of this REU site is the early recruitment and support of undergraduate students, with a focus on recruiting students who have limited background knowledge of and access to academic research. The program includes a two-day research cruise opportunity for undergraduate students aboard an oceanographic research vessel and a specific emphasis on training non-traditional students, veterans, and students with disabilities. SSU's local partners include University of Georgia\u2019s Skidaway Institute of Oceanography and UGA MAREX Shellfish Laboratory. Each of the partners has experienced research mentors and high-level research facilities that provide an excellent environment for student research projects. Students are recruited nationally, and support provided to interns includes stipends, travel to and from the site, housing and an allowance for meals.\r\n\r\nPhase I of the REU program, or weeks 1-2, focuses on whole-group activities including short courses, guest lectures, field trips and visits to marine laboratories along the Georgia/South Carolina coast. Short course topics include introductory marine science lectures and fundamental research skills. During the six-week Phase II, students will focus research in their mentor's lab at SSU or one of the participating institutions. Each student will complete an oral and written presentation of their research and a program evaluation.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
