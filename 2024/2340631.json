 "awd_abstract_narration": "Networked Interacting Dynamical Systems (NetIDs) are ubiquitous, displaying complex behaviors that arise from the interactions of agents or particles. These systems have found applications in diverse fields, including ecology, engineering, and social sciences, yet their high-dimensional nature makes them challenging to study. This often leads to significant theoretical and computational difficulties, known as the \u201ccurse of dimensionality.\u201d Recent advances in applied mathematics have shed light on these complexities, revealing that complex NetID patterns can arise from low dimensional interactions. Building on these insights, this project is dedicated to developing a theoretical and computational framework to address the estimation problems within these models by exploiting the underlying low dimensional structures. The overarching goal is to create efficient, physically interpretable surrogate models that bridge the gap between qualitative analysis and quantitative data-driven applications, ranging from sensor network optimization to modeling the environmental and climate impacts on fish migration. This research program will provide research opportunities for both undergraduate and graduate students, featuring a graduate summer school at the intersection of NetIDs and machine learning. There will be a particular focus on engaging female and underrepresented minority students in this vibrant field, blending machine learning with differential equations. The project's findings will also enrich mathematical data science course materials for both undergraduate and graduate education.\r\n\r\nThis project aims to make fundamental mathematical, statistical, and computational advances for solving NetIDs' estimation problems. The research will focus on three primary areas: (1) Developing innovative sampling strategies for optimal data recovery in NetIDs with linear interactions by exploiting their inherent low-dimensionality in terms of sparsity, smoothness, low-rankness. (2) Establishing robust statistical estimation of NetIDs with nonlinear time-varying interactions by combining machine learning, numerical analysis, and functional data analysis to create physically consistent estimators that bypass the \u201ccurse of dimensionality,\u201d while exploring the identifiability and convergence as sample sizes increase. (3) Investigating the statistical predictive properties of Graph Neural Differential Equations, aiming to derive upper bounds for their transferability and generalization error. The results of this project are expected to address the computational challenges of large-scale Graph Neural Networks and bridge theory and practice in NetIDs research.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
