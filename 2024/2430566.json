 "awd_abstract_narration": "In a collaboration between the NSF Eddie Bernice Johnson INCLUDES Initiative and the NSF Research Experience and Mentoring (REM) programs, EArly-concept Grants for Exploratory Research (EAGERs) were considered under NSF Dear Colleague Letter 24-062 to broaden participation and develop the workforce in microelectronics through research experiences and structured mentoring. This project is establishing an academic training model that combines practical, hands-on research experiences and structured mentoring to deepen student engagement with cutting-edge technologies and methodologies in microelectronics fields. Junior level, undergraduate students majoring in electrical engineering or electrical engineering technology engage in research focused on generative artificial intelligence (AI) in semiconductor manufacturing to automate chip design, optimize production, and advance chip performance and energy efficiency. Faculty mentors guide students in research aligned with current industry challenges and use a conceptual framework, guided by the Anti-Deficit Achievement Framework, Social Cognitive Career Theory, and Prosocial Motivation, to enhance students\u2019 educational experiences.\r\n\r\nSection 10318 of the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 promotes research and \u201cinnovative approaches to developing, improving, and expanding evidence-based education and workforce development activities and learning experiences at all levels of education in fields and disciplines related to microelectronics,\u201d including partnerships that broaden participation in microelectronics education. Funds for this project were provided, in part, by the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022. This project is also funded by the Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMP), which aims to increase STEM degrees to underrepresented populations and supporting research on STEM participation and assessment of LSAMP program impacts.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
