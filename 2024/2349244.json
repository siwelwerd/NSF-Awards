 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Texas Algebraic Geometry Symposium (TAGS) will be held at Texas A&M University April 5,6, and 7, 2024, and in Spring 2025 and Spring 2026. TAGS is an annual regional conference which is jointly organized by faculty at Rice University, Texas A&M University, and the University of Texas at Austin. The conference series began in 2005, and serves to enhance the educational and research environment in Texas and the surrounding states, providing an important opportunity for interaction and sharing of ideas for students and researchers in this region.\r\n\r\nTAGS serves to ensure that members of the algebraic geometry community in the Texas region stay in regular contact and brings distinguished mathematicians and rising stars to an area with no other comparable regular gatherings in algebraic geometry. The 2024 TAGS will have nine lectures delivered by a diverse group of speakers, and will include accessible lectures for graduate students and a juried poster session for students and junior researchers. It will be held in conjunction with the annual Maxson lectures at Texas A&M  the week before and delivered by Prof. David Eisenbud. The TAGS website is https://franksottile.github.io/conferences/TAGS24/index.html.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
