 "awd_abstract_narration": "Maintaining a successful workforce pipeline in modern micro/nanotechnology and semiconductors is a critical national need. This project is designed to expand upon a foundational cleanroom training to fill an important and demonstrated high-tech industry need for job-ready cleanroom technicians. Community college students are in an ideal position to help meet these industry needs. This project intends to provide community college students and faculty with expanded access to and training in cleanroom facilities at the California NanoSystems Institute. These significant hands-on learning experiences in cleanroom facilities and additional curriculum will enable students to develop the knowledge, skills, and abilities necessary for successful employment in cleanroom technician and related positions. Through strong collaboration with industry partners, the project aims to strengthen the regional economy in micro-/nanotechnology and semiconductor fields by increasing the number of competitive local applicants for positions in these areas. \r\n\r\nThrough this project, Santa Barbara City College and the University of California Santa Barbara will expand a partnership to provide community college students with access to and training within cleanroom facilities. The goals of this project are to: (1) enhance industry relationships with community college faculty and students via workshops, tours, seminars and faculty meetings with the Industry Advisory Board; (2) expand training activities for community college faculty and students in the cleanroom facility; (3) broaden the community college student educational pathway to manufacturing jobs via industry-certified curriculum; and (4) expand community engagement, outreach and recruitment activities. This project intends to expand upon initial trainings for building a robust regional workforce pipeline to serve the larger micro- /nanotechnology and semiconductor industry and to prepare students for high-tech manufacturing positions. It is designed to serve as an on-going model of community college collaboration with local industry partners on industry-backed curriculum and student training. The partnership also presents an opportunity for a community college to leverage critical facilities provided by a nearby four-year institution that are fundamental components of hands-on student job training. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program and is supported in part by funds from Intel Corporation under the ETSTE DCL. The program focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
