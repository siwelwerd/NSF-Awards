 "awd_abstract_narration": "An award is made to Connecticut College to acquire a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) with Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS) capabilities to enable interdisciplinary scientific research and training in chemistry, biology, botany, environmental sciences, and anthropology. This project supports an integrated approach to teaching and research in which undergraduate students receive training in electron microscopy through classwork, laboratory work in classes, and faculty-mentored independent research resulting in peer-reviewed publications coauthored by students. There will be a strong, positive impact on the educational experience, training and retention of women, underrepresented minorities, and first-generation college students in STEM, all of whom are well-represented in the sciences and supported by the College through several programs, including Science Leaders and two POSSE Scholars cohorts. Collaborations with the nearby University of Connecticut at Avery Point and the U.S. Coast Guard Academy, as well as public outreach to local high schools via community partnership programs, will support the broader scientific community. The SEM/EDS will also allow multiple early career faculty to expand the scope of their research, all of which focuses on challenges of environmental sustainability, health and safety in both natural and urban environments. \r\n \r\nThe SEM/EDS fulfills major needs for seven distinct groups at the College and supports research in the following areas: (1) porous manganese oxide materials with potential use in catalysis, environmental remediation, and rechargeable battery technology; (2) photosynthetic microorganisms in water samples and ancient sediment cores; (3) wood formation in the model tree Populus; (4) feeding mechanisms and structures in marine invertebrate larvae; (5) morphological differences in strains of a pathogenic fungus threatening amphibian populations; (6) early invertebrate colonization of 3D-printed scaffolds for marine restoration applications; (7) uptake of heavy metals in soil role by mycorrhizal fungi; (8) archeological studies of indigenous and settler societies in North America.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
