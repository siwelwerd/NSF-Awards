The grant will be used exclusively for students in US-based institutions, and it will enable the supported students to travel to Utrecht, Netherlands to participate in the conference and its associated workshops. The funding will defray the registration, travel, and lodging costs for the students. \r\n\r\nIt will enable a life-enriching first-time experience for many students, giving them a taste of the research environment in both academic and industrial circles worldwide. ICDE is a premier conference in the area of databases, and participation in this conference will enable the students to enhance their scientific foundation and build their professional networks.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
