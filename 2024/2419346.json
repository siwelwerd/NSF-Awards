In-Space manufacturing under microgravity conditions enable unique materials characteristics and advanced semiconductor device designs with significantly higher performances, thus providing the most appropriate platform for meeting the technological and market demands. A novel class of semiconductor based composite materials with unique characteristics for numerous large scale emerging applications including, magnetic sensing, thermoelectrics, photovoltaic power generation, quantum computing devices, etc. will be developed. The proposed manufacturing plans will benefit the US national defense and civilian industry. The In-Space manufacturing platform will boost the yield and reliability for high performance device technologies, meeting the demand of the multi-billion US$ market. Lessons learnt from this project will accelerate the space materials production with potentially higher profit margins for sold goods and attract private sector investments in space manufacturing business.  This will help the US domestic industry to gain and/or maintain leadership in many critical technology sectors.  There is a need for higher throughput, higher iteration in-space R&D and manufacturing to drive to meaningful advantages, and this project will enable an acceleration of such translational R&D in semiconductors and other key sectors. Additionally, Workforce Development (WFD) for training engineers and technicians in Space based manufacturing are in perfect alignment with the priorities of the \u201cCHIPS for America\u201d Workforce Development plans.\r\n\r\nThis SBIR Phase I project proposes to create innovative component design and manufacturing approaches for developing two critical hardware necessary for In-space manufacturing and application of high purity semiconductor grade bulk crystals. A universal crystal growth capsule design will be designed and fabricated for leveraging microgravity conditions during crystal growth and providing high throughput of space grown materials. For processing high cost, low defect content premium space grown crystals, a novel wafer dicing tool for damage-free thin film fabrication directly from ingots will be developed. The universal capsule design will incorporate advanced high temperature fluid dynamics components that are necessary for maximizing the beneficial effects of microgravity on crystal growth.  The innovative wafer dicing tool architecture leverages advanced optics fabrication technologies for creating the dicing tool. The Phase 1 project will demonstrate crystal growth of single-phase alloy and multi-phase composites of semiconductor-based materials. Fabrication of micron-scale thick wafers with millimeter scale cross-section for discrete semiconductor device from bulk crystals will be demonstrated.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

A universal crystal growth capsule has been designed for high throughput bulk crystal growth from liquid phase, gas phase and solid phase reactions under microgravity conditions. Space crystal growth ampoule designs are significantly different than terrestrial crystal growth ampoules.&nbsp; The designs must account for Marangoni convections, absence of buoyancy and convection, vibration, and mechanical safety (for flight launches), ease for astronauts to handle and operate, precision designs to enable crystal growth using the thermal profiles in the space furnaces and leverage the micro-gravity conditions. Lack of standardized crystal growth ampoule design and fabrication process has hindered the high throughput of experiments necessary for scaling up manufacturing processes in space and the ability to reduce long cycle time for ampoule design, testing, and flight safety qualification process. The ampoule design must leverage microgravity conditions to enable a number of important attributes such as, (a) weightlessness for ultra-large diameter crystals, (b) container-less crystal growth to eliminate crystallographic defects, (c) exploit marangoni convection for enhanced melt mixing, (d) utilize g-jitters advantageously for periodic solutal deposition, (e) absence of buoyancy for uniform spatial alloy dispersion, (f) absence of natural convection to enforce controlled species diffusion, (g) orientation of residual gravity for nutrient feeding and strategies for raw material form factor delivery for space crystal growth with tailored nucleation. The <em>Archimedes</em> series of space ampoule design is an outcome of this project. This universal design provides low cost, high reliability, design flexibility and materials compatibility necessary for rapid prototyping, scaling up, high-throughput In-Space production of bulk crystals. It leverages advanced terrestrial large diameter container fabrication processes with high technology readiness level (TRL), suitable for: III-V, II-VI, IV-IV semiconductors, chalcogenide glasses, metallurgical alloys, multiphase composites, ceramics, bio-materials and polymer production in space. Another innovation outcome of this project is a smart-cut process for translating bulk crystals to micro-scale device layers. This is especially important for the economic viability of space manufactured materials-based applications. The astronomically high cost of space materials limits its use in large scale terrestrial systems. A smart-cut tool-kit has been designed and demonstrated to create micro-scale features in bulk semiconductor wafers. The successful demonstration of these hardware tools will accelerate the interest in commercial In-Space materials manufacturing in the immediate future.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 01/09/2025<br>\nModified by: Partha&nbsp;S&nbsp;Dutta</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2419346/2419346_10913535_1736403017698_Micron_features--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2419346/2419346_10913535_1736403017698_Micron_features--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Micro-features created using dicing tool\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2419346/2419346_10913535_1736403017698_Micron_features--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Micro-features created using dicing tool\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Micron scale sample features created using the dicing tool</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Partha Dutta, United Semiconductors LLC</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Partha&nbsp;S&nbsp;Dutta\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Micro-features created using dicing tool</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2419346/2419346_10913535_1736402816792_NSF_capsule--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2419346/2419346_10913535_1736402816792_NSF_capsule--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Space Crystal Growth Capsule\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2419346/2419346_10913535_1736402816792_NSF_capsule--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Space Crystal Growth Capsule\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Capsule for Bulk Crystal Growth in Space</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Partha Dutta, United Semiconductors LLC</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Partha&nbsp;S&nbsp;Dutta\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Space Crystal Growth Capsule</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2419346/2419346_10913535_1736402932508_Wafer_dicing_tool--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2419346/2419346_10913535_1736402932508_Wafer_dicing_tool--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Micro-dicing tool\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2419346/2419346_10913535_1736402932508_Wafer_dicing_tool--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Micro-dicing tool\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Dicing tool for creating micro-size films from bulk crystals</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Partha Dutta, United Semiconductors LLC</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Partha&nbsp;S&nbsp;Dutta\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Micro-dicing tool</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2419346/2419346_10913535_1736402682297_Archimedes--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2419346/2419346_10913535_1736402682297_Archimedes--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Archimedes Ampoule\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2419346/2419346_10913535_1736402682297_Archimedes--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Archimedes Ampoule\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Universal Ampoule Design for Bulk Crystal Growth in Space</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Partha Dutta, United Semiconductors LLC</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Partha&nbsp;S&nbsp;Dutta\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Archimedes Ampoule</div>\n</div>\n</li></ul>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n",
