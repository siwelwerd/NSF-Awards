 "awd_abstract_narration": "An award is made to the Smithsonian Institution to acquire a stable isotope ratio mass spectrometer and three associated peripheral devices to enable modern and deep-time interdisciplinary environmental research and education. This project directly supports research with societally relevant outcomes in climate change, ecology/biology, and anthropologic research which will be disseminated through the Smithsonian\u2019s many established platforms for public engagement including exhibits, social media, citizen science programs, and nature centers. As the world\u2019s largest museum, research, and education complex, the Smithsonian has a diverse team of researchers currently involved in this project, with a strong dedication and infrastructure available to support the next generation of early career researchers and scientists. In addition to internal researchers and external collaborators, this project aims to initially involve over 40 fellows, graduate students, and undergraduate interns, and has dedicated institutional support ensuring equity and inclusion in the anticipated future STEM research that will develop from this award.\r\n\r\nThis project will focus on tracking light stable isotopes as a means to investigate broad and compelling environmental issues in both modern and deep-time. Research areas include (1) modern, archaeological, and paleontological studies, examining life on a sustainable planet by providing data on dietary components, trophic structures, population dynamics and biodiversity, animal health, and migrations/movement; (2) climate change records in gases and other matrices that indicate greenhouse gas, temperature, and salinity changes in both the marine and terrestrial realms; (3) applying stable isotopes through an anthropogenic lens of current and past influence of human activity on and interaction with our global environment; and (4) understanding the American experience by using stable isotopes in archaeological remains to study population movements, health, and dietary factors throughout our history, including historically marginalized groups.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
