 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides travel and accommodation support for US-based participants in the workshop \"Women in Commutative Algebra III\u201d (WICA III). The workshop is hosted by CMO (Casa Matematica Oaxaca), a research center located in Oaxaca, Mexico, which is affiliated with the Banff International Research Station for Mathematical Innovation and Discovery (BIRS). The conference takes place on June 2-7, 2024. Commutative algebra is a vibrant field of mathematical research. It has connections to many other fields of mathematics such as geometry, number theory, topology, and combinatorics,  and has found many practical applications in recent years. The main objective of the workshop is to make advances in commutative algebra through state-of-the-art research.\r\n\r\nThe meeting will feature six research topics within commutative algebra: combinatorial commutative algebra, semigroup rings, toric ideals arising from degenerations of Grassmanians, arrangements of hyperplanes, reduction ideals of determinantal ideals, and invariant theory for group actions. Twelve group leaders will suggest problems for study and guide small teams in collaborative research during the meeting. WICA III will expand the research portfolio and collaborative network of the approximately forty participants in attendance. This workshop will create leadership opportunities and provide mentoring for early-career mathematicians, while also making an impact on those who are geographically isolated at their institutions.  More information can be found at https://www.birs.ca/events/2024/5-day-workshops/24w5185 and https://mathstat.dal.ca/~faridi/WICAIII.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
