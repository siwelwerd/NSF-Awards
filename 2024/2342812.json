 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to improve the understanding of how humans perceive and are aware of time, a key aspect of everyday life. Whether it is talking with friends, playing music, or performing tasks, a sense of timing is crucial. Remarkably, one can also judge one's own timing accuracy, such as knowing if one is early or late and by how much. This awareness helps to learn and improve timing skills. However, little is known about how these two processes, timing and self-awareness of timing, work together through learning. The objective of the project is to conduct a series of experiments to uncover which brain areas are involved in the awareness of time passing. Findings from this work may have implications for conditions in which timing perception is disrupted. Furthermore, the project includes cross-disciplinary research experiences for trainees, and scientists will engage in research-related outreach to local communities. \r\n\r\nTechnically, the project aims to investigate the neural mechanisms behind interval timing and metacognitive awareness in time perception, areas that are not well understood in cognitive neuroscience. To examine how humans recognize and learn from their own timing errors to improve performance, the project uses a combination of electroencephalography (EEG), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), and computational modeling to identify the brain regions responsible for these processes. The range of cognitive neuroscience methods provides trainees with valuable skills in experimental design and computational analysis. This research not only aims to expand knowledge of how humans learn and adapt to time intervals but also has potential implications for understanding and treating various mental health conditions where time perception is affected.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
