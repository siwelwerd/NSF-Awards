 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact of this I-Corps project is the development of a smart, wearable, ankle rehabilitation system to improve mobility. Currently, most patients do not receive adequate physical therapy treatment for walking disabilities caused by conditions such as stroke, cerebral palsy, Parkinson's disease, and sarcopenia (ageing). Also, care givers and therapists do not have the tools and time needed to target improved neuromuscular control of the ankle plantar flexor muscles during gait training. This technology addresses this shortfall by providing a wearable platform that can be used daily at home for personalized precision resistance therapy. In addition, this system allows individuals to train within the functional context of walking, thereby achieving repetitive, high-volume practice. The technology may transform the treatment of gait disorders, improve physical and mental health, and lessen the financial burden of individuals with neuromuscular impairments and age-related disabilities.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of a wearable rehabilitation system for individuals with impaired mobility due to a walking disability. The robotic system pairs targeted ankle resistance with a gamified ankle power biofeedback and may provide improvements in neuromuscular function and mobility. Applying adaptive resistance to the plantar flexion is immediately responsive to user input and fosters active engagement. In pilot studies, the device has been shown to work better than the current standard of care for delivering high-quality gait training. The solution matches the performance of high-tech motorized robotic exoskeletons. In addition, the absence of motors and heavy batteries may facilitate adoption by making it easier to use by individuals with weakness and those that historically do not adopt motorized solutions (e.g., older adults). This technology may create a foundation to treat neuromuscular impairment across a wide range of conditions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
