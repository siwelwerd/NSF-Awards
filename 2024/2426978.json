 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-technical Description:\r\nA major challenge in quantum computing is to maintain the quantum state for a long time (known as long coherence time) and to achieve controllable coupling between quantum bits. This three-year project aims to develop research and education capacities in the emerging field of quantum information science and engineering (QISE) at Hunter College, in close collaboration with Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and the University of Maryland. The research team proposes a quantum qubit system featuring both long coherence times and electrically tunable coupling between qubits. This approach uses solid-state spin defects for qubits and an electrically tunable persistent spin helix to control their interactions. This represents a new method for entangling remote spin qubits in solids. The project aims to train historically underrepresented STEM students from undergraduate to doctoral levels and to launch unique student internship programs that improve learning outcomes and foster collaborative research in QISE. The strategic emphasis lies in creating internships that blend educational elements with laboratory research, producing STEM graduates with unique skill sets who reflect the nation's diversity. The project offers students various opportunities to connect with local quantum communities through collaborative research projects, internships, and entrepreneurial ventures.\r\n\r\n\r\nTechnical Description:\r\nThe research objective of this project is to develop electrically tunable persistent spin helixes (PSH) and understand their exchange interactions with defect spin qubits as a novel method for quantum information processing. The research team from Hunter College, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, and University of Maryland pursues a spin defect qubit system that features both long coherence times and electrically tunable coupling between qubits. The collaborative research team explores the epitaxial growth of model cubic materials in quantum wells with specific crystallographic orientations and use electric fields to induce PSH. The team combines optical spectroscopy with electrical transport measurements to understand the spin dynamics of PSH, single qubits, and the exchange interactions between qubits mediated by PSH. The combination of the electrically tunable PSH and the spin defects offers an opportunity to integrate long coherence spin qubits with electrical control for developing a new two-qubit gate system. An integral goal of the project is to train the next generation workforce at the intersection of quantum information science and materials engineering. It addresses the critical national need to foster a diverse workforce capable of tackling challenges in quantum information science using materials science expertise. This initiative includes a robust student exchange and internship program, alongside innovative curriculum development, designed to enrich academic learning and research outcomes. The project provides comprehensive STEM training for historically underrepresented students from undergraduate to doctoral levels.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis award is co-funded by the Advancing Informal STEM Learning program and the Directorate for Mathematics and Physical Science, Office of Strategic Initiatives. This award is also co-funded by the Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program, which supports projects that build understandings of practices, program elements, contexts and processes contributing to increasing students' knowledge and interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and information and communication technology (ICT) careers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
