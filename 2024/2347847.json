 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will fund a workshop at Stanford University June 22-24, 2024, in conjunction with the annual Ecology and Evolution of Infectious Diseases (EEID) conference. The workshop will offer a mix of cutting-edge quantitative training and applied skills related to classic compartmental epidemiological models, estimating environmental response functions using Bayesian inference, and geospatial data analysis using Google Earth Engine. Students will learn how disease ecology models are applied in real-world scenarios from practitioners with experience working in public health and nonprofit sectors. The workshop will feature a dynamic schedule that intersperses quantitative and applied training sessions. This workshop will support scientific training and networking opportunities for at least 40 students from across demographic groups, institutions, and educational backgrounds in cutting edge quantitative and applied tools in disease ecology. The project-based instruction will encourage students to build collaborations among students that will help to form lasting bonds. Students will also receive hand-on instruction in small classrooms (~30 students per track) to ensure networking opportunities with the instructors. Several early-career instructors will receive teaching opportunities to showcase their work in an applied context and to build up their networks with students and post-doctoral scholars.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Participants formed a community, getting to know each other through small-group work throughout the workshop, and afterwards attended the 21st annual EEID conference, where they had the opportunity to network with over 420 participants from around the world. The workshop included quantitative training, based in R and Google Earth Engine programming platforms, aimed at helping students learn to incorporate environmental changes into models of infectious disease dynamics. Instructional materials were made freely available online for participants and the broader disease ecology community. The workshop also included applied sessions to help students connect disease ecology research to applications for public health, conservation, and public policy both in the US and internationally. Panelists included the director of the California Department of Public Health, founders of two international conservation and health nonprofits based in Kenya and Uganda, and global health scientists who work in the US, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Kenya, the Caribbean, and more.
