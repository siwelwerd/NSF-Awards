The workshop is co\u2010sponsored by the Department of Energy's Office of Science, the National Science Foundation, and the Department of Defense.  The workshop is intended to assess research and development needed to enable high\u2010impact scientific research and applications of laser technology and provide a timeline indicating when the research and development outcomes are needed to support the U.S. research program.\r\n\r\nThe 2023 Basic Research Needs Workshop on Laser Technology has been charged with  \r\n- Identifying a set of key scientific challenges that can be addressed with laser technology and the application opportunities they create\r\n- Assessing the critical needs in laser technology needed to address the challenges and enable the applications\r\n- Identifying technical gaps between present laser capabilities (current state-of-the-art) and the performance required in each case\r\n- Identifying areas of strong mutual interest across participating federal agencies\r\n- Identifying areas of strong mutual interest with industry, including supply chain concerns, and ways to foster public-private partnerships to address them\r\n- Assessing which research and development investments are expected to have the highest impact\r\n- Identifying present and anticipated workforce development concerns and potential mitigation strategies\r\n- Assessing how the proposed U.S. research and development activities compare with the global efforts\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
