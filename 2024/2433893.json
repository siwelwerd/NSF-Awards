 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact of this I-Corps project is based on the development of a sustainable method for recycling expired lithium-ion batteries. This advance represents a significant improvement over current recycling methods, offering a more effective and environmentally friendly solution, crucial for sustainable resource management. This technology employs green solvents that reduce hazardous waste and resource consumption, emphasizing resource efficiency and minimizing ecological impact. Additionally, this technology enhances public health and safety by cutting down the use of dangerous chemicals in the recycling process, thereby reducing health risks to workers and preventing environmental contamination.  Overall, this lithium-ion battery recycling technology meets critical industry needs while also serving broader societal objectives, fostering a healthier, safer, and more sustainable future for all.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. The solution is based on the development of a deep eutectic solvent (DES)-based technology for recycling critical metals from expired lithium-ion batteries. This innovative technology efficiently recovers critical metals, such as lithium, cobalt, nickel, and manganese, with high purity and selectivity. By selectively extracting and recycling these critical metals, this technology can reduce environmental impact and promote a circular economy. In addition, this technology uses a solvent that can be derived from low-cost plant materials and is recyclable, which means low cost and minimal wastewater generation. This solution also operates under mild reaction conditions, so it has fewer safety concerns and environmental hazards. This advance represents a significant improvement over current recycling methods, offering a more effective, efficient, and environmentally friendly solution for critical metal recovery from lithium-ion batteries.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
