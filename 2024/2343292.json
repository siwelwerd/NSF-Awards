 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Collaborative Multiracial Post-Election Survey (CMPS) is a nonpartisan post-election survey developed by academic researchers in 2008. Starting in 2016, the CMPS adopted an innovative cooperative strategy which broadened the scope of access to high-quality national survey data with large samples of racial/ethnic and underrepresented groups in the United States. The 2024 CMPS will provide essential empirical information on the state of political inclusion, democratic participation, and policy support in an increasingly diverse U.S. The 2024 CMPS will further expand access to minority data collection for scholars in large research Universities as well as those scholars in smaller teaching colleges and Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs) with fewer resources. This study continues to create a space where scholars have access to and share sociopolitical data, as well as build a network of scholars with shared research interests. The results of the survey will advance our national interests in terms of enhancing our understanding of intra-and inter-group relations, policy support, and civic and political participation among understudied groups. The project will produce a dataset that will be made publicly available within one year following data collection.\r\n\r\nThe 2024 Collaborative Multiracial Post-Election Survey (CMPS) is a cooperative, multiracial, multiethnic, multilingual, post-presidential election online survey in the United States. The sample will include an estimated total of 22,000 completed interviews among various demographics of the American population. The sample includes adult, registered and non-registered voters, including non-citizens. The survey (and invitation) may be available to respondents in English, Spanish, Chinese (simplified), Chinese (traditional), Korean, Vietnamese, Arabic, Urdu, Farsi, and Haitian Creole.  The study will also include a sample of youth 16\u201317 years old (n=1,500). The CMPS employs a cooperative research model for designing the content of the survey. Questions included on the survey are generated through contributions from a national consortium of academic researchers from across multiple academic disciplines including the social sciences, psychology, public policy, public health, education, law, and other fields. The CMPS is changing the way data is collected and shared in the social sciences by collaboratively building a diverse and inclusive academic pipeline of scholars in political science and the social sciences more broadly.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
