 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is a collaborative initiative involving the University of Puerto Rico - Mayag\u00fcez, West Texas A&M University, and Western Washington University. It aims to enhance the ability of primarily undergraduate institutions (PUIs) and emerging minority-serving institutions (eMSIs) to form and sustain long-term partnerships with industry and non-governmental organizations (NGOs). These institutions currently face significant challenges due to the lack of structured processes and institutional frameworks necessary for managing such partnerships effectively. By streamlining and strengthening these processes, the project seeks to increase visibility and attract new collaborators, ultimately enriching the educational and professional experiences of their communities.\r\n \r\nThe project has three primary goals: to improve institutional processes for partnership development, to establish a partnership training program, and to diversify and expand the network of external partners. Each participating institution will implement customized strategies to build a sustainable approach to collaborations. This involves enhancing frameworks for managing and tracking partnerships and fostering efficient and consistent outcomes. The initiative will support faculty and administrative staff by developing their skills for effective external engagement and creating a strong learning community to promote a culture of collaboration. The project focuses on key technology sectors such as AI, biotechnology, semiconductors, and new materials, aligning with the NSF EPIIC program's objectives. By developing best practices for strategic partnership management, the project aims to overcome common barriers and enhance capabilities in technology transfer, intellectual property management, and research collaboration, thereby contributing significantly to the academic and professional communities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
