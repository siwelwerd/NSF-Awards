 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the support of the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program in the Division of Chemistry, Prof. Huiyuan Zhu of the University of Virginia aims to develop advanced chemical synthesis methods to produce nanocrystals. Each of the nanocrystals has a non-precious metal core with a thin (a few-atomic-layers) shell consisting of ordered intermetallics and their corresponding hollow structures. The outcomes shall address a challenge in current nanochemistry, i.e., a lack of fundamental understanding of the chemistry processes involved.  The results are of generic importance in making complex inorganic nanostructures. These nanostructures hold great promise in a diverse range of applications in clean energy catalysis and environmental remediation. This project will provide research training and education to undergraduate and graduate students at the cutting-edge of nanochemistry, nurturing future leaders in academia and industry. The team will stimulate excitement for the science and engineering of the next generation through STEM-interest-instilling K-12 outreach programs and hands-on demonstrations designed to emphasize the relevance and impact of nanoscience in daily lives.\r\n\r\nUnder this award, the team will monitor the nucleation and growth processes of these core/shell nanocrystals and hollow nanocages. Integrating the Zhu\u2019s expertise in precision colloidal synthesis with an array of advanced characterization techniques, including in-situ spectroscopic probes, quasi-in-situ electron microscopic probes, and computational approaches, thermodynamic and kinetic information will be attained. The proposed retrosynthetic analysis is highly advantages to streamline the synthesis of complex nanostructures by transforming a target nanocrystal into metal precursors and ligands and sequential chemical reactions. This approach paves the way to establish a synthesis library similar to diverse arrays of organic reactions. The outcomes also include an in-depth understanding of the interfacial chemistry that governs the colloidal reactions and revealing of the underlying formation mechanisms and transformation pathways of these nanostructures featuring ordered intermetallic shells. Collectively, the anticipated advances in nanochemistry enable the design of retrosynthetic routes into synthetically tractable steps and guide the selection of synthons (metal precursors and ligands).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
