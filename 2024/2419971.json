 "awd_abstract_narration": "Arctic infrastructure is rapidly changing under the impact of climate change, socioeconomic and \r\npolitical shifts. Its existence varies by different regions and countries. In some places it is \r\noutdated and inadequate, while maintaining or upgrading poses significant challenges. In other \r\nplaces there is a need in new roads, airstrips, Internet and utilities. And for some places and \r\ncommunities\u2019 concerns exist about negative impacts of infrastructure on cultures and ecosystems. \r\nThis issue is especially important among Indigenous Peoples as infrastructure development has \r\ntraditionally served interests of external groups to exploit resources without local \r\napproval. As the Arctic undergoes transformations, and climate-induced damages, such as flooding and  \r\nerosion accelerated by thawing permafrost and sea level rise, understanding where and what \r\ninfrastructure demands the most attention becomes highly important for building resilient and \r\nsustainable infrastructure. Development of this understanding requires collaborative efforts to learn from \r\npast mistakes, ensure just transitions, and construct Arctic infrastructure that fosters a more \r\nequitable and sustainable future.\r\n\r\nThe project brings together researchers working in the Arctic (e.g., Alaska, Norway, Greenland, and \r\nCanada) and Indigenous community members (in particular, residents of the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta \r\nRegion) to collaboratively identify the challenges and good practices of co-production of \r\nplace-specific and theoretically grounded knowledge of Arctic infrastructure. The project will \r\npromote transdisciplinary research inclusive of diverse ways of knowing, experiencing and \r\nperceiving the world. This project aims to formulate locally and regionally relevant questions \r\nfor future research on just infrastructures through the following objectives: 1) Map existing \r\nexpertise developed by academia, Indigenous Peoples, communities and other stakeholders and learn \r\nfrom each other about infrastructure planning, managing, maintaining and adapting to climate \r\nconditions and how it involves/excludes stake-, rights- and knowledge holders; 2) Identify \r\nprospects for knowledge convergence and co-production on studies of different forms of \r\ninfrastructure in the Arctic; 3) Start creating a self-sustaining experts network that could be \r\nutilized for decision making, research and other purposes related to critical infrastructure \r\nplanning, construction, maintenance, and removal of abandoned objects. The project will begin \r\ndevelopment of a knowledge platform to help decision-makers assess solutions designed to facilitate the \r\nequitable and just development of critical infrastructure. The project provides learning \r\nopportunities by including Indigenous knowledge holders and early-career scholars in planning, \r\nimplementing, and reporting research projects.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
