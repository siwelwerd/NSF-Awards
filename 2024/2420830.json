 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will fund travel for 60 students for the International Symposium on Hardware-Oriented Security and Trust (HOST), held in Washington, DC, May 6-9, 2024.  Trusted hardware is the foundation of cybersecurity.  The rapid proliferation of computing and communication systems with increasing computational power and connectivity into every sphere of modern life has brought security to the forefront of system design, test, and validation. The emergence of new application spaces for these systems in the internet-of-things (IoT) regime is creating new attack surfaces as well as new requirements for secure and trusted system operation. Additionally, the design, manufacturing and the distribution of microchip, printed circuit board (PCB), as well as other electronic components are becoming more sophisticated and globally distributed with a number of potential security vulnerabilities. Thus, hardware plays an increasingly important and integral role in system security with many emerging vulnerabilities and defense mechanisms relating to hardware. The HOST conference aims to facilitate the rapid growth of hardware-based security research and development. HOST highlights new results in hardware and system security. Relevant research topics include techniques, tools, design/test methods, architectures, circuits, and applications of secure hardware.\r\n\r\nThe project's broader significance and importance include professional development for undergraduate and graduate students as well as continued growth of the symposium. Students' attendance enables them to learn about the latest tools, design methods, architectures, circuits, and novel applications of secure hardware.  Students will also receive ample opportunities for networking with researchers, interactions with industrial sponsors and exhibitors for internships and full-time positions, and opportunities to receive feedback on their own research.  Selection criteria include presentation at the conference, being first-time attendees, financial need, and institutional and demographic diversity, with a goal of growing the talent pool of cybersecurity researchers. The hardware security research community itself will benefit by having a broader and larger audience at the event.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This travel grant enables student researchers to attend the symposium.\r\n\n\nThe intellectual merit of this proposed activity includes professional development for undergraduate and graduate students as well as continued growth of the symposium. HOST 2024 was held in Washington D.C. USA, from May 5 to May 9, 2024. This project provided opportunities for students to receive travel support to attend HOST 2024 to enable them to learn about the latest design methods, architectures, circuits, and novel applications of secure hardware.\r\n\n\nTechnical contributions from the symposium covered topics such as the following: (1) Hardware Obfuscation, (2) counterfeit detection and avoidance, (2) side channel analysis and fault analysis, (3) hardware architectures, (4) Hardware security primitives and protocols, (5) Postquantum cryptography, (6) Hardware Trojan and (7) System/Board level security. The travel grants encourage more students to consider a technical submission, participation in growing hardware demonstration space to a large diverse audience.\r\n\n\nKey outcomes of the project include the following:\r\n\n\nHardware (i.e., integrated circuit chips, printed circuit boards, and firmware) is the most critical layer to cybersecurity, and this hardware layer supports the architecture and system level security as a Root-of-Trust (RoT). New processes that integrate security and trust into design flows and add hardware features to enable trusted execution are complex and require a concerted, multidisciplinary effort. To this end, the mission of the IEEE Symposium on Hardware Oriented Security and Trust (HOST) is (1) to be a leading and globally recognized forum that unites researchers, practitioners, and users from the computer security, microelectronics, and EDA communities; (2) to disseminate cutting-edge ideas, technologies, and results in areas of overlap between hardware and security; (3) to provide a platform for leaders in industry, government, and academia to share their unique perspectives and to help shape the direction and priorities of the community; and (4) to address shortages in the security workforce by recruiting and training students from a diverse group for productive careers with prospective employers.\r\n\n\nThe primary goal of this project was to engage as many students as possible who would attend HOST for the first time and would not normally attend HOST (high school, undergrads, M.S. students, Ph.D. students who do not have papers, etc.). A secondary goal was to provide opportunities to as many students from underrepresented groups as possible, such as women, minorities, and persons with disabilities. The hope is that this will encourage such students to become interested in pursuing a PhD in hardware security. A third goal was to put students in touch with as many employers as possible including both industry and government. Being one of the premier events in hardware security technology and research, these students who attended HOST had the opportunity to talk with senior researchers from government, industry, and academia and to become exposed to the latest research in hardware security. Further, HOST offers many other activities to aid in student professional development, such as (1) Technical Talks, (2) Student Demos and Competition, (3) Tutorial Day, (4) Ph.D. Dissertation Competition, and (5) Organize Exhibition to improve the industry and student interaction. HOST provides best paper, demo, and poster awards to motivate and reward the top student researchers.\r\n\n\nThe HOST organizing committee created an application system for students to provide their background information and express interest in attending HOST 2024. The call for applications was posted on the HOST website and social media. Further, the committee asked the call for applications to be e-mailed by leaders of national groups representing women and minorities to increase their participation. Over the deadline, HOST received 43 applications. The demographical information of the students who submitted applications and were offered travel support was as follows: Female: 24%, Male: 76%. 6 of the 42 students who were offered the grant unfortunately could not attend primarily due to finals and other institutional obligations.

Additionaly students traveling from outside the state were reimbursed partial airfare using the remaining funds available.\r\n\n\nHOST was able to meet many of the goals that it had set forth. Other important outcomes were as follows. 100% of students shared CVs with industry sponsors. \r\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/06/2025\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: FareenaSaqib\n"
