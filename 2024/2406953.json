 "awd_abstract_narration": "Transitioning from high school to university presents various challenges for first-year engineering students, particularly as they adapt from a high school mindset to the rigors of higher education. These challenges are not just academic; they include social issues, the need for independent study, cognitive adjustments, and demanding coursework. Research has shown that certain social factors play critical roles in helping students navigate this transition successfully. These social factors include engineering identity, sense of belonging, and self-efficacy, all of which are essential for students to feel integrated and competent in their new academic environments. The COVID-19 pandemic has further complicated the educational landscape, prompting the creation of diverse learning environments to cater to the varied needs of students. These environments range from fully online formats, asynchronous and synchronous, to hybrid models, combining online and in-person instruction, such as HyFlex formats. The HyFlex model, in particular, offers a blend of hybrid and flexible learning, allowing synchronous participation both online and in person. Despite the proliferation of these innovative learning models, there is little research on how the HyFlex format impacts student learning and engagement in engineering education compared to traditional in-person methods. In response to this gap in research, a quasi-experimental study is proposed to assess the efficacy of the HyFlex learning environment within the context of drone education at a rural public university.\r\n\r\nThe project will involve a new course titled \"iDrone 101,\" which will be available in both HyFlex and traditional in-person formats for first-year engineering students at the University of Idaho. This course aims to provide students with foundational knowledge in automatic control, sensors, ground robots, and drones. Moreover, it will seek to integrate students' cultural experiences and values into problem-solving exercises that address real-world issues, such as wildfire monitoring, river restoration, and animal migration. The overarching goal of this project is to explore how the HyFlex model influences student perceptions and behaviors concerning emerging technologies when compared to a conventional in-person classroom setting. The research objectives include (a) increasing student engagement with emerging technologies through the \"iDrone 101\" courses, (b) fostering positive attitudes towards engineering, reflecting strengthened engineering identity, enhanced sense of belonging, and increased self-efficacy, and (c) evaluating the specific impacts of the HyFlex learning environment relative to the traditional in-person format. The mixed-methods research from quantitative and qualitative methods including pre-post surveys and semi-structured interviews will evaluate the influence of HyFlex and in-person learning on students' perceptions and behaviors, regarding rapidly advancing technologies, particularly autonomous unmanned vehicles, including unmanned aerial vehicles (e.g., drones), unmanned ground vehicles (e.g., ground robots), and unmanned surface vehicles (e.g., drone boats). This project is designed to be easily scalable and implementable. Therefore, the HyFlex and in-person learning modules developed for the iDrone 101 course curricula from this project will be available to a broader audience across different states through the project's website.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
