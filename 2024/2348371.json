 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project studies set theory (ZF) without the axiom of choice. The axiom of choice is known for providing objects which are central to mathematical theory yet are impossible to directly construct, such as ultrafilters on natural numbers. The PI recently developed a method which makes it possible to stratify such objects by intuitive complexity in detail regardless of which field of mathematics they originate. The result of the chart will be an extensive chart of such objects organized by this method. The project involves graduate students.\r\n\r\nThis project sets out to study choiceless set theory (ZF) at the level of sets of reals. The axiom of choice implies the existence of numerous such sets with useful combinatorial or algebraic properties, such as bases for vector spaces or fields, ultrafilters, or complicated partitions of Euclidean spaces. The PI recently developed a method which makes it possible to prove detailed ZF independence results regarding the existence of such sets, in effect stratifying them by intuitive complexity regardless of the field of mathematics they originate in. The result of the project will be an extensive chart of such objects organized by this method.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
