 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Regional Innovation Engines Development Award addresses the societal challenge of transitioning the space industry from one designed for government agencies to one supporting the fast-growing commercial space industry. This shift is crucial for continued U.S. leadership in space-related scientific advancement, economic growth, and national security. The project team has partners across the New Mexico Space Valley Coalition, including state and federal government agencies, industrial companies, post-secondary institutions at multiple levels, and national laboratories. The project's collective efforts, coordinated and scaled by the team, could help strengthen the regional production chain; leverage the region's foundation of federal contracting and collaboration; promote innovations that benefit economic, social, and sustainability outcomes; and grow diverse local talent across all levels of the space industry. Space industry historically has been a priority and strength of the region, and commercial space industry is a potential economic growth opportunity for the region. \r\n\r\nThe vision of this project is to strengthen the existing space ecosystem by helping more innovations move from laboratories to use and making sure the commercial space sector has the product development supports, local labor force, entrepreneurship resources, and specialized infrastructure for success. Key technologies include advanced manufacturing of satellite components; small satellite rendezvous, proximity operations, and docking technologies; satellite cybersecurity; and space-based solar power collection for use on Earth. These thrusts, integrated synergistically, should improve R&D alignment with space industry needs; increase commercial translation of research; support commercial space company development; increase educational pathways for space related careers in engineering, information technology, advanced manufacturing, and entrepreneurship; improve educational and job equity for underrepresented populations; and develop projects and pathways yielding greater economic benefits in the region\u2019s rural and tribal areas.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
