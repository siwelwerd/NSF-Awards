 "awd_abstract_narration": "Electroencephalogram (EEG) technology is among the most widely used neuroimaging techniques to study human cognition and brain functioning. Specific to the University of South Carolina Aiken, a small liberal arts campus, EEG is the best and most advanced neuroscience method that can be utilized. With EEG, brain activity can be measured noninvasively with electrodes placed on the scalp, thus allowing the examination and testing of brain-based mechanisms. This award therefore acquires a new and updated EEG system, specifically the EEG Plus System manufactured by Brain Vision Products, housed in the College of Engineering and Sciences at the University of South Carolina Aiken (USCA). This supports research in the neurosciences, and provides advanced critical training opportunities to students and future workforce in STEM related fields. This project increases cross-collaborative and accessible neuroscience research opportunities for underrepresented populations in STEM. Additionally, this grant provides opportunities to the general community to increase engagement in and appreciation of neuroscience. USCA hosts outreach events (e.g. Family STEM Day, field trips, and research mentorship of high school students) to serve the general Aiken community. A final major impact of this instrumentation is increasing competitiveness of future grant proposals as well as recruitment and retention of faculty. \r\n \r\nThe new EEG Plus system increases capabilities of multi-collaborative mentored projects between faculty and students, with the overarching aim of increasing translational applications. The planned research activities involve students and faculty from the Psychology, Biology, Nursing, Business, Exercise Science, and Computer/Engineering Departments. The first study examines neural plasticity of the empathy system in athletes, which may lead to sport-related interventions for empathy-related behaviors. The second study examines predictors of treatment success of emotional regulation abilities in parents after participation in a clinical intervention program. A third study, also translational in focus, pursues a current area of research involving acetaminophen as a potential treatment for other uses besides pain. The fourth study tests the effect of Ketone supplementation on attention and clinical symptoms in young adults. The final study examines how the framing effect (positively vs. negatively phrased statements) influence decision-making and neural activity. EEG instrumentation explores exercise therapy after concussion to address ways to help those who have experienced brain trauma. A future area of research to be pursued with the new EEG Plus system involves new faculty that will be recruited for the recently approved Gaming and Simulation Development major at USCA.  \r\n\r\n\r\nThis project is jointly funded by the Social Behavioral and Economic Science Directorate and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR)\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
