 "awd_abstract_narration": "The key aim of this project is to examine the role of evidence-informed science diplomacy as a strategic instrument to address opportunities for strengthening and threats to maintaining democracy, governance, and trust (DGT). This work contributes towards a conceptualization of a concept with rising importance on the international stage and presents an innovative approach to integrating metascientific evidence into the practice of diplomacy. The intended impact of the project is to strengthen DGT by supporting data gathering and production of inclusive indicators and amplifying trust in science within and across nations. \r\n\r\nThis research will contribute to our theoretical, historical, and empirical understanding of science diplomacy and advance knowledge across several fields (e.g., science and technology policy, science communication, political science, and international relations). This project will utilize qualitative and quantitative methods to (1) understand the relationship between science diplomacy and DGT; (2) conceptualize and operationalize metascience observatories and investigate the extent to which they can be leveraged to improve science diplomacy; and (3) explore how threats to DGT could be mitigated and opportunities seized through inclusive metascience observatories. The outputs will include both academic-oriented products, as well as communications to policymakers and the wider public. In addition to these products, outcomes will include communities of practice and training opportunities. The long-term goal of the project is to strengthen DGT through evidenced-informed science diplomacy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
