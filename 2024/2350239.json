 "awd_abstract_narration": "The conference \u201cSymmetry and Geometry in South Florida\u201d will take place at Florida International University, Miami, from February 16 to 18, 2024. This conference will serve the region of the southeastern United States, especially South Florida, and it will expose participants to cutting-edge research in Riemannian Geometry.  Being organized around the principle of inclusiveness, the organizers will promote the conference to women and under-represented groups so as to increase their participation in the meeting. The meeting will feature a diverse array of speakers, including graduate students, postdocs, and established researchers.  \r\n\r\nSymmetry has been an essential tool in the development of differential geometry; it has been used to create crucial examples and to test special cases of general conjectures. Although symmetry is a widely used tool, the techniques involved can look substantially different across sub-fields. Given its exceptional nature, the organizers will host a conference centered around the theme of symmetry. The meeting aims to disseminate cutting-edge techniques and applications of group actions from across a broad spectrum of sub-disciplines inside differential geometry, including spectral geometry, curvature bounds, homogeneous spaces, and geometric flows. The conference also includes shorter talks by graduate students and younger researchers to showcase their work.\r\nThe link to the webpage to the conference is\r\n\r\nhttps://sites.google.com/view/sgsf-2024/home-page?pli=1\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
