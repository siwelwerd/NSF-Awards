 "awd_abstract_narration": "Commercial vehicles play a pivotal role in our society in moving people and goods. This project aims to converge and apply knowledge in emerging technologies in connected, electrified, and automated commercial vehicles and logistics networks for efficient, safe, agile, and sustainable mobility for the benefit of society. By bringing together a coalition of private and public sector stakeholders and academic institutions, this project will build the Center for Electrified and Automated Trucking (CEAT). The goal of CEAT is to drive innovation and facilitate the widespread adoption of electric and automated commercial vehicles for sustainable freight and public transportation in North America and worldwide. CEAT will actively engage a diverse range of stakeholders, including small high-tech start-ups, large automotive corporations, third-party logistics providers, trucking technology platforms, network communications providers, motor carrier fleets, retail chain stores, e-commerce pioneers, public transit agencies, federal research labs, sea and inland ports, and state and federal transportation departments. These stakeholders play an integral role in guiding CEAT\u2019s transdisciplinary research, led by faculty members of engineering, business, informatics, and public policy. Industry members will collaborate to refine the research concepts, establish value propositions, and develop a multidisciplinary research agenda aligned with their commercial interests.\r\n\r\nPotential topics that CEAT will investigate for the business world include: (i) electrification of long-haul trucking and public transit vehicles with highly durable fuel-cells and optimal deployment of charging stations; (ii) CEAT adoption models and business cases; (iii) operational strategies such as platooning and caravanning; (iv) vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure communication systems for efficient CEAT operation; and (v) strategies for addressing the workforce deficit in the logistics industry. CEAT will integrate knowledge from various disciplines, including engineering analysis, behavioral sciences, and business analytics, to tackle the technological and operational challenges associated with deploying electric and automated freight and public transportation systems. CEAT will provide technical and business training to the nation\u2019s next generation of engineers, researchers, and managers.  CEAT plans to engage high and middle schools by introducing an automated electric vehicle racing competition. Undergraduates will have access to leadership and innovation opportunities through industry internships and involvement in CEAT research projects. CEAT will scale up the application of CEAT technologies, transforming mobility and supply chains and enhancing e-commerce efficiency.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
