 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Triennial Earth-Sun Summit (TESS) is a joint meeting of the Space Physics and Aeronomy Section of the American Geophysical Union (AGU) and the Solar Physics Division (SPD) of the American Astronomical Society. TESS takes place every three years, with the lead organization rotating each meeting. AGU is the lead for the 2024 meeting, which will take place 7-12 April 2024 in Dallas, Texas. The purpose of this Triannual Earth-Sun Summit is to bring the space physics community together every 3 years to harness the developing science and create collaborations, especially with the increase in data collections and missions involved with this science. The funds will provide travel grants for applicants from under-represented groups in STEM or who demonstrate financial need, with a priority for funding early career scientists.\r\n\r\nSpace Physics includes several subdisciplines including magnetospheric physics, ionosphere-thermosphere-mesosphere (ITM), solar, interplanetary, and the heliopause. While these sub- disciplines are highly interrelated and collaborative, meetings are often segregated and stove- piped. For example at the annual AGU meetings the SM, SA, and SH sessions run in parallel with little opportunity for cross-pollination. Likewise, NSF\u2019s GEM, CEDAR, and SHINE meetings are held at separate times and often in separate locations. While there is an attempt to pair up the NSF meetings there is never an opportunity for all three to meet together. The TESS meeting serves this purpose. The convening happens to bring together the larger sun-earth scientific community with enough interval time to bring new data and information to each meeting. The frequency allows for easier travel and focus. The 2024 meeting will be held in conjunction with the April 8, 2024 total solar eclipse and scientists are invited to come for the eclipse. Sessions later in the week may involve early data from the eclipse.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
