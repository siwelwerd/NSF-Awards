 "awd_abstract_narration": "The UnKnot V Conference will be held at Seattle University in Seattle, WA on July 13-14th, 2024. UnKnot V, like the four undergraduate knot theory conferences that preceded it, will be a gathering of students who are interested in knot theory research together with their faculty and graduate student mentors. Participants who are new to knot theory and interested to learn more are also welcome to join in this community-building event. Accessible talks at UnKnot V will be given by world-renowned knot theory experts as well as students who are just beginning their work in this field. UnKnot V will also feature a mini workshop on using machine learning in knot theory research and one on recreational topology with the aim to inspire fun math outreach projects. \r\n\r\nKnot theory is an area of research which uses tools from and gives insight into many areas of mathematics, including topology, geometry, algebra, and combinatorics. There are important applications in knot theory to DNA knotting, synthetic chemistry, protein folding, and quantum computing as well as in anthropology, art, and materials science. Knot theory also lends itself to research by undergraduates since there are open problems that can be easily stated and explained but lead to mathematics with great depth. The focus of UnKnot V will be on research that has been done by undergraduates and on open problems amenable to research by students. Since experts will be brought together with the students and faculty who would like to do research in this field, this unique conference structure will allow for vertical integration from undergraduates and graduate students to faculty who are interested in mentoring students in knot theory research and experts in the field. Many opportunities for research projects will be presented. The conference webpage is: https://sites.google.com/view/unknot-v-conference/home.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
