 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a collaborative effort between the University of Nevada, Reno and Oxford University in the United Kingdom to study properties of materials under extreme conditions, such as those found deep within planets or in high-energy industrial processes. The materials are studied by imaging the propagation of sound waves through them to determine key properties such as viscosity and diffusion. The project will take advantage of international free electron laser user facilities and will focus on materials such as iron alloys and silicates commonly present in planetary cores. The project will combine these experimental measurements with computational and theoretical methods to develop a comprehensive understanding of the many-body physics within strongly coupled plasmas, with impacts on materials research, studies of planetary evolution, nuclear stockpile stewardship, and potential fusion energy development. The project will also provide year-round research experience for undergraduate students, equipping them with skills in computational physics, data analysis, and experimental techniques.\r\n\r\nThe high-resolution inelastic X-ray scattering technique has been successfully used to study transport in strongly coupled plasmas and warm dense matter. At free electron laser facilities, it has achieved remarkable energy resolutions down to 50 meV and has uncovered key insights into ion dynamics and acoustic modes. This collaborative project between the University of Nevada, Reno and Oxford University aims to further investigate viscosity and diffusion in materials such as iron-alloys and silicates, commonly found in planetary cores. Experimental data will be integrated with computational and theoretical methods, including density functional theory, Bohm molecular dynamics, wavepacket molecular dynamics, and holography. Machine learning techniques, specifically deep symbolic regression, will be used to refine these models, aiming to produce accurate, scalable representations for large-scale hydrodynamic plasma simulations. This comprehensive approach will provide benchmark-quality data and theoretical frameworks, enhancing the understanding of strongly coupled plasmas and their applications in astrophysics and materials science.\r\n\r\nThis collaborative project is supported by the US National Science Foundation (NSF) and UK Research and Innovation (UKRI), where NSF funds the U.S. investigator and UKRI funds the partners in the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
