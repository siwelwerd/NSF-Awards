 "awd_abstract_narration": "The rapid evolution of quantum computing in recent years has led to significant advances, revolutionizing various disciplines, including the energy sector. Quantum computing has emerged as a key player in addressing the increasing complexity of the power system and adapting to the changing needs and goals within the grid. The goal of this project is to establish a quantum-energy training program that addresses real-world challenges in power systems using quantum techniques and offers tailored cross-disciplinary training. This will contribute to creating a stronger, more resilient, and reliable energy system. Additionally, this project will contribute to the NSF mission of advancing STEM by systematically training the quantum-energy workforce through designing tailored training materials.\r\n\r\nThis initiative focuses on enabling trainees to develop quantum algorithms that can effectively address intricate challenges in power systems, particularly by leveraging computational advantages in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum regime. These capabilities are pivotal for overcoming sustainability and clean energy transition challenges that are currently unattainable through classical computational methods. Specifically, three primary objectives will be realized. First, create a project-based training program that synthesizes interdisciplinary knowledge from power engineering and quantum computing, cultivating trainees proficient in both fields. Second, offer trainees hands-on experience and practical application in power system-oriented quantum computing, coupled with personalized feedback, to enhance the widespread adoption of quantum computing. Third, create a seamless integration between problem-solving, training, and career advancement. Overall, this project will train a quantum-ready workforce in power engineering, preparing them to meet future challenges and opportunities in this cross-disciplinary field.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
