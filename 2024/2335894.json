 "awd_abstract_narration": "The shift from quadrupedal to bipedal locomotion, walking on two feet, is at the root of the evolutionary pathway that led to the emergence of humans. To date, many questions regarding the evolution of bipedalism remain unanswered. This CAREER project investigates the evolution of human bipedal walking and running by analyzing fossil footprints through the combined application of field, experimental and computational methods. Training and hands-on experience in paleoanthropological methods are provided to students at different education levels. A new course-based undergraduate research experience (CURE), combined with individually mentored research experiences, provide students with opportunities to directly contribute to the laboratory analyses that are essential to the project. Outreach activities engage community members who live in the immediate vicinity of fossil footprint sites, through an ongoing partnership and the development of a community-led cultural heritage museum. \r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the Quaternary Period three fossil hominin species \u2013 Homo erectus, Homo habilis, and Paranthropus boisei were thought to have inhabited the same landscapes. The current consensus is that their cohabitation was enabled by different sets of adaptations, and that Homo erectus was the only one (and the first human ancestor) to use a modern human-like pattern of walking and running. However, the fossil data that can speak to this are limited and the interpretations inconclusive. The field excavations in this project significantly increase the volume of data available to test long-standing hypotheses about the evolution of human bipedalism. Through laboratory experiments, new analytical methods are developed to relate footprint morphology to foot morphology and biomechanics, allowing for detailed understandings of fossil human locomotion. The project also advances methods for finding, excavating, and analyzing fossil footprints, opening new avenues for these data to address major questions in human evolution.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
