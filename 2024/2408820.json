 "awd_abstract_narration": "Galaxies are made of stars, gas, and black holes. The interaction between these components determines how a galaxy, like our own Milky Way, grows over time. Stars and black holes may change the chemical content of the gas reservoir and/or eject it completely out of the galaxy through winds. The latter outcome, particularly prevalent in interacting galaxy systems, tends to stop future generations of stars from being formed in those galaxies. The investigators will analyze new observations of merging galaxies to trace the movement of gas as it traverses the galactic ecosystem, enabling a detailed understanding of this dynamic process. The investigators will also augment the Observational Astronomy Workshop at Lick Observatory through increasing graduate student participation and by adding a new science communication module to enrich the education and professional development of a diverse range of students. \r\n\r\nLeveraging new Keck and JWST integral-field spectroscopic observations, the investigators will study the hot ionized and warm molecular gas for a representative sample of galaxy mergers to establish the intricate nature of gas fueling and feedback and its role in galaxy evolution. Outflowing gas masses and energetics will be measured and compared to predictions from the latest feedback models across the temperature--density regimes. Presenting a holistic view of gas dynamics from the dusty nuclear cores out to the circumgalactic medium, this project is extremely timely.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
