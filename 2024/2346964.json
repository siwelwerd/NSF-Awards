The workshop will explore significant advances in ground motion simulation, dynamic rupture modeling, and earthquake cycle modeling. This international workshop will bring together modelers from different countries with observational seismologists and experimentalists, facilitating exchange of scientific knowledge and ideas. \r\n\r\nOver three days, through a mixture of talks, poster sessions, and informal conversations, participants will discuss a wide range of topics: numerical methods, verification and validation, source inversion, friction experiments, rheology of the crust and upper mantle, the earthquake energy balance, seismic observables and their link to source processes. International scientific exchange serves to enhance productivity and excellence, as well as train the next generation of seismologists and experts in earthquake source processes and computational seismology.Funding  will support approximately 14 U.S. students, early career scientists, and members of underrepresented groups.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
