 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project brings together a diverse, intellectually and technically driven group of scientists, engineers, staff from a biobased plastic manufacturer unified by the common goal of further developing and commercializing a versatile family of sustainable plastics based on poly (omega-hydroxyfatty acids), P(omega-HOFAs). These polymers were inspired by cutin polymer networks that function to waterproof and protect leaves and fruits and consist of omega-HOFA building blocks. Insights from cutin structure, that evolved over millions of years, provide an approach to re-design polyethylene (PE) to expand its properties that have proved highly valuable in many applications. Cutin has long methylene spacers, a characteristic of PE, while incorporating groups along polymer chains that can be cleaved by chemical or biochemical processes. Combining methylene spacers with readily cleavable groups results in plastics that provide desirable characteristics of both PE and cutin. The intended result is P(omega-HOFAs) and copolymers that are designed for reprocessing for the next life cycle. Efforts will focus on research plan development, team formation leading to a proof-of-concept and meetings for training and cross-cohort collaboration. The research program will provide a proof of concept through a convergent research approach. The activities during Phase 1 will also identify gaps in skills/capabilities that guide the selection of additional team members. \r\n\r\nThe following describes tasks that will be completed during the Phase 1 program. Using methyl-tetradecanoic acid as the feedstock, the project team will upscale monomer synthesis from 1 liter to 100 liters. This work will provide insights into scale-up activities to be performed in Phase 2. Downstream processing (DSP) and monomer purification will be performed at multiple scales. Polymerizations will be performed to provide prototype materials. These materials will be used to benchmark the physico-mechanical properties of prototype materials to those of current biodegradable bioplastics. Investigations will assess the chemical and biological recycling properties of these products. System-level techno-economic analyses (TEA) and life cycle assessment (LCA) will be performed. Also, Phase 1 participants in the workforce development program will initiate activities and develop detailed plans for implementation. An overall review by the PI, in consultation with the full program team, will determine the required team expansion.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
