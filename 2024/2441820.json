 "awd_abstract_narration": "Through this award, Future Earth supports projects funded under the Belmont Forum Collaborative Research Action \u201cIntegrated Approaches to Human Migration/Mobility in an Era of Rapid Global Change\u201d. The awardee will coordinate research, synthesis, communication, capacity building and mobilizing as well as valorization for the transdisciplinary international research teams. By coordinating teams and fostering cross-team synthesis, Future Earth will leverage research support, and build integrated knowledge and tools that reach a broad range of actors in the public and private sector focused on migration and mobility issues. The capacity building efforts will provide science leadership support to awardees around the globe, and assist teams in the difficult process of engaging with non-scientists in transdisciplinary research. Future Earth will bring together awardees at the transdisciplinary international meetings to further promote the integration of the new awardees.\r\n\r\nFuture Earth will implement an interactive, reflexive post-award coordination agenda for the Belmont Forum\u2019s collaborative research action on Migration. Belmont Forum\u2019s programs award grants, distributed in international, transdisciplinary teams, in order to bring together the fragmented research and innovation expertise across the globe to find innovative new solutions to their challenge. These teams include researchers and partners from universities, research centers, civil society organizations, community organizations, and the private sectors. The aim of the Migration call is to develop projects illuminating the determinants of migration - why people move, do not move, from and to where and when, and on what time scale, in relation to Global Change processes like environmental and climate change, demographic changes, consumption patterns, energy use and land-use. The capacity of the research teams to reach their aims will depend, to a great extent, on the degree to which their work can be integrated and supported. Future Earth will carry out the coordination, valorization and synthesis, partnering with two international organizations. The Global Development Network to support capacity building, mentoring and communication, and the Engineering Center for System Solutions will support the development of simulations to functionally integrate the diversity of perspectives, strengthen participation processes, develop effective communication and cooperation skills, explore the governance of social-ecological systems, and support mindset and behavioral change.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
