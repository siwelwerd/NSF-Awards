 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Talon graphics processing unit (GPU) cluster represents a major leap forward in GPU-accelerated computing at Miami University. Workforce development and education efforts utilizing the Talon GPU cluster are strengthening artificial intelligence literacy and incorporating artificial intelligence into the higher education landscape in a manner consistent with best educational practices. These efforts are training an engaged community prepared to meet the needs of the U.S. economy in machine learning and artificial intelligence. The project is leveraging Talon GPU cluster capabilities by providing access through the Open Science Grid, enabling 20% of cluster uptime for research from the broader community.\r\n\r\nThe Talon GPU cluster is a dedicated high-performance computing cluster comprising multiple nodes, each with multiple state-of-the-art GPUs. Resource-intensive GPU-accelerated computing efforts are facilitated by onboard memory for each GPU and high-capacity on-node disk space. Parallel computing job performance is enhanced by fast interconnects. Research enabled by the Talon GPU cluster spans all academic divisions at Miami University and includes the development of sophisticated simulations of atomic nuclei, the development and use of AI chatbots for complex technical handbooks, in silico screening of enzyme inhibitor candidates via machine learning, and the development of machine learning algorithms for automated analysis of image-based manufacturing quality control. The interdisciplinary and collaborative efforts of Miami University researchers and educators are incorporating the societal and pedagogical impact of artificial intelligence into courses and further connect the research to education efforts centered on ethical issues around artificial intelligence.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
