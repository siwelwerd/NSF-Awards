 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project lies in its potential to revolutionize soil remediation techniques, addressing the lack of effective treatment options for soils contaminated by per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). The proposed remediation method utilizes the natural mutualistic relationship between plants and fungi to remediate contaminated sites, offering distinct advantages over traditional methods. This innovation not only preserves site ecology, but also allows for the reuse of remediated soils, distinguishing it from other solutions that have high environmental impact. By mitigating soil-based sources of PFAS contamination, the project contributes to public health by reducing exposure risks and safeguarding water and agricultural resources. Furthermore, the successful completion of this project will provide compelling evidence for field trials, paving the way for regulatory approval and commercialization. This advancement has significant economic implications, enhancing the competitiveness of the United States and stakeholders by allowing for the reallocation of resources through cost savings, and addressing pressing environmental concerns. This enhanced approach offers significant promise for furthering scientific knowledge and delivering tangible benefits to society by tackling a crucial environmental issue, yielding far-reaching benefits.\r\nThe proposed project focuses on developing a scalable and effective biological remediation method that utilizes synergistic interactions between fungi and plants to degrade and remove PFAS from contaminated environments. The project aims to expand on fungi that are able to efficiently degrade PFAS and evaluate their effectiveness in degrading six specific PFAS compounds recommended by the EPA. The research expands the understanding of fungal degradation of PFAS by identifying additional defluorinators and characterizing the resulting breakdown products. The impact of several environmental factors on degradation rates will be assessed to understand how site-specific challenges may impact remediation efforts. Additionally, various delivery methods for microbial inoculation, such as pelleting, soil drenching, and in-furrow application will be evaluated for consistent inoculum application to contaminated sites. Bench trials will assess the efficiency of this approach, combining fungi and hybrid poplars, for PFAS remediation. This research addresses a critical need for effective PFAS remediation methods, expanding the frontier of scientific knowledge in fungal bioremediation, offering a fresh perspective and innovative approach towards mitigating the impacts of PFAS on our ecosystems.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
