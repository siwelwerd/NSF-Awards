 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is aiming to develop an innovative image sensor inspired by arthropod eyes, featuring a wide field of view, high-speed operation, and efficient object tracking. These smart sensors can dramatically expand the field of view, enhance response speeds, and operate with energy efficiency. Central to this advancement is the fusion of photodiodes with artificial synapses and mimicry of geometrical shape, a pairing that mirrors the biological processes of neural networks within the insect eye. This configuration not only facilitates the rapid processing of visual information but also reduces the energy required to do so, marking a significant step forward from traditional planar imaging systems. Unlike conventional systems, the sensor arrays will adopt hemispherical designs, inspired by nature's own solution to wide-angle and efficient vision. This geometric optimization is crucial for capturing the patterns of movement across a visual scene with enhanced accuracy and depth, making the technology invaluable for applications that require precise motion detection and spatial awareness. To process the high-dimensional data captured by these sensors, the project further introduces a specialized neural network architecture. This approach divides data processing tasks between the sensors and a central processing unit, ensuring swift, efficient, and precise analysis. Such a configuration is particularly suited for dynamic environments where rapid decision-making is essential. By emulating the intricate vision systems found in nature, it offers a glimpse into a future where technology and biology converge, providing impactful solutions. The potential applications of this work span across various sectors, promising to enhance the efficiency, and capabilities of systems in robotics, autonomous driving, and beyond, thereby advancing the progress of science and technology for the benefit of society.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to develop and integrate a novel artificial compound eye system capable of advanced in-situ object tracking and depth perception. This system leverages the unique advantages of a photodiode integrated with an artificial synaptic device, embodying a computational layer for immediate data processing akin to biological synaptic functions. The hardware design, inspired by the hemispherical structure of arthropod eyes, enables a wide field of view and rapid image acquisition. To address the challenges of processing high-dimensional visual data efficiently, a communication, storage, and energy-efficient federated split learning framework will be employed. This framework optimizes data processing by distributing computational tasks between the sensor and a centralized processing unit, significantly enhancing the system's real-time object tracking capabilities. By integrating advanced hardware with software algorithms, this project aims to create a system that not only advances the scientific understanding of bio-inspired imaging but also offers practical solutions for real-world applications. The successful execution of this project is expected to set a new standard in optical sensing technology, contributing significantly to the fields of computer vision and neuromorphic computing.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
