 "awd_abstract_narration": "The current framework for monitoring drinking water quality is insufficient for equitably identifying and managing well-established and emerging contaminants. Gaps in the current framework led to some populations receiving drinking water with insufficient monitoring. The project will address these gaps by developing an innovative new monitoring tool based on point-of-use water filters. The project will create knowledge and understanding to advance water solutions through the convergence of expertise in water treatment, microbiology, analytical chemistry, groundwater hydrology, social work, and entrepreneurship. The project will have broad benefits of improving water quality at a nationwide scale. The project will recruit participants from diverse backgrounds through programs at two universities and several non-academic partners, and the results will reach a broad audience through education, outreach, and dissemination activities. \r\n\r\nThe goals of the project are to: (1) coalesce a multidisciplinary team of university and non-academic partners to develop a new passive water quality monitoring tool based on POU filters; (2) identify use-inspired research needs for water quality monitoring; (3) co-design a research study and technology development plan with non-academic partners; and (4) test the proof-of-concept of using POU filters to monitor metals, per- and polyfluorinated alkyl substances (PFAS), agricultural chemicals, and opportunistic pathogens in drinking water. These goals will be pursued in a convergent research approach that uses team science and human-centered design. The project team will complete the innovation curriculum. With a broad set of stakeholders, the team will co-design a research plan and a technology development plan. The proof-of-concept of the new monitoring approach will be evaluated in laboratory experiments with realistic water compositions that assess the accumulation, recovery, and quantification of a range of chemical and microbiological contaminants.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nGaps in the current water quality monitoring framework leave millions of Americans in urban and rural America at risk of exposure to harmful contaminants like lead and per- and polyfluorylalkyl substances (PFAS), also known as forever chemicals. The project addressed these gaps by developing an innovative new monitoring tool that deploys commercially available point-of-use water filters to serve as both monitoring devices and treatment tools. This new approach (1) simultaneously protects users from contaminant exposures while monitoring, (2) is designed for ease of use, and (3) is the only viable method for quantifying exposure to contaminants like lead that have concentrations that vary over time. The approach will benefit the 23 million American households in rural America who get their drinking water from a private well and the 10 million homes with lead service lines in big cities and small towns.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nThe project demonstrated the proof-of-concept of the approach with multiple filters and with chemicals that include lead, PFAS forever chemicals, and the herbicide atrazine. The approach was assessed using tap water from two public water systems and with a real untreated groundwater. The project also contributed new knowledge regarding the ability to monitor additional chemical and microbiological constituents in drinking water.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nParticipation in the Convergence Accelerators Innovation Curriculum led to several key outcomes. Through analysis of more than thirty end-user interviews, the project identified specific contaminants of concern and confirmed the need for affordable and meaningful water quality testing options. This analysis also unveiled need for effective communication. End-users perceived the approach as easy to use and identified value in the detailed information about water quality. Based on consultations with a technology and innovation coach, industry experts, and stakeholders, the project identified commercialization as the most promising pathway to sustainability of the water quality monitoring approach. The project included the design of a sustainability plan that can enable the water quality monitoring approach to be sustained beyond the initial investment from the National Science Foundation. The sustainability plan can lead to job creation and improved capabilities for water quality monitoring at a national scale.\r\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/03/2025\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: DanielEGiammar\n"
