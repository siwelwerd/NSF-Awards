 "awd_abstract_narration": "Semiconductors are essential components of electronic devices, enabling advances in important applications and systems such as communication, healthcare, and national security. In order to sustain the U.S.'s global competitiveness in the semiconductor industry, there is a growing demand for a skilled semiconductor workforce. High-schoolers are among the most frequent users of electronic devices. However, many do not know how these devices are designed and manufactured. To address the knowledge gaps and workforce needs equitably, this project will develop a semiconductor curriculum with high-school-aged students from diverse backgrounds, and with partners in higher education, K-12, and industries, enhanced with artificial intelligence (AI) and other innovative technologies. Game-based semiconductor modules will be created for students to play and learn with peers choosing culturally diverse avatars. These learning modules will be made available to a wide range of students through the project collaborator Stemuli, a game-based learning company. In addition, approximately 50 students each summer (years 2-4) will be engaged in in-person workshops hosted in Maine and Texas. Through these workshops, students will be engaged in hands-on activities and field trips to semiconductor companies where they will connect their game-based learning with industry experiences. Based on students' feedback, the workshop and game curriculum will be designed and improved iteratively. \r\n\r\nThis Developing and Testing Innovations (DTI) project aims to help high-school students develop skills and career interests in the semiconductor fields through an innovative game-based learning platform, hands-on activities, and industry field trips. The overarching research question is: To what extent do the designs and integration of AI Educator(a generative AI tool for education), game-based learning, and hands-on experiences provide equitable access and strengthen students\u2019 engagements, awareness, interests, and knowledge in STEM careers? The AI Educator will provide students with suggestions, assistance, and additional study materials about the subject matter. The AI component will be responsible for tuning the output content based on the student\u2019s interests, hobbies, and preferences to make the experience more relatable. Data collection will include students\u2019 attitudes, game activities, and hands-on learning outcomes. Design-based research methods will be used incorporating the NASA Task Load Index, t-test, interviews, and surveys to understand students\u2019 learning and efficacy of the game and workshop curriculum. The Technology, Pedagogy, and Content Knowledge (TPACK) framework will be used and refined throughout the AI and game technology integrations into the semiconductor curriculum and education pathways. The project will be designed with a focus on equity, accessibility, engagement, and collaboration, catering to students from diverse backgrounds. This project is co-funded by the Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program, which supports projects that build understandings of practices, program elements, contexts and processes contributing to increasing students' knowledge and interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and information and communication technology (ICT) careers. This project is also co-funded by the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program and the Discovery Research PreK-12 (DRK-12) program.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
