 "awd_abstract_narration": "The conference \"Singularities in Ann Arbor\", scheduled for May 13-17, 2024, at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, will explore recent progress in the study of singularities in algebraic geometry. Algebraic geometry, in simple terms, concerns itself with studying geometric objects defined by polynomial equations. This conference will focus on several recent advances concerning singularities: these are points where the geometric objects behave in unexpected ways (such as the bumps or dents on a normally flat surface). Understanding these singularities not only satisfies intellectual curiosity but also plays a crucial role in classifying and comprehending global complex geometric structures. More details about the conference, as well as the list of confirmed lecturers, are available on the conference website, at https://sites.google.com/view/singularitiesinaa.\r\n\r\nThe conference will feature four lecture series presented by leading experts and rising stars in the field, covering recent advancement related to singularities. These lectures will introduce fresh perspectives and tools, including Hodge Theory, D-modules, and symplectic topology, to address challenging questions in algebraic geometry. The conference aims to make these complex ideas accessible to a younger audience, fostering engagement and understanding among participants.  Additionally, the conference will provide a platform for young researchers to showcase their work through a poster session, encouraging collaboration and discussion among participants.  This award will provide travel and lodging support for about 35 early-career conference participants.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
