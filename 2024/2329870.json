 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact of this Partnerships for Innovation - Research Partnerships (PFI-RP) project is the development of a technology that will improve building energy systems and reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions stemming from building energy use. This project will also lower the cost and implementation barriers for widespread adoption of thermal energy storage (TES) technologies. The project focuses on developing a technology called CenoPCM, a new low-cost, fire-resistant phase change material (PCM) microcapsule. This material can seamlessly integrate with existing building energy systems like heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) and heat pumps for efficient thermal energy storage. The unique properties of CenoPCM will overcome the limitations of current encapsulated PCM technologies, such as high costs, PCM leakage, weak structural integrity, and potential fire hazards. Beyond its technical innovation, the project also places a strong emphasis on cultivating a diverse group of students and providing them with valuable knowledge and skills necessary for entrepreneurship. Participants will have the opportunity to engage in business plan competitions, fostering entrepreneurial thinking and preparation for start-up endeavors. Through this multifaceted approach, the project aims to make a transformative impact on both the building energy sector and the professional development of future innovators and entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\nThis project advances practical applications of microencapsulated PCM in building thermal energy storage to increase energy savings by developing a novel PCM microcapsule, CenoPCM. This novel technology overcomes several weaknesses of the existing products for building applications: high cost, flammability, and PCM leakage. To this end, two novel technologies will be developed to substantially reduce the cost of the PCM microcapsule: a low-cost PCM and a novel microencapsulation method. A method will be developed to upcycle soapstock, an underutilized byproduct of the green diesel industry, into high quality PCM. This PCM will be encapsulated with cenospheres through an \u201cetching-loading-sealing\u201d process. The resulting product, CenoPCM microcapsules, can be used in high volume applications because it is safe and economically feasible. Thermal energy storage units can be made with CenoPCM, which can be integrated with HVAC to achieve higher energy efficiencies. A database of energy saving potential of CenoPCM used in different building types situated in various climate zones will also be built through a scoping study.\r\n\r\nThis project is jointly funded by Partnerships for Innovation Program (PFI) and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
