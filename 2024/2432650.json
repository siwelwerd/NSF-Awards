 "awd_abstract_narration": "The FUTURE collaboration between Athens State University (ASU), Georgia College & State University (GCSU), and Southern Utah University (SUU), aims to bridge the gap between academia and local industries to foster innovation and economic growth. These institutions, known for their strong focus on teaching and research, often face challenges in establishing lasting external partnerships. FUTURE addresses these challenges by promoting collaboration, supporting interdisciplinary projects, and creating opportunities for hands-on student learning and faculty ingenuity. This initiative not only enhances the institutions' ability to innovate but also equips students with valuable skills, preparing them for successful careers and contributing to the prosperity of their communities. \r\n\r\nFUTURE seeks to increase institutional capacity and participation in innovation partnerships through three main goals: building faculty capacity, developing centralized knowledge and resources, and strengthening industry relationships. This collaboration employs methods such as faculty training, providing incentives, and implementing clear policies to empower educators to engage in innovative partnerships. A centralized repository of partnerships and resources will be developed to provide easy access to valuable information and expertise. Additionally, FUTURE fosters close ties with industry through student showcases, faculty integration events, and enhanced advisory boards, ensuring that institutions can adapt to industry trends and market demands. By integrating these activities into institutional plans and regularly evaluating and adapting strategies, FUTURE ensures sustained innovation and entrepreneurship. The potential contributions include driving economic growth, enhancing the institutions' reputations, strengthening community engagement, and facilitating the transfer of knowledge and technology from academia to industry.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
