 "awd_abstract_narration": "Organisms face constant threats from invasive nucleic acids, like transposons and viruses, which can cause genome instability. To combat these threats, organisms have evolved sophisticated defense mechanisms. Among these, the piRNA immune pathway stands out as one of the oldest and most important mechanisms for maintaining genome stability and regulating gene expression. This project will focus on addressing two fundamental questions: how piRNAs are made and how they are degraded. The research will enhance the understanding of fertility and inheritance, with broad implications for basic research. In addition to its scientific goals, this project places a strong emphasis on fostering inclusivity and innovation in STEM education and research. It will establish training programs tailored for undergraduate students from diverse backgrounds and students from STEM-focused high schools. Furthermore, a model organism science fair will be organized to foster collaboration among Historically Black Colleges and Universities, liberal arts colleges, and research universities in central Ohio.\r\n\r\nThe study will use the model organism C. elegans to explore piRNA biology. Specifically, the project will examine how piRNA production is regulated at the level of transcription, how precursor molecules are processed into functional piRNAs by investigating an unconventional cap-binding protein, and how these piRNAs are degraded through the characterization of RNA-modifying enzymes. Through a combination of laboratory experiments and computational analyses, the project seeks to uncover new insights into the mechanisms underlying piRNA biology. By identifying key molecular players and pathways involved in piRNA biogenesis and degradation, the research aims to contribute to our fundamental understanding of genetic regulation and inheritance processes. In summary, this interdisciplinary project not only seeks to advance scientific knowledge of piRNA biology but also aims to inspire and educate the next generation of scientists. By integrating research with educational outreach, the project aims to make significant contributions to both scientific discovery and community engagement.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
