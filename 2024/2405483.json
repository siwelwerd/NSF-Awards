 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mathematics plays a critical role in students\u2019 career choices as well as their success in STEM fields. Unfortunately, math performance often declines as students\u2019 progress through the grade levels and the aftermath of the COVID19 pandemic has worsened the situation. Research has shown that when teachers have strong content and pedagogical content knowledge that they can provide better quality mathematics instruction to their students and improve student outcomes. The goal of this project is to enhance elementary school teachers\u2019 capacity to improve students\u2019 mathematics learning through a scaled professional development program that uses artificial intelligence (AI) to create a personalized, active learning environment for teachers. The professional development program focuses on key elements of content-specific expertise needed for teaching, such as enhancing teachers\u2019 understanding of the foundational ideas behind numbers and operations concepts that are developed across grade levels, as well as teachers\u2019 understanding of how students learn these concepts and how various instructional tools and practices can improve students\u2019 learning. By creating a professional development that is adaptive to the individualized needs of teachers and is accessible to teachers anywhere and at any time, this work has the potential to change student outcomes at scale. The professional development program utilizes advances in AI to create an inquiry-based learning environment for teachers to enhance their understanding through solving problems of practice. Equipping teachers with the knowledge and skills crucial for quality teaching has the potential to improve mathematics teaching and learning at scale, which has the potential to reduce the opportunity gaps to quality teaching faced by underserved students.\r\n\r\nThe specific focus of this project is to enhance elementary school teachers\u2019 content and pedagogical content knowledge of numbers and operations using a multiple-AI-agent to guide teachers\u2019 development of a conceptual understanding of the content as well as ways to make the content more accessible to their students. Rather than AI delivering the information, the AI tool will serve as a facilitator to create a learning environment in which teachers meaningfully engage with purposefully developed activities and learn through the process. The research questions the work addresses are: (1) In what ways can advances in AI be incorporated into the AI-based interactive professional development program? (2) How well does the AI-based professional development program enhance teachers\u2019 content and pedagogical content knowledge of numbers and operations? and (3) How well does the AI-based professional development program enhance the quality of mathematics teaching and students learning of numbers and operation?  The professional development program and AI tool will be developed through multiple iterations and inputs from several key stakeholders, such as teachers, teacher educators, and content experts. The study will use a mixed methods approach. The effectiveness of the fully developed program on instruction and student learning will be explored through a randomized controlled trial with 200 elementary school teachers. The final version of the program will be made available online. \r\n\r\nThe Discovery Research preK-12 program (DRK-12) seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models, and tools. Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
