 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports participation of US based mathematicians in the conference entitled \"Moving to higher rank: from hyperbolic to Anosov,\" which will take place in Centraro, Italy, from July 15- 19, 2024. The conference will bring together researchers and students from the classical field of hyperbolic geometry and the more recent area of higher Teichmuller theory to explore and further develop the rich connection between them. The conference will facilitate the exchange of ideas, and promote collaboration between experts in both fields, while reinforcing cooperation between the US and European mathematical communities. The organizing committee will encourage and support broad and diverse participation, and the training of the new generation of researchers.\r\n\r\nIn recent decades, the areas of hyperbolic geometry and Higher Teichmuller theory have undergone a dynamic convergence of concepts, attracting numerous scholars from hyperbolic geometry who have shifted their focus toward higher rank phenomena. Concurrently, a new generation of researchers has emerged, working at the juncture of these two domains. The conference will focus on how phenomena from hyperbolic geometry generalize to higher Teichmuller theory. Past success along these lines includes generalizations of Fenchel-Nielssen coordinates, Weil- Petersson geometry, Collar Lemmas, Length rigidity, and Patterson-Sullivan Theory. The conference will feature 18 research talks, and two lightening talk sessions for junior researchers. The URL for the conference website is https://tinyurl.com/hyp2anosov.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
