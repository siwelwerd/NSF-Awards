 "awd_abstract_narration": "The wide adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) provides significant benefits to society, including a cleaner environment, lower running costs, reduced noise pollution, and reduced carbon emissions. However, the adoption of EVs also brings challenges to the existing civil infrastructure system. For example, EV fires burn hotter, longer, and take more resources to extinguish than fires involving vehicles with traditional combustion engines. The first responders\u2019 current work standards, training protocols, and training methods related to EV emergencies are dangerously outdated. In this project development award, an interdisciplinary team of researchers and multiple public agency partners will define and test the feasibility of an immersive and intuitive training platform that would augment first responders\u2019 decision making when responding to EV-related fires. The knowledge generated from this study will provide valuable information to the first responder communities and help EV automakers design \u201cresponder friendly\u201d EV systems. \r\n\r\nThe objective of this Future of Work at the Human-Technology Frontier (FW-HTF) planning research project is to test the feasibility of the immersive training platform\u2019s framework for future EV-related emergency responses. There are three major objectives: 1) To conduct a nationwide survey followed by focus group meetings to understand existing EV-related emergency response workflows; 2)  To design and develop the framework of the immersive training platform that can augment first responders\u2019 cognitive performance; and 3) To  share the initial findings with researchers and other stakeholders to test the viability of the proposed training framework and formulate a detailed roadmap for future work.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

To achieve this goal, the research team first formed a stakeholder group and conducted a workshop in Alabama, including different stakeholders from fire departments, car manufacturers, fire colleges, non-profit training organizations, the state Department of Transportation, and AAA Automotive to share their knowledge, experiences, and lessons learned in EV emergencies. In addition, the research team also conducted a national survey with 1049 first responder participants with the help of the Emergency Response Safety Institute (ERSI) to better understand first responders&rsquo; incident management knowledge, practices, and training experiences related to EVs. At last, the research team developed a prototype of the proposed PICK training system and conducted human subject experiments to evaluate the training system with college students at the Colorado School of Mines (n=45) and first responders in Denver areas (n=21). The main outcomes and findings are: (1) The research team has explored and summarized the existing EV emergency response requirements and workflows based on the feedback and insights from focus groups and interviews with the project stakeholders. This finding sets the foundation for the PICK training system related to learning contents and learning formats; (2) The results showed that over 40% of respondents reported never receiving any EV-related safety training, and most of them are volunteer firefighters. The odds of not receiving EV-related safety training vary significantly across agencies. Emergency Medical responders (EMS) were associated with the highest odds of not receiving EV-related safety training. The most suggested recommendation (88%) is special training on EV emergency response, followed by standard EV designs (61%); (3) A prototype of the PICK training system with different learning formats was developed to meet the self-learning conditions for first responders. Our user study compared the effectiveness of different learning formats with college students and first responders. The results found that the proposed PICK training system can significantly improve participants&rsquo; knowledge and confidence in the tasks related to EV emergency response. In addition, we also found that the 5 to 15-minute learning episodes are more effective than the 45-minute learning content.</p>\r\n<p>The knowledge generated from this research project will be valuable for firefighters, law enforcement professionals, EMS, and tow truck drivers. It will enable first responders to make more informed decisions when preparing for and responding to EV-related incidents. In addition, our research results will provide baseline knowledge and assessments for EV manufacturing companies to understand first responders&rsquo; concerns and training needs during EV-induced incidents, which will help various EV manufacturing companies to achieve a consensus on designing &ldquo;responder-friendly&rdquo; EV systems and providing standard safety guidelines for public safety agencies. Our research results will also provide insights for State Departments of Transportation (DOTs) to enhance their traffic incident management (TIM) strategies to ensure the robust and resilient operations of transportation systems with wide adoption of EVs in the future. At last, our work will substantially advance the knowledge in workforce development to EV emergency responses, designing and developing a training framework via different learning approaches.</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 01/02/2025<br>\nModified by: Yangming&nbsp;Shi</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\"
