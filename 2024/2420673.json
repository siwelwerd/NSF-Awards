 "awd_abstract_narration": "Funding supports the operation of the Academic Research Fleet (ARF) East Coast Van Pool (ECVP) for CY 2024 - 2028. Operations include scheduling, van transportation logistics, maintenance, repairs, outfitting and construction of new vans. The Van Pool provides these portable laboratory assets to Oceanographic research projects around the globe. The pool has 14 portable laboratories of several different functions. Funds included in this proposal will be used to support a number of upgrades and repairs to the existing vans as well as personnel time to provide necessary general maintenance. The East Coast Van Pool provides infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects.  The acquisition, maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.\r\n\r\nEast Coast Van Pool (ECVP) operations include scheduling, van transportation logistics, maintenance, repairs, outfitting and construction of new vans.
