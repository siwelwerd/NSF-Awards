 "awd_abstract_narration": "Few small-scale separation methods are available to support critical applications like medical diagnostics or the sensing of dilute chemicals. Dielectrophoretic molecular transport (DMT), which works at small length scales, flexibly separates most solutes out of water but it is not used because current mathematical models are unable to accurately predict its behavior. This CAREER project seeks to develop and validate models of DMT equilibrium and transport behavior. These models and the improved understanding of DMT that will result from this project will enable its use and could result in, for example, lab-on-a-chip diagnostics which broaden access to important medical tests and improve well-being. This project will accomplish this while creating an equitable and inclusive pipeline to graduate education that will broaden and strengthen participation in scientific research.\r\n\r\nThe primary research goal of this CAREER project is to develop and validate models for dielectrophoretic molecular transport (DMT). To accomplish this objective, a microfluidic device with transparent electrodes and insulation has been developed that permits real time, spatially resolved spectroscopy measurements of solution composition between and around electrodes while controlling initial concentrations, field strengths and gradients, and flow rates. Spatially and temporally resolved concentration data will be used to develop, improve, and validate mathematical models of field-dependent activity coefficients, which will be used to predict equilibrium states and coupled transport in complex solutions. Not only will these constitute the first accurate models of DMT but will also expand our understanding of this transport phenomenon by assessing the importance of structure-field interactions. Integrated with this research project is an undergraduate, research-oriented alternative to Senior Design, which will lead students from starting a research project through to creating and disseminating research products. The research component of this CAREER proposal will serve as a core, guaranteed research opportunity for students within the course. Incorporating research and mentoring into a familiar classroom setting significantly reduces cultural and institutional barriers while reducing uncertainty and time cost associated with undergraduate research. In doing so, this plan will increase participation in undergraduate research and ideally position students to continue and thrive in their future education and career.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
