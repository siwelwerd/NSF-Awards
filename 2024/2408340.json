 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this program is to create an antenna design and measurement lab at Wilkes University by obtaining an anechoic chamber for antenna testing. The establishment of a dedicated laboratory for wireless systems at Wilkes University aims to significantly enhance the training of undergraduate and graduate students in this critical field. The rapid growth in antenna and radio frequency (RF) technologies has created a high demand for well-trained RF engineers. Wilkes University, primarily an undergraduate institution with a significant proportion of first-generation college students, is committed to mentoring and providing students with a robust engineering foundation. This initiative aligns with our mission to equip students with up-to-date knowledge of key concepts, underlying principles, and practical applications in technology. By offering research opportunities with state-of-the-art instrumentation, the proposed laboratory will foster new partnerships and strengthen existing collaborations among researchers and across disciplines. This project not only supports educational and diversity goals but also contributes to the advancement of national prosperity by preparing a new generation of skilled engineers.\r\n\r\nThe proposed laboratory will focus on developing advanced antennas and RF systems, with the primary goals of enhancing educational experiences and advancing research capabilities at Wilkes University. The laboratory will be equipped with cutting-edge technology to facilitate hands-on learning and innovative research projects. The intellectual merit of this project lies in the design and development of novel antennas, including ultra-wideband antennas for microwave imaging, wearable antennas, dual-polarized antennas, miniaturized and textile antennas for energy harvesting, and antennas for GPS satellite communication. The acquisition of the requested equipment is essential for advancing these research activities and will provide the foundation for new interdisciplinary collaborations and competitive research projects. This equipment will enable realistic measurements of wireless systems, fostering partnerships between industry and Wilkes University and attracting new research funding.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
