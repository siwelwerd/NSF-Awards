 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is for funding the purchase of new instrumentation (CTD system) for the R/V Marcus Langseth, a 235\u2019 Global seismic vessel with general oceanographic capabilities. The vessel is owned by Columbia University and operated by Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University under a cooperative agreement with NSF. The Langseth is unique in the U.S. Academic Research Fleet in that it provides a combination of capabilities for imaging the oceans, the seafloor, and the solid earth beneath the sea. It is the only vessel in the world dedicated to academic research that can conduct 3D seismic surveys as well as extended offset 2D surveys. Lately, the vessel is utilized also as a general oceanographic vessel with a demand for extended hydrographic surveys that provide information on the vertical structure of the water column (temperature and salinity as function of depth) using CTDs. This award provides funds for one CTD system for use by the vessel during these surveys. The system would consist of electronics and 30 water sampling bottles (24 operational and 6 spares) as well as the required custom-built frame, interconnecting cables, and ancillary hardware.\r\n\r\nThe principal impact of the present proposal is under Merit Review Criterion 2 of the Proposal Guidelines (NSF 23-525). It provides infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF). The acquisition, maintenance, and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or other organization access to well-maintained, high-quality, calibrated instruments for their research. It ensures the collection of high-quality oceanographic data in support of science, reduces the cost of that research, and expands the base of potential researchers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
