 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national interest by promoting evidence-based science teaching practices in a K-6 bilingual teacher preparation program. The project has potential to yield evidence for ways to prepare future elementary teachers to engage in classroom instruction grounded in science practices that address inequities in science education for emerging bilingual students. Early learners from under-resourced communities with diverse cultural and linguistic backgrounds are underserved in elementary science education. This project addresses a significant need for certified teachers prepared to support STEM learning of elementary students by creating research-based resources that will help prepare undergraduate students to teach science in linguistically diverse K-6 classrooms by connecting their understanding of science content, pedagogy, and the linguistic abilities of bilingual students. Project goals and activities are in direct alignment with the IUSE Engaged Student Learning (ESL) track's focus on \"the development, testing, and use of teaching practices and curricular innovations that will engage students and improve learning, persistence, and retention in STEM\" that involves \"creation, exploration, or implementation of tools, resources, and models\" through a project that is both \"evidence-based and knowledge-generating.\"\r\n\r\nThrough a mixed-methods design, this project will investigate pre-service teachers' K-6 science content and pedagogical content knowledge while learning to leverage the linguistic abilities of emergent bilingual students for elementary science instruction. The goals of the project are to: (1) Better prepare bilingual teacher candidates to teach science content in bilingual K-6 classrooms through instructional design by improving science pedagogical content knowledge (PCK), cross-linguistic awareness of science-related concepts and topics, and improving pass rates on the science subtest of the Core Subjects and Spanish proficiency teaching certification exams; (2) Conduct education research to better understand bilingual teacher candidates' preparation to teach science content in bilingual K-6 classrooms through instructional design. The project focuses on a 1-year sequence within an undergraduate K-6 bilingual teacher preparation program. Year 1 of the project will focus on restructuring an existing bilingual science teaching methods course, developing online learning modules focused on Earth Science concepts aligned with K-6 science standards, and developing a summer bilingual science teaching internship program in partnership with community science education organizations. Years 2 and 3 of the project will focus on implementing this 1-year program and conducting iterative cycles of education research. The project includes efforts to disseminate the results of this work to the broader science and bilingual education community. The NSF IUSE Program in the Directorate of STEM Education, supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through the Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools. Additionally, this project is funded in part by the HSI Program, which aims to enhance undergraduate STEM education, broaden participation in STEM, and build capacity at HSIs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
