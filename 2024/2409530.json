 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research supported by this award aims to advance the field of interferometric gravitational wave astronomy by increasing the sensitivity of existing LIGO detectors and developing new techniques and methods for application to future gravitational wave detectors including Cosmic Explorer. The immediate scientific benefit of improved sensitivity of these detectors is more astrophysics discoveries and a better understanding of the universe. The US has held a leadership role in gravitational wave astronomy since its inception. Research supported by this award is key to maintaining this position over the next decades. However, this research has impacts that go beyond those directly made in the field of gravitational wave detection. The experiments and simulation tasks carried out here provide ideal training grounds for junior scientists. These students will join the PI\u2019s research group, where they will be strongly encouraged and supported to develop their networks and STEM careers within the international research community via collaborations. With continued focus on inclusivity and support for junior group members, the PI supported by this award works to do his part to move the field of physics towards a more equitable situation for female scientists and scientists from under-represented groups.\r\n\r\nThe work aims to improve the sensitivity of future gravitational wave detectors. Specifically, the research will focus on three areas: simulations to support LIGO commissioning and future detector designs, development of a new method for sensing optical imperfections in laser interferometers, and investigations into the possibility of using a new beam shape to reduce one of the fundamental noise sources in laser interferometers: thermal noise. The LIGO detectors are constantly pushing the boundaries of what can be achieved in precision metrology. They now regularly manipulate the quantum uncertainty of light measurements to achieve better sensitivity to gravitational waves and operate close to their theoretical optimum performance. These achievements are only possible thanks to on-site and remote simulation-based commissioning activities, which this award partially supports. The next-generation US ground-based gravitational wave detector Cosmic Explorer is currently in the conceptual design phase. It is crucial to apply our understanding of LIGO's operation and limitations to the design of Cosmic Explorer to maximize the likelihood of its future success. Thermal noise is also a limiting factor in other areas of cutting-edge research, such as optical clocks. The research supported by this award may therefore have cross-cutting technical impact beyond gravitational wave astronomy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
