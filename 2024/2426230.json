 "awd_abstract_narration": "This funding establishes a new Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at the University of Michigan Flint focused on digital accessibility. People with a disability are much less likely to have completed a bachelor's degree than people without a disability. Graduate degrees are particularly important for this demographic because the unemployment rate for people with disabilities drops significantly with higher levels of education. However, few opportunities exist for students with disabilities to prepare for graduate studies. This undergraduate research experience site will enable new opportunities for students with and without disabilities to be involved in digital accessibility research. The proposed research will bridge the digital divide, ensuring that individuals with diverse abilities can leverage the advancements in technology, leading to a more inclusive and equitable digital society.\r\n\r\nThe proposed research projects within the site will develop new knowledge, methods, and frameworks to build the next generation of inclusive software and assess the challenges that people with disabilities experience when using technology. This site will build on the experience of many mentors who have worked with undergraduate students in their individual research to cover three themes: (1) Inclusive Software Requirements Engineering and Design, (2) Inclusive Software Development, and (3) Inclusive Software Testing and Maintenance. The proposed activities will include understanding the research literature, formulating and refining relevant research questions, performing empirical studies and designing novel approaches and prototypes. Students engage in critical problem-solving and multidisciplinary research through these projects, which incorporate principles from computer science, software engineering, human-computer interaction, health and related disciplines. Students will be able to broaden their understanding of user-centered design and the significance of developing equitable digital experiences. In addition to conducting research, the students will participate in other professional development activities, such as field trips, professional seminars, invited speaker series, career guidance, and graduate school preparation.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
