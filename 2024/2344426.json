 "awd_abstract_narration": "The lifetime of methane in the atmosphere is relatively short compared to other major atmospheric gases; hence, reducing its emission represents a rapid option for rendering the planet more resilient. Methane production from dairy and beef cattle is a considerable component of farming-related emissions, and multiple on-farm strategies, including feed-additives, are being developed to reduce this source. The project aims to apply novel microsensor technology to quantify the emission of methane from individual cows. When linked to custom-designed information technology systems, the technology will allow estimation of methane emissions at the whole-herd scale. This information will enable farmers to monitorand validate the effectiveness of methane-reduction approaches and provide the information required to access economic incentives for adoption of the emission-reduction approaches and engage in smart agricultural practices. Effective mitigation of methane emissions from agriculture will benefit society as a whole by rendering the planet more resilient for future generations.\r\n\r\nThrough an expanding partnership of complementary expertise, the project aims to progress the development of a functional, robust, ear-tag mounted, methane microsensor that is sufficiently sensitive and selective to quantify concentrations in the vicinity of a cow\u2019s muzzle, where most enteric methane is emitted. Preliminary trials on a working dairy farm are aimed at optimizing sensor deployment times, data recovery and interpretation strategies and to validate the measurements through intercomparison with established, scientific instrumentation. Additional partnerships will be established to design and implement data processing and interpretation systems that integrate with existing \u2018smart agriculture\u2019 technology. Initial engagement with experts in atmospheric gas accounting will be consolidated during the second phase of the project to establish methodologies that effectively utilize the microsensor technology as the basis for farm-specific emissions reduction quantification. The overarching goal is to transition an innovative microsensor technology from prototype to commercial readiness for application in the dairy and beef industries and integration in smart farming practices, with the intention that it will be an integral tool in the validation and promotion of mitigation strategies aimed at reducing enteric methane emissions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
