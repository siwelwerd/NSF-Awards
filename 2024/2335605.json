 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to reduce the $740B a year burden of substance use. Healthcare costs, crime, and lost productivity are only a fraction of the problem that has claimed over 100,000 lives in 2021 alone. The proposed innovation is a novel AI-based technology integrated into a mobile app that allows the assessment of drug use or alcohol intoxication based on voice signals. Substance and alcohol use disorders are prevalent across every stratum of our society.  Not only are the users impacted, but the penumbra of individuals impacted includes every citizen in the US. Preventing early exposure to illicit drugs and alcohol lowers the likelihood of developing severe addiction later in life. By disrupting normal brain development, various substances increase the long-term negative effects on a child\u2019s life. Given the skyrocketing rates of depression and anxiety among teenagers, the wide availability of highly potent synthetic substances, and the ease of access to drugs, parents feel ill-equipped to protect their children.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research Phase 1 project will help advance knowledge in several important areas, such as artificial intelligence capabilities, leveraging digital media platforms for data collection, synthetic audio data generation, and using the mix of temporal and spectral domains for audio analysis. Each area is an active research field, but the combination of all these areas into a product for analyzing voice to detect intoxication caused by various substances has not been previously attempted by academia or industry. The company\u2019s technology relies on the unique impact that each substance use has on neuromotor function, as manifested by the bio-mechanical process of voice production. By comparing the voice signal against the speakers\u2019 baseline voice, the technology will flag abnormal deviations of acoustic features that are typically consistent with intoxication. The field of voice analysis integrates a range of features and signal characteristics to extract valuable insights from voice signals. The primary objectives are to develop and deploy this AI-based technology in ubiquitous devices such as mobile phones while ensuring its performance in real-life conditions and achieving soft real-time processing.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
