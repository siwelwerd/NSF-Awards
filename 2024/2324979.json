 "awd_abstract_narration": "A goal of the Tribal Colleges and Universities Program (TCUP) is to increase the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) instructional and research capacities of specific institutions of higher education that serve the Nation's indigenous students. Expanding the STEM curricular offerings at these institutions expands the opportunities of their students to pursue challenging rewarding careers in STM feels, provides for research studies in areas that may be culturally significant, and encourages a community and generational appreciation for science and mathematics education. Sustainability of capacity gains is significantly enhanced by retaining the talent of credentialed STEM faculty.  This project aligns directly with that goal.\r\n\r\nTo strengthen its STEM offering, Bay Mills Community College is developing four additional science courses and researching the efficacy of developing a Bachelor of Science in Science degree.  The four courses to be developed include biology I, biology II, chemistry I, and chemistry II.  To build capacity, summer science camps are offered to local middle and high-school students.  These activities combine to provide a stronger transfer curriculum for students seeking an upper-level instructional experience, a more prepared incoming student experience, and the potential for seeking a four-year degree in STEM without transfer.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
