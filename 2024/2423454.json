 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to enable novel preclinical research into brain disorders and screening of neurological drug candidates by providing a versatile, multifunctional tool for neuroscience research. This flexible, fiber-based neural probe integrates electrical, optical, and chemical capabilities into a single implantable device for the brain, empowering scientists to combine recording of neural activity with electrical and optical stimulation along with targeted delivery of pharmacological agents in animal models. This is a crucial advance to enable insights into neurological disorders and translation of neuroscience discoveries into effective therapies. The technology has significant commercial potential in the neuroscience research market ($240M Annually) as well as the pharmaceutical market for screening of neurological drug candidates ($600M Annually) based on both primary and secondary market research. The completion of this Phase I project will significantly de-risk the commercialization of this groundbreaking neurotechnology.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will address a key shortcoming of today\u2019s neural interfacing research technologies: a lack of available tools that can combine key methods spanning electrical, optical, and chemical modalities into a single device in a single brain region. To address this challenge, a novel neural probe will be developed based on multi-material, flexible, microscopic, bioelectronic fiber technology that integrates diverse capabilities including electrophysiological recording, optical and electrical stimulation, drug delivery, and neurotransmitter monitoring. In this Phase I project, key technical challenges to commercializing and scaling the multifunctional neural probe\u2019s production will be addressed by (1) integrating electrodes and microfluidic channels along the length of the probe to achieve broader spatial sampling, (2) developing a novel integrated back-end connector comprising electrical pins, optical ferrules, and fluidic fittings, and (3) establishing an automated and scalable manufacturing approach. At the conclusion of the project, a versatile tool enabling novel neuroscience research paradigms will be ready for commercialization.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
