 "awd_abstract_narration": "Microelectronics and integrated circuits have revolutionized computing, communication, and information technology. However, the size, cost, performance, and battery life in a variety of applications is increasingly limited by systems that process power and energy, which in turn is limited by power electronic circuits, passive and active devices, and integration strategies. The Power Management Integration Center (PMIC), a collaboration between researchers at Dartmouth and the University of California, San Diego (UCSD), is addressing these challenges with next-generation power electronic circuits, systems, and components. PMIC's mission is to create innovations that support higher efficiency, smaller size, and reduced cost. The center connects leading academic researchers with a large and growing industry base that has a great need for collaborative, interdisciplinary research as well as workforce development and training, including students from underrepresented backgrounds to become leaders in this important STEM area.\r\n\r\nAs part of PMIC\u2019s strategic plan to advance integrated power management, UCSD contributes unique, internationally recognized expertise in three critical aspects: high-power-density integrated power converters, ultra-low-quiescent power conversion and energy harvesting systems, and high-voltage III/VI materials suitable for power applications. The proposed work will advance the theory and practice in all of these areas. Modeling, design and fabrication of novel hybrid and piezoelectric-based power converter topologies, control laws, and GaN devices will be advanced and integrated into new applications. Phase II of the center will expand collaborations between Dartmouth and UCSD to combine circuit, system, and component innovations.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
