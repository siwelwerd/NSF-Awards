 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is funded from the Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Sites program in the Directorate for Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences (SBE). It has both scientific and societal benefits in addition to integrating research and education. This 8-week summer program for 12 undergraduate students aims to cultivate a new generation of scholars to conduct research on the demography of the criminal justice system with relevance for research, policy, and practice. Through a combination of activities including classroom learning, workshops on skill development, involvement in mentored research projects, and opportunities for community engagement, students will develop research skills and advance interdisciplinary research. The goals of the program are to enhance student skill development and enable students to contribute to scientific advances on ongoing research projects with research active faculty scholars.\r\n\r\nStudents will receive training in classrooms, in research labs, in individual mentored research projects, and in partnership with community organizations in policy and practice settings. Classroom activities will shed light on exposure to and impacts of criminal justice contact and educational, economic, health, political, and social inequalities in the U.S. Student engagement in research labs and on mentored research projects will enable students to develop research skills and provide support for student scholarship on the causes and consequences of justice system involvement. Through the involvement of practice and policy partners, the program aims to bridge barriers between basic and applied research and facilitate the conduct of research with policy and practice relevance as well as to support students to communicate research insights in scholarly and public spaces. Students will be exposed to, and have the opportunity to engage in, research focused on inequality in exposure to the criminal justice system; impacts of criminal justice contact; and the implementation and impact of policy and practice innovations in related areas. The intellectual work done by students can help move the discourse on the criminal justice system in new ways and broaden the way we think about the criminal justice system and its impact.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
