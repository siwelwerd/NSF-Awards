 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-year Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site: Regulatory Science for Engineering Intuitive, Engaging, Safe and Effective Human-Device Interaction is hosted by the University of Houston. This project is a unique collaboration of the Industry-University Cooperative Research Center for Building Reliable Advances and Innovations in Neurotechnology (IUCRC BRAIN) at the University of Houston and the Office of Science and Engineering Labs (OSEL) in the Center for Devices and Radiological Health of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The objective is to develop a diverse, inclusive, and socially responsible workforce of young scientists, engineers and design professionals needed to address major gaps in the early-stage development of products and processes to fulfil the healthcare needs of the U.S.  Regulatory Science is the science of developing new tools, standards, and approaches to assess the safety, efficacy, quality, and performance of FDA-regulated products. Seven students will engage in a twelve-week program in Houston and in White Oak, Maryland. This first-of-its-kind REU Site will address best design and engineering practices, computing tools, and new computational methods to support early-stage medical device development and their evaluation so that as a nation, we can keep up with the accelerated pace of technology development and innovation. This REU Site will prepare students for future careers in regulatory science and medical device development while understanding the socio-technological impact of user-centered engineered medical devices and biomedical innovations. \r\n\r\n\r\nThis three-year Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site: Regulatory Science for Engineering Intuitive, Engaging, Safe and Effective Human-Device Interaction is hosted by the University of Houston. This REU Site provides a twelve-week summer research experience (4 weeks at the UH-BRAIN and 8 weeks at the FDA-OSEL) where students have the opportunity to work on a research project in an established research lab (Human-Device Interaction, Neurological Devices, Regulatory Science, High-Resolution Optical Imaging, and Electromagnetic Compatibility). The objective is to develop a diverse, inclusive, and socially responsible workforce of young scientists, engineers and design professionals needed to address major gaps in the early-stage development of products and processes to fulfil the healthcare needs of the U.S.  Seven students will engage in a twelve-week program in Houston, Texas and in White Oak, Maryland. Participants will attend themed seminars, professional development sessions, technical and career development workshops, lab tours, and complete student presentations at the FDA Annual Student Scientific Research Day. REU participants will conduct research under recognized experts in all aspects of human-device interaction design, development, and evaluation. This REU Site will prepare students for future careers in regulatory science and medical device development while understanding the socio-technological impact of user-centered engineered medical devices and biomedical innovations.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
