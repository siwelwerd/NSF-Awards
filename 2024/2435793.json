 "awd_abstract_narration": "Eclogites and associated rocks both drive and record fundamental Earth processes, including those related to earthquake and volcano hazards and the exchange of economically significant elements between Earth's surface and deep interior.  The Geological Society of America Penrose Conference on \u201cEclogites in space and time \u2014 bridging the micro to planetary scales\u201d will be held in June 2025. The conference will gather international scientists from multiple fields to identify emerging breakthroughs and priorities for future research. This award will support the next generation of scientific leaders by providing conference support for approximately 30 outstanding US-based early-career scientists and students to attend the Penrose conference. Participants will be chosen from a range of disciplines and will have the opportunity to make contacts with colleagues from different disciplines and different countries early in their careers.\r\n\r\nThis award will support the next generation of scientific leaders by providing support for approximately 30 outstanding US-based early-career scientists and students to attend the Penrose conference, \u201cEclogites in space and time \u2014 bridging the micro to planetary scale.\u201d Convening this conference is significant and timely as recent advances in petrological, geodynamical, and geophysical techniques underscore the importance of eclogites in different tectonic processes.  Integrating new approaches across multiple disciplines will lead to a better understanding of subduction zone processes, such as the interconnection between metamorphic reactions and the generation of intermediate-depth earthquakes, fluid-rock interaction, flux melting and arc volcanism. This award and conference will also 1) increase participation among early-career scientists and students from US-based institutions, 2) offer unique learning and networking opportunities through presentations, discussions, and field trips, 3) promote widespread dissemination to improve scientific understanding, and 4) foster US and international collaborations.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
