 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to develop innovative technology for environmental monitoring. The researchers are inspired by the natural design of dandelions to create a swarm of tiny, lightweight sensors that can be deployed in hard-to-reach areas by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). These sensors will harness wind currents to spread across vast and difficult terrains, collecting crucial data on environmental conditions. This technology promises to improve our understanding of ecosystems and aid in disaster management by providing real-time, detailed information in places that are otherwise inaccessible. The project brings together expertise from three institutions and will enhance research capacity, support education, and promote diversity in STEM fields.\r\n\r\nThe project focuses on developing a biomimetic swarm sensing system that emulates the dispersal method of dandelion seeds. The system includes sensors with pappus-like structures for flight and energy harvesting, and achene-like components for sensing and communication. Key research goals include designing and optimizing the sensor structures for aerodynamic efficiency, developing robust energy harvesting and communication circuits, and creating a transformer-based deep reinforcement learning architecture for autonomous UAV-assisted sensor deployment. The performance of the system will be validated through simulation and experimental testing. This interdisciplinary research integrates aerodynamic analysis, solid mechanics, microelectronics, signal processing, communication theory, and deep reinforcement learning, aiming to advance both basic science and the practical application of biomimetic swarm-based remote sensing technology.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
