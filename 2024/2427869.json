 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact of this I-Corps project is the development of a method to detect early stages of cancer. Cancer causes the death of more than 600,000 Americans each year. Researchers would like to develop a test to identify cancer biomarkers in blood or saliva that detects early onset of the disease as survival rate increases with early detection. Research demonstrates that Raman spectroscopy, a commonly used method to provide a structural fingerprint of molecules, can identify biomarkers of many types of cancers such as breast, colorectal, ovarian, and others. The Raman signal from cancer biomarkers is very weak and needs to be amplified to be reliable. This technology achieves this amplification using Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS), which provides a substrate that may improve the signal and allow development of a test for the early detection of cancer.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. The solution is based on the development of a Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS) substrate using nanotechnology. The substrate is composed of silver (Ag) nanowires coated with nickel (Ni). The properties and structure of the substrate have been studied using electron microscopy, quantum mechanics, and multi-physics-based calculations. The Ag-Ni nanowire substrate has shown high reliability and reproducibility and meets Food and Drug Administration (FDA) standards for clinical trials. The lack of a commercial substrate has been a roadblock to develop Raman-based cancer detection tests. If successful, this technology may allow researchers to develop routine diagnostic tests from a blood or salvia sample for the early detection of cancer.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
