 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Improving Undergraduate STEM Education: Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSI Program), this Educational Instrumentation (EI) project aims to train students on Powder x-ray diffraction (PXRD), one of the most utilized tools in materials science and engineering. This tool allows for determining the crystal structure and purity of bulk solid materials. As a primarily undergraduate, Hispanic-serving institution, Texas Lutheran University (TLU) is dedicated to providing high-quality education and training to undergraduate students. This instrument acquired through this educational instrumentation grant will improve the education training and quality of undergraduate students at TLU. The PXRD adds a new, exciting and relevant topic to intermediate and advanced physics and chemistry lab offerings that will better prepare graduates for a wide range of opportunities that meet the needs of an expanded technological workforce.\r\n\r\nAcquiring the powder x-ray diffractometer will expand the training and education at TLU, providing undergraduate and underrepresented minority students with exposure to real- world applications and practical experiences. PXRD is a robust and versatile materials characterization technique for determining phase identification, purity, and crystal structure with multiphase analysis, phase transition monitoring, and measuring unit cell dimensions. The PXRD technique is based on investigating the properties of microcrystalline powders and will bring a new dimension of training and education to TLU students, which is not currently possible. The acquisition of a benchtop powder x-ray diffractometer will enable students to work with cutting- edge technology in the fields of solid-state chemistry, physics, and materials science, enhancing their learning experience and preparing them for the demands of these industries. The addition of the PXRD in teaching labs will not only enhance faculty-student interactions and expand student learning and training options but also play a significant role in strengthening faculty collaborations, fostering teamwork, and creating more exciting outreach activities. The HSI Program aims to enhance undergraduate STEM education and increase capacity to engage in the development and implementation of innovations to improve STEM learning and teaching at HSIs. Projects supported by the HSI Program will also generate new knowledge on how to achieve these aims.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
