 "awd_abstract_narration": "Bringing medical imaging technologies to remote areas of the world can be very challenging, creating stark disparities in patient access to potentially life-saving screening procedures, such as for breast cancer. Ultrasound, though, is portable and generally low cost. Recently, wireless ultrasound probes have revolutionized how and where ultrasound can be used, bringing the imaging method directly to the patient bedside. However, due to the complexity of the hardware, the data available from these wireless systems are limited and ultimately only represent a two-dimensional snapshot of a three-dimensional (3D) tumor. To address these challenges, the goal of this Engineering Research Initiation award is to develop a novel low-cost system capable of generating 3D ultrasound volumes at the patient bedside and quantitatively analyze images from this system to extract features that detect cancer. This award will also promote the development of a hands-on ultrasound curriculum at the undergraduate level as well as immersive and engaging ultrasound activities for elementary and middle school students, increasing awareness of ultrasound imaging and the role of engineers in the medical world.\r\n\r\nThis project aims to engineer a low-cost, point-of-care, 3D wireless ultrasound system and determine optimal quantitative biomarkers that can be extracted from this system to diagnose breast cancer. To undertake this interdisciplinary work, the research will be focused into two main objectives. The first objective will establish quantitative tools using both traditional signal processing and artificial intelligence to extract ultrasound-derived biomarkers from wireless ultrasound data and evaluate their ability to improve breast cancer diagnosis. The second objective will focus on the development of a robust calibration, registration, and sensor fusion protocol to create 3D tissue volumes using a wireless ultrasound probe and a low-cost commercial sensor. The results of these studies have the potential to establish a new foundation for future innovation in accessible ultrasound technologies and increase access to critical cancer screening tools in low-resource settings.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
