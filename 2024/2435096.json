 "awd_abstract_narration": "Texas communities face increasing challenges from weather-related disasters, population growth, and demographic shifts. Many rural and underserved areas lack the resources to effectively plan for and respond to these hazards. The Texas WEATHER program aims to address this critical need by fostering connections between hazard scientists and local practitioners for actionable knowledge at the science-policy-practice interface. The objective for this project, Texas WEATHER: Whole-community Efforts to Adapt, THrive, and Enhance Resilience, is to develop a community of practice through outreach and engagement, ultimately improving Texas communities' resilience to extreme weather events. We will foster collaboration between academic institutions and local organizations to identify and support 'resilience stewards' - community leaders who can champion holistic, locally tailored responses to climate hazards. By bridging connections between these stewards and academic resources, we aim to enhance resilience, particularly in underserved communities that are isolated due to geography, language, or economic barriers. The broader impacts of this research include increased capacity through new relationships, knowledge, and skills, and an executive education curriculum at the intersection of future severity of extreme weather exposure and actionable strategies to enhance resilience. Additionally, this project will benefit the field by improving understanding of how to connect rural and other isolated communities to research centers and science support, as well as identifying gaps in knowledge on effective risk and preparedness communication to diverse communities. Lastly, findings from this research will inform recommendations to improve federal, statewide, and regional support systems.\r\n\r\nThe Texas WEATHER project will employ a co-production approach to develop research questions based on the reciprocal exchange of experiential and scientific knowledge between community partners, hazard scientists, and policy specialists. The project will unfold over two years through four sequential activities aimed at co-producing a research agenda with 2-3 place-based communities to develop actionable solutions for community-scale resilience. Methods include utilizing social vulnerability data and mapping tools to identify at-risk areas, forming community relationships based on reciprocity principles, and engaging communities through online workshops, semi-structured interviews, and surveys. The project will foster peer learning on weather challenges and equip community leaders with strategies for future extreme weather impacts. Key principles guiding the project include reciprocity, reflexive co-production, and asset-based community development, ensuring that community partners are valued for their local expertise.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
