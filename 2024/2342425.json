 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Chemical Structure, Dynamics, and Mechanisms A (CSDM-A) Program in the Division of Chemistry, Janice Musfeldt of the University of Tennessee is using a variety of spectroscopic measurements to study the properties of molecular multiferroics under high magnetic fields, pressure, and strain. These compounds exhibit tunable chemistry and competing phases with overall low energy scales. By applying external stimuli, molecular charge, orbits, structure, and magnetism change. Dr. Musfeldt and her students will measure these changes to develop phase diagrams, reveal coupling processes, test the role of chirality in establishing functionality, and establish routes to previously unobserved phases. Their discoveries could address questions related to the chemical and physical tunability of molecular quantum materials. This project will help to build the future workforce at the chemistry/physics interface as students performing these experiments will be trained in spintronics and quantum information science. \r\n\r\nUnder this award, the spectroscopic properties of molecular multiferroics, quantum magnets, and spin qubits under external stimuli will be studied using dichroism, Raman, and infrared spectroscopies to reveal new states of matter in these chemical systems. Interactions between the charge, spin, and lattice degrees of freedom in these compounds are sought. Structure-property relationships will be explored by examining nonreciprocal effects, testing strategies for eliminating vibronic decoherence, and tailoring the metal environment in color change materials. By combining light-matter interactions of the molecular multiferroics under well-controlled extreme conditions, the team seeks to develop improved approaches to chemical and physical tunability.  The Tennessee team will also pursue the development of underlying  theory and examine key quantum information concepts that relate to the behavior of these molecular multiferroics when placed under external stimuli.  In this way, these studies have the potential to make important contributions to the understanding of quantum materials.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
