 "awd_abstract_narration": "The IEEE Radio & Wireless Week (RWW) covers a broad range of emerging research topics in radio wireless technologies, from theory to practical implementation, from integrated chips to large-scale systems, from kilohertz (kHz) to terahertz (THz), and from communications to sensing and space applications. It is sponsored by the IEEE Microwave Theory and Technology Society, with technical co-sponsorships from the IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society, the IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Society, and the IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society. The 20th annual IEEE RWW will be held in San Juan, Puerto Rico on January 19-22, 2025. To support the training of the next-generation scientists and engineers working on 6G Wireless, this NSF grant will provide travel support for 25 students to present their research papers at the conference and learn the cutting-edge research and development of wireless technologies, systems, and applications. The travel grants will be awarded competitively to graduate students from U.S. universities who will present their accepted papers at the conference. The awardees will be selected by a committee of the conference and the paper quality will be considered in the selection process. The proposed travel support will have long-term and broad impacts on the participating students' career developments and contribute to the U.S. STEM workforce development.\r\n\r\nThe IEEE RWW in 2025 consists of five co-located sub-conferences: Topical Conference on Power Amplifiers for Wireless and Radio Applications (PAWR), Topical Meeting on Silicon Monolithic Integrated Circuits in RF Systems (SiRF), Topical Conference on Wireless Sensors and Sensor Networks (WiSNet), Space Hardware and Radio Conference (SHaRC), and Radio and Wireless Symposium (RWS). Students attending the conference will learn about the latest state-of-the-art wireless technologies in these topical areas covering devices, integrated circuits, antennas, system architectures, and emerging applications such as 6G Wireless and space communications/sensing.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
