 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is a request for a $20,000 travel grant to support students attending or participating in the 2024 Embedded Systems Week (ESWEEK), which will be held at the Sheraton Raleigh Hotel in Raleigh, NC, USA, from September 29 to October 4, 2024. ESWEEK is the leading event in the embedded systems field. Its conferences have traditionally been very selective, with acceptance rates typically in the 25-30% range. ESWEEK is normally attended by over 300 participants, where conferences and symposia traditionally have high rates of student attendance and participation. Students attend the workshops and talks, and they participate by presenting papers that they have authored, where each accepted paper is accompanied by a poster presented in a separate poster sessions. Most of the students have been Ph.D. candidates doing research relevant to the conferences, symposia and workshops. Special preference given to US citizens and permanent residents as well as under-represented groups.\r\n\r\nThe support requested in this proposal will subsidize the cost for students to attend and will be used to increase participation of students, including minority and underrepresented students. The proposal describes how the allocation of the 20 travel awards will be distributed among students without a paper, and those students from underrepresented groups, as well as students from a 4-year college or university.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
