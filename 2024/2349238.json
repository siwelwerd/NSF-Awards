 "awd_abstract_narration": "A new three-year REU Site: Undergraduate Research in Sensor Development (Design, Manufacture, Analysis) and Implementation Pipeline (SDIP) is hosted by Clarkson University. The SDIP program focuses on developing skilled leaders capable of addressing global challenges in fields such as public health, the environment, space, defense, photonics, and electronics. Ten students will engage in research about the fundamentals, design, manufacturing, data analytics and applications of sensing technologies. SDIP aims to promote the progress of science and contribute to the development of a qualified workforce in engineering technologies. REU participants will focus on developing essential skills in sensing technologies, and then using those skills and understanding to help solve real-world problems and prepare for STEM careers. Professional coaching, presentations, and opportunities to work on publications will enhance students\u2019 communication skills and their capabilities to disseminate knowledge to the broader society.\r\n\r\nThe program's objectives are to: 1) Improve students' abilities to solve real-world problems and develop into independent researchers through cross-disciplinary training in sensing technologies, 2) Enhance students' interpersonal, oral, and written communication skills through professional coaching and diverse presentation formats, 3) Broaden the academic pipeline and facilitate students' pathways into STEM careers, with a focus on engineering systems and sensor technologies, and 4) Cultivate a diverse and motivated cohort to meet the nation's need for a qualified workforce in engineering technologies. Students will be involved in all aspects of research, from conceptualization and experimental planning to data interpretation and result dissemination. They will gain experience in sensor design, development, mathematical modeling, data analysis, manufacturing, and deployment. Each participant will address an open- ended problem to develop the technical and critical-thinking skills necessary for creating and characterizing sensing systems. Additionally, REU participants will engage with industry professionals, participate in development activities, attend seminars, and go on field trips, all of which will help prepare them for successful, lifelong careers in STEM.\r\n\r\nThis Site is supported in part by funds provided to the National Science Foundation by the Semiconductor Research Corporation.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
