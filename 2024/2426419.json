 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal supports student travel for about 20 students to attend the 2024 Privacy Enhancing Technology Symposium (PETS), to be held in Bristol, United Kingdom, from July 15-20, 2024. PETS is a leading venue for quick and wide dissemination of cutting-edge research that address the design and realization of privacy services for the Internet and other data systems and communication networks by bringing together anonymity and privacy experts from around the world to discuss recent advances in, and new perspectives on privacy. This travel grant will enable a number of students with financial need to attend the conference, providing them the opportunity to discuss leading edge research with world-class computer researchers in privacy, and establish professional connections and mentoring relationships that will serve them well during their research careers.\r\n\r\nThis grant provides travel support to encourage participation in the 2024 PETS conference by students who would normally find it difficult to attend. Criteria for selection include evidence of a serious interest in the field, as demonstrated by research output, coursework and/or project experience.  The organizers will also encourage participation by students from groups under-represented in computer security and ensure that students from a range of institutions are represented.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
