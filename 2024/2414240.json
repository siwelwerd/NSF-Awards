 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project examines the determinants of methane emissions from fires in regions that exhibit particularly high propensities for fires, including fires that arise from human activity. Methane, a potent gas, has been hypothesized to be a contributor to global greenhouse effects, but precisely measuring methane emissions from fires has been technologically challenging. For example, emissions from savanna fires are broadly regarded as a major source of atmospheric methane, but previous estimates have contained high levels of uncertainty. This research introduces new sensors, methods, and approaches for obtaining comparatively precise estimates of methane emissions from savanna fires. Emissions are predicted to vary in response to the vegetation type and its moisture levels, ambient air conditions, and properties of the fire. In turn, these measurements across a range of conditions and inputs can inform subsequent efforts to estimate the effects of fire management strategies on methane emissions, potentially revealing opportunities for savannas to serve as carbon sinks. The project also provides opportunities for students to gain training in the methods of environmental science.\r\n\r\nThe general objective of this research is to determine the significance of each factor that affects methane emissions and model how changes in land use and fire practices dynamically influence the methane that is produced. A secondary goal is to use simulation methods to predict changes in future methane emissions from fires at regional scales. To obtain measurements of emissions, the researchers experimentally initiate burns using practices that are used by local human populations, and then they use sensors mounted on airborne drones to document the extent of methane associated with these fires. The measurements subsequently inform the simulations of burning practices and the resulting methane emissions across diverse contexts. Workshops with local partners provide opportunities for the study to shape local land use practices in ways that advance sustainable livelihood strategies.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
