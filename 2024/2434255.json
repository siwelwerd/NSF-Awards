 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Improving Undergraduate STEM Education: Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSI Program), this Educational Instrumentation (EI) proposal aims to revolutionize the teaching of physics in STEM programs at the university and extend this innovative approach to other educational institutions. The project will develop six virtual physics experiments using immersive virtual reality headsets. This cutting-edge technology leverages the three primary senses\u2014sight, hearing, and touch\u2014to create a realistic virtual experience. Students will be immersed in a distraction-free environment, enabling them to clearly visualize and comprehend abstract and invisible physical phenomena, such as electromagnetic fields. Additionally, the project will include two hands-on modern physics experiments (diffraction and spectrometer) to provide practical training in quantum physics principles. The integration of virtual reality and real-world experiments aims to offer a comprehensive and immersive physics education.\r\n\r\nThe project will develop six virtual physics experiments compatible with Meta Quest 3 headsets and Windows PCs, featuring capabilities for both group collaboration and online participation. This ensures inclusive access for all students, regardless of gender or socioeconomic status. The development process will be coordinated between an experienced software company and physics department professors. The modern physics experiment on diffraction will enable students to observe and measure the interference and diffraction patterns of light, demonstrating its wave-like nature. Similarly, the emission spectrometer experiment will allow students to observe and measure the discrete spectra of different chemical elements, highlighting the quantization of energy at the atomic level. These experiments will provide students with practical training in high-precision scientific instruments and a deeper understanding of fundamental quantum physics principles. The HSI Program aims to enhance undergraduate STEM education and build capacity at HSIs. Projects supported by the HSI Program will also generate new knowledge on how to achieve these aims.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
