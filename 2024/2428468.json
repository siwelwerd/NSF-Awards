 "awd_abstract_narration": "New episodes for a second season of the recently released television series, Doug's Geology Journal, will be produced and broadcast on the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) network and streamed on major online platforms, building on the success of the first season, which reached 50 percent of the PBS audience.  Doug's Geology Journal features Doug Prose, a filmmaker and geologist, as the on-camera host who, in an entertaining style, explores a fascinating geological area in each half-hour episode.  For Season Two this project will use traditionally effective promotional tools as well as social media to bring the series to a larger audience.  A publicity campaign including a tour of schools, with an emphasis on those serving underrepresented communities, will increase the impact of the series\u2019 content and training products.  Overall, the series is designed to greatly expand public interest in geoscience concepts and their relevance to everyday life.  This is crucial at a time when the geosciences are becoming increasingly important in tackling natural resource shortages, climate change, and geologic hazards such as earthquakes, landslides, and volcanic eruptions.  The project will also provide tools that will improve the communication skills of students and professionals from diverse backgrounds, ultimately helping to build a more innovative and diverse geoscience profession.\r\n\r\nThis project will produce new episodes for Season Two of Doug\u2019s Geology Journal, a television series currently being broadcast on Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) stations nationwide and streamed on major platforms online.  New episodes for a second season will be produced, distributed, and promoted under this project, building on the success of the first season.  Season One broadcasts reached about 50 percent of the PBS audience, an excellent success rate for a first-time series.  This project will seek to expand the series' audience and impact by including a robust outreach component which employs traditional publicity methods and the use of contemporary social media tools.  Activities include generating and placing stories, interviews, video production training videos, blogs, and podcasts in multiple media outlets; and conducting an in-person tour of colleges and high schools that primarily serve students underrepresented in the geosciences.  Formative evaluation and iterative development design will ensure that the episodes are accurate and have a significant learning impact on the intended diverse audiences.  This project helps fill the need to increase public access to relevant and accurate earth science knowledge, at a time when public trust in science is eroding while, simultaneously, knowledge of geological concepts is becoming increasingly important for addressing growing natural resource challenges, climate change, and geologic hazards.  Improving the communication skills of geoscience students and professionals will contribute to efforts to develop a more diverse and innovative workforce.  Support for geoscience research overall will be strengthened as the series increases in popularity.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
