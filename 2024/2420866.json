 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant will support travel for dissertation-stage students at U.S. institutions to participate in the Communication, and Digital Technology, and Organization (CTO) doctoral consortium at the 2024 Academy of Management (AOM) convention in Chicago, Illinois.  The doctoral consortium provides students with feedback on their work from other students and faculty members, allowing them to enhance their own dissertation research proposals. Additionally, because of the diversity of the business sub-disciplines and communities involved in the AOM conference, the consortium will allow students to establish research connections beyond their own disciplines. Consequently, participation will allow students to develop a better understanding of the different research communities, which will facilitate their participation in future interdisciplinary research.  This travel funding will allow students who might not otherwise have support to attend the consortium.\r\n\r\nAbout 15 students will be selected, chosen to span a range of disciplines and topic areas that CTO research addresses, as well as a range of institutional types and backgrounds.  Students who are just before or after their dissertation proposal will be prioritized, as well as students with demonstrated financial need.  Students be assigned in small groups to faculty mentors, with each student getting feedback from both the mentor and other student participants.  There will also be a career professionalization session in which panels will discuss publication and reviewing, interviewing, and academic career management.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
