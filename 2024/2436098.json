 "awd_abstract_narration": "In a world increasingly driven by artificial intelligence (AI), across the nation there is a rising need for an AI literate workforce that spans industry sectors, a push which is felt across institutions of higher education from students, faculty, and the industries interested in employing their graduates. This NSF CUE Pathways project is a collaboration between Education Development Center (EDC) and Green River College (WA), along with Bridgerland Technical College (UT), Bunker Hill Community College (MA), Harford Community College (MD), and Nashville State Community College (TN) to build a replicable pathway from 2 year to 4 year CS degrees, increasing AI literacy among faculty and students, better preparing graduates to advance in CS degrees and participate effectively in the world of work they will enter upon graduation. The project raises visibility of community colleges (CCs) as the workforce development engine producing our nation\u2019s middle-skilled AI workforce. The rich diversity of students that attend two-year colleges will serve to broaden the participation of these groups in the pathways to AI and Computer Science (CS) degrees and jobs, thereby building a more robust and creative workforce enabled with AI. \r\n\r\nThis project builds on a successful five-year partnership of five CCs previously funded through NSF to develop new programs, courses, and/or curricula in data science. The project leverages best practices, curriculum and program development, and integration tools developed and tested through ATE and STEM+C funding, which enables schools to expedite development of new programs. Partner colleges will develop and implement a strategic plan for pathway development; co-design, test, and implement an AI literacy course for students; and will integrate foundational AI skills into data science courses. These courses will build student\u2019s interest in AI, develop AI literacy and AI prompting skills, and introduce them to AI applications across careers. The project will (1) increase the number of CCs designing and testing effective pathways from community college to four-year CS and AI degree programs, (2) increase the number of CC students who are aware of the impact and applications of AI across industry sectors, and (3) build the AI literacy needed for individuals to be active, contributing citizens and workers in our technology-driven world. Lastly, it will increase the number of faculty who are literate in AI and experienced in integrating AI into their courses. To do this, the project will (a) support each CC\u2019s development and implementation of a strategic plan; (b) develop a profile of the middle-skilled AI worker and align AI courses with local industry skill demands; (c) co-design and pilot courses and curricula with stakeholders, and research effectiveness of the AI literacy course and integration; (d) build the capacity of faculty to teach AI literacy and integrate AI into data science; (e) provide faculty externships in industry and experiential learning for students; and (e) model and institutionalize supports for students\u2019 transition to BA/BS degrees.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
