 "awd_abstract_narration": "In order to understand how planets, stars and galaxies form and evolve, we need to measure their physical and chemical properties. These properties can be studied by separating the light they emit into the different colors that make it up using diffraction gratings, a technique called spectroscopy. Some of these objects in the distant Universe are very faint, so we need spectrometers equipped with highly efficient diffraction gratings. The investigators in this project have led a study to develop a unique method to create efficient diffraction gratings called reactive ion-plasma etching (RIPLE). Future telescopes, however, will also require the diffraction gratings to be very large in size. To build very efficient large gratings, the investigators are developing a one-of-a-kind machine called the Multiple Aperture Grating Pattern Inscription Engine (or MAGPIE). MAGPIE can write nanometer-scale grating patterns over very large areas, far beyond what the current state-of-the-art can do. This large pattern can be made into diffraction gratings by use of the RIPLE method. This unique capability will be useful in building mission-critical large diffraction gratings for other areas of research as well as for astronomy.  The team will actively involve graduate and undergraduate students, assuring they learn valuable skills, which can lead to high tech jobs. \r\n\r\nThis interdisciplinary and collaborative research project will develop MAGPIE and advance a broad range of photonic and instrumentation tools that are crucial to astronomical spectroscopic research. This includes the introduction of the large-area nanometric pattern inscription capability and highly deterministic reactive ion-plasma etching technologies to fabricate high aspect ratio, compact line-density, high-dispersion, and very large format astronomical surface-relief gratings to push diffraction and transmission efficiency near theoretical limits. These gains will not only significantly enhance the capabilities of existing telescopes and facilities, but also super-charge large diffraction gratings needed for future generation astronomical instruments. This research program will expand potential applications of such devices to a much broader range of electro-optical-mechanical components and systems in other disciplines. It will also result in educational materials for K-12 educators and students and provide hands-on, real-world training for the next generation graduate-level scientists and engineers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
