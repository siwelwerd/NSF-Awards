 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact of this I-Corps project is the development of high energy and high-capacity solid-state micro-batteries. These batteries promise to usher in a new era of consumer electronics, characterized by devices that are not only smaller and longer lasting but also safer, addressing the needs and concerns of consumers while simultaneously reducing electronic waste. The durability of these batteries translates into fewer replacements, thereby reducing the environmental toll exacted by the manufacturing and disposal of electronic products, a critical step toward sustainability. This semiconductor-based approach represents a shift in the battery manufacturing industry and advances the next generation solid-state batteries to market.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. This solution is based on the development of thin film fabrication of solid-state batteries. The technology combines high-aspect-ratio structures to increase the total energy. The resulting batteries have energy densities higher than state-of-the-art lithium-ion batteries at orders of magnitude higher power, resulting in batteries with 15-30 times more energy, which can recharge on the order of seconds to minutes rather than hours. Furthermore, the shift in manufacturing allows for faster and cheaper production, without the need for element such as cobalt, powders of any kind, and/or external cell pressure.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
