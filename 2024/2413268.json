 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national interest by improving curricula in English as a Second Language (ESL) and computer science (CS) college courses to increase and diversify the CS graduation rate at two-year colleges. Specifically, the project intends to study the effectiveness of methods for recruiting and retaining women and English Language Learners (ELLs) in the computer science sector. Outcomes include ESL courses with integrated CS content, CS courses enhanced with impact-focused and project-based learning, and a pre-internship course to support CS students to develop professional skills needed for a career in STEM. Current research supports the importance of project-based learning and impact-centered projects in empowering women and ELL students who are interested in connecting their academic studies to their lived experiences. This interdisciplinary project has the potential to serve as a model to enhance CS and ESL education at two-year colleges at the national level and contributes to broadening participation in two-year college STEM pathways.  \r\n\r\nIn partnership with a local education nonprofit, the project aims to address the following goals: 1) recruit women and ELL students to CS courses, 2) retain women and ELL students in CS courses, and 3) provide opportunities for CS students\u2019 professional growth. These goals will be achieved by enhancing ESL courses with CS content, training ESL teachers from feeder schools to integrate CS content, refining CS courses to include impact-focused project-based learning activities and developing a noncredit pre-internship course focused on professional skills. Professional development for faculty includes coaching sessions and CS learning community seminars. The project seeks to advance understanding of effective methods for diversifying STEM fields through the research questions: Are ESL classrooms an effective audience for recruiting CS majors? Can impact-focused, project-based learning retain the number of diverse students enrolled in CS courses? Does exposure to professional skills better prepare ELL students to pursue professional growth towards a CS career? Surveys and focus groups will be implemented to determine the overall effectiveness of the project in promoting interests and enrollment in the CS pathway. Outcomes will be disseminated to community college and education nonprofit networks through articles, press releases, social media, and CS and ESL conferences. The NSF IUSE: Innovation in Two-Year College STEM Education (ITYC) Program seeks to accelerate the impact of and advance knowledge about emerging and evidence-based practices in undergraduate STEM education at two-year colleges.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
