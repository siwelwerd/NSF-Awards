 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project is a novel biocompatible gel to improve the effectiveness and safety of thermal tumor ablation procedures. The technology enhances the energy medium of radiofrequency energy, resulting in more effective electroporation of tumors, increasing the therapeutic concentration of energy while minimizing unintended damage to surrounding fluids or tissues. The technological medium aims to improve procedural outcomes for the $800 million and $2.7 billion worldwide image-guided thermal ablation market, with broad applicability for a wide variety of ablation procedures, including those performed for endometrial bleeding, pain management, spinal decompression and denervation, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and emphysema reduction.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Technology Transfer Phase II project aims to develop a novel protein-based gel for improving procedural outcomes during focal tumor ablation procedures. This novel material provides a viscous fluid medium for focusing radiofrequency energy intensity to its intended target area in order to intensify localized energy delivery.  During the first phase, a computational model will be developed using 3D microwave imaging under simulated clinical conditions to predict the thermal behavior of the gel.  During the second phase, preclinical data will be collected using liver, kidney, and muscle tissue in vivo preclinical models and magnetic resonance imaging to quantify temperatures, ablation zone size, and thermal energy deposition. During the third stage, the gel\u2019s effects during tissue ablation will be assessed using in vivo porcine lung and standard non-invasive clinical imaging methods. During the fourth phase, an in vivo chronic safety study will be completed. Upon completion, the results from these milestones will provide the necessary preclinical evidence to initiate first in human studies.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
