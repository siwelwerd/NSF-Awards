 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this EAGER project, funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics & Mechanisms-B Program of the Chemistry Division, Shiyu Zhang of the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Ohio State University aims to develop a new class of battery by pairing Na metal with nitrogen oxides (NOx) gas. The proposed Na-NOx battery would have a higher energy density than conventional flow batteries and can be produced from abundant elements. Additionally, the proposed research will achieve broader impacts on society by taking on a significant problem and training students to address important sustainability issues associated with modern battery technology. Outreach activities involving middle school students in the Columbus area will also be part of the funded project.  \r\n\r\nNOx gases are abundant due to their ease of production from the oxidation of ammonia, a key industrial feedstock produced at about 140 M tons/year. These redox-active NOx species have redox potentials up to 3.25 V vs. Na+/Na, making them attractive energy storage materials. However, due to their highly reactive nature, NOx has yet to be successfully demonstrated for energy storage in batteries. The objective of this proposal is to develop an electrochemical energy storage system by pairing a Na metal anode with an NOx cathode, specifically using nitrogen trioxide (N2O3) and nitric oxide (NO). The research involves  (i) establishing the fundamental (electro)chemistry of Na-NOx batteries through electrochemical and in-situ spectroscopic studies, (ii) systematically improving the stability of Na-NOx static cells through the optimization of electrolyte, separator, temperature, cell design, solution-gas-phase equilibria of gaseous NOx, and (iii) designing Na-NOx flow cells equipped with gas mass flow controller and diaphragm pump.  If successful, this research has the potential to open up a new vista for the chemistry that underlies sustainable battery technology.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
