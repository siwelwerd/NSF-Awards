 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project aims to develop and commercialize a handheld authentication device, based on the principle of nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) spectroscopy, that can help improve the health and safety of the general public. The portable form factor and low cost of the device will make it accessible for everyone to utilize without any restrictions. The powerful analytical capability of this device to provide accurate and reliable results quickly and non-invasively can be used in different stages of the modern supply chain. Specific use cases of the device will include the law-enforcement agencies and postal systems, where it can be used to rapidly identify and isolate illegal drugs, thereby mitigating the illegal drug epidemic. In addition to its use in law enforcement and forensics, this spectroscopy technology has potential applications in the medical field for drug screening and monitoring. Its applicability in drug and pharmaceutical products detection alone will impact a multi-billion-dollar market. Overall, this innovation will greatly enhance our scientific and technical understanding of the capabilities and limitations of the NQR spectroscopy technology for chemical analysis and create a pathway for its widespread deployment in diverse fields. \r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this project lies in utilizing NQR spectroscopy to provide a highly specific and sensitive method at low cost for detecting drugs based on their unique chemical identifiers (UCIs). The project will focus on developing a portable NQR spectrometer device for general consumer use to detect and identify various compounds based on their unique chemical and structural properties in the solid state. NQR spectroscopy can detect drugs that may be difficult to identify using other techniques, such as those that are highly pure or are concealed in complex mixtures or disguised as other substances. The project will explore new approaches to improving the sensitivity based on pre-polarization methods, as well as size, cost, and selectivity of NQR spectroscopy for drug detection, as well as developing new portable instrumentation. Major hardware components, including the broadband tuner and backend signal processing unit, will be custom designed to minimize the footprint and improve sensitivity. The device will be extensively evaluated for wide range of drugs and other substances (e.g., dietary supplements, which often include unregulated harmful chemicals) for its efficacy in commercial settings.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
