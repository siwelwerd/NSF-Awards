 "awd_abstract_narration": "An award is made to the University of South Alabama to acquire a dual inverted selective plane illumination microscopy (diSPIM) light sheet system. The diSPIM light sheet system enables rapid acquisition of extended time lapse image data over a range of relevant biological volumes, from 0.03 to more than 300 \u00b5m3. The acquisition speed of light sheet systems is orders of magnitude faster than other high-end microscopes, while inducing significantly less photodamage. This allows simultaneous measurement of intracellular signals as well as the colocalization and distributions of proteins at subcellular resolution throughout large scale model systems. The diSPIM light sheet system is a scientific nexus for integrating concepts from engineering biological sciences, mathematics, and computer science. Broader training impacts include fostering multidisciplinary expertise that promotes a collaborative scientific training environments for the next generation of biological scientists, chemists, and engineers. Broader educational impacts include incorporation of advanced microscopy and image analysis capabilities in laboratory-based coursework and research opportunities. Broader outreach impacts include summer training experiences for high school and undergraduate students, providing access to cutting edge imaging and image analysis capabilities through summer research programs. \r\n\r\nThis diSPIM system enables projects that support understanding and application of basic biological, chemical, and engineering principles over large length scales, with applications in marine biosystems, environmental toxicology, biochemistry, cell biology, and physiology. This award supports a broad array of projects at the intersections of biological sciences, environmental toxicology, engineering, and computer sciences. Project investigators explore fundamental mechanisms underlying the mechanics of vascular tissue, plant and animal development, movement, cellular communication, information transfer within biological systems, and the roles of rare populations of immune cells. The diSPIM light sheet system allows investigators to expand scientific inquiry over a broad range of length and time scales.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
