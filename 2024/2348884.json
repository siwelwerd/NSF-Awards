 "awd_abstract_narration": "The award will provide support for a three-year REU Site at the College of Staten Island (City University of New York), in collaboration with Hunter College (City University of New York) and with technical support from CUNY's High Performance Computing Center, in an area of increasing national importance: Computational Methods in High Performance Computing with Applications to Computational Sciences. The REU Site will recruit nine undergraduate students for a ten-week summer experience. The students will undertake challenging problems with their mentors in computer science and related fields (such as Computational Vision, Computational Biology and Chemistry, Cyber Security, Deep and Machine Learning, Sensor Networks, and Complex System Modeling and Simulation). The research will require students to learn parallel processing programming techniques for problem-solving. Emphasis will be placed on recruiting students from colleges and universities that offer limited STEM research opportunities such as Minority Serving Institutions. By fostering a research program that is diverse, inclusive, and promotes respect while encouraging collaboration and camaraderie, students can realize their full potential and succeed in both academic and career pursuits. The REU Site will not only attracts students to develop research skills but will also motivate them to pursue graduate studies and research careers in computer science and related disciplines.\r\n\r\nThe program provides a unique opportunity for students to tackle challenging and practical projects requiring parallelism, with the technical support from the City University of New York High Performance Computing Center (CUNY HPCC), while learning theoretical concepts and parallel programming techniques and computational methods in different research areas of computer science or closely related fields, with their mentors. By instilling a comprehensive understanding of parallelism and computational methods, the REU Site cultivates a cohort of skilled and intellectually adept researchers poised to contribute meaningfully to the advancement of computer science and its allied disciplines. Students will be trained to develop competency in scientific research, improve presentations and writing skills, and collaborate to produce significant research results for publication in either a conference proceeding or a journal. The program builds upon the foundation of a previous REU Site experience and introduces significant enhancements with a particular focus on the integration of a diverse range of projects requiring cutting-edge methodologies such as the application of deep and machine learning.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
