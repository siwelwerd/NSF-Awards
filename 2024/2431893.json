 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMP) program assists universities and colleges in diversifying the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce through their efforts at significantly increasing the numbers of students from historically underrepresented minority populations (Blacks and African Americans, Alaska Natives, American Indians, Hispanic and Latino Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Native Pacific Islanders) to successfully complete high-quality degree programs in STEM.\r\n\r\nChicago State University (CSU) will organize and convene two meetings of the LSAMP grantee community which will occur in-person in Washington, DC over two days each in October 2024 and Winter/Spring 2025. These events will provide a forum for updates on NSF funding opportunities, policies and procedures. Additionally, participants will share successful practices in STEM broadening participation post-pandemic. Emphasis will be placed on the Chips and Science Act of 2020. \r\n\r\nAll LSAMP program grantees, selected LSAMP student participants, and representatives from federal laboratories and the corporate sector will participate. Proceedings from the meeting will be disseminated broadly via the organizer's websites.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
