 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact of this I-Corps project is the development of a biodegradable antibacterial spray designed for application in air filtration systems. This solution addresses the need for improved air quality and contamination prevention, providing benefits such as enhanced public health and environmental sustainability. The commercial potential is significant with many applications, including in heating and air conditioning systems of buildings and vehicles. This product meets the growing demand for better indoor air quality solutions. The spray will benefit the air filtration market, offering a cost-effective, high-performance solution that will be seamlessly integrated into the production process of air filters, reducing allergens, viruses, and bacteria to improve quality of life.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. The solution is based on the development of a water-soluble cellulose nanofiber (CNF) spray, which has demonstrated promising results in enhancing the efficiency and barrier properties of biodegradable and synthetic textiles against particulates and pathogens. Validated against industry standards, the CNF spray increased the Bacterial Filtration Efficiency (BFE) of fabrics up to 87.3%. The technology also reduces certain bacteria growth rates by 81%. Integrating this CNF spray into air filtration systems could lead to improved sustainability and a step towards industry-wide adoption and improved air quality management.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
