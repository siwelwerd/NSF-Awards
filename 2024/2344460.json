 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cancer, a pervasive global challenge affecting a substantial portion of the population, necessitates innovative solutions for improved treatment outcomes. This project encapsulates a multidisciplinary approach rooted in convergence research to address a critical issue in cancer surgery. The primary objective is the development of a bioinspired multispectral imaging sensor, drawing inspiration from the mantis shrimp's remarkable visual system. This innovative sensor, compacted onto a single chip, spans a broad spectrum, enabling simultaneous detection of cancer markers through near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence and deep ultraviolet (UV) fluorescence. Our diverse team, comprised of engineers, material scientists, physicians, visual ecologists, and social scientists, unites academia and industry in a collaborative effort to pioneer this groundbreaking technology. The central focus is on real-time intraoperative identification of positive sentinel lymph nodes, a pivotal aspect of cancer surgery, which can significantly impact patient outcomes by reducing the need for additional surgeries and minimizing complications such as lymphedema. \r\n\r\nOur research centers on three primary objectives. Firstly, we aim to develop an advanced multispectral imaging device that seamlessly integrates perovskite nanocrystals and optical metasurfaces with state-of-the-art imaging sensors. This bioinspired sensor will facilitate simultaneous imaging of both endogenous tumor-specific biomarkers in the UV spectrum and exogenous markers in the NIR spectrum; both of which are essential for the accurate identification and staging of lymph nodes during surgical procedures. Secondly, we will conduct comprehensive validation of our bioinspired imaging technology to guarantee its accuracy in detecting positive sentinel lymph nodes, both in vivo and ex vivo. This validation will involve the collection of human data in two distinct clinical settings. Lastly, we will conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the practicality and transformative potential of this technology within the complex landscape of surgical environments. In addition to our scientific pursuits, our project emphasizes a strong commitment to public engagement. Through a collaboration with the Saint Louis Science Center, we intend to educate the broader public on the fascinating realms of bioinspired imaging sensors and nanotechnology, using interactive exhibits to showcase our groundbreaking fluorescence camera. Furthermore, we will extend our collaboration into the realm of medical education, actively integrating bioinspired imaging principles into the curriculum of a new engineering-focused medical school: a partnership between the University of Illinois and the Carle Foundation Hospital. By doing so, we aim to equip the next generation of medical professionals with cutting-edge medical imaging tools and techniques. In essence, our project, rooted in convergence research, holds the promise of revolutionizing cancer surgery, encompassing technological innovation, public outreach, and medical education to ultimately enhance the well-being of cancer patients worldwide.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
