 "awd_abstract_narration": "This funding supports the Geobiology Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) and Gordon Research Conference (GRC) in Galveston, TX from January 13 to 19, 2024. The field of Geobiology investigates life and the environment over Earth history, including both modern phenomena and societally-relevant impacts on the future. In recent years, the field has produced a strong cohort of Geobiologists, and the GRS and GRC serve to strengthen the community and enhance communication across subgroups and disciplines. The 2024 Geobiology GRS and GRC offers numerous formal and informal opportunities to socialize and network. The setting and size (60 and 200 participants maximum) promote connections between junior and senior colleagues. The funding will support the attendance of 25 participants, prioritizing scientists who are early career and from underrepresented backgrounds. The 2024 conference will bring together these diverse scientists who work in different Geobiology disciplines to enable the exchange of ideas, tools, and expertise to promote further cross-pollination and development of these disciplines. \r\n\r\nGeobiology uses the tools of paleontology, geology, geochemistry, microbiology, and engineering but is separated from these more traditional disciplines by an interest in the complex relationships and feedbacks among biological, chemical, and physical processes, large spatial scales, and evolutionary timescales. The conference facilitates interactions among sub-disciplines to understand the ongoing co-evolution of life and the environment. The sessions for Geobiology GRC/GRS 2024 focus on addressing the outstanding questions in the field, and how geobiologists can use their knowledge to mitigate anthropogenic problems and understand life\u2019s impacts on Earth and beyond.  Gordon Research Conferences encourage open and honest intellectual debate as part of a welcoming, inclusive atmosphere and each session chair fosters rigorous analysis of all science in a manner respectful to all conferees. These interactions advance discovery and understanding across Geobiology while promoting mentorship, training and community.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
