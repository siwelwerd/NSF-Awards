 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will partially support the 18th symposium for Study of Earth\u2019s Deep Interior (SEDI), to be held at Simon\u2019s Rock College in Great Barrington, MA June 23-28, 2024. SEDI is a cross-cutting union commission of the International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics (IUGG), the International Association of Geomagnetism and Aeronomy (IAGA), the International Association of Seismology and Physics of the Earth\u2019s Interior (IASPEI), and the International Association of Volcanology and Chemistry of the Earth\u2019s Interior (IAVCEI). The meeting will promote understanding of the thermal, chemical, and dynamical state of the Earth\u2019s deep interior through time, and of the effect that the interior has on structures and processes observed at the surface of the Earth. The award will provide travel support US-based beginning investigators to attend the meeting. SEDI is an international scientific organization dedicated to the Study of the Earth\u2019s Deep Interior. Its primary activity is a biennial meeting, which, because of its relatively small size and meeting structure, provides ample time for discussion of the latest results and more pressing scientific questions. Because of the open discussion, cross-disciplinary nature, and international attendance, the meetings are particularly productive for beginning investigators, including graduate students, post-docs, and those without a permanent position. Applications for support will be broadly solicited and applicants will be supported based on their abstracts and a statement of their situation. The grant will also support a limited number of undergraduates, especially those from groups traditionally underrepresented in geoscience, to attend the meeting.\r\n\r\n\tThe 2024 SEDI meeting will consist of eight sessions, organized by the layers and boundary layers within the Earth, with applications to other planets and moons. The structure of the schedule therefore brings together scientists from multiple sub-disciplines of geosciences as they focus on the structure and dynamics of the systems. The scientific questions and problems of interest to the meeting include the structure and dynamics of the core and mantle, core-mantle interactions and the nature and location of deep geochemical reservoirs, material properties at extreme conditions, the geomagnetic dynamo and geo and paleo magnetism, and the evolution of the Earth\u2019s deep interior.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
