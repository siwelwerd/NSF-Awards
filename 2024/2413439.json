 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award  supports participation in the 9th International Symposium on Riordan Arrays and Related Topics (9RART), scheduled to occur at Howard University in Washington, D.C. from June 3rd to June 5th. Notably, there is a significant historical tie to this event, as the original paper on the Riordan group was authored by four mathematicians from Howard University in 1991. Since then, eight international conferences have taken place, but this is  the first to be held at Howard University. The primary objective of the symposium is to foster collaboration and networking among researchers interested in Riordan arrays and associated subjects. It seeks to catalyze fresh research directions, offer platforms for emerging scholars to showcase their work, and serve as an international nexus for academic exchange and cooperation. Additionally, it aims to broaden the community of mathematicians engaged in Riordan array research.\r\n\r\nThe symposium  features two distinguished international scholars specializing in enumerative combinatorics, who deliver hour-long colloquium-style lectures on their respective fields of expertise. These lectures  provide comprehensive overviews of current research trends and suggest potential avenues for future exploration. Furthermore, the event  hosts four keynote speakers recognized for their contributions to Riordan arrays. Additionally, there are scheduled several 30-minute presentations and a poster session showcasing student research. The conference website is : https://riordanarray.org/.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
