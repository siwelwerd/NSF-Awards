 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cellular networks are crucial for the national economy and security. With each generation, the networks are designed to support higher performance levels. The next-generation networks, namely sixth-generation (6G) networks, will target higher data rates and new features like city-scale perception. To achieve the desired performance in the next-generation networks, new spectrum in the 7-24GHz frequency range, also known as the FR3 band, is being considered. However, the FR3 spectrum band is highly fragmented, which means that the design of wireless radios is poised to be even more challenging than the existing systems. In particular, this project will address two important questions for the new FR 3 band. How to formalize a mixed-domain system design methodology that leverages programmable baseband and analog (i) to meet the need of next-generation communication systems in FR3, and (ii) to enable multi-function operation with communication and sensing over such diverse bands in a power-efficient manner?\r\n \r\nThis project will develop MD2 (Mixed Domain Design), a novel theoretical framework and practical designs for next-generation networks using the FR3 wireless systems. The project thrusts will address foundations, algorithmic methods and prototype designs, using the platform of pixel antennas. The new designs will target communications-only, sensing-only, and joint communications and sensing wireless applications. A key innovation of MD2 framework will be to allow joint and systematic design across antenna, analog and digital domains, with practical designs using pixel antennas optimized for FR3 spectrum. The team consists of investigators from the USA and Finland who bring complementary expertise across multiple disciplines. This project will strengthen international collaboration between the US and Finland, with a significant impact on next-generation wireless communications systems.The project will involve undergraduate students to improve student retention in engineering programs and integrate new research modules into wireless communication courses.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
