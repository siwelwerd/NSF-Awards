 "awd_abstract_narration": "This REU Site award to Montana State University, located in Bozeman, MT, will support the training of 10 students for 10 weeks during the summers of 2024\u20132026. It is anticipated that a total of 30 students, primarily from schools with limited research opportunities or from an under-represented group, will be trained in the program. This program will train the next generation of ecologists and organismal biologists to bring a foundational socio-ecological perspective to their study of any ecosystem. Research and educational experiences will guide students in synthesizing subject-area expertise in rangeland and animal biology into a whole-system understanding of how sociological and ecological processes interact in the American West. Students will learn how research is conducted, and many will present the results of their work at scientific conferences. Assessment of this program will be done through an online tool. Students should apply to the REU site using NSF ETAP (Education and Training Application: https://etap.nsf.gov). \r\n\r\nThe program theme is the social, economic, and ecological sustainability of the prairies of the American West. Students will be trained to bring a holistic socio-ecological perspective to their study of any ecosystem. Departments involved will include Animal & Range Sciences, Land Resources & Environmental Sciences, Agricultural Economics, and Research Stations. Students will work with faculty members on diverse subjects including plant ecology, soil ecology, wildlife ecology, animal health and nutrition, animal reproduction, and cattle production. Projects will be conducted in the laboratory and the field. Students will engage in guided workshops to understand the broader socioecological context for their research projects and to conduct cross-disciplinary synthesis with other students. Events will include travel experiences to working Indigenous and non-indigenous ranches, including the bison ranches at the Fort Peck Reservation, where students will do hands-on service learning and discuss ranching from a socioecological perspective. Other workshops will focus on ethics and responsible conduct of research. Program assessment will occur via meetings between students, advisors, and the PI, entry and exit surveys, and formative assessments during workshops. Students will be selected based on their subject-area interests and matching interests of participating faculty members. Including Tribal students and representing Indigenous perspectives will be a focus of this program.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
