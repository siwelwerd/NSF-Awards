 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will study evolutionary responses to extreme weather events and increase our understanding of how genetics influences a population\u2019s response to selection. We know that extreme weather events such as hurricanes can have long-lasting, evolutionary effects on wild populations. However, no information exists about how genomic factors that might facilitate or impede that evolution.The project will focus on brown anoles (Anolis sagrei), a widespread invasive lizard in Florida that is native to Cuba. It will compare populations sampled in 2018 to those same populations following Hurricane Ian. Information on evolutionary responses (or lack thereof) to increasingly intense and frequent catastrophic weather will be a key component of our understanding of the response of wild populations to global change. The project will also train graduate and undergraduate students in field methods, as well as morphological and genomic and data analyses.\r\n\r\nPrior work consisted of high-quality genomic, habitat use, and morphological data from brown anoles. Sampling covered 30 populations distributed along the latitudinal extent of Florida and into southern Georgia. Guided by previous research, it is hypothesized that the strength of selection will be correlated with wind speeds, such that stronger winds will favor longer limbs. In addition, the evolutionary response to limb-length selection will be strongly affected by an interaction between a large-effect limb-length locus and the genomic background of brown anole populations. Specifically, there will be a weaker evolutionary response to hurricane-mediated selection on limb length in populations with extensive hybrid ancestry. Previous research found epistatic interactions between an otherwise large-effect locus for limb length and the genomic background for hybrid populations. Because these genomic backgrounds vary across Florida, these effects should vary geographically.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Recent studies illustrate the important role that hurricanes play as drivers of evolutionary change. Our study evaluated the factors that facilitate or impede the evolutionary responses to hurricane-driven natural selection. We compared morphological and genomic variation in brown anole lizard populations in Florida and Georgia before and after the powerful Category 4 Hurricane Ian in 2022. Maximum wind speed during the hurricane varied from<em> </em>25&ndash;209 km/h among our 30 study sites depending on the distance from the path of the hurricane. We predicted this variation in wind speed would generate substantial variation in the strength of selection on traits that lizards use for clinging to vegetation. Results indicated spatially varying selection on limb morphology driven by wind speed during Hurricane Ian. Changes in hindlimb length were consistent with selection on clinging performance and the ability to resist the dislodging forces of extreme hurricane-force winds. We also detected changes in allele frequencies at the locus corresponding to limb length variation. Compared to our pre-hurricane sample collected in 2018, we observed a trend towards increasing frequency of the long-limb allele after the hurricane with increasing wind speed during the storm. This is consistent with a genetically based adaptive response to hurricane-induced selection on limb length. Interestingly, populations experiencing either tropical storm or hurricane-force winds showed increases in the long-limb allele frequency, but tropical depression strength winds did not result in similar increases. Genome-wide analyses also pointed toward strong selection with decreases in genetic variation (i.e. heterozygosity) and the frequency of harmful mutations (i.e. deleterious alleles). Given the increasing frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, our findings of strong selection and rapid adaptive responses driven by strong winds associated with hurricanes will help us to better understand how wild populations respond to catastrophic events. Incorporating evolutionary responses into conservation and management plans will make us better prepared for extreme weather events, a key component of global change.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 02/08/2025<br>\nModified by: Sean&nbsp;T&nbsp;Giery</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n></div>\n</div>\n",
