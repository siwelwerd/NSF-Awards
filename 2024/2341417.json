 "awd_abstract_narration": "This BIORETS Site award to the Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies, located in Millbrook, NY, will support the training of 9 teachers for 6 weeks during the summer and an additional 2.3 weeks during the academic year. Three cohorts of teachers will be recruited over the course of 3 years from January 2024 \u2013 2027. The Cary BIORETS program aims to engage diverse cohorts of teachers serving a variety of students. Participating schools will span across mid-sized urban districts with significant minority populations, to rural districts serving low-income and immigrant communities, two communities that often lack access to high-quality professional learning experiences. Through collaborative research projects and professional development activities that promote reflection, teamwork, and teacher leadership, the Cary BIORETS program aims to enhance teacher capacity to build the ecological knowledge of their students and increase their proficiency with science practices. This program will cultivate and support teacher leadership that extends its impact beyond the immediate confines of participating teachers' classrooms. Each teacher will produce instructional materials and contribute to an education publication based on their research and experiences. They will have the opportunity to attend regional or national conferences and be supported in conducting workshops within their schools to share their innovative curricula and other knowledge generated from their RET experience. Although the formal program lasts for one year, this BIORETS program will establish a lasting connection between teachers and scientists committed to promoting ecological literacy locally and nationwide. \r\n\r\nThere is a pressing need for increased ecological literacy in our rapidly changing world. Secondary education serves as a crucial arena for advancing ecological and environmental teaching, as it represents the last place in our nation\u2019s system where all students engage in science learning. To ensure exposure to key ecological phenomena, the program focuses on training and supporting teachers in research experiences that will aid in their adoption of global change curriculum to improve ecological literacy. Specifically, teachers will engage in projects with an array of Cary scientists that address (1) Ecosystem Change, Transformation and Resilience, the (2) Ecology of Human Well-being, and/or (3) Functions of Biodiversity. Participating instructors will conduct scientific research, co-author publications, develop curriculum and will have opportunities for professional development. All participants (e.g., mentors and teachers) will be trained in responsible conduct for research. Collaboration with a program evaluator will help reach programmatic goals and ensure successful participant experiences. Funding to teachers include a stipend, conference travel for teachers to present, and classroom funds to implement their newly designed curriculum. Applications are accepted through the NSF ETAP system. More information about the program is available by visiting http://www.caryinstitute.org/biorets, or by contacting the PI (Dr. Jane Lucas at lucasj@caryinstitute.org) or the co-PIs (Dr. Alan Berkowitz at berkowitza@caryinstitute.org or Rebecca Van Tassell at vantassellr@caryinstitute.org).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
