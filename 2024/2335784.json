 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Midwest Probability Colloquium is a series that has run for over 40 years. This award supports three installments, held on the Northwestern University campus (Evanston, IL) in October 2023, 2024, and 2025.  The focus of these conferences is probability theory, the mathematical study of the behavior of random phenomena. Probability is arguably the most applicable branch of pure mathematics and has wide applications to across the natural and social sciences. It is also an extremely active field of research and approximately 100 participants are expected at each meeting, including not only the probabilists, but also researchers from other areas of mathematics and other natural and social sciences.\r\n\r\nThe format of these conferences provides an inclusive research environment for graduate students and early career researchers, fostering interaction and collaboration among those at different stages of their careers. The organizing committee, whose membership is regularly updated, has a broad range of interests and recruits speakers on topics of current interest. The meetings include both research lectures and tutorial lectures, with the latter intended to introduce graduate students to an active area within probability. The bulk of this award will support the participation of graduate students, early career researchers, those from underrepresented groups, and those without access to other funding. \r\n\r\nFurther information on the conference series can be found at http://sites.math.northwestern.edu/mwp/\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
