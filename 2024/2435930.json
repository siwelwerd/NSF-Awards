 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 2025 International Conference on Biomolecular Engineering (ICBE) will take place January 5-8 in Houston, Texas. This conference, organized by the Society for Biological Engineering (SBE), part of the American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE), brings together researchers who are using quantitative approaches to advance the understanding and application of molecular biology. Molecular engineering integrates principles of molecular biology, chemistry, and engineering to design and manipulate biological molecules for various applications. It is a pivotal research area enabling precise control over biological processes, facilitating breakthroughs in synthetic biology, pharmaceuticals, biomanufacturing, bioinformatics, and sustainability-related research. Biomolecular engineering has far-reaching impacts on society, revolutionizing diverse fields such as healthcare, agriculture, environmental sustainability, and industrial processes. \r\n \r\nThe conference is the premier event for trainees and early career faculty to take on prominent conference roles for the first time in their careers, including Chairing the conference, participating on the Organizing Committee or delivering invited talks.  This project, funded by the NSF, provides support to trainees and early career faculty to participate in the conference. People beginning their career stand to benefit most from participating in conferences by learning from world-leading experts, receiving feedback on their work and developing their network, leading to future collaboration. However, they often do not have funding available to attend the events. This project helps people early in their career overcome this financial barrier.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
