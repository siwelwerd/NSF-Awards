 "awd_abstract_narration": "Contemporary scientific research increasingly relies on robust and comprehensive data networks. Data-intensive instrumentation and methodologies like AI lead to incredible advances for the researchers fortunate enough to have access to the requisite cyberinfrastructure. Unfortunately, even modest deficiencies in capacity and connectivity can sharply limit scientific discovery, especially at under-resourced institutions.\r\n\r\nThe proposed Pennsylvania Science DMZ (PA Science DMZ) project addresses critical infrastructure and connectivity gaps in five participating institutions: Pennsylvania State University, Indiana University of Pennsylvania (IUP), Lafayette College, The Digital Foundry at New Kensington (DFNK), and Swarthmore College. At IUP, the project will immediately benefit ongoing efforts in data analytics and applied research in worker safety, robotics, and geospatial data, as well as enhancing cybersecurity and STEM education. In Lafayette College, the improved connectivity will support molecular dynamics simulations and biology research, and at DFNK it will allow enhanced external access to a Digital Learning and Demonstration Lab. Swarthmore College will employ the solution in collaborative linguistics and social interactions research.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these immediate applications, the proposed PA Science DMZ opens the door to a multitude of additional research opportunities, both within the initial consortium and through collaborations with smaller institutions that are currently unable to access critical tools of contemporary science. By implementing a regional model for aggregating cyberinfrastructure hardware and human resources, the project aims to provide a robust and economically efficient template for additional initiatives within the state and nationwide, fostering a more inclusive and interconnected cyberinfrastructure landscape.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
