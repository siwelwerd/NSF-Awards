This conference has been the premier venue to present and discuss progress in research, development, standards, and applications of the topics related to the Web. The 2024 ACM Web Conference offers a high quality program made of research sessions, posters and demonstrations, a PhD symposium for the junior scholars, workshops, tutorials, an industry track for the practitioners as well as thought provoking keynote speakers, panels, special tracks, and special days. All these activities provide a unique opportunity for students to share their knowledge, experience, and research projects with internationally recognized researchers from both academia and industry.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
