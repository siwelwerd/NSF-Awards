 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Improving Undergraduate STEM Education: Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSI Program), this Educational Instrumentation (EI) Track project aims to enrich the student educational experience learning about animal design, structure, and function, by integrating virtual cadaver dissection technology into the laboratory curriculum. This work is important to prepare students for professional programs in the health sciences, medical field, and STEM workforce. This work will contribute to new knowledge by offering a new sophisticated modality for learning about animal structure and function (human and animal cadavers), and performing clinical diagnostics by visualization of medical CT and MRI images. The project\u2019s broader impact is to support community outreach and engagement efforts, including providing virtual cadaver experiences for students in regional K-12 public schools.  \r\n\r\nThe project aims to enrich the educational experience learning about animal design, structure, and function. The methods used will be to integrate Anatomage virtual cadaver dissection technology into the laboratory curriculum.  Anatomage is a technologically advanced anatomy visualization system that promotes learning outcomes in higher education and STEM fields. It is both a virtual library of human and animal cadavers, as well as a clinical diagnostic tool that enables the visualization of any medical CT or MRI scan. The project's goal is to integrate Anatomage education into STEM major and non-major courses in the Biology Department including: Human Anatomy & Physiology, Zoology, Comparative Vertebrate Anatomy, Vertebrate Physiology, and several others, impacting approximately 770 students each year. To support this goal, the project will purchase 2 Anatomage tables and 10 tablets. The expected results are to 1) enhance educational technology in biology laboratory courses, 2) develop virtual technology skills in students, 3) develop critical thinking skills, 4) enhance anatomy education curriculum, and 5) enrich the student learning experience. To assess progress/impact toward the goal of \u201cenriching the student learning experience,\" the project's principal investigators will evaluate information obtained from surveys, student commentaries, and skills assessment activities. The work will be disseminated in written reports and poster presentations at meetings. The HSI Program aims to enhance undergraduate STEM education and increase capacity to engage in the development and implementation of innovations to improve STEM learning and teaching at HSIs. Projects supported by the HSI Program will also generate new knowledge on how to achieve these aims.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
