 "awd_abstract_narration": "This new REU Site: Intelligent Systems for Healthcare, Imaging, Communications and Infrastructure is hosted by the University of Utah. Intelligent systems perceive and respond to the world around them. They can be used to better utilize scarce resources, and provide increased reliability, comfort, and convenience This REU Site connects ten students each summer with mentors and research projects relating to intelligent systems featuring wearable and implantable healthcare, communications and infrastructure, and vision and imaging. REU participants will be able to engage in opportunities to test and improve implantable sensors related to traumatic brain injury; develop computer codes to help prosthetic limbs on amputees move as intended based on the person\u2019s thoughts; increase agricultural yields on smart farms; enhance measurement data analysis capabilities to improve our understanding of how the atmosphere changes over time; and develop better algorithms to help vehicles see and navigate through challenging environments. Through project activities, undergraduates will better understand how this research benefits society by improving the intelligence capabilities of systems in the areas of healthcare, communications, infrastructure, vision, and imaging. \r\n\r\nMachine learning will increasingly be integrated into intelligent systems and/or be involved in the development of those systems. REU participants will engage in hands-on experiences with machine learning. Students will receive professional development sessions that will enable them to explore STEM career development opportunities, prepare for graduate studies, and practice public speaking skills with feedback. One unique feature of the project will have REU participants pursue the idea of entrepreneurship. They will be housed at Lassonde Studios, located at the Lassonde Institute (which has helped hundreds of students launch startup companies). Faculty mentors will provide insights and advice to students for pursuing a variety of STEM careers. Lastly, participants will attend workshops organized by the Office of Undergraduate Research (OUR), attend a Grad School Mini Expo, and present their research at the culminating Research Symposium.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
