 "awd_abstract_narration": "Catalyst Projects provide support for Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) to work towards establishing research capacity of faculty to strengthen science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) undergraduate education and research. It is expected that the award will further the faculty member's research capability, improve research and teaching at the institution, and involve undergraduate students in research experiences. This award to the Tennessee State University aims to broaden participation of undergraduate students enrolled in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) degree program. Specifically, researchers seek to examine the use of augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) technology, building on this established evidence-based practice by coupling it with Project-Oriented CDIO (Conceive, Design, Implement, Operate), an innovate instructional approach.\r\n\r\nEmploying AR/VR technology with the CDIO educational framework, the research team aims to improve learning outcomes in Mathematics, Civil and Architectural Engineering disciplines. Targeting five courses, the project seeks to develop and implement AR/VR modules that provide immersive, hands-on learning experiences. Methods include the creation of interactive simulations, practical assessments, and project-based learning activities tailored to each course. The project's goals are to enhance students' technical skills, engagement, and knowledge retention. By leveraging cutting-edge technology and innovative pedagogical approaches, this initiative aims to contribute to the broader field of STEM education, particularly within Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), fostering a more effective and engaging learning environment.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
