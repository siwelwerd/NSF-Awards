 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Expanding Capacity in Quantum Information Science and Engineering (ExpandQISE) project establishes a Quantum Materials Institute at the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology, in collaboration with Montana State University and the NSF funded Q-AMASE-i MonArk Quantum Foundry. The Quantum Materials Institute comprises an interdisciplinary team focused on the discovery and development of compact, efficient nonlinear optical systems based on combining atomically-thin two dimensional materials and sub-wavelength flat optics, also known as meta-surfaces. Such compact and efficient nonlinear optical materials are expected to find application in chip-scale integrated photonics and quantum networks. The project explores the design, physical limits and mechanisms for achieving extraordinarily high optical nonlinearities in atomically-thin materials. By coordinating the synthesis, characterization, and theoretical analyses of a palette of two-dimensional materials and meta-surfaces, the Institute will pursue a fundamental understanding of materials and systems optimized for second harmonic generation and parametric downconversion, two important nonlinear optical processes in quantum communication networks based on entangled photons. The project will also support training and workforce development in quantum information science by developing and delivering coursework in quantum communications and quantum computing, through a certificate in quantum communications, a minor in quantum information science and collaboration with quantum communications and quantum computing industry partners.\r\n\r\nThe Quantum Materials Institute will focus on the discovery of novel 2D materials, heterostructures and meta-surfaces to achieve compact systems with efficient second order processes, including second harmonic generation (SHG) and spontaneous parametric downconversion (SPDC). In partnership with the MonArk Quantum Foundry, heterostructures of transition metal dichalcogenides with varying monolayer composition, spacing, and orientation (\"twist\") will be examined using spatially- and spectrally-resolved multi-photon excitation microscopy. In concert, self-assembled plasmonic meta-surfaces and their chiral assembly will be developed. Chemical vapor deposition will be used to grow novel 2D materials, as well as other methods. The institute will explore the light-matter interaction and enhanced second harmonic generation in 2D materials and heterostructures supported by metasurfaces. Density functional theory will predict the band structure, along with associated optical properties, and finite difference time domain method will be used to describe the optical interactions with the meta-surfaces. A large palette of 2D material candidates is planned, from MXene's to transition metal dichalcogenide's to perovskites and Janus materials. Compact, efficient second order nonlinear materials are essential for the integration of quantum communications and integrated photonic circuits. The Quantum Materials Institute will foster educational program(s) in quantum information science, including a certificate in quantum communications and a minor in quantum information science. The minor is designed to allow a broader pool of students to become trained in quantum information science. Results from the project will be shared with underrepresented groups, particularly Native American populations in South Dakota and first-generation college students. The project team will participate in multiple diversity and inclusion activities, including the annual Women in Science and Engineering (WISE) program, a career and science fair for middle school girls. Graduate and undergraduate students will be involved in the project and obtain valuable experience working in quantum information science.\r\n\r\nThis award is co-funded by the Advancing Informal STEM Learning program. This award was also jointly funded by the Directorate for Engineering, Division of Civil, Mechanical and Manufacturing Innovation, and the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences, Office of Strategic Initiatives.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
