 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) grant will develop a multi-agent AI system of (a) three bio-inspired underwater vessels integrated with multimodal (optical and acoustic) underwater communication interfaces and (b) a buoy operating as an underwater/sea-surface control station. Progress in cooperative multi-agent underwater systems is fundamental for the short and long-term study of ocean and coastal zones, but integration of effective technologies to develop a network of underwater vessels is still limited. Contrary to land and air, 3D underwater robotic systems have not yet been able to achieve comparable levels of self-organization. Technical issues that impede operation in complex unknown underwater environments include 1) localization and communication to determine the exact position of each vessel; 2) efficient propulsion systems that allow the vessel to maneuver in multiple directions and perform precise station-keeping; and 3) effective autonomous control schemes able to adaptively optimize vehicle- and fleet-operation in time-varying uncertain environments. The school of connected vessels developed under this project will enhance our understanding of the hydrodynamics and control of multi-swimmer systems, advance the theory and practice of programmable multi-function underwater networks, and enable effective and efficient survey of sensitive coastal zones. Moreover, this project will help broaden participation and training of underrepresented minorities in engineering and support outreach activities for high school students and the general audience. \r\n\r\nThe development of the connected three-vessel-and-buoy instrument will support research and training at the intersection of three emerging technologies: 1) bio-inspired propulsion and the dynamics of collective swimmers; 2) artificial intelligence applied to underwater mobility and 3) programmable underwater multi-modal networking. In specific, outcomes of this project are: (a) a bio-inspired underwater vessel with undulating fin propulsion and integrated communication and sensing capabilities (three copies); (b) a software-defined protocol stack for underwater multimodal communication, networking and positioning; (c) a connected multi-agent system of three bio-inspired robotic fish with the ability to autonomously coordinate, share information and cooperate for a basic mission  or to be wirelessly remotely controlled by a single human operator. At conclusion, this effort is expected to provide a stable, shared-use, programmable research instrument with unique propulsion and integrated wireless networking and positioning capabilities. The instrument will enable rapid testing and repeatable comparative evaluation, while also strengthen collaboration and partnership between different institutions interested in research in AI control, bioinspired underwater mobility and underwater wireless networking. The instrument will also serve as an experimental platform to train undergraduate and graduate students at the intersection of multiple engineering fields.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
