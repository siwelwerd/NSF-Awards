 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II\r\nproject is to potentially improve patient outcomes and reduce healthcare costs by enhancing communication\r\nbetween patients and their medical providers. In the U.S., 78.9% of misdiagnoses are caused by\r\nmiscommunication, resulting in 80,000 to 200,000 avoidable hospital deaths each year, and 56.3% of\r\nthose communication gaps are related to the history-taking during the patient-provider encounter.\r\nEnhancing communication in healthcare is crucial for improving both the efficiency and quality of\r\nhealthcare services. LiteraSeed\u2019s project proposes Electronic Health\r\nRecord (EHR) integration and Natural Language Processing (NLP) data extraction to enable automated\r\nchart review, facilitating possible access to critical patient data and allowing health systems to reclaim previously\r\nlost revenue due to the misclassification of patient risk.\r\nThis project aims to improve the long-term efficiency of our healthcare system by addressing incomplete\r\nand conflicting EHR information, providing alerts of vital medical history, and mitigating the effects of\r\npoor health literacy, all in an effort to help empower the patient.\r\n\r\nThe proposed project performs Electronic Health Records (EHR) integration of the platform and integrates it with Natural Language Processing (NLP) to extract valuable information from complex and unstructured medical records. These learnings led to the prioritization of three major technical\r\nobjectives: (1) EHR integration to simplify workflow and enhance access to patient data, (2) enhancing\r\nthe ML/AI risk assessment model by incorporating NLP techniques for extracting valuable information\r\nfrom complex, fragmented, incomplete, and contradictory medical records, and (3) conducting validation\r\ntesting by clinicians to ensure the reliability and efficacy of ML/AI outputs. The integration of NLP for\r\ndata extraction, combined with the patient\u2019s self-reporting, ensures a comprehensive and accurate\r\nrepresentation of the patient's present condition and medical history. This innovation could enable\r\nreal-time risk adjustment, expedite patient care, address missed care opportunities, and boost revenue\r\nin global capitation and value-based care delivery models.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
