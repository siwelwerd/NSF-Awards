 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is funded by the Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Sites program in the SBE Directorate. It has both scientific and societal benefits and integrates research and education. Reflecting the growing diversity of children and communities across the nation and world, scientists must be equipped with scientific knowledge and approaches that can help optimally reflect the varied experiences of diverse youth and communities. Early experiences that provide immersive training experiences will cultivate and train scientists to meet this challenge. Multidisciplinary and integrative approaches may advance science on youth and community development as well as inform programming and policy that may benefit society. This REU program provides an educational opportunity for undergraduates in two primary training areas: 1) how multidisciplinary and community-engaged science can advance scientific understanding of factors that shape youth development and community well-being and 2) novel strategies for scientific dissemination and translation. \r\n\r\nThis REU experience supports an 8-week learning experience for 8 undergraduates during the program duration (24 students over 3 years). The REU program provides a research training opportunity for undergraduate students that is typically not available to them at their home institutions. Students attending primarily undergraduate and minority-serving institutions are encouraged to apply. A primary objective of this REU is to expose undergraduates to research methodology in a multidisciplinary and collaborative learning context. Additionally, REU participants will learn diverse approaches for conducting research in partnership with youth and communities. In collaboration with REU faculty, participants will develop an independent research project. In addition, participants will develop a comprehensive skillset that includes all aspects of the research process (i.e., child and community-focused research design, ethics, scientific writing, statistical analyses, scientific presentations, data visualization). This REU experience will provide training on foundational skills for conducting multidisciplinary and community-engaged research as well as prepare participants for graduate education.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
