 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-technical summary\r\n\r\nImagine smart, compact notebooks with more space to store games, photos, and videos, sleek cell phones with quicker-loading apps and longer battery life, and powerful, unparalleled computers that can solve complex problems much faster than today computers. While such innovative computers and memory devices could revolutionize our lives through energy savings, environmental conservation, national security, and healthcare, it is difficult to unlock the potential of magnetic materials that are the basis of the next generation of electronic architectures. This CAREER award, jointly funded by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program in NSF\u2019s Division of Materials Research and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), aims to develop a deeper understanding of the chemistry-function relationships of solid-state materials potentially hosting tiny magnets, which can twist and turn in a unique way. The twisty dance of these small magnets could enable higher data storage capabilities, faster data access, and more efficient spin-based logic devices.  The PI and her team will focus on a particular class of magnetic compounds that lack inversion symmetry in the structure and study how chemical bonding in these materials determines their physical properties. In addition, this CAREER award seeks to improve student STEM competency and promote solid-state materials through the design, refinement, and dissemination of inquiry-based animation called Adventures in Materials Discovery.\r\n\r\nTechnical summary\r\n\r\nNoncentrosymmetric magnetic materials hosting topological spin textures (skyrmions) are at the forefront of new technological advances in quantum information science and spintronics. This is owing to topological protection, a strange state wherein the physical properties of electrons are insensitive to defects and noisy environments such as lattice imperfections and room-temperature operations. While impressive achievements have been made in skyrmion materials research, a significant challenge remains as to how chemical bonding and electronic structures give rise to the emergence and intentional modification of skyrmions. The research goal of this CAREER award, jointly funded by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program in NSF\u2019s Division of Materials Research and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), is to provide an efficient set of fundamental chemistry-property guidelines for new noncentrosymmetric magnetic materials that facilitates (or hinders) the formation of skyrmions. To achieve this, the PI and her team adopt combined experimental and computational approaches using state-of-the-art synthetic techniques, magnetic and heat capacity measurements, X-ray diffraction, neutron scattering, and density functional theory calculations. The education goal of this CAREER award is to improve student learning and promote interest in quantum STEM disciplines. The PI and her team will design, refine, and disseminate inquiry-based activities called Adventure in Materials Discovery with five animated modules (Stone Age, Bronze Age, Iron Age, Silicon Age, and Quantum Age) that will engage and excite students and the public about the impacts of solid-state materials in addressing real-world challenges.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
