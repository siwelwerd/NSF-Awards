 "awd_abstract_narration": "Diagrams are profoundly important to science, technology, education and mathematics (STEM) education and scientific communication. Illustrative diagrams require deep domain-knowledge and extensive design work. PENROSE is a new diagram format that encodes both domain knowledge and visual design in a reusable way. The PENROSE format contains the source information of diagram design: using PENROSE, diagram authors encode domain-specific concepts and how to visually represent them in plain-text languages. The PENROSE core tools compile this format into static images, animated vector graphics, and interactive web applications. Supporting PENROSE\u2019s expansion into a sustainable OSE would best enable broader societal impacts on education and accessibility. The development of a diverse community of users and contributors from across academic disciplines and industry areas will drive a higher number of high-quality diagrams in research papers, in classrooms, and in public-facing scientific communication efforts. In addition, PENROSE provides the best format to enable user creation of diagrams that are accessible to differently abled groups. The readable plain-text format lends itself to customization for alt text and aural feedback as well as rearranging diagram layout for language localization and color acuity. The project will employ a strategy of open communication, usable and varied forms of documentation, and a culture of highlighting contributions to encourage users. \r\n\r\nThis project will be used to assess the success of transitioning PENROSE transitions to an OSE in the following ways: gathering data on the nature of contributions to open-source development and diagramming in PENROSE; quantifying and characterizing PENROSE\u2019s adoption and prevalence in published research across domains and disciplines; quantifying and characterizing the impact of PENROSE in educational settings, both for educators and learners; as well as gathering data on the effectiveness of implementations of accessibility foci. To realize the full potential of PENROSE, a standalone diagramming tool is not enough. The aim of this project is to establish a PENROSE ecosystem of open-source diagrams and to integrate PENROSE with other platforms. The primary goals for the ecosystem are to build robust infrastructure for authoring, sharing, and reusing diagrammatic contents and develop a community of expert creators that contribute open-source diagrams in the PENROSE format. Both directions are crucial for wide adoption of the PENROSE format and for transformational impact on STEM education and communication.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
