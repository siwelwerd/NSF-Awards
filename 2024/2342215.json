 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is developing user-friendly tools to guide optimal choices about clean energy, especially regarding charging electric vehicles (EVs). Efforts focus on creating simple and efficient computer algorithms capable of learning from real-world data to suggest ideal charging times and conditions for EVs. The significance lies in users adapting to increasingly complex energy environments, adopting more sustainable options and behaviors, and gaining more control over energy use. The project centers on EVs as integral to reducing carbon emissions from transportation. Despite significant advancements in battery and charging technologies, there are many challenges in planning how EVs are charged, and the situation is poised to worsen with the expected increasing penetration of electrified transportation. The aim is to ensure these tools will be accessible to all EV users, focusing not only on making charging recommendations that promote the use of renewable energy but also on considering individual preferences and potential benefits to the entire energy system. The ultimate objective is to simplify decision-making, making it easier for users to manage energy consumption in optimal ways without feeling overwhelmed. Advanced statistical techniques are employed, utilizing highly efficient computer algorithms that will ensure speed, flexibility, interpretability, and real-world policy relevance. The proposed system adapts and learns charging preferences in real-time, providing energy management recommendations in the context of coordinated EV charging while considering factors such as electricity demand, pricing, and grid stability. \r\n\r\nThe methodical modular Markov chain fast and scalable sampler of the proposed incentive-compatible recommender system is designed by integrating: an expansion of Ultimate P\u00f3lya-Gamma data augmentation for multi-index choice models to create conjugacy where it does not exist, amortized and non-factorized variational inference for efficiency, Choquet aggregation for complex nonparametric tradeoffs across service features (relaxing linear compensatory behavior), Bayes endogeneity controls, Bayesian optimization for tuning hyperparameters and for integration with a system equilibrium algorithm, and flexible semiparametric representation of heterogeneity in preferences and motives between and within strategic agents. The research team implements the project through an actual residential program for coordinated scheduling of electric-vehicle charging, such as avoiding in-force price endogeneity and constraints via self-selection price discrimination through discrete targeted bundles. In simpler terms, a helpful guide is created for individuals driving electric vehicles, suggesting ideal charging times and needs based on their preferences and driving patterns. Smart technology is employed to gather information, enabling the provision of personalized suggestions to users. The impact of the project extends beyond individual assistance, contributing to the overall sustainability of energy systems and providing valuable tools for energy-related organizations, utilities, and policymakers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
