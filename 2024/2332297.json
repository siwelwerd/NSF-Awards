 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of a digital solution that provides a variety of evidence-based interventions for executive functioning and attention deficits that are easy and effectively used by parents and teachers. Currently, delivery of evidence-based interventions for students with executive functioning/attention difficulties is impeded by several barriers including stress, lack of capacity, and lack of requisite knowledge about best practices.  Using the proposed technology, users may select specific interventions based on a student\u2019s executive function/attention deficit symptoms and/or diagnostic category. Once an intervention is selected, it may be individualized to fit the student\u2019s unique profile of strengths and deficits prior to implementation by parent and teacher users.  Positive impacts may include improved academic and social outcomes. This solution also may benefit schools and school districts by reducing the costs associated with the unintended consequences of unsupported executive function/attention difficulties, such as reducing staff turnover, reducing the need to hire professional development coaches, and increasing student grade retention.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on the development of a digital solution that translates a variety of evidence-based interventions for executive functioning and attention deficits that parents and teachers would be able to implement with fidelity. Executive functioning and attention deficits are commonly associated with a broad spectrum of psychopathologies. Effective nonpharmacological intervention approaches are those that are tailored to the individual and implemented when symptoms impede goal attainment. However, traditional effective executive functioning and attention interventions have historically been cumbersome to use and have lacked validity in the real-world context. The proposed technology uses a digital solution that translates traditional intervention approaches to mitigate executive functioning and attention deficit symptoms. Features that may amplify the efficacy of these digital approaches include psychoeducation, data collection and visualization, and home-school communication tools. The software is designed to provide users with a digital executive functioning and attention intervention technology that incorporates these best practices in order to make it easy for parents and teachers to consistently implement, track interventions with fidelity, and effectively reduce executive functioning and attention difficulties experienced by students.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
