 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact of this I-Corps project is the development of a non-contact health monitoring method with broad applications. The solution has the potential to seamlessly monitor vital signs without requiring users to wear any devices. Unlike wired systems, this technology offers convenience, reliability, and long-term monitoring, benefiting both healthcare providers and individuals seeking advanced care. In addition to targeting diseases like sleep apnea and sudden infant death syndrome, the technology also promises innovation in motion-adaptive cancer radiotherapy. The technology can potentially revolutionize patient care, reducing costs, and improving outcomes, especially for vulnerable populations.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. This solution is based on the development of an advanced beamforming that supports concurrent multiple target sensing and tracking of human subjects. This technology includes the use of advanced signal processing algorithms that enable high sensitivity and a wide dynamic range for the detection of micro-motions. The technology considers a coherent detection architecture that supports multiple operation modes for high dynamic range. Finally, the solution includes an antenna-in-package for the integration of the system with compact size, low cost, and high performance.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
