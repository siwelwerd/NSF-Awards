 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will stem from the creation of novel and safe ultraviolet (UV) materials, called filters, for the skincare, cosmetics, and sunscreen markets. The proposed UV filters have the potential to have high impact as an alternative to current petroleum-based photo-protectants as these are the first biodegradable, biocompatible and ecologically safe UV filters made from components already present in the human body.  The petroleum-based filters break down into toxic compounds with carcinogenic and endocrine-disrupting properties. This project will develop a safe alternative to chemical sunscreens that appeal to the customers, providing a more convenient formulation with superior stability and better protection against UV damage to the skin involving sunburns, aging, and the heightened risk of skin cancer. The naturally derived formulations developed in this project can be produced using an environmentally friendly synthesis with minimal byproducts that are safely biodegradable. These innovative UV protectants will continue to drive competition, push creativity, and establish additional lucrative product lines, including creams, lotions, gels, sprays, and stick-based sunscreen products. \r\n\r\nThe proposed project seeks to address the unmet need for novel UV filters with improved safety and stability over current UV protectants. The Phase I project established reliable, green synthesis of UV filters, including formulations that can serve as a clear, non-greasy, water-based serum for the skin. These compounds have superior stability compared to other UV filters on the market while remaining biocompatible with little waste created during the synthesis. The Phase II project will build upon this success by further characterizing compound safety/degradation, optimizing production and green synthesis for manufacturing scale-up, and development of finalized formulations that are ready to enter the market by the end of the Phase II project. The goals of the project include: (1) testing of UV filter safety and degradation products needed for regulatory approval, following adherence to the generally recognized as safe and effective (GRASE) guidelines; (2) optimization of methods for green synthesis and scaling for manufacturing; and (3) development of new formulations targeting the beachhead market of UV-protectant serum products.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
