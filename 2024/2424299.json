 "awd_abstract_narration": "NSF CAREER awards support early career faculty with great potential to serve as leaders who integrate research and education synergistically through their academic programs. Building on the success of past Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences CAREER Awardee Conferences since 2019, the fifth annual meeting in 2024 will bring together a diverse cohort of awardees to enhance their research and teaching through exposure to new technologies and pedagogical approaches, and exchange of scientific questions and ideas. The diversity of research topics, model systems, and approaches represented among conference attendees is expected to foster community and lead to cross-disciplinary collaborations.\r\n\r\nThe goals of the conference are to facilitate knowledge sharing and catalyze collaborations among early-career faculty who span a broad range of research and educational expertise, and to provide input to the NSF on new research frontiers that will advance our understanding of complex biological systems at the fundamental molecular and cellular scales.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
