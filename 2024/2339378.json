 "awd_abstract_narration": "Internet's naming relies on the Domain Name System (DNS). Security Extensions of DNS (DNSSEC) and Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) safeguard the Internet's two critical aspects: naming through DNSSEC and routing through Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) using RPKI. Despite their pivotal importance, fully grasping the principles of RPKI and DNSSEC and managing them securely and effectively presents challenges, given their complexity and the diverse ways they are deployed and implemented across various entities. This project aims to improve the visibility, understanding, administration, and security of these essential components of Internet infrastructure.\r\n\r\nThe project targets three main objectives. Firstly, it introduces a technique for evaluating DNS and RPKI clients at scale, leveraging residential virtual private network (VPN) proxies and perturbation techniques such as fuzzing and genetic algorithms to pinpoint and address security vulnerabilities. Secondly, it plans to analyze the causes of configuration errors from administrators' viewpoints, aiming to create machine learning-based tools for automatic correction of errors. Lastly, it plans to leverage RPKI and DNSSEC to improve the security of other network protocols, focusing on TLS revocation trust issues and the security assessment of critical infrastructure communication channels.\r\n\r\nBy providing a clearer understanding and effective management tools for DNSSEC and RPKI, the project addresses fundamental challenges in ensuring the Internet remains a secure and trustworthy environment. This is important for maintaining the integrity and reliability of Internet naming and routing, which are foundational to the global digital ecosystem. The project's outcomes will be to help minimize mismanagement and vulnerabilities, towards enhancing the overall security and resilience of the Internet.\r\n\r\nThe project's resources, including tools, datasets, and source code, will be made available at https://projects.netsecurelab.org, ensuring long-term access for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers interested in Internet security.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
