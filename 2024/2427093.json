 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nontechnical Abstract: \r\nQuantum information science and engineering (QISE) has far-reaching implications for scientific advancement, technological innovation, and national priorities. Research into advanced quantum materials will help QISE realize these goals.  By bringing together expertise in microwave resonator characterization, carbon nanotube synthesis, and superconducting qubit technology, the research team seeks to develop novel quantum materials and devices with enhanced performance.  This project seeks to advance QISE through collaborative research and education initiatives in the St. Louis area. The project also focuses on expanding the quantum workforce by creating new educational pathways and research opportunities for students from diverse backgrounds, including those from historically underrepresented groups. Through partnerships between Saint Louis University, Washington University in St. Louis, Harris-Stowe State University, and St. Louis Community College, the project aims to broaden participation in QISE and create a robust pipeline of skilled quantum scientists and engineers.\r\n\r\nTechnical Abstract: \r\nThis research aims to develop materials and devices that can better preserve quantum coherence, enhance light-matter interactions, and achieve strong confinement of charge, thereby enabling novel approaches to computation, sensing, and communication that surpass classical limitations. The research component of this project addresses fundamental challenges in quantum materials and devices through three main goals. First, the team will investigate advanced superconducting quantum materials by measuring superconducting resonator quality factors. The team will study new materials and apply surface treatment techniques to mitigate losses. Second, the project develops methods to embed semiconducting carbon nanotubes in superconducting resonators, leveraging their unique properties for quantum sensing and information processing. Third, the team will use these devices\u2019 design, production, and measurement as a workforce training tool, integrating students at various levels into cutting-edge QISE research. The project will employ state-of-the-art fabrication techniques, including flip-chip integration of carbon nanotubes with superconducting circuits, and utilize microwave resonator measurements to characterize and optimize device performance. This work aims to advance our understanding of quantum decoherence mechanisms and develop new platforms for quantum sensing and computation.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
