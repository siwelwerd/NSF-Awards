 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports research on the regularity of solutions to elliptic partial differential equations and regularity of generalized minimal submanifolds. Elliptic differential equations govern the equilibrium configurations of various physical phenomena, for instance, those arising from minimization problems for natural energy functionals. Examples include the shape of free-hanging bridges, the shape of soap bubbles, and the sound of drums. Elliptic differential equations are also used to quantify the degree to which physical objects are bent or distorted, with far-reaching implications and applications in geometry and topology. The proposed research focuses on the regularity of solutions to such equations. Questions to be addressed include the following: Do non-smooth points (singularities) exist? How large can the set of singularities be? What is the behavior of the solution near a singularity? Is it possible to perturb the underlying environment in order to eliminate the singularity? The project will also provide opportunities for the professional development of graduate students, both via individual mentoring and via the organization of a directed learning seminar on geometric analysis and geometric measure theory.\r\n\r\nThe mathematical objectives of the project are twofold. First, the principal investigator will study unique continuation for solutions to elliptic partial differential equations, with a focus on quantitative estimates on the size and structure of the singular set of these solutions. A second topic for consideration is the regularity theory for generalized minimal submanifolds (a generalized notion of smooth submanifolds which arise as critical points for the area functional under local deformations). In particular, the principal investigator will study branch singular points in the interior as well as at the boundary of a generalized minimal submanifold, under an area-minimizing or stability assumption. Research on the latter topic, which can be viewed as a non-linear analogue of quantitative unique continuation for elliptic equations, requires the integration of ideas from geometric measure theory, partial differential equations and geometric analysis.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
