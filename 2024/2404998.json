 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project funds U.S. based student participation in the 2024 Joint Research Conference on Statistics in Quality, Industry and Technology (JRC 2024), which will be held in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada, from June 17-20, 2024, at the University of Waterloo. The organization of this \r\nconference is also in partnership with Virginia Tech. JRC 2024 is a joint meeting of the 29th Spring Research Conference on Statistics \r\nin Industry and Technology (SRC) and the 40th Quality and Productivity Research Conference (QPRC), which happens once every four years.\r\n The theme of JRC 2024 is \"Data Science and Statistics for Industrial Innovation.\" JRC 2024 aims to bring together researchers and\r\n practitioners worldwide who use statistics in quality, technology, and industrial contexts. The conference promotes communication \r\namong researchers and practitioners to enable and ensure the development and widespread use of novel insights and methodology. \r\nJRC 2024 has the potential to benefit society by offering participants the opportunities to gain knowledge and reshape their \r\nperspectives on topics associated with data science, statistics, and machine learning. JRC 2024 will advocate for the ethical \r\napplication and understanding of data science, statistics, and machine learning for industrial innovation, which is beneficial for \r\nthe long-term competitiveness of the U.S. industry. The conference provides a platform to disseminate knowledge to the broader \r\ncommunity by sharing short course lecture notes, presentation slides, and posters on the conference website. JRC 2024 aims to broaden \r\nthe participation of underrepresented groups (i.e., women, racial/ethnic minorities, etc.) in STEM disciplines. \r\n\r\nJRC 2024 focuses on recent advancements in methodology, best practices, and innovative applications. Participation in JRC 2024 has the \r\npotential to advance knowledge and understanding of topics related to data science, statistics, and machine learning and how they can \r\nbe relevant to industrial innovation. This conference traditionally attracts prominent statisticians, data scientists, quantitative \r\nanalysts, and others with an established record of highly influential, methodological, and interdisciplinary research. These individuals \r\nwill have the opportunity to discuss the current progress made in statistics and machine learning, such as big data technology, \r\ntext modeling, the use of generative artificial intelligence in industrial innovation, and exchange novel ideas and experiences in \r\nworking with modern data science to discover knowledge and apply it to numerous fields. JRC 2024 has the potential to disseminate \r\nnew methods and data-driven approaches, the evaluation of previous findings, and the validation of theoretical approaches, \r\nstimulate further investigations regarding the benefits of working with statistics and machine learning methods for industry and \r\nincrease the awareness of the need to use data science approach in industry. The conference will include three plenary presentations, \r\n18 invited paper sessions, four to six contributed sessions, a poster session, a technical tour, and a one-day short course. \r\nMore details on the conference can be found on its web page: \r\nhttps://uwaterloo.ca/joint-research-conference-statistics-quality-industry-technology/\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
