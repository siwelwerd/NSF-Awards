 "awd_abstract_narration": "Technology transfer involves the process of translating basic research into tangible products or services that benefit society. This process typically begins in a research lab with an invention by a scientist who may or may not choose to engage in technology transfer activities, such as patenting and the licensing of patents. Such engagement is not a required job activity, since it goes beyond the scientist\u2019s primary job activity as a basic researcher. The project team is collecting data to better understand scientist engagement in technology transfer at several institutes of the NIH. The project is the first large-scale study of behavioral and organizational factors that could be relevant to engagement in technology transfer. Specifically, the project team is collecting data on individual factors, such as perceived ambivalence toward technology transfer, perceived fairness in the treatment of scientists, and scientists\u2019 representation in historically marginalized groups. In addition, the team is collecting data on organizational support variables, including supervisory championing and extent of an organizational climate stressing technology transfer. The project has important managerial and public policy implications for those who manage and govern technology transfer at federal agencies and academic institutions.\r\n\r\nThe project involves data collection in two stages. First, initial interviews are conducted with the Scientific Directors of participating NIH Institutes. The purpose of these interviews is to provide insights on the unique characteristics of each Institute that may be relevant to technology transfer. Second, using survey methods, the study is multi-level in that it simultaneously assesses individual scientists within the context of their organization (i.e., Institutes). With this design, the project generates insights regarding potential variation within and between research centers, branches, and institutes of NIH. Survey data collection involves a time-delayed approach at three different points in time. Time 2 administration occurs approximately two months after Time 1, and Time 3 administration occurs approximately six months after Time 2.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
