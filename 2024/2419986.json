 "awd_abstract_narration": "This academic-industry collaborative project aims to develop new methods to search for and discover mineral deposits enriched in copper and nickel. Copper is essential to electricity generation, distribution, and storage. It is used in rechargeable batteries, electric motors, electrical wiring and connectors, charging stations and infrastructures needed to connect renewable energy to the main electrical grid. Nickel is used in a wide range of industries including manufacture of stainless and heat-resistant steels and non-ferrous alloys used in specialized industrial, aerospace, and military applications. Nickel is also used as a cathode material in lithium-ion batteries in electric vehicles and local and grid-scale energy storage because it increases the energy density of batteries. This research team is made of university professors and students along with mining industry professionals. They will collaborate throughout the project to ensure that the research deliverables have measurable impacts on the mining industry. The industry scientists add substantial practical knowledge about critical mineral deposits and ground and surface hydrogeological systems that are vital for the success of the project. Students at the University of Michigan and Juniata College will do field work in Minnesota and Michigan. They will learn to log drill core, make observations of hand samples, understand surface and groundwater flow, measure the compositions of ore samples, and how to effectively communicate research results. Industry and academia will benefit from each other, while providing invaluable applied experience for students.\r\n\r\nResearchers will test the hypothesis that the ratio of the abundances of copper-65 to copper-63 in ground and surface waters proximal to the Tamarack copper-nickel-cobalt-sulfide ore deposit will reveal a systematic change of 2 to 4 per mil with proximity to the sulfide ore body and 'downstream' waters, thus providing a vector toward sulfide mineralization. Copper, nickel and cobalt are considered critical materials for energy (U.S. Department of Energy) and nickel and cobalt are considered critical minerals (U.S. Geological Survey) vital for downstream manufacture of battery electric vehicles, photovoltaic solar panels, wind turbines, grid-scale battery energy storage and the generation and distribution of electricity.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
