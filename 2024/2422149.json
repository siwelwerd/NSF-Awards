 "awd_abstract_narration": "The demand for powerful and energy-efficient artificial intelligence (AI) is growing rapidly. Current AI hardware, which uses silicon chips, struggles to meet these needs for advanced AI models. This Emerging Frontiers in Research and Integration (EFRI) project will develop innovative computing systems inspired by the structure and function of the human brain.  Specifically, the project will create advanced human brain organoids (hBOs). These are miniature 3D models of the human brain grown from stem cells in a lab dish. They contain various types of brain cells that organize themselves into structures resembling parts of the developing human brain. hBOs can process information and perform computations in ways that parallel the human brain's capabilities. This EFRI research will integrate multiple hBOs with different arrangements and connections to develop new computing architectures that are highly efficient in terms of energy consumption and computing power. In addition, Bioethicists will collaborate closely with engineering researchers at each step of the project to study ethical considerations related to public acceptance and oversight of hBO computing.\r\n\r\nThis EFRI BEGIN OI project will develop an hBO-based biocomputing system that integrates neuromorphic computing theory, bioengineered hBOs, and critical bioethical research. It will advance theoretical concepts in biocomputing with human cortical neural networks by designing optimal neural networks and implementing adaptive learning mechanisms. The research will explore how factors like excitatory-inhibitory balanced networks, connectivity density, and network scale affect the computational capacity of hBOs. Additionally, the project will develop bioengineered multi-hBO systems with organized hBOs containing excitatory and inhibitory neuron populations in local microcircuits. These novel hBOs will interface with electronics to achieve real-time read-in and read-out of neuronal activity, leveraging the adaptive learning properties inherent in hBOs. This effort represents a critical step toward developing neuromorphic computing hardware capable of achieving superior computing power with low energy consumption. Importantly, the EFRI research will also address bioethical challenges associated with hBO-based biocomputing by refining an innovative approach to engineering ethics. It will ensure alignment with evolving standards in AI and biomedical research ethics, engaging policymakers and ethical committees to navigate the complex landscape of human biomaterial use in computing applications and fostering public trust and acceptance. Educational efforts within the EFRI project will reach diverse student populations, including K-12 and underrepresented groups, nurturing interest in STEM and biological research. Outreach activities will engage students in both the US and Israel with STEM challenges and offer interdisciplinary training opportunities for graduate students in both countries.\r\n\r\nThis project is jointly funded by the Emerging Frontiers in Research and Innovation Program (BEGIN OI), the Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering, and the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
