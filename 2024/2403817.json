 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supports the 38th annual Summer Topology Conference, hosted at the University of Coimbra in Coimbra, Portugal, July 8-12, 2024. This international conference encourages participation from a broad spectrum of mathematicians at different career levels and diverse backgrounds, and implements a recruitment strategy that starts with establishing a diverse cohort of session organizers.  Elements of the conference provide pathways to include mathematicians into the community of topology research, such as dissemination of results through the conference affiliated journal Topology Proceedings. The funds from this grant will be used to support the participation of researchers based in the US, who wish to attend the conference but otherwise lack the funds to do so.\r\n \r\nThe conference will feature six special sessions: Set-theoretic Topology, Topological Methods in Algebra and Analysis, Topological Dynamics and Continuum Theory, Topology and Categories, Topology in Logic and Computer Science, and Topology and Order. There will be seven plenary lectures, as well as six semi-plenary lectures, one for each section. The extra plenary lecture will be delivered, per tradition, by this year's winner of the Mary Ellen Rudin Young Researcher Award. The primary goal of the conferences is to disseminate and discuss new discoveries in topology from the past few years, and to facilitate collaboration among those able to attend. Further information about the conference can be found at https://www.mat.uc.pt/~sumtopo/.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
