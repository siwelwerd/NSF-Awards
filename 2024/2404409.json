 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the support of the Macromolecular, Supramolecular, and Nanochemistry Program in the Division of Chemistry, Prof. Thuc-Quyen Nguyen of the University of California Santa Barbara will lead a research project focused on developing a new class of sustainable carbon-based semiconductors, named conjugated polyelectrolytes (CPEs), which could be used in electronic devices like smartphones, sensors and solar panels. Unlike traditional semiconductors made from silicon, CPEs can be processed using environmentally friendly methods, such as water-based solutions at room temperature. This approach will help reduce the negative environmental impact of semiconductor manufacturing. The project aims to enhance fundamental understanding of how the structure of CPEs affects their property and performance in various devices, which could lead to the development of more efficient and cost-effective electronics, paving the way for breakthroughs in healthcare, neuromorphic computing, and energy storage. Additionally, the research will contribute to educational and outreach programs, engaging students and teachers from diverse backgrounds in cutting-edge science and promoting STEM education in the local community. This research project aligns with the goals of the US CHIPS and Science Act, supporting the development of sustainable semiconductor technologies and contributing to the American leadership in semiconductor research, production, and workforce development.\r\n\r\nThe project will investigate the impacts of different chemical structures and processing conditions on the self-assembly, morphology, and electronic and ionic transport properties of CPEs using a combination of characterization techniques including dynamic light scattering (DLS), atomic force microscopy (AFM), cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM), X-ray scattering, four-point-probe, and impedance spectroscopy. The combined set of studies will provide a thorough understanding of structure-function-property relationships, leading to fundamental guidelines for synthetic chemists to design a new generation of CPEs with tailored transport properties for various emerging technologies.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
