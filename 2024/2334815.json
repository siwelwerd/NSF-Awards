 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 19th Annual Graduate Student Combinatorics Conference (GSCC) will be held from March 15-17, 2024, at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, PA. The GSCC is organized by and for graduate students, and includes many subfields of combinatorics, including algebraic, topological, additive, and probabilistic combinatorics. The goal of GSCC is to provide a welcoming environment for graduate students to present their research, learn about the research of others, and meet and collaborate with other students in their field. Carnegie Mellon is well-known for its strength in combinatorics and the applications of combinatorics to computer science. Through a conference for graduate students, the hope is to provide support and encouragement to the next generation of researchers in this thriving subject, as such the aim is to make it accessible and inclusive to a broad spectrum of students. \r\n\r\nThe main feature of the GSCC is that graduate student attendees are invited to present 25-minute talks on their research, which will run in parallel sessions. There will be four plenary speakers, who are all distinguished professors within different subfields of combinatorics: Jane Pu Gao (Waterloo), Thomas Lam (Michigan), Igor Pak (UCLA), and Michael Young (Carnegie Mellon). Conference registration (free) will open by January, as will applications for travel support. More information for the GSCC is available at sites.google.com/view/GSCC2024.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
