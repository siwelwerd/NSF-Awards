 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project develops air conditioning technology, unveiling a high-efficiency, liquid desiccant regenerator that promises to unlock the full potential of liquid desiccant air conditioning (LDAC).  The solution promises substantial energy savings for families and industries alike. For families, the technology translates into reduced energy costs, offering tangible financial relief and enhancing their quality of life. On an industrial scale, it stands to reshape the power requirements of various sectors, paving the way for more sustainable and cost-effective operations. \r\n\r\nThe project is focused on overcoming the efficiency barriers that have historically impeded LDAC's widespread adoption relative to today\u2019s vapor-compression air conditioners. A suitable membrane technology is adopted for the regeneration of the liquid desiccant as it promises to substantially improve the coefficient of performance for the LDAC. The plan is to develop design specifications for an LDAC that combines the size and cost characteristics of today\u2019s conventional air conditioning systems with the anticipated leap in energy efficiency. The key challenge is in designing a system where membrane behavior at extremely high salt concentrations is robust and predictable.  The experimental development is focused on the assessment of performance of various membranes under various flow rates and salt concentrations. The resulting experimental data are modeled with established mathematical models from literature. Computer simulations of the liquid desiccant regeneration process are developed using the experimental membrane models to demonstrate the regenerator's feasibility and predict its efficacy and value.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

LDAC technology dehumidifies air using a liquid desiccant (LD) and cools it via evaporative cooling. The primary energy-intensive component of this process is the regeneration of the LD, which restores its moisture-absorbing capability. Traditional thermal regeneration methods have demonstrated efficiencies comparable to state-of-the-art VC systems but lack a compelling efficiency advantage to justify commercial adoption. This research investigated a novel, non-thermal regeneration technique, Low Salt-Rejection Membrane (LSRM) separation, to improve the efficiency of LD regeneration by separating the water in liquid form, drastically reducing energy consumption.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Research Findings and Technical Insights</strong></p>\r\n<p>The research systematically examined LSRM separation as an alternative to thermal regeneration. The ideal process would involve reverse osmosis (RO) separation, where water is mechanically extracted without phase change. However, due to the extreme osmotic pressures required for effective RO separation, the study explored a multi-stage LSRM process. Extensive experiments were conducted to quantify the performance of various membrane materials and desiccants, measuring rejection rates, permeate flux, and system efficiency across different operating pressures. Results revealed that while LSRM could achieve desiccant regeneration, its efficiency was significantly lower than initially predicted, requiring an impractical number of membrane stages. The highest regenerator coefficient of performance (COP) achieved was 0.60, far below the industry standard COP of 4.0 for thermal regeneration, making LSRM an uncompetitive technology for practical application.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Technology Pivot and Breakthrough</strong></p>\r\n<p>Given the limitations of LSRM, the project pivoted towards an alternative, proprietary regeneration technology capable of achieving a COP of 7. This novel approach retains the fundamental benefits of LDAC while substantially improving energy efficiency. In an operational LDAC system, this innovation is projected to achieve an overall cooling performance with a COP of 10.5, translating to a Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio 2 (SEER2) of 39, double the efficiency of the most advanced VC systems available today. This breakthrough offers a viable pathway to commercializing LDAC with unprecedented efficiency gains.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Broader Societal and Economic Impacts</strong></p>\r\n<p>The development of high-efficiency LDAC technology presents significant environmental and economic benefits. Air conditioning accounts for a substantial portion of global energy consumption and carbon emissions. By reducing energy demand by over 50% compared to current VC systems, this technology can contribute to large-scale reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally, it eliminates reliance on high-global-warming-potential (high GWP) poly-fluoroalkyl substance (PFAS) refrigerants, aligning with global sustainability initiatives and regulatory trends.</p>\r\n<p>From an economic perspective, the commercialization of LDAC with this advanced regeneration technology is poised to disrupt the existing $390 billion HVAC industry by redefining the standards of high-efficiency air conditioning. During Phase I, Liebold Technologies participated in the NSF I-Corps program, conducting over 100 customer interviews to refine the commercialization strategy. The primary beachhead market identified consists of high-income residential consumers in Florida with homes larger than 2,000 ft&sup2;, where energy efficiency incentives and high cooling demand make this technology particularly attractive. The initial product offering will be a variable-speed, 5-ton residential split air conditioning system exceeding 30 SEER2 efficiency, positioning it competitively against premium VC systems. The long-term roadmap includes expansion into commercial and industrial applications.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Conclusion and Future Work</strong></p>\r\n<p>This Phase I research successfully demonstrated the feasibility of a transformative LDAC regeneration process, overcoming a critical efficiency barrier that has historically hindered LDAC adoption. The novel regeneration approach enables a disruptive shift in HVAC technology, significantly reducing energy consumption and operational costs while enhancing climate resilience. Future work will focus on scaling the new regeneration process, optimizing system integration, and advancing towards commercial prototypes. With continued development and validation, this innovation has the potential to redefine energy-efficient air conditioning on a global scale.</p>\r\n<p><strong>References</strong></p>\r\n<p>[1] NREL, \"Desiccant Enhanced Evaporative Air-Conditioning (DEVap): Evaluation of a New Concept in Ultra Efficient Air Conditioning,\" National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Golden, CO, 2011.</p>\r\n<p>[2] P.
