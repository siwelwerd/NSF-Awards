 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Improving Undergraduate STEM Education: Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSI) Program, this Track 1 project aims to address critical challenges in STEM education at the University of Puerto Rico in Carolina (UPRCa). The general problem centers around the underrepresentation of Hispanic students in STEM programs across the Nation, leading to lower enrollment, retention, and graduation rates. This issue is of critical importance as it impedes the full potential of these students and fails to meet the growing demands of the STEM workforce. Currently, there is a gap in providing accessible and relevant STEM education, particularly in emerging fields like Artificial Intelligence (AI). Existing programs lack incorporation of these technologies, making it imperative to renew and diversify STEM degrees to align with current and future job requirements.\r\n \r\nTo improve enrollment, retention, and graduation rates, the project will establish partnerships with local high schools, implement dual enrollment programs, and create clear pathways for a seamless transition from high school to associate and bachelor\u2019s degree programs. Through needs assessments, faculty training, and curriculum enhancements, we aim to integrate AI into existing programs, ensuring graduates possess cutting-edge skills. Employing a stackable program structure, students can earn certifications at various stages, enhancing their employability. Additionally, we will provide robust student services, mentoring programs, and Continuing Education Certifications for the existing workforce. Anticipated outcomes include increased STEM program enrollment, enhanced retention and graduation rates, and a skilled workforce ready for 21st-century technologies. Aligned with the HSI Program's broader impact, our project enhances undergraduate STEM education, fosters partnerships, and contributes new knowledge to address STEM challenges at HSIs. Dissemination includes a project website, social media, newsletters, workshops, and seminars, ensuring impact across academia, industry, and society, ultimately contributing to a successful STEM community. The HSI Program aims to enhance undergraduate STEM education and build capacity at HSIs. Projects supported by the HSI Program will also generate new knowledge on how to achieve these aims.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
