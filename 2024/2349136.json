 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site at Western Washington University\u2019s Shannon Point Marine Center (SPMC), which is located in Anacortes, WA. The program will bring eight undergraduates to SPMC each summer for a nine-week research experience. During the three years (2024-2026), the project will provide summer internships for a total of twenty-four students. Students will conduct independent research projects with the guidance of research mentors and will participate in a variety of professional development activities, including workshops on scientific ethics, scientific writing, the graduate school experience and career options, as well as field trips and outreach events. The program conducts a national search for applicants and seeks to engage students who are from community colleges and schools with limited research opportunities. Most of the funding provided supports student stipends, housing and travel to attend the program. This project supports the national goals of developing the next generation of scientists and the scientific workforce.\r\n\r\nThe WWU REU program promotes strong faculty/student relationships tailored to the needs and capabilities of each student while providing group activities that promote student-student interaction, near-peer mentoring, and student access to the entire group of faculty mentors. Each student works with an individual adviser to develop a research project that is independent, relevant, and appropriately focused. The general theme\r\ninvolves a process-oriented approach to estuarine dynamics, emphasizing primary and secondary productivity, biogeochemistry, microbial ecology, sediment and nutrient transport at estuarine and boundary-layer scales, ocean acidification, chemical ecology, and marine diseases, topics that articulate well with more traditional studies of invertebrate ecology. With their adviser, each student develops and presents a project plan in a colloquium during the second week, conducts the research under the appropriate level of faculty supervision, and presents oral and written reports at the end of the program. Publication of results and presentation at scientific meetings is strongly encouraged and supported.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
