 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project seeks to develop a new technology to improve the way neurons are stimulated during neuroscience experiments. Current methods have limitations such as invasiveness. The devices to be used here will allow localized chemical reactions to be initiated with light. Thorough testing will be done both in cultured cells and on living animals. This project aims to provide new approaches that may revolutionize the treatment of neurological conditions such as Parkinson's disease and epilepsy. Additionally, the project promotes STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) education and diversity by providing valuable learning opportunities for students from underrepresented groups.\r\n\r\nThe technology to be developed here, the Monolithic Adjustable Photostimulation (MAP) platform introduces random-access and pixel-less photostimulation capabilities, significantly improving neuromodulation resolution. The device is designed for minimally-invasive delivery and precise, non-genetic modulation of neural circuits. The research involves meticulous engineering of advanced silicon heterojunctions, which are junctions between nanoporous and non-porous silicon, to optimize their photoelectrochemical properties. Rigorous evaluations will be conducted both in vitro and in vivo. Initial tests will be performed on cultured neurons and mice brains to validate the technology, followed by trials on minipig models that closely simulate human brain anatomy to ensure the efficacy and safety of the MAP devices. This work, at the intersection of semiconductor technology and biophotonics, promises significant advancements in understanding and treating neurological conditions. The broader impacts include transforming treatments for disorders such as Parkinson's disease and epilepsy through the development of these non-genetic, optically controlled neuromodulation devices. Through programs such as the University's Collegiate Scholars and partnerships with Chicago Public Schools, students can participate in summer research. The project also collaborates with the Logan Art Center at UChicago to inspire high school students by integrating science with art.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
