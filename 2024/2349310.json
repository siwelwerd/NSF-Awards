 "awd_abstract_narration": "This new REU Site: Summer Research Program at SRC JUMP2.0 SUPREME is hosted by Cornell University and MIT. Workforce development for the semiconductor industry is paramount to meet the demands in semiconductor industry. Essential skillsets for the new workforce are device fabrication, process, and packaging and cleanroom experiences. This site will host 10 REU students each year (five at Cornell and five at MIT), who will participate in semiconductor research in the cutting-edge cleanroom facilities. Students will align their individual research projects with the latest semiconductor research for future microelectronics applications. They will experience extensive cleanroom experiences using world-class cleanroom facilities in academic settings. The mentoring experience will be tailored to each student.  Participants will also interact with semiconductor industry liaisons, engage in professional development via workshops and talks on ethics in research, effective presentation and writing, intellectual properties and entrepreneurship, career paths, and become part of the network of Semiconductor Research Corporation (SRC) research communities. REU participants will gain valuable skills in cleanroom and semiconductor technologies, exposure to latest microelectronics research, and networking opportunities with semiconductor industry partners.\r\n\r\nThe new REU site focuses on building a semiconductor industry-ready workforce and provide a launching pad for REU students to further pursue higher education degrees in STEM fields. REU students will conduct research at the MIT-Cornell led SUPREME center. SUPREME (Superior Energy-efficient Materials and Devices), a Semiconductor Research Corporation (SRC) funded JUMP (Joint University Microelectronics Program) 2.0 center. The REU participants will conduct research aligned with the 2021 Decadal Plan for Semiconductors. Four semiconductor research areas are featured, including new digital and analog devices, novel memory and applications, interconnects and materials discovery, and advanced metrology and processing. Recruitment efforts will focus on students from institutions where research opportunities are limited. Technologically, the REU student research projects are aligned with the goals of the semiconductor industry for the next generation of electronics.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
