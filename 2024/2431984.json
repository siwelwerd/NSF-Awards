 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact of this Partnerships for Innovation - Technology Translation (PFI-TT) project is in the development of a new conducting material, namely a conducting coordination polymer, and its application to conductive coatings and/or films for various technological applications. The material is stable in harsh conditions and is solution processable as an ink which can be applied to surfaces. This unique combination makes it different from known conductors and makes it an appealing candidate for inclusion into electromagnetic shielding coatings/textiles and flexible electronics. The goal of the effort is to further develop the material for these applications, both in terms of its scalability and cost, while exploring its applications and processing capabilities. In tandem with these efforts, this project will result in entrepreneurial training and career preparation for students at various levels of education.\r\n\r\nThe project aims to investigate the technological applications of a newly discovered coordination polymer NiTTFtt. This material is highly conductive and is also stable to harsh conditions including acid, base, and even detergent washes. It is also stable to heating in air above 200 degrees Celsius. The material can be solution-processed either as a colloidal suspension or an ink. These solutions enable the deposition of thin films on many substrates, as well as dip coating of materials such as textiles. The goal of this research will be to optimize the above properties, and to then develop its applications in various technologies. Specific areas of interest include electromagnetic shielding and flexible electronics. Here, the unique stability profile of NiTTFtt promises the realization of new robust coatings or devices which should be amenable to operation in harsh conditions such as marine environments. Novel synthetic approaches will also be investigated in order to improve the scalability and cost of these materials and/or coatings. Finally, performance in specific applications will be tested on both pure NiTTFtt films, as well as coated composites which can be tailored for specific applications.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
