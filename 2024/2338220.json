 "awd_abstract_narration": "There are differences in environmental quality across groups in the US with important implications for health, productivity, and economic opportunity. While research has  documented differences in environmental quality across locations, not much is known about who is exposed to environmental risks, why these differences arise, and the consequences for health, prosperity, and welfare. This CAREER award funds research that will use a newly constructed individual-level data set with rich demographic, economic, and environmental information, to answer important questions about the extent, causes, and consequences of environmental inequality in the United States. The first part of the research will study individual exposure to environmental risks in the US, the second part will study the mechanisms that cause differential environmental risks, while the third and final part will study how environmental inequality affects health, productivity, and economic opportunity.  The results of this research will provide inputs into decisions to reduce the effects of environmental risks, improve health, increase labor productivity, economic growth, and increase the well-being of US citizens.  The results of this research will also establish the US as the global leader in reducing environmental risk inequality.  \r\n\r\nThis CAREER award funds research that will use a combination of different methods to study the causes and consequences of environmental inequality on the well-being of the US population. The first set of projects will produce new descriptive facts about individual exposure to environmental hazards. These insights will provide the context and framing needed to think about the models and mechanisms underlying the causes and consequences of environmental inequality. The second set of projects will provide key insights into the mechanisms that cause environmental disparities. The third part of the project will provide new evidence on how environmental inequality shapes health, productivity, and economic opportunity in the U.S. It pays particular attention to combining microeconomic data and research designs with macroeconomic models to better understand the aggregate and distributional effects of environmental inequality.  The results of this research will provide inputs into decisions to reduce the effects of environmental risks, increase labor productivity and increase the well-being of US citizens.  The results of this research will also establish the US as a global leader in reducing environmental inequality.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
