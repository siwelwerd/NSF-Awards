 "awd_abstract_narration": "Current research on STEM education shows that among the barriers to STEM participation and retention for underrepresented minority students is the interpersonal bias experienced in STEM settings where they are subject to stereotypes related to underachievement. Racial microaggressions refer to stereotype-based verbal, behavioral, or environmental negativity in interpersonal interactions that are often subtle yet detrimental, especially when encountered on a regular basis. Research shows that microaggressions are linked to decreased well-being, mental health, and physical health. Students experiencing racial stressors in academic environments, including microaggressions, experience lower rates of academic engagement, institutional belonging, persistence, and academic efficacy. The project objective is to use design-based research to develop a tool for countering racial microaggressions in STEM. \r\n\r\nThrough an iterative process, the project will generate a tool distinct from other anti-bias interventions and grounded in psychological theories on behavior change. Quantitative and qualitative data from STEM students and faculty will be collected and applied across several phases of a theory-driven design process. The STEM Educator Series on Student Interactions (SESSI) is an innovative approach to reducing racial microaggressions in STEM by illustrating students\u2019 experiences and, importantly, alternative inclusive behaviors to be readily learned and applied by STEM educators. This project will generate a tool distinct from other anti-bias interventions, akin to public health messaging grounded in psychological theories on behavior change. The ultimate goals of the project are STEM educators\u2019 behavior change and more inclusive STEM environments that support aspiring Hispanic and Black scientists and engineers.\r\n\r\nThis project is funded by the EDU Racial Equity in STEM Education activity, which is supported by the Directorate for STEM Education (EDU). This activity supports research and practice projects that investigate how considerations of racial equity factor into the improvement of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education and workforce. Awarded projects seek to center the voices, knowledge, and experiences of the individuals, communities, and institutions most impacted by systemic inequities within the STEM enterprise. Programs across EDU contribute funds to the Racial Equity activity in recognition of the alignment of its projects with the collective research and development thrusts of the four divisions of the directorate.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
