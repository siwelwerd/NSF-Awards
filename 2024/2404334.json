 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project, funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics & Mechanisms B (CSDM-B), Chemistry of Life Processes (CLP) and Chemical Measurement and Imaging (CMI) Programs of the Chemistry Division, Professor Hsin-Chih Yeh of the Department of Biomedical Engineering and Professor Devleena Samanta of the Department of Chemistry at The University of Texas at Austin will develop new types of molecules for detecting and imaging chemicals under various settings. These molecules are comprised of short snippets of DNA, RNA, and/or peptides, and are termed as functional nucleic acids (FNAs). The research aims to discover new FNAs with catalytic properties that can be transformed into sensors that are sensitive, selective, and maintain their function in complex environments. The ultimate goal is to develop sensors for diverse chemical and biological applications that are as good as, or better than, conventional protein enzyme-based sensors. The PIs will leverage the institution\u2019s outreach activities to promote STEM awareness among young talents and inspire them to pursue careers in STEM. The PIs will also make a strong effort to utilize web-based and social media outlets such as YouTube to feature their scientific discoveries and make science more appealing to K-12 students, teachers, and the general public.\r\n\r\nIn this project, Professor Hsin-Chih Yeh and Professor Devleena Samanta will develop catalytic functional nucleic acids (FNAs) for chemical measurements and imaging. Specifically, the proposed research aims to use state-of-the-art selection, synthesis, and signal transduction methods to characterize, enhance, and diversify the catalytic properties of a wide variety of FNAs including aptazymes and DNA-peptide chimeras. The ultimate goal is to discover new FNAs that can be used to detect, measure, and image target analytes under various chemical and biological settings with sensitivities and specificities rivaling or even surpassing those of their protein enzyme counterparts. As such, this research will enhance our fundamental knowledge of how targets and FNAs interact, the development of nucleic acid sensors, and the application of nanomaterials in fluorescence imaging. Additionally, it will introduce innovative techniques for monitoring chemical dynamics within live human cells and tissues.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
