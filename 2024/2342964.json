 "awd_abstract_narration": "This conference travel grant will support the participation of students attending the 2023 North American Power Symposium (NAPS), held at the Western Carolina University in October 2023. NAPS is a student-centric conference that brings together students, faculty, and researchers from the industry and national laboratories, in the power and energy systems area. The purpose of this symposium is to provide a forum for students, faculty, and industrial representatives to discuss the latest research ideas and findings and receive feedback from their peers. The requested funding will be used to cover part of the travel expenses, including meals, lodging for two nights, and discounted registration for students. NAPS is technically co-sponsored by IEEE Power and Energy Society, and the conference proceedings will be published through IEEE Xplore.\r\n\r\nThe NSF support for NAPS 2023 will boost awareness about issues related to the power and energy system, including decarbonization, resilience, and energy justice. The support will also provide a unique learning opportunity for the students in the STEM community by subsidizing their participation in NAPS. The students are expected to receive feedback from their peers and the faculty participants, learn from their peers and connect with potential employers. Finally, support for NAPS will have a positive impact on the power and energy research community in the United States, as they work towards the nation\u2019s energy and climate goals.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This support had two primary intellectual benefits. First, the symposium served as a valuable learning and networking opportunity for students&mdash;future leaders in the field&mdash;by allowing them to present their research, gain insights from peers, and connect with prospective employers. Second, NAPS brought together top researchers in power and energy to exchange ideas on current research, fostering potential advancements in technology and collaborative efforts.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Broader Impacts: </strong>The National Science Foundation&rsquo;s support for NAPS 2023 played a significant role in raising students' awareness and technical readiness in the field of carbon-free power grids. This funding provided an invaluable educational experience for students, particularly those from minority groups within this critical STEM field, by making participation in NAPS more accessible and affordable. Students gained valuable feedback from peers and faculty, learned from other participants, and built connections with potential employers. Ultimately, this support benefits the U.S. power and energy research community as they strive to meet national energy and climate objectives.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Outcomes:</strong> The National Science Foundation funding covered costs for lodging ($147 per student), meals ($128 per student), and registration fee discounts ($200 per student) to support dozens of U.S. students&rsquo; participation in NAPS 2023 in Asheville, North Carolina.
