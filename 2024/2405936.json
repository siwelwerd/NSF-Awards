 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) through Targeted Infusion Projects supports the development, implementation, and study of evidence-based, innovative models and approaches for improving the preparation and success of HBCU undergraduate students so that they may pursue science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) graduate programs and/or careers. The goal of this project is to improve the retention and graduation rates for students historically underrepresented in STEM fields, particularly those with an interest in Nuclear Science, at Florida Memorial University.\r\n\r\nThe project aims to accomplish this goal by 1) improving the STEM and Nuclear laboratory infrastructure, and teaching competencies in the STEM and Nuclear programs; 2) creating a professor and student-led learning community; and 3) providing academic year and summer research experiences for students enrolled in STEM and Nuclear courses. Implementing these activities will enable students to improve their critical thinking skills through early research exposure and supplemental instruction, including mentoring. The project will serve as an attractive model for minority serving institutions throughout the nation and address the national shortage of diverse, skilled STEM professionals, particularly in Nuclear Science fields.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
