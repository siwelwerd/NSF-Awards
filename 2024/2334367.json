 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a number of US-based students to attend the 41st annual IEEE Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Test Symposium (VTS) with the intention of exposing them to the discipline and to encourage them to pursue careers in emerging issues around VLSI testing and related research. Participation in this symposium is considered an important part of the graduate-school experience of students in computer engineering, providing the opportunity to interact with senior researchers and to be exposed to leading-edge work in the field. The support will enable dissemination of scientific knowledge to students who would otherwise not have this valuable experience. This student-travel support will also facilitate the development of promising graduate students and will both directly and indirectly help train the workforce of the future in the key areas of computer engineering, in general, and Semiconductor Microelectronics Testing in particular. Participation of members from groups underrepresented in computer engineering will be given due consideration for receiving support through this grant.\r\n\r\nThe VLSI Test symposium (VTS) for more than 40 years has been the premier conference where emerging trends and novel concepts focused on testing, reliability, built-in test, hardware security research and development have been explored. The 2024 edition of this conference will address key trends and challenges in these areas and includes Keynote and Plenary Talks, Technical Paper Sessions, Tutorials, Panels, and Special Sessions. The conference committee has set up adequate evaluation criteria to select qualified students from a pool of applicants formed via open advertising. While the requested funds will primarily be used for supporting graduate students, the committee may also consider US-based post-doctoral fellows to better reach a diverse population of potential researchers in this field.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
