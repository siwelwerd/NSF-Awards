 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact of this I-Corps project is based on the development of proprietary two-dimensional (2D) material composites for electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding applications. These composites can provide effective shielding across diverse frequency ranges, enabling improved performance and reliability of consumer electronics, electric vehicles, aerospace systems, and other technologies susceptible to disruptive electromagnetic interference. The global EMI shielding market is projected to reach $7.7 billion by 2026, driven by surging demand and the transition to 5G networks. The development of 2D material composites can uniquely meet the shielding needs of this rapidly growing market.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology.  The technology is based on the development of surface-functionalized two-dimensional (2D) materials that exhibit strong interfacial interactions allowing their use in multifunctional composite blends. This project investigates the relationships between composite structure, processing methods, and resultant functional properties like shielding effectiveness across frequency ranges. The project aims contribute to design rules for scalable 2D material composites with tailored electromagnetic interference shielding and diverse capabilities spanning mechanical, thermal, optical and other performance metrics critical for commercial adoption.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
