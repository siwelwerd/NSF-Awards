 "awd_abstract_narration": "Technical Abstract: The quantum science and engineering community is focused on developing protocols and devices that leverage the unique features of quantum mechanics to achieve classically infeasible tasks. Realizing this potential requires highly trained scientists and engineers who are fluent in quantum concepts. More must be done to attract, train, and place emerging talent to meet the needs of a growing market in industry, government, and academia. Populating the growing quantum workforce requires training in science communication, exposure to career pathways, and access to internship and job opportunities. The Institute for Robust Quantum Simulation has developed the Quantum Leap Career Nexus workshop to advance workforce development through internship and job placement. The goal is to facilitate more such placements in the local and regional area, where a multi-university quantum-focused career workshop does not yet exist.\r\n\r\nNon-Technical Abstract: This workshop is a direct result of feedback from and was designed by young researchers, who are interested in learning more about career pathways and are eager for opportunities to expand their professional networks, engaging more fully in the quantum industry. The program brings together undergraduates, graduate students, postdoctoral scholars, and early-career professionals to build career skills, establish mentorships, widen networks, learn about emerging career pathways, create new connections between talent and employers in quantum science and engineering, and showcase research and work experience to secure promising placements. It provides career-development training to enhance job-seekers\u2019 marketability through stronger resumes, expanded digital footprints, and improved communication to a non-technical audience. A significant portion of the workshop is dedicated to networking and recruitment activities with potential employers, to help with internship and career placements in quantum science and technology. The location in Prince George\u2019s County, Maryland provides a unique opportunity to leverage the mid-Atlantic region\u2019s diverse population of students and professionals and its abundance of employers across the quantum industry, academia, and\r\ngovernment. In addition to inviting attendees from local, regional, and national partners such as the Institute\u2019s partner universities, other Quantum Leap Challenge Institutes, and other quantum centers, this workshop invites attendees from historically Black colleges and universities and minority-serving institutions. To broaden access to career opportunities in quantum science and technology for students of all backgrounds, the workshop covers travel expenses for at least fifty attendees.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
