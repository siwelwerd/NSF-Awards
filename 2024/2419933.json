 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Summer Geometry Initiative (SGI) is an intensive summer program aimed at helping student researchers in the field of geometry processing.  Geometry processing addresses algorithms, software, and theory relevant to computing over geometric data; the fields brings together mathematics, computer science, and engineering expertise needed to work with 3D models in a range of applications.  The summer program provides opportunities for SGI Fellows to engage deeply with current research and work with experienced mentors.  This year, the summer program leadership is also working closely with the Symposium on Geometry Processing, a leading conference in the area.  This will provide additional opportunities for students to engage with the research community, including interacting with alumni who have participated in past iterations of the workshop.\r\n\r\nThis grant will support stipends, travel, and registration support for about 13 students who otherwise have limited funding and so might not be able to participate in the summer institute or the conference.  Criteria for selection include financial need and growing the size and breadth of the geometry processing community, with a particular focus on providing opportunities for students who would not otherwise be likely to get involved in the field.  Prior sessions of the summer program have had demonstrated impact on alumni's graduate work and careers, while elements of the summer program will also be made more widely available through a talk series and tutorials with accompanying materials.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
