 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project\r\nmay be to improve the success rates of clinical trials by possibly enhancing the engagement and retention of participants.\r\nPoor clinical trial communication causes participant disengagement and attrition, resulting in incomplete data,\r\nfailed trials, and associated economic losses for the pharmaceutical industry The dynamic communication behavior\r\nprediction tools that will be developed by this research may improve participant engagement through tailored\r\ncommunication strategies. This technology combines unsupervised machine learning and operations research\r\nmodels to predict participant communication and optimize contact protocols to increase engagement and\r\nretention. This is a data-driven approach to improve clinical trial decision-making, schedule flexibility,\r\nand participant outcomes, and reduce no-shows and dropout rates.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a large language model that will\r\nimprove the communication between clinical researchers and the participants in clinical trials with a focus on\r\noptimizing engagement and retention to prevent trial failures. The project will use cluster analysis of\r\ncommunications data from several clinical trials to understand and model group behavior for key variable\r\ndetection. These data will be integrated to design customized communication strategies for identified\r\nbehavioral clusters. The clustering and group assignment models will be tuned to develop a synergistic model\r\nfor employing optimal communication with clinical trial participants. Increased research staff productivity,\r\nimproved data collection efficiency, and advances in clinical trial research scientific and technological\r\nunderstanding are predicted. This new technology could solve a major problem in the industry,\r\nimprove patient outcomes, decrease healthcare costs, and increase the success rate of clinical trials by\r\nachieving response rates close to 95% total participation. The ultimate goal is to improve treatment efficacy\r\nand healthcare delivery quality by incorporating a multi-objective machine learning methodology to increase\r\npatient engagement in their care.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
