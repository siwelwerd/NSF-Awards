 "awd_abstract_narration": "The MITRE Caldera project is an open-source platform that enables cyber defenders to attack and test their own computer networks and systems at the same level as real-world hackers and cyber-attacks. The primary vision of the Caldera platform is to operationalize the ability to translate cyber threat intelligence to adversary emulation plans and cyber security evaluations in the most efficient, repeatable, and understandable manner for cyber defenders and analysts. Furthermore, Caldera provides an intuitive user-interface and low barrier-to-entry for users to become proficient practitioners very quickly as demonstrated by it being used to effect by entry-level cyber defenders, interns and even students. Caldera has helped democratize cyber defense capabilities for organizations, companies, and governments. Despite this impact, most of its academic and private industry outreach occurred organically through unfunded happenstance. This effort seeks to secure Caldera's long-term sustainability.\r\n\r\nTo meet this goal of sustainability, this project focuses on three areas. First, commercial organizations are included as full stakeholders, contributors, and partners. This integration leverages existing networks and interested parties and emphasizes Caldera\u2019s potential use in technology growth areas such as researching cyber defense of operational technology and artificial intelligence-driven adversary emulation. Second, academic and research programs are included for long-term partnerships. Third, incentives attract users to contribute and step up to leadership roles in the Caldera community. This leadership development includes on-boarding resources and contribution guides and policies, but also hosting coding events and establishing a transparent, merit-based governance structure and collaborative decision-making process.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
