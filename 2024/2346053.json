 "awd_abstract_narration": "Feeding a growing global population and engaging in the bioeconomy to sustainably produce proteins, fats, and other useful biomolecules requires high levels of integration between life sciences and engineering disciplines as well as a deep understanding of the current capacities and limitations of the contributing fields. Developing U.S. advanced biomanufacturing capabilities in this area is a national priority that depends on a workforce with interdisciplinary fluency. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award to the University of California at Davis will explore new bioprocessing technologies for cellular agriculture and industrial biomanufacturing important for the development of novel, environmentally friendly consumer products, processes, and services. The comprehensive expertise developed through participation in this program will prepare emerging researchers to meet complex challenges here on Earth and ultimately pave the way for long term human space exploration. The project anticipates training a total of 43 graduate students, including 10 stipend-funded master\u2019s trainees, 13 stipend-funded doctoral trainees, and 23 additional trainees from a strategically assembled group of life science and engineering disciplines (Agricultural and Resource Economics, Animal Biology, Biochemistry, Molecular, Cellular, & Developmental Biology, Biological Systems Engineering, Chemical Engineering, Food Science, Nutritional Biology, and Plant Biology).\r\n\r\nBuilding on strong relationships with industry partners and faculty researchers who have expertise in precision fermentation, cellular agriculture, plant and algal based bioprocessing, and characterization of novel proteins and biomolecules, trainees will conduct research in three broadly defined research areas: 1) Cultivated Meat (growing animal muscle, fat, and connective tissue cells in large-scale bioreactors to produce a meat product); 2) Alternative (Alt) Proteins for Human and Animal Nutrition (developing alternative proteins such as meat, egg, or dairy products that are plant-based, cultivated, and/or derived via microbial fermentation); and, 3) Natural or Recombinant Plant/Algal Proteins and Small Molecules for Industrial Applications (growing plants, plant cells, or algae under controlled conditions for a broad range of industrial applications). Trainees will cultivate technical and professional skills necessary for designing and implementing novel bioprocessing strategies across 6 categories: Bioprocessing Technical Skills, Technoeconomic and Life Cycle Analyses, Project Management, Team Science, Science Communication, and Bioethics and Professionalism. Experiential learning via an industry-mentored Capstone Team Design Project, opportunities to conduct industry internships, and networking with professionals who are actively working to scale novel bioprocesses will provide program trainees with valuable \u201creal world\u201d insights on potential innovations and emerging career paths in this research space.\r\n\r\nThe NSF Research Traineeship (NRT) Program will bring together graduate students from multiple disciplines interested in design and engineering for sustainability to solve real-world problems and increase climate resilience. This project will offer students not only core technical education and training opportunities but important soft skills to become inclusive and responsible future workforce. It will foster collaborations and support immersive experiences for trainees and build a diverse community in STEAM fields. \r\n\u2003\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
