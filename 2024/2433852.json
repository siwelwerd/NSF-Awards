 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact of this I-Corps project is the development of a biomaterial for bone graft regeneration. A major obstacle to the effectiveness of bone grafting procedures is the overgrowth or invasion of fibrous tissues, which grow into the graft site faster than the healing bone. Currently, guided bone regeneration (GBR) membranes are commonly used to augment healing by covering and protecting bone grafted spaces during the bone regeneration process. However, current GBR membranes suffer a high incidence of failure due to rapid degradation, infection, and poor barrier properties, leading to revision surgeries and additional costs to patients and the healthcare system. This technology uses nanofiber materials that are electrospun from chitosan, a biopolymer obtained from natural sources such as shrimp shells and fungi. The use of natural, degradable materials serves as a more sustainable and biocompatible alternative to currently used synthetic polymers such as polytetrafluoroethylene and natural materials such as collagen, which have unpredictable degradation rates and high susceptibility to contamination. The chitosan nanofibers have material characteristics that may reduce early degradation, bacterial attachment, and soft tissue ingrowth, which may improve patient outcomes. In addition to bone graft regeneration, chitosan nanofibers may be used for wound healing dressings, food packaging materials, and local therapeutic delivery.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of stabilized chitosan nanofiber materials for guiding tissue regeneration. The technology uses chemical techniques to covalently bond a fatty acid to functional groups in the chitosan biopolymer, which allows for the stabilization of fibers without swelling or degradation during the fabrication process. The nanofiber structure forms a porous structure ideal for nutrient exchange while remaining cell occlusive, allowing appropriate healing and providing the needed barrier function. The stabilizing fatty acids prevent swelling of the fibers and solve the problem of early degradation of resorbable membranes. As the chitosan membrane does eventually degrade, its non-acidic degradation products do not produce the inflammation associated with synthetic materials and may promote healing and resolution of inflammation. In preclinical evaluations, these nanofiber membranes have been shown to promote bone growth, guide inflammation resolution, deliver therapeutics including anti-inflammatory molecules and antimicrobials, provide a barrier to separate tissue compartments, and prevent bacterial colonization without limiting nutrient exchange.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
