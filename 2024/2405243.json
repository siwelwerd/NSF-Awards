 "awd_abstract_narration": "An exit ticket is a recommended and widely used way to end a lesson. A typical exit ticket format in mathematics lessons is for students to solve a few problems related to the day's lesson and turn it in when they exit the classroom. The most common purpose of exit tickets is to provide formative feedback to teachers about whether students have met the objectives of a given lesson. However, the psychology of learning literature suggests that there is an untapped potential for exit tickets to also benefit student's learning directly. This project explores two potential enhancements to exit tickets, with the goal of improving high-school student's mathematics knowledge and ability to regulate their own learning processes. These enhancements can be implemented easily by teachers in the context of exit tickets to support students self-reflection. This project will explore the impact of enhancements for supporting students in (1) determining how well they know material and (2) evaluating their strategy use and answers. These enhancements could benefit student's mathematics performance on content tests and improve the quality of high-school mathematics instruction. The findings could generalize to a wide range of grades and domains and to other formative assessment types. Dissemination efforts will include sharing the results with practitioners, district administrators, and digital learning creators to increase the use of enhanced exit tickets if they are successful. \r\n\r\nThe project team will work with Integrated Mathematics I teachers to add enhancements to exit tickets for one curriculum unit and investigate whether and how the enhancements improve student outcomes. At least 680 students in a metropolitan school district that serves racially and economically diverse students will participate. The project uses a pretest-intervention-posttest design, with students randomly assigned to one of two conditions within their classroom: 1) enhanced exit tickets or 2) typical exit tickets. At pretest and posttest, students will complete measures of targeted self-regulated learning components (confidence calibration, metacognitive evaluation, mathematics self-efficacy, and mastery-approach goal orientation) as well as an assessment of mathematics performance. Using hierarchical linear models, analyses will investigate whether the enhanced exit tickets show more positive effects on student outcomes than typical exit tickets. Teacher interviews will explore whether the exit tickets were feasible for teachers to regularly implement and informed their instructional practices. Student interviews will explore student's perceptions of the exit ticket enhancements. The research will expand existing theories of self-regulated learning by evaluating whether specific supports for self-reflection can each benefit multiple self-regulated learning outcomes as well as mathematics performance. The proposed studies will also reveal ways that this formative assessment device can be adapted to enhance student's self-regulated learning and content knowledge. These enhancements could lead to exit tickets serving as a formative assessment of student's self-regulated learning practices.\r\n\r\nThis project is funded by the Discovery Research preK-12 program (DRK-12) that seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models, and tools. Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
