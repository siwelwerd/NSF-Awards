 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a theoretical study of the behavior of matter in super-strong magnetic fields.  Observational discoveries of compact stars in our galaxy that are extraordinarily strong magnets, called neutron stars and magnetars, brings modern science into an uncharted territory of enormous magnetic fields. This is where quantum mechanics, rather than everyday classical physics, describes objects as massive as our Sun. Recent advances in laser science and engineering allow the most advanced national laser facilities to approach regimes relevant for studies of such extreme conditions. The neutron stars and magnetars can be viewed as astrophysical laboratories for studies of the interplay of quantum effects in large classical systems, at scale not yet achievable at laser laboratory facilities.  Broader impacts of this project include training of graduate students and outreach to students from rural areas and underrepresented minority groups. \r\n\r\nMagnetars -- neutron stars with magnetic fields exceeding a critical (or Schwinger) field -- are the primary astrophysical sources of interest where quantum electrodynamic (QED) effects strongly affect the behavior, properties and dynamics of plasma.  State-of-the-art high-intensity laser systems are beginning to approach regimes relevant for studies of plasma under such extreme, super-critical field conditions. The upcoming laser-plasma experiments and astrophysical observations will allow one to probe into extreme plasma and astrophysical phenomena that were previously inaccessible. This project aims to lay the theoretical foundations for studying collective plasma phenomena in a strong field QED plasma. The primary goal of this study is the development of theoretical understanding of plasmas under extreme astrophysical conditions and the creation of a comprehensive knowledge base of extreme plasmas with full QED. \r\n\r\nThis project is jointly funded by the Division of Physics and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
