 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact of this I-Corps project is the development of new apple tree varieties that are able to withstand problems brought on by changing weather patterns while maintaining fruit quality. Currently, there is a need for apples trees that are tolerant to a changing environment such as increased temperature and disease. The solution is to genetically select apple trees for long growing seasons, hot summers, and tolerance to diseases that damage and kill trees. In addition, the new varieties may reduce labor costs and the cost of planting new orchards, which may lower production costs. The goal is to provide flavorful fruit for consumers while reducing potential orchard problems.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. The solution is based on the development of apple tree varieties that have better tolerance to the effects of changing weather patterns. Changes in climate have brought on warmer, wetter, and windier weather patterns in most apple-growing areas, which reduce fruit quality, increase pesticide usage, and reduce tree survival. This apple tree technology also has addressed a primary need voiced by fruit growers \u2013 the shortage of trained, skilled laborers. To address these separate objectives, the team has used classical plant breeding techniques to combine traits that produce labor-saving, scion-dwarfed trees and high-quality fruit in hot weather. In addition, scion dwarfing may require fewer grower production inputs and potentially improve apple tree survival. These qualities have been demonstrated in a series of field trials that have piqued fruit grower and consumer interest.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
