 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Mathematical Cognition and Learning Society\u2019s (MCLS) mission is to promote the communication of scientific research on mathematical cognition and learning and advance the study of its typical and atypical development, neural substrates, genetic and environmental influences, cultural variation, and malleability. The MCLS is also committed to fostering diversity and inclusion within its activities to broaden the participation of underrepresented researchers and ensure discoveries are accessible and representative of the broad range of human experiences. Indeed, diverse experiences and perspectives are needed to promote novel research questions and expand our field beyond the traditionally investigated topics. Human abilities may only be truly understood by investigating the full diversity of experiences and abilities, and individuals with diverse experiences are uniquely positioned to ask questions that would not otherwise be asked. \r\n\r\nThis proposal aims to facilitate the contribution of researchers and research findings from underrepresented groups in science, broadly defined, by ensuring a fully accessible conference and setting the guidelines for continued future accessibility both within MCLS activities and in the field. Disabled researchers continue to be underrepresented in academia, and removing access barriers will make the academic community and education more diverse and inclusive. By hosting a fully accessible conference, following the principles of Universal Design at Gallaudet University in June 2024, the MCLS aims to broaden participation in STEM and increase STEM workforce development. The most common accommodations will be proactively provided (e.g., ASL interpretation, professional captions, wheelchair accessibility, advanced availability of materials) to ensure a successful attendance experience for all attendees while removing the burden from disabled individuals for making requests. Through direct experience, all attendees will benefit from a more inclusive conference while challenging any existing preconceived notions about disability. Conferences are a critical means for sharing information and advancing discovery and understanding. By employing principles of Universal Design to enhance accessibility, this conference will directly benefit the diverse audience in attendance.\r\n\r\nThis project is supported by NSF's EDU Core Research (ECR) program. The ECR program emphasizes fundamental STEM education research that generates foundational knowledge in the field. Investments are made in critical areas that are essential, broad and enduring: STEM learning and STEM learning environments, broadening participation in STEM, and STEM workforce development.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
