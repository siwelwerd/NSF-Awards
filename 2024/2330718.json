 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project encompasses both societal and commercial sectors. This project, centered around advancing healthcare technology, aims to significantly revolutionize the way healthcare providers approach diagnosing, monitoring, screening, and updating medical treatments. The core innovation of this project lies in its ability to facilitate early and precise disease detection, thereby potentially reducing healthcare costs and markedly improving patient outcomes, especially in managing chronic and age-related health conditions. In the commercial realm, this technology is set to make a substantial impact within the rapidly expanding healthcare AI market. Its unique approach to processing and interpreting complex health data positions it as a groundbreaking advancement in healthcare AI. Furthermore, this project can lead to enhanced scientific understanding and technological capabilities in the healthcare sector. The project\u2019s success can result in efficient, accessible, and enhanced patient-centric healthcare delivery. This is crucially needed in a world where healthcare systems are increasingly strained and the need for innovative solutions is ever-growing.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is focused on the development and refinement of a healthcare technology platform that utilizes Geometric Unified Learning. This innovative approach is geared towards enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of healthcare diagnostics and monitoring. The project aims to address the significant challenge of processing and interpreting complex health care data, particularly focusing on diseases that can be diagnosed and monitored using minimal yet crucial data sources such as voice and EEG. The research objectives include refining the platform to handle real-world patient data effectively and expanding its capabilities to diagnose and monitor a broader range of diseases. The development of a versatile, user-friendly, and effective diagnostic tool is expected to set new benchmarks in the field of healthcare AI. Such a tool would not only provide significant advancements in medical diagnostics and patient care but would also contribute to the overall understanding of disease patterns and healthcare needs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
