 "awd_abstract_narration": "This CREST-CHE planning award is funded jointly by the Division of Chemistry and the Division of Equity for Excellence in STEM and supports Professors Shahidul Islam, Robert Marsteller, and their team to plan for the establishment of the Center for Renewable Energy and Biotechnology (CREB) at Delaware State University (DSU), a Historically Black College and University (HBCU). The planned CREB center will bring together scientists to create new materials and technologies, such as improved solar panels, batteries and biofuel. These advancements are important because they offer cleaner and more sustainable alternatives to traditional energy sources like coal and oil, which can harm the environment. The project also aims to involve students, particularly those from underrepresented backgrounds, providing them with valuable experience and skills in science and technology and support their educational pathways.\r\n\r\nThe CREB center will develop cost-effective polymers for optoelectronic applications and nanoporous high-entropy cathodes for sodium-ion batteries, providing an eco-friendly alternative to lithium-ion batteries. The center will also explore biodiesel production, offering a sustainable option over fossil fuels. The planning grant will support the identification of existing assets, the establishment of collaborative research teams, and the creation of an organizational framework for governance and evaluation. A Steering Committee and Advisory Committees will guide the planning process, while subcommittees will address critical areas such as infrastructure and partnerships. The project involves an interdisciplinary team of experts, including those in polymer chemistry, nanotechnology, biochemistry, computational chemistry, and data science. This initiative will not only enhance DSU's research capabilities but also provide students with hands-on experience in cutting-edge scientific research, aligning with industry demands and supporting the growth of DSU's Applied Chemistry PhD program.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
