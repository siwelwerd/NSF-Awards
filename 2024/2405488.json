 "awd_abstract_narration": "Navigating complex societal issues such as water shortages, forest fires, and other phenomena-based problems requires understanding the social, technological, and scientific dimensions surrounding the issues and they ways these dimensions interact, shift, and change. Undoubtedly, K-12 students encounter complex problems in their everyday lives now and will do so in the future; how they come to understand an issue and how to tackle it depends on their socioscientific literacy, or the knowledge, skills, and dispositions necessary to understand and address complex societal issues with social, technological, and scientific dimensions. Despite its importance, however, developing students\u2019 socioscientific literacy has received limited attention in elementary science teaching and learning contexts. This project begins to address this problem of practice by focusing first on developing elementary teachers\u2019 socioscientific literacy and their capacity to integrate socioscientific issues and local phenomena in their science teaching practice. The project will do this through the design, development, and facilitation of a year-long professional development program for fourth- and fifth-grade teachers. The project will promote transfer of knowledge and skills gained during professional development into the classroom by supporting teachers in the work of modifying their existing science curriculum materials to integrate socioscientific issues and local phenomena in students\u2019 science learning. The project will also provide continued support as teachers enact their modified science lessons and engage students in scientific sensemaking rooted in socioscientific issues and local phenomena. Curricular materials and resources created during this project will be shared widely with teachers and other educators interested in integrating socioscientific issues and local phenomena in science instruction. \r\n\r\nThe project is exploratory in nature and applies naturalistic research methodology to study the design, development, and implementation of a year-long professional learning program focused on supporting elementary teachers\u2019 socioscientific literacy and capacity to integrate socioscientific issues and local phenomena in their science teaching practice. The project\u2019s target population is 4th and 5th grade teachers in Des Moines, IA area schools. Professional learning will and focus on six broad socioscientific issues (e.g. access to clean water) situated in local phenomena and data (high nutrient levels in local waterways) aligned to 4th and 5th grade science Next Generation Science Standards. Investigators will examine to what extent and in what ways the professional development impacts teachers\u2019 socioscientific literacy, pedagogical capacity to support students\u2019 socioscientific sensemaking, and teachers\u2019 practice. Data sources include teacher interviews, classroom observations, artifacts from practice and professional development sessions (lesson plans, reflective notes), field notes, and pre- and post- Socioscientific Issues Teaching Efficacy Beliefs surveys. Qualitative analytical approaches will be utilized employing both inductive and deductive coding strategies. The project\u2019s design, implementation, and research activities will generate design principles for professional learning centered on developing elementary teachers\u2019 practice that promotes socioscientific literacy in upper-elementary students.\r\n\r\nThe Discovery Research preK-12 program (DRK-12) seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools. Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
