 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research Infrastructure Improvement Track-4 EPSCoR Research Fellows project will provide a fellowship to an Assistant professor and training for a graduate student at the University of Hawaii. This work will be conducted in collaboration with researchers at the Center for Western Weather and Water Extremes at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California San Diego. Forecasting extreme weather events is essential for safety, preparedness, and infrastructure planning, especially in regions like Hawai\u02bbi, where the unique geography poses significant challenges. Hawai\u02bbi\u2019s isolated location increases the importance of early and accurate forecasts to facilitate timely emergency response. This project aims to strengthen the science of forecasting such events in Hawai\u02bbi by understanding the region\u2019s specific climate complexities. By improving our forecasting capabilities, this endeavor will not only advance scientific research but will also contribute significantly to the well-being and safety of Hawai\u02bbi\u2019s residents, especially socioeconomically disadvantaged communities that often bear the brunt of extreme weather events.\r\n\r\nThis fellowship will support training opportunities for the PI in subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) weather forecasting by supporting the establishment of a long-term collaboration with the Center for Western Weather and Water Extremes. The primary objectives of this project are to deepen the understanding of intraseasonal climate variability in the Central Pacific and to develop a subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) forecast system for extreme hydrometeorological events ranging from 2 weeks to 6 months. During the fellowship, this collaboration aims to clarify the impact of the Madden-Julian Oscillation on Hawai\u02bbi\u2019s hydroclimate using observational and reanalysis data, and to evaluate the accuracy of S2S forecasts in the Central Pacific using a variety of metrics. In addition, an S2S forecast system for Hawai\u02bbi will be created by downscaling real-time ensemble forecasts. This system could be used by forecasters and other stakeholders to support emergency planning.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
