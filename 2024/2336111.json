 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dust storms are ubiquitous in Earth\u2019s atmosphere and are composed of small mineral particles having diameters of varying sizes. Theory suggests that for dust transported long distances, the diameters of these particles should be limited to approximately 10 microns or smaller, due to the downward gravitational force acting to remove larger particles from the atmosphere. However, dust particles with diameters of tens to even hundreds of microns in size have been measured thousands of kilometers away from the deserts where they were lofted into the atmosphere. To-date, there is no accepted explanation for this so-called \u201cgiant dust particle conundrum\u201d, highlighting a gap in physical understanding of atmospheric and aerosol processes. Since the magnitudes of dust storm effects on weather and climate, ranging from the absorption of sunlight to being a catalyst for biological activity in the oceans, depend on the physical characteristics of dust, including the particle sizes, there is a need to solve this conundrum.\r\n \r\nThis project aims to improve understanding of the movement of dust particles having diameters greater than 10 microns (super coarse and giant particles, or SCG dust) in the atmosphere, and make progress towards solving the giant dust particle conundrum. Size-resolved changes in the concentrations of SCG dust during vertical diffusive and horizontal advective transport will be measured. Additionally, the size-resolved vertical flux of SCG dust at the point of emission will also be measured. These measurements will then be used to test two hypotheses that could explain the conundrum: (i) that current theory grossly overestimates dry deposition of these large particles during both vertical turbulent diffusive and horizontal advective transport and (ii) that the flux of SCG dust at emission is one to several orders of magnitude greater than that predicted by theory. These data will provide a unique opportunity to evaluate the theory governing the emission and atmospheric transport of these particles, and to generate new methods to represent these processes in weather and climate models.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
