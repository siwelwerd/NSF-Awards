 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is jointly supported by the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program and the Division of Chemistry Research Instrumentation program. The University of Nevada Reno (UNR) is acquiring a 500 MHz Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectrometer console upgrade equipped with a nitrogen-cooled broadband probe.  This instrument advances research in various scientific domains, including the chemistry of biological interactions, materials science, quantum information science, and sustainability. In general, NMR spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution or in the solid state. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. This instrument enhances the educational, research, and teaching efforts of students at all levels including K-12 outreach and collaborations with national and international institutions.\r\n\r\nThe research enabled by the acquisition of this instrument spans a wide range of areas. The upgraded NMR spectrometer provides enhanced sensitivity and throughput, enabling advanced techniques such as NMR-based metabolomics, eco-metabolomics, and structural characterization of natural products, polymers, and catalysts. This project facilitates groundbreaking research in ecological interactions, energy storage, quantum computing, and the development of sustainable materials, thereby driving innovation and fostering interdisciplinary collaborations. The new instrumentation will support over 20 research programs and benefit 20 established researchers, 70% of whom are NSF-funded, and over 60 students and postdoctoral scholars.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
