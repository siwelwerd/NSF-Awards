 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports participation of graduate students and postdoctoral researchers in the conference \"Upcoming Researchers in Commutative Algebra\" (URiCA) to be held in Lincoln, Nebraska, May 11-12, 2024, and in May 2025. URiCA (formerly known as KUMUNU Jr), is an annual conference hosted by the Department of Mathematics at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln designed to promote visibility and interactions between graduate students and postdocs working in commutative algebra and related fields. \r\n\r\nThe conference will feature ten talks from graduate students and postdocs over the span of two days. These talks will be on original research done in commutative algebra and related fields of mathematics. While URiCA was initially focused on connecting mathematical communities in the Great Plains region, previous success has allowed us to extend our outreach and include more early career researchers from outside this region. The goal of the conference is to help foster a diverse and welcoming community of early researchers leading to increased collaborations and exposure to different areas of research being done in commutative algebra. This conference will continue to provide an opportunity for early researchers and underrepresented groups in math to share their work and gain visibility among their peers.\r\n\r\nConference Website: https://urica-unl.github.io/\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
