 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant will provide partial participants support for the 2024 Great Plains Operator Theory Symposium (GPOTS) conference at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, June 3-7, 2024.  GPOTS is the largest annual national conference in operator algebras and operator theory held in the United States.  Operator algebras and operator theory are major research areas in mathematics, with many connections to other branches of mathematics and with applications across the sciences, particularly to quantum phenomena. Since its beginning in 1981, GPOTS has grown into a major international conference with attendance approximately between 100-150 each year.  Researchers will learn about the latest developments and early-career participants will have the opportunity to share their work and connect with other researchers in this part of Mathematics.\r\n\r\nThe themes of the conference have connections both to many areas of mathematics, including dynamical systems, logic, group theory, ring theory, and to a range of applications, including in quantum phenomena, such quantum computing, and in mathematical physics.  Topics which will be featured at GPOTS 2024 include: C*-algebras, operator spaces, operator theory, non-commutative geometry, von Neumann algebras, and quantum information theory.  Aside from plenary lectures, GPOTS 2024 will have contributed talks, with many given by early-career researchers, graduate students and postdocs.  A significant portion of the proposed funding will be used to support participation by early-career researchers. More information is available at https://math.unl.edu/events/special/gpots2024\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
