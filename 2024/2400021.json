This award to Alabama Agriculture and Mechanical (A&M) University has the potential to enhance our knowledge and understanding of nature from the fundamental elements and interactions to a new quantum world of quarks. This project provides an opportunity to support and train under-represented minority undergraduate and graduate students for becoming the next generation of STEM scientists who can professionally contribute scientific creativity, productivity, and innovation.\r\n\r\nTechnical Abstract: This project seeks to reveal a new quantum world of quarks and explore its mysteries. The investigations are based on the PI\u2019s new thoughts to the fundamental elements and interactions of nature, especially his innovative ideas that the weak force is an interaction between electric and color charges as well as that quarks have only two flavors but multiple excitation states. Questions to be investigated include how the weak force occurs inside a quark, how quarks are excited by the weak force, how excited quarks emit, and how quark-antiquark pairs annihilate to form various particles. The fundamental question also include asking how particles with neutrinos and photons are disintegrated into quark-antiquark pairs to form many more other particles during collisions, how neutrinos oscillate and how photons materialize, and what possible particles can be generated from various combinations and annihilations of quarks and antiquarks that are highly excited to the second, third, or higher excitation states. This study will potentially develop a new quark model for better understanding to the quantum world of quarks, better explaining to observations, and innovative predicting of new particles.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
