 "awd_abstract_narration": "Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM) will host the SIAM Quantum Intersections Convening - Integrating Mathematical Scientists into Quantum Research to bring quantum-curious mathematical scientists together with leading experts in quantum science for a three-day interactive workshop. Recognizing the critical role of mathematical scientists, this convening aims to promote multidisciplinary collaborations that bridge the gap between mathematics and quantum sciences and aims to foster and increase the involvement and visibility of mathematicians and statisticians in quantum science research and education. The convening will be organized by a steering committee and will be supported by professional facilitators. Participants will learn from and connect with physicists, computer scientists, engineers and mathematical scientists who are experts in quantum science. This in-person gathering will be held in fall 2024 in the Washington DC area. A primary deliverable from the convening will be a report summarizing the activities and recommendations generated during the event. Key presentations will be recorded and will be available on a SIAM webpage.  \r\n\r\nSociety for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM) will host this convening with the goals of (i) making more mathematical scientists aware of the demand for their expertise in quantum research and articulating areas and problems where they can contribute, (ii) increasing the participation of researchers in mathematical sciences in the quantum information science revolution to accelerate its research and development, (iii) providing a seeding ground for partnerships and collaborations of mathematical scientists with physicists, computer scientists, and engineers from industry and academia, and (iv) recommending activities to develop a quantum science and technology workforce pipeline in the mathematical and computational sciences. A few topics in quantum science where mathematics can help research and discovery include quantum computing, quantum algorithms, quantum optimization, quantum error corrections, quantum information theory, quantum cryptography, quantum sensing and metrology, and quantum networks.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
