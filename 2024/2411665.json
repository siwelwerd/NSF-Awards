 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract: Probing the Standard Model with the LHCb Detector at the Large Hadron Collider\r\n \r\nFundamental particles and their interactions are described by the Standard Model (SM) of elementary particle physics. Although the SM has been remarkably successful in its ability to describe observations of elementary particles to date, there are good reasons to believe that this model is incomplete, and that some new physics should exist beyond the Standard Model. Proton-proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) can probe the Standard Model at the highest energies ever achieved in the laboratory. This award will support a research program at the University of Cincinnati that takes advantage of the unique capabilities of the LHCb experiment at the LHC to probe SM predictions, and may reveal evidence for new physics beyond the SM.\r\n \r\nThe force-carriers of the Weak interaction are known as W bosons. This award makes the first measurements of the helicity of W bosons and of the production of pairs of W bosons in the forward region at LHC. These measurements will be important tests of the SM theory predictions at the energy frontier.  This award will also study rare decays of B and other mesons and contribute to the future upgrade of the LHCb electromagnetic calorimeter, taking a leading role in development of the calibration system.\r\n \r\nBroader impacts of this research program will arise through efforts to broaden participation in physics, at the high school, undergraduate and graduate levels. The work will seek to inspire more high school students to choose a future in physics by providing students and their teachers with experience of high-energy physics research through participation in the QuarkNet teacher training program. This will also provide opportunities and mentoring for undergraduates to participate in research at the LHC, and we will strive to support students from under-represented groups to pursue graduate degrees in physics.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
