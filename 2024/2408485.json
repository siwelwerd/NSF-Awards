 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) through Targeted Infusion Projects supports the development, implementation, and study of evidence-based, innovative models and approaches for improving the preparation and success of HBCU undergraduate students so that they may pursue science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) graduate programs and/or careers. The goal of this project is to increase the number of students who 1) obtain baccalaureate degrees in STEM disciplines, 2) pursue graduate degrees and or careers in these fields, and 3) enroll in STEM majors at Voorhees University (VU).\r\n\r\nThe project aims to accomplish this goal through the infusion of bioinformatics and biotechnology skills into the VU STEM curriculum. The addition of two new courses, a new laboratory curriculum, and establishment of a new core facility to support research will allow the School of Science, Technology, Health, and Human Services to enhance and expand its interdisciplinary programs. In addition, research internships for students have been integrated into the new course development. The development and implementation of these courses will assist students in the integration of knowledge across the curricula and facilitate the students\u2019 use of current and future computing technologies. This project is a critical first step toward increasing VU\u2019s capability to educate highly skilled STEM graduates who enter graduate studies and/or the STEM workforce in a diverse and increasingly technological society.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
