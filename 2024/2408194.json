 "awd_abstract_narration": "An award is made to the University of South Dakota (USD) to acquire an Oroboros NextGen-O2k all-in-one system for precise, real-time measurements of energy flow in cells. This analyzer is the most cost effective and sensitive instrument available for comprehensive quantitative tracking of energy flow within cells. Acquisition of this instrument will provide new opportunities to students and faculty at USD. The central teaching and outreach goals of this project are three-fold: (1) train the next-generation of scientists, (2) increase participation of underrepresented groups in STEM, and (3) lower institutional barriers to research. The instrument will be used by faculty and students in the Department of Biology and Division of Basic Biomedical Sciences for research and incorporated into four undergraduate courses at USD. The project involves collaboration with Nebraska Indian Community College to increase training and recruitment of Native American students, first generation students, and students from small rural communities. On-site use of the instrument will be extended to five other public universities in the state to develop regional collaborations. Finally, annual workshops for higher-education and industry partners will be held to foster a large user-community. \r\n \r\nThis analyzer uses small samples for measurements on isolated mitochondria, cells or tissue preparations to assess the flow of energy within cells. Immediate research uses include investigating mitochondrial function under genetic stress in invertebrates, mitochondrial adjustments to variable temperatures in birds, mitochondrial function during movement and feeding in lizards, the influence of mitochondrial function on responses to light in plant and animal cells under stress, the influence of mitochondrial function on protein regulation in heart cells, and the role of mitochondria in regulating cell signaling under stressful conditions. Data acquired on the instrument will be used to develop future competitive research proposals and will be disseminated in peer-reviewed publications and at scientific meetings.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
