 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign ADVANCE Adaptation project, I-ADVANCE, will induce positive, sustainable, systemic change for STEM faculty by implementing evidence-based practices that will foster a climate of equity in UIUC\u2019s STEM departments. The project will develop a sustainable, data-driven, systemic change model that removes informational barriers and builds equitable workspaces. Guided by rich institutional data, I-ADVANCE seeks to reduce disparities in recognition and rewards for faculty work; to increase  capacity, resources, and accountability for equity-minded decision making by department leaders; and empowering majority faculty to foster an equitable and inclusive department climate.\r\n\r\nThe project seeks to adapt evidence-based strategies to (1) create a centralized Faculty Workload Dashboard for better transparency and accountability of unrecognized work; (2) educate and develop Faculty Fellows to conduct systemic equity work directly in their home units; and (3) launch an Advocates and Allies network to shift the institutional culture toward one in which everyone contributes to equity and inclusivity. Formative and summative assessment will be conducted by internal and external evaluators, and additional guidance will be provided by internal and external advisory groups. The project can serve as a model for other research-intensive land grant institutions.\r\n\r\nThe NSF ADVANCE program is designed to foster gender equity through a focus on the identification and elimination of organizational barriers that impede the full participation and advancement of diverse faculty in academic institutions.\u202fOrganizational barriers that inhibit equity may exist in policies, processes, practices, and the organizational culture and climate. ADVANCE \u201cAdaptation\u201d awards provide support for the adaptation and adoption of evidence-based strategies to academic, non-profit institutions of higher education as well as non-academic, non-profit organizations.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
