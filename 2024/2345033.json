 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Improving Undergraduate STEM Education: Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSI Program), this Track 1 pilot project aims to expose students to fundamental knowledge of biotechnologies at the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley. There is a considerable and growing demand for a biomanufacturing workforce in the United States. Biomanufacturing serves as a source of high-paying jobs and can support strong supply chains. This project's research-based approach will use active learning practices to involve students in a sequence of engaging experiences across three semesters. Students will take a leading role in identifying a biomanufacturing problem, gathering information from existing sources, conducting research activities, analyzing experimental data, and proposing reasonable solutions. By shifting the emphasis from passive learning to active engagement, this approach aims to encourage STEM participation, collaboration, critical thinking, and the practical application of theoretical knowledge to address real-world research challenges. Students will be equipped with the skills necessary to become problem solvers and enduring learners in a variety of fields.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to foster a knowledgeable, engaged, and empowered workforce committed to applying biomanufacturing technologies to solve challenges in food and agricultural fields. The development of environmentally sustainable and cost-effective methods for upgrading biomass will be introduced as a research theme. Students will gain a comprehensive knowledge of biotechnologies through a twelve-week spring seminar series. They will then spend eight weeks during the summer learning how to design experiments, operate equipment, analyze data, report results, and employ theoretical knowledge to solve real-world problems. Finally, a six-week symposium will be organized in the fall to showcase research discoveries and gather feedback. The project will host a career workshop designed to assist students in preparing for graduate school or the workforce. By engaging in this program, the students will enhance their ability to enter the STEM workforce and make valuable contributions to society. In addition to promoting a sustainable economy, the project intends  to expand STEM students' involvement in biomanufacturing, thereby cultivating their capacity for critical thinking and collaboration. Project evaluation efforts will identify effective practices and allow the project team to refine promising approaches, strengthening the potential for adoption at other institutions. This project is funded by the HSI Program, which aims to enhance undergraduate STEM education, broaden participation in STEM, and build capacity at HSIs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
