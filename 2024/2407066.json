 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is jointly supported by the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) and the Chemistry Research Instrumentation  programs. Kansas State University is acquiring a a powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) with high-temperature, pair distribution function analysis, in-plane grazing incidence X-ray diffraction, small-angle X-ray scattering, and laser/video microscope guided micro-focused PXRD to support the research of Professor Jun Li along with colleagues Daniel Higgins, James Edgar, Ganga Hettiarachchi, and Tendai Gadzikwa. This instrument facilitates research in the areas of nanomaterials, renewable energy, catalysis, separation and chemical/biochemical sensing, polymers, geology, and biology. In general, an X-ray diffractometer allows accurate and precise measurements of the full three-dimensional structure of a molecule, including bond distances and angles, and provides accurate information about the spatial arrangement of a molecule relative to neighboring molecules. The research facilitated by the instrument has profound impacts on a range of critical scientific and technological developments, including those defined as national priorities in the CHIPS Act of 2022 for semiconductor manufacturing in the USA. The instrument supports the training and professional development of ~ 65 young researchers, including postdoctoral associates, graduate students, and undergraduate students. The instrument supports a broad array of existing federally funded projects among the 40 participating research groups by providing new capabilities not presently available within the State of Kansas. Its acquisition will greatly enhance the competitiveness of proposals for new federal and industrial funding from these and other investigators. It will also help Kansas institutions recruit and retain world-class researchers/educators, particularly those from under-represented groups in STEM disciplines. The research groups include scientists from groups underrepresented in STEM and early-career researchers. The instrument helps maintain a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce within the nation.\r\n\r\nThe award is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels, especially in areas such as nanomaterials, renewable energy, catalysis, separation and chemical/biochemical sensing, polymers, geology, and biology. Specifically, the instrument enables research focusing on four cluster areas: (i) developing nanomaterials for renewable energy, catalysis, separation and chemical/biochemical sensing; (ii) exploring highly crystalline, precisely controlled bulk and epitaxial thin films (including large defect free 2D materials) for novel electronics, optoelectronics and next-generation computing; (iii) characterizing material\u2019s nanostructures in colloids, semicrystalline polymers, bio-based construction composites, and supramolecular assemblies in broad hard, soft, and bio-based materials; and (iv) understanding the bioavailability, bio accessibility and stability of nutrient elements and potentially toxic trace elements in minor mineral phases of highly heterogeneous soils and geological samples.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
