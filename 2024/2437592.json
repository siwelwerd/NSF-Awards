 "awd_abstract_narration": "This workshop, set to take place in the spring 2025, at the National University of Singapore, aims to bring together approximately 50 artificial intelligence (AI) experts from the United States (US) and Southeast Asian nations (including Singapore, Malaysia, India, Vietnam, Indonesia, and Thailand). The objective is to facilitate discussions on enhancing collaboration in responsible AI research between Southeast Asia and the US. This interactive workshop will focus on: (1) identifying research gaps and opportunities in responsible AI research across countries to promote potential collaboration between Southeast Asia and the US; and, (2) discussing responsible, use-inspired foundational AI development that can serve in providing crucial elements of future economic development and societal well-being. \r\n\r\nThe multinational workshop will be held at the National University of Singapore (NUS), a globally recognized institution with a strong commitment to fostering advancements in AI.  Key members of the workshop steering committee include leadership and faculty from NUS and Nanyang Institute of Technology, as well as members of industry and government. Insights from the workshop discussions will be captured in a white paper which will include the essential takeaways from the event, providing: (i) a snapshot of the collective knowledge and (ii) recommendations for future directions of research collaboration between US and the Southeast Asian countries in the field of responsible AI. \r\n\r\nThe workshop project is co-funded by the Division of Information and Intelligent Systems (IIS) within the Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE) and the Office of International Science and Engineering at NSF.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
