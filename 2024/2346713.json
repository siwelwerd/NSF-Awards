 "awd_abstract_narration": "This two-year planning effort develops an inclusive vision for sustainable High-Performance Computing (HPC) at Colorado State University to support knowledge discovery in the era of big data.  To accomplish this, a series of campus workshops and planning sessions are being held to foster engagement with stakeholders, as well as broaden participation in data-driven knowledge discovery.  These activities include planning the development of training and educational materials to enhance accessibility of data-intensive computing to the campus community, addressing the integration of new parallel computing technologies with faculty and student research, and strengthening computing partnerships both regionally and nationally.\r\n\r\nIn conjunction with these user targeted activities, there is a simultaneous effort to update the university cyber-infrastructure plan including addressing the transmission, storage, and hosting of large data sets.  An overarching goal of this planning phase is the development of a self-sustaining infrastructure that enables the campus community to cultivate expertise and contribute to workforce development in HPC, an area of national need.  The broader impact of fostering a culture of high-performance computing and data driven discovery at CSU is the enhanced ability of faculty, students and graduates to make fundamental discoveries that improve society, e.g., predictive analytics for pandemic preparedness, climate and weather prediction, food supply through digital soil and crop sciences.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
