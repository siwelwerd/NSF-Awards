 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support to the Ice Drilling Program (IDP) to provide community leadership and to operate and maintain a facility to support ice drilling engineering, field support, and education and outreach. The intellectual merit of this project is embodied in the four closely linked leadership goals of this project which include: 1) producing and maintaining long-term and short-term integrated science and drilling technology plans in collaboration with the U.S. and international ice coring and drilling research communities, 2) providing field support with drilling equipment and expertise to support NSF-funded science, 3) identifying new technology needs and seeking funding for technology development and acquisition, and 4) enhancing communication and information exchange related to ice coring and drilling science and technology within the US and international ice science community. These goals relate to the importance of evidence from the polar ice sheets from ice cores, subglacial bedrock cores, and boreholes to access the subglacial aqueous environment, which has led to many important discoveries that have revolutionized climate science. These discoveries have also had important impacts on policy and thus also have societal relevance. Continued U.S. scientific leadership in this area depends critically not only on the support of scientists doing this research but also on the continued support of a dedicated facility to provide the field drilling support and accomplish engineering and technology development activities. This program and its education and public outreach activities will nurture the inclusion of students of many ages, races, and genders, will help to launch graduate students into promising careers, and the resulting scientific discoveries will benefit all citizens. Achieving the goals of this project will enable the U.S. ice science research community to realize implementation of their national and internationally-coordinated scientific goals, lead the world in ice science discoveries, nurture the education and development of the next generation of scientists and engineers, and help to communicate the importance of the discoveries to all.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
