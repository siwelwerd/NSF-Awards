 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant will fund the acquisition of instrumentation to support the growth of undergraduate research and education in Environmental Biogeochemistry and Mineralogy at La Salle University as well as promote collaboration for undergraduate research in the Philadelphia region. A Rigaku MiniFlex 6G X-ray diffractometer and an IXRF Iridium Ultra Energy-Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy System will enable mineralogical and chemical analysis to understand the cycling of metals between water, minerals, and biota. This information can help inform technologies aimed at treating environmental contaminants. This equipment acquisition will benefit science discovery and society by providing insights into biogeochemical cycling processes which in turn can improve treatment and remediation of environmental contaminants.  Increase of student engagement by providing access and training to this equipment in course work and research projects will enhance undergraduate education across Environmental Science, Biology and Chemistry.\r\n\r\nThe instrumentation purchased with this award will be used to examine (1) how airborne fungi produce calcium-containing minerals (2) ways for toxic lead to be stabilized in Philadelphia soils, and (3) how mineral co-precipitation of barite can remove toxic arsenic and chromium from wastewaters produced from oil and gas operations. In particular, X-ray diffraction will be used to identify minerals produced by fungi in laboratory cultures, minerals in soils collected around contaminated sites in Philadelphia, and minerals co-precipitated with contaminants from simulated fracking wastewaters. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy will be used to map the incorporation of metals into bio-precipitated minerals with fungal biomass, the location of lead in soil minerals and plants grown in contaminated soils, and to map the distribution of arsenic and chromium in barite mineral particles produced from simulated wastewater treatments. Collaborations will also be developed across the Philadelphia region with a focus on affordable, undergraduate access to instrumentation for research.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
