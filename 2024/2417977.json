 "awd_abstract_narration": "The funding is to support research-centered activities for building resilience to extreme events through the Resilient America Roundtable\u2019s convening of experts from academic, public, and private sectors to catalyze innovation at local, regional, national, and international levels. As weather and extreme events become more destructive and costly, there is a need to inform scientific communities, government agencies, and practitioners about current trends, knowledge gaps, and innovative solutions for resilience. The Roundtable is the forum to address this crucial need. Its members, comprised of experts across disciplines and sectors, engage with policymakers, federal agencies, local communities, and practitioners in discussions on resilience and provide advice on program priorities, design, and evaluation. Roundtable meetings, held twice per year, aim to assess the state of resilience planning and implementation across diverse communities; and advance policies, knowledge, and practice that will build resilience and enhance safety, equity, and prosperity of communities across the nation and globally. Notable experts from the resilience field are invited to speak at Roundtable meetings to (1) increase impact and share knowledge, (2) create a valuable opportunity for researchers to connect their work to relevant policies, and (3) be informed by on-the-ground successes and challenges. The Roundtable also helps decision-makers make scientifically informed decisions on how to invest resources to mitigate risk and build resilience.\r\n\r\nThe Resilient America Roundtable provides sound guidance and recommendations towards strengthening community resilience. Reports from Roundtable activities are reviewed and published under National Academies\u2019 procedures and disseminated online and through outreach efforts. Along with recordings, reports, and other resources, the Resilient America Roundtable adds value to current knowledge in resilience by promoting the progress of science, research, and new concepts in resilience and provides global leadership through institutional partnerships and networks.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
