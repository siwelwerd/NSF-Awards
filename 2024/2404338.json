 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the support of the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry (MSN) Program in the Division of Chemistry of the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (German Research Foundation, DFG) under the NSF-DFG Lead Agency Activity in Measurements of Interfacial Systems at Scale with In-situ and Operando aNalysis, Prof. Xingchen Ye of Indiana University and Prof. Michael Engel at Friedrich-Alexander-Universit\u00e4t Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg, Germany, will develop advanced electron microscopy techniques to visualize the growth of nanoparticles in solutions. These nanoparticles are pivotal in various applications, such as medicine, electronics, and clean energy technologies. The collaboration between Indiana University, USA and Friedrich-Alexander-Universit\u00e4t Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg, Germany, aims to unveil atomic level processes underlying nucleation, growth, dissolution, and phase transitions. The broader impacts of this project highlight the synergy between experimentalists and computational scientists, enhancing undergraduate and graduate education through multidisciplinary research. Outreach activities at local science festivals will engage the public, showcasing the significance and excitement of scientific discovery.\r\n\r\nThe objective of this project is to elucidate the atomic-level and nanoscale processes in the formation and transformation of nanocrystals under controlled chemical environments, using multimodal in-situ electron microscopy and multiscale computer simulations. Aim 1 focuses on symmetry breaking and morphology development during the kinetically-controlled synthesis of metal nanocrystals. Aim 2 investigates the structural dynamics and deactivation pathways of nanocrystal electrocatalysts under practical conditions. The developed methods, findings, and insights will facilitate the design of next-generation functional nanocrystals with enhanced properties and stability.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
