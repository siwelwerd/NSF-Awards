 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project addresses challenges in constructing lunar infrastructure, specifically the high costs and risks associated with transporting materials to the Moon, exacerbated by its harsh environment. By utilizing lunar in-situ resources, the project aims to enable sustainable and cost-effective lunar construction, crucial for advancing human exploration of Mars, conducting scientific research, and potentially establishing human settlements beyond Earth. The project focuses on developing Lunar Thermochemically Activated Concrete (LTAC), a non-hydraulic cementitious composite designed to withstand lunar extremes. Aligned with NASA's Lunar Construction Capability Development Roadmap, LTAC is intended for diverse lunar applications including landing pads, habitats, and transportation infrastructure. The project contributes to scientific advancements by improving construction techniques for extraterrestrial environments, supporting national space exploration objectives. Additionally, it aims to enhance educational opportunities in STEM fields and potentially foster societal benefits by promoting sustainable living beyond Earth. This effort ensures American global leadership in space technology through the development of advanced materials, structures, and manufacturing capabilities, as well as facilitating access to extraterrestrial resources.\r\n\r\nThe LTAC utilizes lunar regolith as its primary raw material and employs a novel thermochemical process that combines alkali activation with thermal processing under vacuum conditions.  Research in this fellowship program focuses on designing, developing, and evaluating LTAC, with an emphasis on assessing its microstructural and engineering properties. Computational modeling complements experimental investigations, enhancing the understanding of LTAC synthesis and its performance in lunar environments. Project objectives include formulating LTAC mixture designs and synthesis parameters to meet engineering specifications for lunar construction, refining LTAC properties through rigorous testing under lunar conditions (including temperature variations, thermal cycling, abrasion, and impact), and developing models to optimize LTAC design and predict its performance in lunar settings. Furthermore, the project aims to broaden participation and integrate educational activities by creating research opportunities, outreach programs, and incorporating project outcomes into educational curricula and workforce development initiatives. Collaboration with NASA's Glenn Research Center provides essential support for simulating lunar conditions, including isobaric temperature cycling and impact testing, crucial for evaluating material performance in lunar-like environments. The project's intellectual merits lie in developing a novel thermochemical activation process for casting construction composites using locally sourced materials without water at low temperatures, applicable to both lunar regolith and terrestrial aluminosilicate materials. Integrating regolith derivatives like glass fragments and cast basalt enhances LTAC's structural stability and resilience in lunar settings. The vacuum curing process aligns with lunar construction conditions, aiming to advance lunar construction technology and establish sustainable and resilient infrastructure on the Moon.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
