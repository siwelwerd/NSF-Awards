 "awd_abstract_narration": "NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\n\r\nSupported by the Division of Materials Research at the National Science Foundation, the acquisition of a Phenom Pharos G2 Field Emission Gun \u2013 Variable Pressure Scanning Electron Microscope (FE-VPSEM) will advance science and engineering research and teaching at California Polytechnic State University (Cal Poly).  This microscope will support faculty researchers at Cal Poly and beyond to examine material structures at the micro- and nano-level.  This project includes many unique and transformative research activities that benefit from an FE-VPSEM.  The FE-VPSEM allows for acquisition of structures with 2 nanometer resolution.  The variable pressure aspect of the instrument permits characterization of samples that are either conductive (e.g. metals and semiconductors) or non-conductive (e.g. organic and mineral), broadening the range of applications.  It includes a wide range of detectors.  This suite of detectors provides qualitative (image) and analytical (chemical) data for a wide range of materials. This breadth of signals will allow the instrument to be a truly multi-user facility across four colleges at Cal Poly.  The project brings together faculty and student researchers from diverse fields including engineering, physics, biology, chemistry, entomology, packaging and more.  The project also includes research training at Cal Poly and community colleges on the central coast of California, facilitated by strong relationships with our partner institutions.\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThe research activities enabled by the FE-VPSEM are highly diverse including the study of carbon sequestration nanomaterials, nanoscale colloidal covalent organic frameworks, high entropy alloy design, wearable sensors, amphiphile self-assembly, nano-porous encapsulation, inorganic-organic core-shell nanowires, etc.  For example, one group of researchers will characterize the nanostructures of colloidal synthesized covalent organic frameworks to examine their potential for gas separation applications.  Other groups will explore the use of metal organic frameworks for carbon sequestration and the tailoring of microstructures of high entropy alloys.  The FE-VPSEM will be essential in capturing secondary and backscatter electron images, as well as x-ray energy dispersive spectra, from the above materials.  The FE-VPSEM will be heavily utilized to improve research training at Cal Poly and at our partner institutions including workshops, hands-on courses, summer outreach programs, and remote control by our partners.   Having the FE-VPSEM on Cal Poly\u2019s campus will broaden participation in STEM careers and research among individuals with diverse backgrounds.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
