 "awd_abstract_narration": "Schoolchildren are exposed to hundreds of digital tools each year, many of which are already driven by AI technologies. Parents and teachers must consider how to incorporate these learning tools into their daily lives at a rapid pace. Yet, very little is known about the current use and perceptions of AI among these key stakeholders. This time-sensitive RAPID project will identify the opportunities and challenges that arise for parents, teachers, and youth regarding the use of these AI-driven technologies in K-12 education. Specifically, it will identify risks of generative AI in educational settings and explore opportunities for supporting future design and engagement, including supports for teacher training and regulation in educational contexts. Findings will have theoretical and practical relevance for education, child development, technology design, and policy. Results will also support policymakers as they work to establish guidelines and regulations to protect youth\u2019s privacy, safety, and well-being in the context of AI interactions. Ideally, this work will inform how AI might be used to close versus widen existing disparities and learning gaps in youth. This proposal was received in response to the Dear Colleague Letter (DCL): Rapidly Accelerating Research on Artificial Intelligence in K-12 Education in Formal and Informal Settings (NSF 23-097) and funded by the Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program, which supports projects that build understandings of practices, program elements, contexts and processes contributing to increasing students' knowledge and interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and information and communication technology (ICT) careers.\r\n\r\nThe study employs a large stratified random sample of parents, teachers, and youth across age, gender, socio-economic status, and geographical location. The probability-based nationally representative sample will be drawn from the NORC AmeriSpeak panel. The survey includes both open and close-ended questions that focus on use, perception, and trust in AI systems. Questions will probe how youth engage with generative AI as well as more traditional forms of AI in education, such as personalized and adaptive learning. An embedded experimental manipulation within the survey will test how participants evaluate AI-powered versus non-AI powered educational platforms with respect to usefulness, expertise, and trust. Qualitative interviews augment the survey findings, relying on remote participation to ensure broad geographic representation in a very short time window. Research materials will be made available as part of an online toolkit, enabling multiple investigators to use them across their studies and pool the data for future analyses through an open science approach. This large-scale mixed methods study will generate knowledge to directly inform policy guidelines regarding youth\u2019s safety, privacy, and well-being in AI interactions. It is also positioned to help build design guidelines for AI product developers that prioritize child well-being, learning, and development.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

These technologies are increasingly powered by artificial intelligence. Yet little is known about how parents, educators, and youth themselves perceive and engage with AI. Key questions remain about how youth and adults use AI, the potential risks and benefits they perceive to incorporating AI in their lives, and how these impacts vary across demographic and socioeconomic groups.</p>\r\n<p>To address these open questions, we conducted a national, mixed-methods investigation of parents&rsquo;, teachers&rsquo;, and adolescents&rsquo; perceptions, use, and experiences with generative and more traditional forms of AI. &nbsp;Quantitative data was drawn from two national samples: 1,510 adolescents (ages 9-17) and a probability-based panel of 2,826 parents of K-12 students in the U.S.&nbsp; Qualitative data was collected through focus groups with parents, teachers, and adolescents.</p>\r\n<p>Key findings from this study are described briefly below, with additional details available in published work:</p>\r\n<p><strong>1. Nearly 1 in 2 adolescents reported using ChatGPT or similar applications in the past month, while more specialized tools, such as image generators and mental health chatbots, were less commonly used. </strong>Almost half of adolescents (45%) said they had used ChatGPT or similar applications in the past month. More specialized tools like image generators, AI companions, and mental health chatbots were less frequently used (10-28%). Only 6% of adolescents were unfamiliar with any AI tools (Figure 1).</p>\r\n<p>2.&nbsp;<strong>Adolescents did not report using AI tools frequently in their daily routines. </strong>Adolescents reported using AI tools about once a week on average. Only 17% of adolescents reported using any<em> </em>AI tools daily (7% reported using ChatGPT or similar applications daily). (Figure 2)</p>\r\n<p><strong>3. Most adolescents reported using AI for entertainment or schoolwork. </strong>The most common reasons adolescents reported using AI were for entertainment (72%), homework (63%), and classwork (40%). Fewer adolescents reported using these tools for social connection (30%).</p>\r\n<p><strong>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><strong>Few generative AI users reported negative academic and social impacts resulting from their use of AI. &nbsp;</strong>Among adolescents who reported using generative AI tools in the past (<em>n</em> = 697), most (69%) reported that generative AI had helped them learn something new. Few users reported negative academic or social experiences resulting from their use of generative AI, such as getting into trouble at school or conflicts with parents or peers (&lt; 6%).</p>\r\n<p><strong>5. We did not find strong evidence for an &ldquo;AI divide&rdquo; among adolescents. </strong>Adolescents from lower versus higher SES families reported lower awareness and use of AI tools, and a lower likelihood of adult support in learning to use AI tools (including ChatGPT-platforms). However, these differences were small in magnitude, explaining only 2% to 4% of the variation and no significant SES-related differences were observed across several other AI engagement metrics.</p>\r\n<p><strong>6. AI was largely absent from parents&rsquo; digital practices at home. </strong>Less than a quarter of parents reported that their family used other AI tools in the home. ChatGPT-like applications (24%) and learning applications (19%) were the most commonly used, while virtual friends (7%) and mental health chatbots (1%) were the least used. (Figure 3).</p>\r\n<p><strong>7. Parents&rsquo; perspectives on generative AI varied widely, as did their approaches to integrating AI in family life. </strong>Parents shared their perspectives on generative AI in a series of focus groups. Their views ranged from enthusiasm about its educational benefits and new opportunities for their children to concerns about its potential impacts on children&rsquo;s cognitive, social, and moral development.</p>\r\n<p><strong>8. Parents, teachers, and adolescents showed a general preference for EdTech that involves human tutors over AI-based solutions. </strong>Focus groups and A/B testing with parents, teachers, and adolescents revealed a preference for human involvement in education. Participants emphasized the importance of teacher-student communication and expressed discomfort with the idea of becoming too reliant on AI as an active educator.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;Our findings illustrate the emerging role of AI platforms in the lives of young people and their families. As AI continues to evolve, it will be crucial to monitor young people&rsquo;s use, experiences, and perceptions of AI over time and test for impacts of AI-related policies on youth engagement and related outcomes.</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 01/30/2025<br>\nModified by: Candice&nbsp;Odgers</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2334172/2334172_10904668_1738269362572_NSF_4--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2334172/2334172_10904668_1738269362572_NSF_4--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 2.
