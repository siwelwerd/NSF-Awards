 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is achieved through developing a novel non-surgical method of sterilizing female cats. Unlike traditional spays, this innovation uses a single injection of a small implant to achieve sterilization. The high costs and risks associated with surgically removing reproductive organs often lead cat owners to delay or avoid sterilization, which contributes to cat overpopulation and abandonment. This situation exacerbates the strain on animal shelters and communities, contributing to around 500,000 cats being euthanized annually and an estimated 32 million free-roaming cats across the US. This new approach may address the substantial market of over 2 million female kittens born annually in the US, offering a commercially viable solution to these widespread issues. Additionally, the proposed project is expected to enhance the understanding of reproductive endocrinology in domestic cats, paving the way for future veterinary advancements. In the long term, this product could revolutionize traditional population management approaches and improve the care of companion animals.\r\n\r\nThe proposed project addresses a critical need for a more affordable, less invasive sterilization method for female cats. The main objective of this project is to evaluate the effectiveness of a novel non-surgical method for sterilizing cats, including its effect on fertility and sexual behavior. Female kittens will be treated with three escalating doses and at two different ages to determine the optimal dose range and treatment age. Effectiveness on fertility will be assessed by measuring blood sex hormone concentration, executing histological examination of reproductive organs, and conducting breeding trials. Effectiveness on sexual behavior will be determined by monitoring their reproductive cycles and assessing their mating behaviors in the presence of proven male cats. This treatment is expected to cause infertility by irreversibly inactivating reproductive neurons in the hypothalamus that play a critical role in fertility in the female cat. The proposed study aims to accomplish two goals: refine the product to suit the unique metabolic and reproductive traits of female cats and provide evidence of its effectiveness and safety to initiate regulatory approval.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
