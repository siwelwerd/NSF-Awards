 "awd_abstract_narration": "The International Symposium on Microarchitecture (MICRO), sponsored by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) and the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), is widely recognized as a premier forum for disseminating cutting-edge ideas and innovations in the field of computer architecture. MICRO brings together a diverse group of researchers in areas spanning computer hardware/software/hybrid design, systems, chips, and compilers to facilitate interactions and advance the state-of-the-art in computing research and emerging areas. This grant seeks to broaden student participation at MICRO 2024 to be held in Austin, Texas on November 2-6 along with a series of co-located workshops on related topics. The travel fund will provide students with valuable exposure to new ideas and opportunities to engage with leading experts in their fields. It will advance computer systems design education and research in academia, cultivating a strong workforce to tackle the intersection of technological and societal problems that lie ahead. \r\n\r\nThis award will provide travel support for at least 25 US-based students attending MICRO 2024 by helping defray a portion of their travel, lodging, and attendance expenses. Each awardee will receive approximately $600 of support, subject to their individual needs. This fund especially focuses on increasing institutional, geographic, and demographic diversity and balances the participation of students who are first-time attendees, lack existing travel support, women, underrepresented group members, and students with disabilities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
