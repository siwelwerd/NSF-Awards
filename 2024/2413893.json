 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supports a select group of United States-based doctoral students to participate in the Sixth and Seventh AAAI/ACM Conference on AI, Ethics, and Society (AIES\u201923, and potentially AIES\u201924). The growing presence of artificial intelligence in various aspects of human life, from our homes to how we access information and engage in political processes, underscores its significance. The decisions made by technologists today will significantly influence the future, shaping what becomes normal and possible. To comprehensively and responsibly address the current and future implications of AI, it is essential for technologists to engage not only with their peers but also with thinkers and experts in the humanities and social sciences. \r\n\r\nThis conference will bring doctoral students together with experts across fields to network and present their research. Since its establishment in 2018, AIES has been a highly successful platform for such interdisciplinary conversations. A pivotal aspect of this conference is the student track, providing students with an entry point to actively participate. By offering structured opportunities to interact with the diverse group of scholars attending AIES, the student track aims to be a stimulating experience. Additionally, by making this conference accessible to students, especially those from underrepresented backgrounds, the student program aims to cultivate long-term interest in pursuing research-oriented careers related to AI. In summary, this grant facilitates the involvement of US-based Ph.D. students in the AIES conference, fostering crucial interdisciplinary discussions on AI's impact on society and encouraging diverse students to engage in AI research for the future.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
