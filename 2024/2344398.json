 "awd_abstract_narration": "The overarching goal of the project is to develop a portable fit-for-purpose water purification system to address water insecurity. Such a system would circumvent limitations in regions where there is limited basic water infrastructure and water quality monitoring, or frequent shortages or interruptions caused by environmental events or natural disasters, such as drought and hurricanes. Water insecurity and insufficient water quality are detrimental to social and economic growth, especially in regions like Puerto Rico and Colonias near the U.S.-Mexico border. The young population is compelled to migrate away from these areas to seek better living conditions and employment, while the elderly who are unable to leave, are subjected to deteriorating living conditions, which result in poor mental and physical health. A fit-for-purpose water purification system will alleviate some of the water insecurity burden in these regions and in turn, address these resulting issues. \r\n\r\nThe few portable membrane-based water purification systems that are commercially available require continuous maintenance, high-pressure, and water preconditioning steps, which limit deployment flexibility and increase cost. This two-phase project aims to develop a portable, membrane-free water purification and monitoring system where no water preconditioning is necessary, and the removal of salts and contaminants is achieved using an electric field. The specific technology employed has the distinct advantage that the rate of water output can be readily scaled to meet demand. The focus of Phase 1 is to determine community needs and demonstrate feasibility of the proposed technology. First, by bringing together various stakeholders, the research will evaluate the landscape of water insecurity in impacted regions and identify key variables, needs, and design preferences that will guide the development of a pre-prototype device. Second, a coupled computational and experimental approach will expedite technology development and demonstrate practical feasibility. Third, a recently developed sensing technology amenable to point-of-need applications will be adapted for in-line continuous monitoring of water contaminants identified by stakeholders as being high priority. Lastly, Phase 1 of the proposed project will identify key partnerships for further advancement of technology and its adaptation in the field in Phase 2.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
