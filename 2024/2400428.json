 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-technical Abstract: As data protection is a growing concern globally, there is much work devoted to investigating user attitudes, beliefs, and expectations towards the data collected and used by smart technology. However, the literature is sporadic and not sufficient for interested stakeholders to gather relevant information to design, develop, and implement tools and strategies to protect users. As the United States government seeks to establish a federal privacy law, states are introducing and enacting laws to protect their constituencies. The findings of this project can provide insight into the concerns of individuals living in the United States and provide recommendations for inclusive policies, laws, and regulations to protect individuals and the data collected by smart technology and their devices. This research at a Historically Black College or University allows minority and underrepresented undergraduate students to engage in and advance interdisciplinary research at local and national levels.  \r\n\r\nTechnical Abstract: The project seeks to provide a comprehensive overview of the state of smart technology privacy studies and examine whether any disparities. Specifically, the research team will evaluate whether there are any underexplored device types or underrepresented demographic groups such as based on race, ethnicity, gender or age in smart technology privacy studies. If there are any underexplored devices or underrepresented groups, the team will explore the related privacy concerns. The research is split into two major components to accomplish its goals. First, complete a systematic literature review to reveal trends, uncover gaps, and deliver a demographic profile of participants. Second, conduct user studies such as online surveys, interviews or focus groups according to the gaps discovered during the literature review. The knowledge from this project can support smart technology device manufacturers, developers, and researchers, contribute to the global and national privacy discussion, and inform privacy-related policies and laws.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
