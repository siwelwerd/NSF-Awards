 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Sustainable Nanotechnology Organization Conference is an annual event dedicated entirely to promoting sustainable nanotechnology that engages experts and early career researchers from around the world. For 2024, the conference has two main goals: (1) to share the latest knowledge and (2) to encourage in-depth discussions on how nanotechnology can help address important challenges in the 21st century, especially those related to the environment and human health. Seven prominent experts from various fields, including science, engineering, medicine, and agriculture, will deliver keynote or plenary speeches. There will also be discussions and presentations about the role of nanotechnology in topics with societal impacts including climate change, infrastructure, energy, and agriculture. To promote sustainable nanotechnology, the presentations and discussions will emphasize how nanomaterials behave in the environment, and their impact on the environment and human health. In addition to bringing together experts from various fields, the conference is a platform for people at all stages of their careers, from students to accomplished professors, as well as nanotechnology stakeholders from academic institutions, government agencies, and industry. It is anticipated that 200 students and experienced scholars will attend the conference. The conference organizers aim to increase access to science and nanotechnology, enhance diversity in science, and create an inclusive culture among researchers and other stakeholders in sustainable nanotechnology.\r\n\r\nThe Sustainable Nanotechnology Organization Conference is exclusively devoted to sustainable nanotechnology, bringing together experts and young researchers from across the nation. The 2024 conference will address pressing issues with significant societal impacts, including climate change, infrastructure, energy, and agriculture, and the role sustainable nanotechnology can play in addressing these issues. There will be seven plenary or keynote talks by an outstanding and diverse group of experts from various fields of science, engineering, medicine, and agriculture. Conference participants will contribute through oral technical sessions and poster presentations. To promote integration of sustainability in the applications of nanotechnology, presentations and discussions will also focus on environmental fate, transport, and exposure as well as human health impacts of nanomaterials. This exchange of ideas by experts from different fields of knowledge will continue to catalyze the realization of the potential of nanotechnology while minimizing unintended consequences. Efforts are being made to ensure the conference has solid representation and participation from underrepresented groups in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. The conference is expected to be attended by up to 200 students and experienced scholars, who will share ideas, develop collaborations, and help chart a path forward in sustainable nanotechnology. The conference organizers aim to increase access to science and nanotechnology, enhance diversity in science, and create an inclusive culture among researchers and other stakeholders in the area of sustainable nanotechnology.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
