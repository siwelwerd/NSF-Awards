 "awd_abstract_narration": "This EArly-concept Grants for Exploratory Research (EAGER) award is made in response to Dear Colleague Letter 23-109, as part of the NSF-wide Clean Energy Technology initiative. As an energy carrier that cuts across sectors, natural geologic hydrogen could serve as a future clean energy source. This project focuses on the exploration and characterization of new hydrogen resources in the United States, and innovative education and workforce developments to meet the demand for future careers in clean energy. The researchers build a model for hydrogen generation potential from iron-rich rocks by identifying hydrogen-producing reactions, testing their geographic extent, and building a scalable workflow for hydrogen resource exploration. To expand clean energy education experiences and contribute to workforce development, the researchers will create introductory experiential learning opportunities focused on the role of Earth science in clean energy futures and will expand upper level undergraduate research opportunities through course-based research relating to hydrogen as a future energy source. Additionally, team will facilitate discussions between academia and industry through a clean energy symposium, and will connect students to employers for on-the-job training in sustainable geoscience research, thereby providing students with training for future clean energy careers.\r\n\r\nThe project identifies and characterizes new natural hydrogen resources in the United States and gauges the natural hydrogen production potential of iron-rich rocks. This is the first-time natural hydrogen generation through low temperature oxidation reactions is practically tested in iron-rich geologic units in the United States. Quantification of hydrogen-producing reactions in iron-rich rocks in drill cores from across the mid-continent of the United States requires application of a multi-method, multi-scale workflow. The researchers quantify hydrogen generation potential of iron-rich rocks by calculating the total reduced iron remaining in the rock unit that has the capacity to react with subsurface fluids which requires (1) determination of mineral oxidation reactions, mineral volumes, and iron valency; (2) measurement of oxidation-reduction potential of regional subsurface fluids in direct contact with iron-rich rocks, (3) direct measurement of hydrogen gas in boreholes that intersect iron-rich rocks; and (4) identification of microbial hydrogen consumption. Subsequent tasks involve mapping of gas and fluid migration paths to quantify regional hydrogen transport and storage and determining regional trap and seal potential through application of geospatial and geophysical data analysis. The research provides foundational datasets required to systematically assess the potential for large-scale domestic hydrogen production and usage.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
