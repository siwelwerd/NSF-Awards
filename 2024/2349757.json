 "awd_abstract_narration": "This REU Site award to the University of California, Merced, located in Merced, CA, will support the training of 10 students for 10 weeks during the summers of 2024-2026. It is anticipated that a total of 30 students, primarily from schools with limited research opportunities or from underrepresented groups, will be trained in the program. The knowledge generated through the undergraduate research projects will impact a variety of scientific disciplines including biophysics, biochemistry, biology, and bioengineering and pave the way for applications that benefit society while also providing students with valuable training and professional exposure during a pivotal stage in their journeys toward careers in STEM fields. Students will discover how scientific, interdisciplinary research is conducted, and many will present the results of their summer experiences at scientific conferences. Assessment of this program will be done through an online tool. Students should apply to the REU site using NSF ETAP (Education and Training Application: https://etap.nsf.gov). \r\n\r\nTransformative advances in bio-related fields require\u202fcontributions from multidisciplinary teams and the REU Site has dedicated faculty with active, collaborative research programs in biophysics, biochemistry, molecular biology, developmental biology, biomaterials, and bioengineering. Students will carry out research projects ranging from studying the mechanisms of circadian clocks and cancer cell migration to the design and characterization of novel biosensors, antibacterial hydrogels, and responsive drug delivery systems. In addition to the immersive research in multidisciplinary research teams, the program will provide hands-on training in various laboratory techniques; focused professional development including communication, graduate school preparation, and ethics/responsible conduct of research; career pathways sessions with professionals from industry; and community building events such as trips to nearby Yosemite, followed by reinforcement through conference presentations. The REU Site will integrate holistic assessment to ensure a beneficial experience for all participants and mentors. Stipends, housing, and meals, as well as funds for post-program conference travel, will be provided. This REU Site is supported by the Division of Equity for Excellence in STEM (EES) in the Directorate for STEM Education (EDU) and the Division for Biological Infrastructure (DBI) in the Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
