 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Computer Science (CS) Department at Oklahoma State University is launching the SecurAIty Nexus, a new RET site for research and education focused on security and artificial intelligence (AI). This project fosters collaboration between STEM teachers and university experts to advance AI and security education. It aims to help teachers in training programs, community colleges, and high schools teach AI and security concepts, addressing the gap where high school students often struggle with college-level courses and the lack of CS teacher certification in Oklahoma. The SecurAIty Nexus will encourage creation of well-rounded course integrations that better prepare high school students for higher education, while through regular communication and meetings, the participants will share strategies and technologies to enhance student engagement and support students with special needs. By integrating cutting-edge tech fundamentals and partnering with industry experts, the SecurAIty Nexus seeks to build a capable workforce knowledgeable in AI and security, promoting scientific progress and innovation. The project also aims to improve access to tech jobs for Oklahoma's diverse and rural populations, benefiting the community. Participants will explore AI in healthcare, learning how it can improve diagnostics, treatments, data privacy, and security. They will also learn about system vulnerabilities and ethical AI use, focusing on critical systems like communications networks and healthcare infrastructure. This initiative will support diversity, inclusion, and equal opportunities in STEM education, ensuring that all students, especially those from disadvantaged backgrounds, have access to quality tech education and future job opportunities.\r\n \r\nThe site\u2019s research projects focus on integrating AI and security technologies into STEM education to enhance teachers' skills and benefit students. Methodologically, they utilize machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing, simulations, and network analysis to develop and validate solutions, leveraging tools like network simulators, social media analysis platforms, image processing software, and blockchain technology. These projects cover diverse areas such as vehicular network security, social media polarization, soil moisture prediction, and cyber threat intelligence, contributing to technological innovation and practical solutions to real-world problems. By providing hands-on experience, these projects prepare teachers to integrate advanced technologies into their curricula, thereby addressing the diverse needs of Oklahoma's population and promoting equitable access to technological advancements. Furthermore, industry collaboration with Paycom and OSU\u2019s Center for Health Systems Innovation enhances teachers' practical skills and problem-solving capabilities, ensuring a comprehensive and impactful STEM education framework.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
