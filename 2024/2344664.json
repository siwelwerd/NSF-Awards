 "awd_abstract_narration": "Electrical power converters are critical to a wide range of applications from renewable integration to transportation electrification and can be a key factor in determining the size, weight, and efficiency of all types of energy conversion systems. Magnetic components are typically the largest and least efficient components in power electronics. While there have been major strides in the development of wide-bandgap (WBG) semiconductor devices and circuit topologies, the necessary advances in the modeling and design of complex power magnetic components are lagging. This project will conduct fundamental research on the magnetics modeling theory for linear and non-linear micro- and macro-scale behavior analysis of power magnetics. The linear electromagnetic field and current distribution in windings, and the non-linear hysteresis of power magnetic core materials will be modeled under a unified framework, targeting sophisticated magnetic structures with matrix coupled flux and non-uniform flux distribution. Methods will be developed to characterize the complex behavior of electromagnetic hysteresis in the magnetic materials and model the way they impact the field and current distribution in magnetic components. The outcomes of this project include 1) a systematic method for modeling and designing complex multi-winding power magnetics; 2) a family of software tools for optimal design of power magnetics; and 3) a group of design examples to demonstrate and validate the effectiveness of the new modeling approach. These outcomes will make the magnetic components in future electric vehicles, computers, renewable energy systems more compact, more efficient, and be able to perform more sophisticated functions. \r\n\r\nWith the theories and methodologies developed in this project, sophisticated magnetic components can be designed and simulated with high accuracy, and fully unlock the potential of WBG devices. This will increase energy efficiency, reduce emissions, and create new societal opportunities. We will work to ensure this outcome by disseminating the results in education, research, and commercialization. There will be impact on research experiences and training of engineering students. Research will be conducted by both undergraduate and graduate students, strengthening their skills in this important area, with participation of under-represented groups especially encouraged. The outcomes of this research will be embedded into the MagNet Project \u2013 an international open-source magnetics community effort.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
