 "awd_abstract_narration": "The fourth workshop on Figurative Language Processing, a multidisciplinary event will take place in conjunction with the NAACL 2024 conference in Mexico City, Mexico. The workshop aims to foster advancements in the computational understanding of figurative language. It will integrate various computational, cognitive, and linguistic perspectives, focusing on both theoretical and applied methodologies. It will contribute to understanding how advanced language models can interpret and generate figurative language, impacting fields like sentiment analysis, creative writing, and digital humanities. The event will feature keynote speakers, panel discussions, shared tasks, and paper presentations, creating a platform for exchanging cutting-edge research and fostering collaborations among researchers from diverse fields such as NLP, psycholinguistics, neurolinguistics, and education. The shared tasks, involving multilingual euphemism detection and visual entailment, are designed to push the boundaries of current technology and stimulate innovation.\r\n\r\nBy encouraging the participation of students, especially those from underrepresented groups, and offering travel stipends, the event aims to promote diversity and inclusivity in scientific research. The interdisciplinary nature of the workshop will help bridge gaps between different research communities, enhancing cross-disciplinary understanding and collaboration. The knowledge generated from this workshop has the potential to influence various societal applications, from improving AI-driven communication tools to enhancing our understanding of language's role in human interaction and culture. The dissemination of findings through publications and a dedicated workshop page will ensure that the benefits of this research extend beyond the immediate participants, contributing to broader societal advancements in technology and education.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
