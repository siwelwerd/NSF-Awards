 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award from the Condensed Matter Physics program supports the attendance of early career scientists and students at the 2024 Gordon Research Conference (GRC) and Gordon Research Seminar on Research at High Pressure, with an emphasis on  Exploring Matter Beyond Equilibrium. The biennial GRC brings together world experts and young scientists in a broad range of fields. Sessions on matter out of equilibrium, hydrides, the deep Earth, the machine learning revolution in materials computation, new experimental probes, and astrophysics will be held. A novel feature will be a session highlighting the technological applications of high-pressure research \u2013 for example the barocaloric materials for sustainable cooling. All the events are designed to provide an opportunity for friendly, yet high-level scientific discussions among participants crossing all levels of experience and influence.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
