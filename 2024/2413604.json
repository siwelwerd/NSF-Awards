 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 6th Cincinnati Symposium on Probability will take place on May 1-4, 2024 at the University of Cincinnati, Ohio (earlier Cincinnati Symposia took place in 2018, 2014, 2009, 1986, and 1985). This year's symposium will highlight 16 senior invited speakers, 7 junior invited speakers, and a poster session for other junior participants, hosting a total of around 70 participants. The first major goal is to bring leading experts on stochastic processes with weak dependence and stochastic models in mathematical physics to Cincinnati; they will present their latest results. Several invited speakers are from Europe and Asia, and their presence will be much appreciated by junior probabilists in the midwest. The second major goal is to provide graduate students and postdocs in probability a platform to present their own results and establish connections with well-established scholars. All non-speaking and junior participants are encouraged to present their research results in the poster session. Last but not least, the organizing committee is committed to diversity and will ensure that conference attendees reflect the populations of graduate students and new researchers who form the primary audience of the conference.\r\n\r\nThe two main themes of the symposium are stochastic processes with weak dependence and stochastic models in mathematical physics. Stochastic processes with weak dependence have a long history in the development of probability theory and its applications, particularly in statistics. Recently several key techniques have found new applications in other mathematical areas, including random fields, random matrices, and random walks on groups. Such extensions will also be showcased by the talks of invited speakers. Mathematical physics has been another source of main motivations for the development of probability theory, and invited speakers will present latest results on selected models from random motions in random media and integrable probability. The Symposium website is https://homepages.uc.edu/~wangyz/CSP2024/index.html\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
