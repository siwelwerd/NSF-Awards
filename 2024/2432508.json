 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact of this I-Corps project is based on the development of an ultra-flexible, liposomal, lidocaine gel. This innovative product addresses the limitations of current topical anesthetics by providing a more rapid onset of numbing and deeper tissue penetration. The enhanced efficiency can significantly improve patient comfort and clinical workflows, particularly in settings like dermatology and minor surgical procedures where quick pain relief is essential. Commercially, the gel reduces procedural delays and increases the throughput of a medical practices, thereby enhancing overall healthcare efficiency. \r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. The solution is based on the development of a novel liposomal drug delivery platform. The core technology involves ultra-flexible liposomes capable of penetrating skin barriers more efficiently than current products, delivering lidocaine directly to pain receptors for quicker and longer-lasting relief. The research underpinning this project demonstrated the liposomes' enhanced skin permeability and efficacy in preclinical models, showing significant improvements over existing formulations. This technological advance not only promises to elevate the standard of care in pain management but also sets the stage for future applications of the liposomal delivery system in other therapeutic areas.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
