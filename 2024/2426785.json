 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports participants in the 2024 Midwestern Workshop on Asymptotic Analysis, scheduled to take place in October 2024 at Indiana University. The goal of the conference is to disseminate research advances and to foster cooperation among researchers working in various areas of analysis and partial differential equations, particularly from colleges and universities in the midwest.  Special emphasis is placed on attracting graduate students, both as participants and as speakers, to encourage the professional development of early-career scholars in various areas of mathematical analysis with both academic and industry applications.\r\n\r\nMajor research themes to be addressed during the meeting include approximation theory, functional analysis, harmonic analysis, mathematical physics, potential theory and several complex variables. The event starts with a Friday afternoon colloquium talk by a senior researcher, and continues on Saturday and Sunday with an additional ten talks by researchers working in the above fields. All of the Saturday and Sunday talks will be given by early career researchers, including junior faculty, postdocs, and graduate students. The conference will also feature a poster session where other beginning researchers in analysis can publicize their work.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
