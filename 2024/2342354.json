 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of a deformable uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) with vertical take-off and landing capabilities that may be used for aerial imaging, surveillance, and cooperative payload transport applications. The proposed technology will demonstrate long-duration, energy-efficient, and zero-emission flight at low-altitude airspace to support the United Nations\u2019 goal of zero emissions in aviation by the year 2050. The proposed deformable UAV can aggressively deform to pass through narrow passages. This unique capability may benefit under-canopy operations, such as crop sensing and disease detection. In addition, the proposed UAV offers a solution for payload delivery in urban areas. For example, it may be used to transport medical supplies between health centers or carry commodities and first aid supplies into difficult-to-access areas during a natural disaster. Other applications include industrial applications, environmental monitoring, and defense-related applications such as combat, surveillance, and reconnaissance operations.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on the development of a continuum-deformable multi-copter-based uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV), or \u201cCDCU,\u201d to transport payloads at low altitude airspace. The proposed technology is designed to aggressively change its shape, which makes it resilient to conditions in real-world, obstacle-laden motion spaces. Current multi-copter UAVs struggle to cope with large disturbance forces during inclement weather conditions. By being aggressively deformable, the proposed CDCU resiliently operates in the presence of inclement weather conditions. In addition to aggressive planar deformation, the proposed CDCU is designed to offer the essential structural rigidity in every plane normal to this deformation plane for robustness of operations during inclement weather. Due to the multiple quadcopter design, the CDCU may be resilient against failure and recover safely.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
