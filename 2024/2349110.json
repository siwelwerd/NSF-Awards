 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will provide renewed funding of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site. The REU program will be offered annually to fifteen qualified applicants in three locations: Socorro, NM; Green Bank, WV; and Charlottesville, VA. These sites are the headquarters for the operations of the Very Large Array (VLA) and Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA), Green Bank Telescope (GBT), and Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), respectively. Students will perform cutting-edge research in several areas, including all fields of astronomy (cosmology, extragalactic, galactic, stellar, solar system, astrochemistry, pulsars, etc.), as well as astronomical engineering and computing. In addition to their assigned research project, all students participate in a hands-on observing experience using the NRAO GBT, VLA, and/or VLBA.\r\n\r\nThe award will enable a pipeline of skilled scientists and engineers to be developed in the field of radio astronomy, which is critical for the infrastructure of NSF-funded facilities. The program has also demonstrated its effectiveness in retaining students in STEM fields: indeed, over 300 past participants remain in the field of astronomy. Finally, participants also receive instruction and experience with communicating their scientific research through oral and written presentation of their research project results, including the opportunity to present their research at a professional meeting following their appointment.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
