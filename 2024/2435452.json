 "awd_abstract_narration": "The AI Inspirations conference focuses on emerging research and current developments in artificial intelligence (AI). This conference will identify cross-sector and cross-agency efforts within the domain of AI research and development (R&D) as they relate to both societal and economic impact as well as national security. In addition, this event aims to be responsive to the recent White House Executive Order on the Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence (AI EO). \r\n\r\nJohns Hopkins University (JHU) will convene 300 science and technology leaders, policymakers, and researchers to share current efforts in AI R&D and identify effective strategies related to AI R&D translation within the U.S. The proposed event will consist of panel discussions on critical topics, technical demonstrations, and plenary sessions designed to showcase and further accelerate the development of responsible and secure AI solutions. Topics to be discussed during this conference will include accurate weather forecasts, resilient power grids, accelerated drug development, personalized didactive learning tools, transformative infrastructure, rapid design of materials for semiconductor manufacturing, and effective/efficient government services.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
