 "awd_abstract_narration": "Educators strive to incorporate meaningful and translatable skills that both engage their students in current research and prepare them for careers in microbiome science. In an effort to support instructors, the Microbiome Workforce Development program was established using modular, reproducible scientific method-based training materials designed to be readily incorporated into existing microbiology and bioinformatics courses. Undergraduate educators and collaborating programs developed these modules and training materials to overcome commonly identified barriers and challenges to teaching microbiome research skills across a range of institution types, specifically addressing resource access and affordability, instructor training, effort to implement new concepts, and student engagement. The Microbiomes in Computational Research Opportunities Network (MICROnet) RCN-UBE is focused on facilitating the growth and diversification of an educator network to incorporate MICROnet resources at a range of institutions, build regional networks to support and sustain growth, and evaluate program modules for continued improvement. Supporting instructors at diverse institutions makes for more inclusive training of the next generation of researchers capable of answering current questions and generating open data to address future grand challenges. \r\n\r\nMICROnet will enable a greater distribution of Microbiome Workforce Development materials through regional networks of instructors and institutions implementing the modules. In building regional hubs, the network will form an inclusive, robust, self-sustaining community of educators that provide peer-led training, resource distribution, and opportunities for local collaboration across institutions. With broader use of the program, MICROnet will assess all five scientific method-based modules: Research Question and Hypothesis Development, Experimental Design and Sample Metadata, Sample Collection and Processing, Data Analysis, and Conclusions and Publishing. Evaluation focuses on accessibility and feasibility of use across a range of institutions, as well as student interest and engagement. Feedback from participants, students and educators, enables the program to evolve with community needs through an iterative development of materials and training, while ensuring MICROnet provides an equitable approach to teaching microbiome science. This project is being jointly funded by the Directorate for Biological Sciences, Division of Biological Infrastructure, and the Directorate for STEM Education, Division of Undergraduate Education as part of their efforts to address the challenges posed in Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology Education: A Call to Action (http://visionandchange/finalreport/).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
