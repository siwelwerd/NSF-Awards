 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of a system for assessment of cardiovascular physiology so that training programs may be targeted at a level to maximize performance.  There are both central and local physiological mechanisms that operate to regulate blood flow in working muscle tissue.  Currently, there is no mechanism whereby the balance between central and local control can be assessed and optimized.   To assess these mechanisms, both cardiac and vascular function must be measured.  The proposed technology allows the combination of both sets of measures in an algorithm and testing procedure to assess cardiovascular functionality. With this information, training or treatment plans may be optimized to address the underlying limitations in achieving maximum performance.\r\n \r\nThis I-Corps project is based on the development of an algorithm to assess cardiovascular function by calculating the determinants of working tissue flow during exercise.  Critical to this algorithm is the measurement of both central (neurological) and local (metabolic) control of blood flow.  This is achieved by measuring pulse arterial responses to restrictions in blood flow, using a blood pressure cuff, and to stimulation through exercise.  The proposed method assesses local dilation, autonomic constriction, and total cardiac function.  These measurements may be used to determine how well both the heart and the blood vessels are performing.  Exercise increases the output of the heart but the blood vessels in the working muscles need to relax to allow more blood to flow.  If an athlete trains to increase heart output but does not increase the ability to relax blood vessels, then they will not optimize working tissue flow and hence performance.  Using the proposed algorithm, it may be possible to tell the athlete where they are limited and how to train to improve that limitation.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
