 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-technical abstract: The advancement of human society is closely linked to the discovery, understanding, and application of materials. Throughout history, epochs have been categorized based on the materials, such as the stone age, bronze age, and iron age. Current era stands on the edge of the silicon age, characterized by the rapid growth of the semiconductor industry. However, a new category of materials, known as quantum materials, is emerging and is destined to become as familiar as silicon. These materials, crucial for future technologies like quantum computers, exhibit quantum effects across various energy and length scales, resulting in unique properties. Despite their potential, understanding of quantum materials remains limited. This research project is centered around the manipulation of quantum materials through uniaxial pressure to explore various 'emergent' phenomena. This approach aims to enhance the understanding of how the lattice influences the correlation in quantum materials, a fundamental yet crucial aspect of material science. Through integrated education and outreach efforts, this project trains students as the next generation of leaders in science through cutting-edge quantum materials research. Collaborations with the Museum of Natural History and Women in Science and Engineering at the University of Michigan enable effective engagement with the public and particularly underrepresented groups in science. As a result, this research project not only aims to push the boundaries of knowledge in quantum materials but also seeks to inspire and empower a diverse community of scientists, making significant contributions to the advancement of science and technology.\r\n\r\nTechnical abstract: A major question in basic physical research is how to understand the collective behavior of interacting quantum objects that cannot be treated as non-interacting particles. In condensed matter physics, material systems consisting of numerous atoms, can be simplified by periodic potentials and Coulomb interactions. However, this simplest model often fails to capture the true nature of interactions. Alternatively, one can explore 'emergent' phenomena. Specifically, complex quantum materials, characterized by strong many-body interactions, offer an ideal platform to investigate fascinating phenomena. Additionally, the four fundamental degrees of freedom\u2014lattice, charge, orbital, and spin\u2014provide extensive tunability of exotic properties, leading to rich phase diagrams for correlated systems. Applying stress to a material represents a novel approach to manipulating its four fundamental degrees of freedom and symmetry, free from complexities arising from atomic substitutions. This research project aims to advance the understanding of correlated behaviors in quantum materials by probing electronic structure changes using recently developed modern uniaxial stress devices. The proposed research is organized into four key thrusts: 1) Investigating the strain effect on orbital mixing in a heavy fermion system. 2) Controlling magnetism through strain manipulation in an anisotropic 2D magnet. 3) Unraveling strain-induced emergent phenomena in quantum materials. 4) Discovering new correlated materials with potential for sensitive strain tuning. These research projects represent promising avenues for enhancing the comprehension of quantum materials and exploring their potential applications across various fields.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
