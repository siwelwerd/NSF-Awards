 "awd_abstract_narration": "By collecting and storing genes from important wildlife now while these wildlife populations are under current threat of diminishment and possible extinction, current conservation practice can support efforts of future generations to restore these populations and/or explore them for potential benefits for the ecosystem. This project explores the proactive, large-scale storage of the genes of wildlife of cultural, conservation, and scientific significance. The approach seeks a unified mode for collecting, storing, and recording collections, based on a consultative process that honors the intentions, preferences, and priorities of local communities, including and especially Indigenous populations. The aims of the project include: 1) exploration of minimally-invasive sampling and storage of genetic samples from American red fox and American pine marten in the Great Lakes region; 2) evaluation of the generation of induced pluripotent cells (iPSCs) from these samples, a key technique to support species recovery; 3) evaluation of storage techniques (pooled-sample approaches) to reduce space and energy consumption; 4) execution of consultative engagements with communities, including Indigenous partners to evaluate the role of such technologies, if any, in local conservation planning, and to develop a unified system for recording and communicating collections, and 5) provision of training and instrumentation for communities to collect, process and store data for their own purposes, to assure self-determination.\r\n\r\nThe project will conduct preliminary fieldwork to collect 15 minimally invasive genetic samples from red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) and American martens (Martes americana) in the Great Lakes Region. The samples will be used to identify technical gaps in generating induced pluripotent cells (iPSC) (i.e., reprogrammable cells that preserve genetic diversity) and to assess the coverage of genetic variation in the biosamples relative to the wild population. This proof-of-concept study will also identify technical gaps in long-term cryogenic preservation of biosamples and procedures to re-isolate single iPSC clones representing sampled individuals. We will further develop and deploy an ethical framework that honors Traditional Knowledge, Indigenous Data Sovereignty (IDS) principles, and public trust. The project will host a series of workshops, convening diverse publics from the Great Lakes region, including Sovereign Native Nations, to discuss and develop: 1) Data sovereignty principles as they apply to genetic material, 2) Governance guidelines for data sharing, storage and ownership of genetic information; 3) Training and infrastructure needs of communities and sovereigns related to genetic data management, 4) Biosampling decision making. Workshop results will include action plans for policy, training and educational needs, and guidelines for collaboration.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
