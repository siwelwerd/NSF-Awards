 "awd_abstract_narration": "Scientific models can help improve decision-making in various settings, but creating and communicating these models is often limited by a variety of obstacles. More effectively communicating with decision makers, however, might improve and expand the use of scientific models, thus improving the safety and well-being of Americans in a variety of contexts and settings. This study develops and tests a new method for producing useful scientific information for decision makers with a focus on snow avalanche models in Alaska. The research includes virtual and in-person listening sessions, interviews, and surveys with snow avalanche decision makers from different sectors in Alaska, such as transportation, utilities, municipalities, business, recreation, and resource management. The goal is to create a more efficient way to produce actionable science by grouping decision makers with similar perspectives on the use of science. The second goal is to provide actionable future snow avalanche information to aid in decision making. Avalanches are Alaska's deadliest natural hazard, and changes in climate are expected to increase their frequency and intensity, posing risks to lives, homes, infrastructure, and resources. \r\n\r\nA team of social scientists, avalanche experts, and science communicators develop tailored communication strategies and products for each identified group. Products will be evaluated with an expert elicitation workshop. This research has the potential to establish new links and strengthen existing connections among the disciplines of communication, actionable science, and natural hazards, leading to a deeper understanding of how communication can be isolated and studied within engaged research processes. Though tested with avalanches in Alaska, this model could be applied to other hazards such landslides and wildfires, ultimately helping scientists and organizations improve their communication with decision makers.\r\n\r\nThis project is jointly funded by the Decision, Risk and Management Sciences Program and by the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
