 "awd_abstract_narration": "Rising sea levels and climate change are threatening our way of life and posing significant economic and sustainability challenges. To better understand the interaction between the Earth's Oceans and the atmosphere and how they contribute to climate change, we need to improve our understanding of oceanic trace gases. This project aims to develop new optical and photonic sensing technologies to help us gain a better understanding of this interaction and the presence of trace gases in the ocean. The project is closely linked to the interdisciplinary fields of photonics and ocean sensing, and it will have a wide-reaching impact on various engineering and scientific disciplines. We need to educate and train the next generation of workers in ocean sensing and blue technology. Thus, the project will involve students at Delaware State University in year-round research and training in ocean sensing technologies and instrument development. Through this project, we aim to integrate new research with educational activities and programs, which is crucial for attracting and retaining STEM students.\r\n\r\nOur goal is to create new small-scale technologies for detecting trace gases dissolved in water. Our approach involves using a novel mid-infrared photonics sensing technique that utilizes hollow-core optical fibers coupled with mid-infrared lasers. Unlike current sensing techniques, our method is in situ and does not require permeation membranes for equilibration at the air-liquid interface, which has been a major limitation. These sensors or sensor networks can be deployed in various locations, such as upstream, downstream, inshore, and offshore, to monitor the air-water interface. With these technologies, we aim to build a marine sensor network that can adapt to different conditions and provide highly detailed and real-time data on the presence of trace gases at the air-water interface.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
