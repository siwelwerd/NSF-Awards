 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to overcome some of the fundamental challenges in the field of implantable medical devices (IMDs) by addressing the critical issue of power source size. Traditional IMDs, such as cardiac pacemakers and neural stimulators, rely on bulky batteries, making them invasive and requiring frequent replacement surgeries. This research proposes an innovative solution using advanced wireless power transfer (WPT) technologies integrated with a novel metasurface slab. The metasurface slab, made of two-dimensional metamaterials with tailored electromagnetic properties, will be attached to the transmitter coil to concentrate electromagnetic fields, thereby increasing efficiency. By enhancing the efficiency of power transmission, this project seeks to enable the development of smaller, battery-free IMDs. These devices promise to reduce surgical invasiveness, minimize postoperative complications, and improve patient outcomes.\r\nThe proposed research focuses on two main tasks: designing a metasurface slab to enhance the power transfer efficiency (PTE) of wireless power systems and validating this technology in vivo using rodent models. The metasurface slab will be attached to the transmitter coil to concentrate electromagnetic fields, thereby increasing PTE. This design process will be optimized using a deep learning approach with a conditional deep convolutional generative adversarial network (cDCGAN). The second task involves powering a miniaturized IMD for sciatic nerve stimulation in rodents, demonstrating the practical application and effectiveness of the proposed WPT system. This project leverages advanced AI techniques and aims to significantly improve the feasibility of minimally invasive, miniaturized IMDs, with potential applications across various biomedical fields. The award has the potential to significantly impact multiple research areas, including the development of wireless-powered IMDs for diverse applications, advancements in RFID technology, and innovations within the wearables, Internet of Things (IoT), and Internet of Bodies (IoB) ecosystems. The educational component will integrate research findings into a new undergraduate course, host guest lectures from industry professionals, and provide hands-on research opportunities for high school and undergraduate students. Additionally, students will participate in tours of industry facilities, offering them first-hand exposure to advanced manufacturing processes and hardware design. These efforts will prepare students for careers in biomedical engineering and foster a deep understanding of innovative IMD technologies.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
