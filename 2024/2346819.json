 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project addresses two critical needs of the nation: 1) a significant talent shortage in the field of microelectronics and semiconductors, and 2) a high unemployment rate among individuals with disabilities and neurodiversity in the STEM workforce. There are over 2 million autistic adults holding post-secondary degrees in the United States. Empirical studies have shown that autistic individuals possess unique strengths that can excel in many STEM fields, such as strong attention to detail, visual pattern recognition, high integrity, and adherence to rules, which are essential in the field of semiconductor quality assurance and data analysis. Despite autistic individuals' strong STEM backgrounds compared to their neurotypical peers, they remain one of the most underrepresented groups in the STEM workforce due to multiple challenges they face in the competitive job market, including networking, finding mentors, and limited opportunities to receive hands-on training. Meanwhile, the semiconductor industry is struggling to recruit talented domestic engineers in microelectronic quality assurance after years of reliance on foreign outsourcing. Expensive training costs and equipment, often costing multimillion dollars, are cited as primary obstacles to expanding hands-on training experiences. This project aims to bridge this gap by designing and providing an 8-week intensive program leveraging virtual reality (VR) technology, called PATH. The outcome of this project will contribute to addressing the nation's urgent need to rebuild a strong and diverse workforce in the semiconductor industry.\r\n\r\nThis is a collaborative effort between the University of Florida (UF), the Center for Autism and Related Disability (CARD), and industry partners including Skywater Foundry in Kissimmee, FL, and ZEISS in Jupiter, FL. During the project period, a total of 50 autistic adults will receive training. The specific target demographic is autistic adults with associate or bachelor's degrees in electronic engineering, material science, computer science, industrial engineering, or other relevant areas. The training aims to prepare them for entry-level jobs as quality assurance engineers and process engineers in semiconductor foundries. Over the 8-week training period, students will not only learn fundamental concepts of Integrated Circuit (IC) packaging and quality inspection methods through lectures but will also have the opportunity to gain hands-on experience through VR simulation. VR simulations have been recognized as effective tools for autistic individuals, as they can provide a tailored learning experience without the concern of making mistakes in an individualized space, as compared to the conventional group-based observation method. Additionally, PATH participants will receive one-on-one mentorship from industry experts. Among the 50 participants, selected individuals will have the opportunity to work as summer interns at Skywater Technology. The developed learning contents, including lecture recordings, VR simulations, and quizzes, will be made available to the public through an online learning platform to enhance its broad impact on the larger community beyond the project period.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
