TheoryFest, a satellite event of STOC, comprises various workshops and additional programs. The purpose of this travel grant is to enable students from underrepresented communities to attend STOC 2024 and TheoryFest and the TCS for All events, which will coincide and be co-located with STOC. This financial support will offer students the opportunity to participate in these leading conferences, which not only enhances their intellectual growth but also fosters community enrichment by encouraging interaction with a diverse mentoring panel, contributing significantly to the event's success. With this funding we aim to provide financial support to fifteen students to attend STOC 2024.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
