This is the 15th workshop in the ISCOM series which was started in 1995. Typically, these meetings alternate between Europe, Asia, and North America but has not been held in the United States since 2005. The symposium will balance theory and experiment with coverage of many contemporary issues. This symposium is designed to inspire new collaborations and provide opportunities for the education and growth of a diverse group of young people including via a student tutorial session before the main conference.\r\n\r\nTechnical Abstract:\r\n\r\nThis conference aims at advancing the fundamental understanding of molecular and molecule-based materials, which includes cutting edge topics in condensed matter physics such as non-equilibrium phenomena, particularly in high magnetic fields; molecular ferroelectrics multiferroics and chiral system; and competing interactions, electron correlations, and superconductivity in low-dimensional systems. A diverse set of US and international researchers present in the student tutorial and the technical sessions, with a priority on highlighting the work of young researchers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The workshop was co-organized by Natalia Drichko (Hopkins) and Jan Musfeldt (Tennesssee) to highlight interdisciplinary research, encourage international collaboration, and contribute to the education of young people in this important interdisciplinary field. We broadened the topical sections to include chirality, ferroelectricity, multiferroics, spin liquids, metal-organic frameworks, and high field effects - in addition to offering Sunday student tutorial sessions, two active poster sessions with prizes for students and postdocs, an editorial presentation on \"how to write a paper and get it accepted quickly\", a banquet at the Anchorage museum (with access to the first people&rsquo;s exhibit), and a hiking excursion in the Chugash state park to boost camaraderie. We made real efforts to improve the visibility of young people by asking them to give invited talks and chair sessions. We also attempted to host a near-equal number of male and female speakers.
