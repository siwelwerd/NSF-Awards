 "awd_abstract_narration": "The GLOBE Program community has over the past 29 years created an openly accessible database with over 300 million measurements and growing at an increasing rate of almost 2 million submissions per month. As the program continues to grow, it needs to build on the success of the past as it attempts to address current challenges and others that may lie ahead. The 2024 Globe meeting will focus on Climate and Resilience, contributing to all partner sponsors\u2019 strategic objectives. Thus, GLOBE plans to increase its impacts beyond its community and into the wider Earth and Space Science and science education communities.\r\n\r\nThe GLOBE Program\u2019s measurement databases are freely accessible which will allow contribution to GLOBE activities from a broad participant pool. Emphasizing the main theme of Climate and Resilience, the 2024 Annual meeting will address how GLOBE program elements and activities allow the community to delve deeper into the understanding of climate related issues. Facilitating this level of engagement around climate aligns well with sponsoring Agency priorities. Meeting sessions will explore and address the theme through the following strands: 1. Exploring climate through GLOBE science and data; 2. Using GLOBE to increase resilience; 3. Responding to a changing climate; and 4. Amplifying GLOBE\u2019s impact on improving life on our planet.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
