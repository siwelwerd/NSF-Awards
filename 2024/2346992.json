 "awd_abstract_narration": "Driven by over eight decades of nuclear innovation in the Oak Ridge region, advances in next generation nuclear are spurring the demand for a uniquely skilled workforce. Regional employers have identified the lack of a sufficiently trained and educated workforce in radiological and nuclear disciplines as a barrier to future growth. The Nuclear Industry Pathways: Meeting Emerging Needs project will support collaboration between Roane State Community College and industry leaders to develop and implement a Nuclear Technology Program. Curriculum will be informed by industry leaders to ensure cohorts have the skills necessary for immediate job placement after completion of the program. The project will result in a broader impact of strengthening partnerships between academia and industry leaders, improve experimental learning opportunities, engage youth in STEM and associated occupations, and serve to improve the quality of living for populations of rural service areas.\r\n\r\nThe goal of the Nuclear Industry Pathways: Meeting Emerging Needs project is to implement a Nuclear Technology Program which results in a cohort educated in unique skills required by regional industry needs. The Program design will include stakeholder input such as robust curriculum reviews by the chartered Nuclear Technology Program Advisory Board and other industry experts, as well as a laboratory incorporating real-world equipment in a simulated nuclear environment, and classes taught by subject matter experts. The Program aims to serve various groups, including incumbent workers, dislocated workers, and underrepresented populations in STEM fields. In addition to offering a 2-year AAS, the Program will also be designed to provide education and training opportunities such as certifications to fill training gaps identified by regional employers, internships, and STEM recruitment at the K-12 level. The Program is poised to serve as a model for other rural areas seeking to establish similar programs to meet future workforce demands within the clean energy industry. The Program is targeted to begin in Fall 2024 and be fully scaled by Fall 2026.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
