 "awd_abstract_narration": "Blockchain, a transformative and decentralized peer-to-peer ledger technology, is impacting industries at a pace that rivals the adoption of the internet in the 1990\u2019s.  Blockchain facilitates secure and transparent transactions across various domains and sectors such as finance, health care, energy, supply chain, manufacturing, and other global industries. The goal of this project is to develop a new academic program to prepare students to work as Blockchain technicians. The resulting curriculum will be aligned with developing industry standards and will help to address the demand for Blockchain capable technicians.  Existing partnerships and consortiums will be leveraged to share the resulting curriculum broadly with the community, stakeholders, workforce development agencies, and partner institutions. \r\n\r\nThe academic program that will be created by this project will consist of four dedicated courses, two stackable micro-credentials, and will be integrated into existing programs. The curriculum will be designed to attract and retain a wide variety of students, and to help incumbent workers to obtain skills in Blockchain. The project will provide substantive professional development to faculty so that they remain current with evolving Blockchain regulations, standards, and innovations. Integration of the Blockchain curricula into the host institution's catalog, marketing, and student recruitment processes will ensure sustainability of the curriculum after the grant funding ends. Project evaluation will include formative and summative inquiries that will provide feedback to inform continuous improvement. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
