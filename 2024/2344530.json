 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project aims to develop a groundbreaking instrument capable of measuring mass changes in live single cells with unparalleled precision and speed. The instrument uses small pipettes that capture the cells using gentle pressure and measure tiny weight changes in thousandths of a second. By enabling scientists to observe how cells regulate their mass during crucial processes such as migration and differentiation, this tool will fill a significant gap in biological research. Additionally, the project will benefit society by advancing scientific knowledge and fostering new technological innovations. The project will also include educational outreach programs through internships to allow underrepresented and economically disadvantaged students to experience scientific research and entrepreneurship, promoting diversity and inclusion in STEM fields.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to develop a transformative instrument for measuring cellular mass changes with picogram accuracy and millisecond temporal resolution. The instrument will utilize small pipettes that can precisely attach to individual cells using gentle pressure, eliminating the need for adhesion molecules that might alter cell behavior. This technology will enable mass measurements of mammalian cells and support high-throughput analysis using pipette arrays with embedded sensors. By integrating several technical innovations, the instrument will achieve accurate and frequency measurements in liquid environments. This innovative approach will allow continuous monitoring of cell mass changes, applicable to studies on cell division, metabolism, migration, and more. Collaboration with industry partners will facilitate the commercialization of the instrument, ensuring its broad application in biological research and potential therapeutic developments. The research outcomes, including device designs and data, will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and made available on a stable URL: https://labs.icahn.mssm.edu/gaitaslab/.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
