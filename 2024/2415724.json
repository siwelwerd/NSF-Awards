 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Tri-Alliance Consortium aims to transform post-award activities at emerging research institutions (ERIs) to reduce administrative burden, better support faculty in their research, and increase grant activity.  Without adequate research infrastructure, faculty and staff at ERIs  face distinct challenges, including lack of support systems for managing the post-award responsibilities, access to accurate information, and post-award compliance.  Addressing these issues can help increase the research contributions from diverse institutions, thereby supporting U.S. economic growth.\r\n \r\nThe Tri-Alliance consortium, which includes Loyola Marymount University, Santa Clara University, and University of San Francisco, is dedicated to advancing research excellence through collaboration and resource sharing. These California-based institutions, part of the Association of Jesuit Colleges and University (AJCU), and recognized as ERIs, will focus on three core components: 1) Building capacity for post-award service structures, functions, and data collection; 2) Developing shared education and training opportunities and resource materials to increase efficiency and reduce administrative burdens; and 3) Piloting innovative cross-division support roles that span pre- and post-award administration. By sharing resources, piloting innovative positions, and documenting best practices, the Tri-Alliance will create a toolkit available to ERIs, thus fostering a stronger, more efficient research environment.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
