 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to enable pervasive, next-generation, mobile broadband connectivity across the United States through the development of an intelligent wireless repeater. Equal access to high-speed broadband connectivity is integral to the economic security and competitiveness of the United States. However, widespread disparities in broadband access continue to persist, especially in underserved urban and rural areas. This project will transform the economics and complexity of delivering ultra-high throughput wireless connectivity over large areas. The associated total addressable market is expected to reach $660 million by 2027 at a compound annual growth rate of 59%. The successful development of the hardware and software solutions in this project will disrupt the telecommunications industry and pave the way for optimal usage of new high-frequency spectrum bands, thereby unlocking the potential of next-generation mobile broadband connectivity.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the current shortcomings of fifth generation (5G) wireless networks that have failed to provide Gigabit-level data rates and sub-millisecond latency across wide areas. This failure is because millimeter-wave 5G networks at frequencies of 28 GHz and higher have very poor propagation range, and building a hyper-dense network of millimeter wave base stations for pervasive coverage is prohibitively expensive. Millimeter wave repeaters are an appealing solution to extend network coverage at a fraction of the cost of deploying new base stations, since they have a simpler software stack and do not require fiber backhaul. However, network operators have a strong aversion to deploying repeaters today since current repeaters have fixed transmission power and beam directions regardless of the actual traffic conditions on the macro network, which increases inter-cell interference and reduces spectral efficiency. The corresponding lack of pervasive millimeter wave 5G coverage exacerbates the digital divide in the U.S. and harms the national and economic security. This SBIR Phase I effort will design and prototype an intelligent 5G repeater that addresses these pain points.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
