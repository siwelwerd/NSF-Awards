 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project examines demographically diverse young adults and how they develop social and political identities, as well as how resources and opportunities for youth political engagement have changed during election seasons.  The project will contribute to our understanding of the development of political attitudes, behaviors, and identities during this period of rapid life transitions that characterize young adulthood. This project will further our understanding of how demographic groups are integrated into U.S. society and will also identify ways to promote political participation among young adults. \r\n\r\nThis multi-method study will consist of four waves of data collection. First, in September 2024, we anticipate collecting online survey responses from about 500 young adults ages 23 to 34 who participated in our 2020 survey, and 1,500 new participants ages 18 to 22 and 1,000 new participants ages 23 to 34. Second, we will recruit 40 original study participants and 40 new participants who will be first time voters in 2024 to participate in a photovoice exercise. Third, in October 2024, we expect to re-interview approximately 150 young adults ages 23 to 34 who participated in the original study, and 80 new participants ages 18 to 22 using purposive sampling to capture heterogeneity in experiences and outlooks by racial/ethnic and gender identity, political affiliation and voting intentions, and area of residence. Fourth, in the weeks immediately following the 2024 presidential election, we will administer a second online survey to all pre-election survey respondents. Data analysis will include statistical analysis of our survey data using regression analysis to estimate how sociodemographic and other background characteristics and contexts of political socialization are associated with political identities and forms of political engagement. Interviews and photovoice data will be analyzed using a qualitative data analysis software that supports multiple researchers' continuous data inputting and analysis.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
