 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will validate the commercial potential of an erasable dye technology intended for apparel. The transformative nature of the approach lies in its ability to reduce environmental impact every time a new design is downloaded. The conventional apparel industry consumes vast amounts of water and emits significant amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2) for every piece of clothing produced. This project aims to drastically reduce these environmental implications while providing consumers with a quick and climate-friendly alternative. By tapping into proprietary light-programmable color-changing dyes, this endeavor seeks to disrupt the fashion industry. By targeting the millennial and Gen Z market segments, which are increasingly conscious of sustainability, the project foresees significant commercial uptake, initially in the $8 billion custom domestic T-shirt market.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this project stems from its unique combination of advanced functional materials science, chemistry, and manufacturing to create a sustainable apparel solution. At the heart of the method lies a proprietary dye system which can provide repeatable color changes. Unlike conventional photochromic dyes that degrade quickly under visible light, this dye system is engineered to be durable, enduring repeated cycles of color change. The research objectives focus on refining this dye system to make it commercially viable, especially for the initial use case of custom and re-printable T-shirts. With the successful realization of this technology, the fashion industry will witness a paradigm shift, paving the way for a more sustainable and innovative future.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
