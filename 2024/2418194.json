 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)\r\nPhase I project addresses the significant and persistent challenge of protein aggregation in the\r\ndevelopment of protein therapeutics, which can impede therapeutic efficacy and increase\r\nmanufacturing costs. Protein-based therapies hold immense promise for treating a wide range\r\nof diseases due to their specificity and potency. However, their development is frequently\r\nhampered by aberrant aggregation, which can lead to loss of function and immunogenic\r\nresponses. This project proposes a novel computational platform that predicts aggregation-prone\r\nsites and, critically, suggest specific mutational mitigation strategies to stabilize proteins\r\nwithout altering their therapeutic function. The successful development of this technology has\r\nthe potential to significantly reduce the time and possible cost associated with drug development,\r\nenhancing the availability of effective treatments and supporting the health and welfare of the\r\npopulation.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will focus on advancing a\r\ncomputational platform that leverages state-of-the-art simulations and a modern\r\nunderstanding of the physics of protein hydration to identify and mitigate problematic\r\naggregation sites in therapeutic proteins. The project aims to validate and enhance the\r\nplatform's predictive capabilities through a comprehensive analysis involving a diverse dataset\r\nof proteins. In particular, this project will focus on developing the abilities of the technology to\r\nidentify transient protein interfaces likely to mediate aggregation and to suggest rigorous\r\nmutational strategies to mitigate aggregation without disrupting biological function and\r\ntherapeutic efficacy. The expected outcomes include a scientifically validated tool that can\r\nreliably predict and correct aggregation issues early in the drug development process. By\r\nimproving the stability and efficacy of biologic therapeutics, this technology has the potential to\r\nhave a significant commercial impact on the fast-growing biopharmaceutical market.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
