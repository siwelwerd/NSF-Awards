 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is based on the development of an immunotherapeutic virus vector for cancer treatment.  This modified virus targets cancer cells and activates the immune system, generating an adaptive immune response and potential synergy with Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors. Current solutions do not offer both direct cancer cell destruction and immune system enhancement. Ultimately, this approach has the potential to significantly change cancer therapy and benefit a wide range of cancer patients.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. The solution is based on the development of an immunotherapy and gene delivery platform that addresses the major hurdles for the success of oncolytic vaccines and gene therapy for solid tumors. The solution was developed and tested using a new generation of therapeutic vectors, based on vaccinia virus, that is able to directly kill cancer cells, activate the immune system against tumor antigens, and deliver therapeutic transgenes at tumor sites via blood circulation. In addition, the vectors in this solution combine with standard of care or immune checkpoint inhibitors and may result in complete eradication of tumors and metastases.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
