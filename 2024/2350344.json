 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal will fund the \u201cTrisections Workshop: Connections with Knotted Surfaces,\u201d which will take place at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln from June 24-28, 2024, and the \u201cTrisections Workshop: Connections with Diffeomorphisms,\u201d which will take place at the University of Texas at Austin during one week in the summer of 2025.  Workshop attendees will include established experts, early-career researchers, and students, and the program will actively engage all participants.  Each morning will feature plenary talks by experts and/or lightning talks highlighting the work of junior researchers.  The afternoons will be devoted to working in groups on open problems.  This series of regular workshops has been critical to the development of an enthusiastic community of researchers in low-dimensional topology, helping this new and growing area gain momentum and fostering numerous collaborations across career stages and demographics. The organizers take pride in the camaraderie and welcoming atmosphere they strive to create, and many in the community deeply value and appreciate these events. \r\n \r\nA trisection splits a 4-dimensional space into three simple pieces.  Since their introduction roughly a decade ago, trisections have proven to be a successful new tool with which to study smooth 4-manifolds, with numerous articles written in the interim to develop the foundations for trisection theory. An important strength of the theory of trisections is the way it interfaces with a variety of other topics in low-dimensional topology.  This interface provides an opportunity to explore many classical areas of 4-manifold topology through a new lens. Such areas include, for example, the study of knotted surfaces in 4-space, diffeomorphisms of 4-manifolds, exotic smooth structures, group actions and (branched) covering spaces, and symplectic structures.  The main goal of these workshops is to bring together researchers from multiple areas to propose and to work on open problems, with a particular focus on the inclusion of early career researchers.  The workshops are preceded by a series of introductory virtual pre-workshop talks, which serve to bring new researchers up to speed, to facilitate the work to be done in groups, and to incorporate a broader, worldwide audience.  The website for the 2024 workshop can be found here: https://sites.google.com/view/tw2024.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
