 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Coordinated Cosmic-Ray Observation System Conference in Lincoln, Nebraska in July 2024 brings together experts in space weather, atmospheric science, and hydrology. The workshop explores the value of cosmic ray neutron sensors across both low and high-energy spectrums for scientific and operational goals. An outcome from the three-day conference would be a white paper on the infrastructure necessary to facilitate progress and synergies across multiple Earth and space sciences.\r\n\r\nMeasurements of high-energy neutrons on earth are vital for understanding the origin of cosmic-rays and how events from the sun impact conditions on earth. Similarly, measurements of low-energy neutrons are critical for measuring the changes of hydrogen (i.e., water) on earth and in planetary science applications (e.g., Mars rover, planned missions to the moon). However, detectors that measure each of these range of neutrons must correct for so-called contamination from variations of the other. The design of future cosmic-ray neutron detector networks must therefore consider the synergistic needs of the space weather, atmospheric science and hydrology research and operations communities. This workshop is a pioneering attempt to bring these multiple science communities together to explore the potential benefit of a coordinated neutron monitoring network across the United States.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
