 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mathematical Opportunities in Student Thinking (MOSTs) are high-leverage instances of student mathematical thinking that emerge in whole-class discussions. The challenge for teachers is to build on these opportunities to help the whole class understand the mathematics underlying these student contributions. To help teachers learn how to build on MOSTs, there is a need for professional development resources and tools that facilitators can use. There is also a need for research about how teachers use what they learn in professional development in their teaching. This project is developing a teacher learning sequence that will support teachers in learning to productively use student thinking that surfaces in-the-moment during their instruction\u2014that is, in learning to build on MOSTs.\r\n\r\nThis project builds on prior work that developed a framework for recognizing MOSTs and conceptualized the building practice teachers use to effectively capitalize on MOSTs. The overarching research question for the project is: to what extent does the professional learning sequence help teachers understand and enact the teaching practice of building? As part of this investigation, the project also considers factors that might mitigate teachers\u2019 learning, such as teacher attributes (knowledge, practices, or experiences) and contextual factors. The study uses a design research framework to document how teachers take up aspects of building on MOSTs from the professional development, the process of teachers\u2019 learning, and changes in their classroom practice. The study relies on data from the professional development activities, teacher surveys and interviews, and classroom data. The project sites include secondary schools in urban and rural settings.\r\n\r\nThe Discovery Research preK-12 program (DRK-12) is an applied research program that seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers. Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for funded projects.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
