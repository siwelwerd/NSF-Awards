 "awd_abstract_narration": "This collaborative project aims to investigate the fast plasma flows within the Earth's nightside magnetosphere and their effects on the upper atmosphere (ionosphere and thermosphere). The dynamics of the fast plasma flows is an outstanding magnetosphere-ionosphere-thermosphere coupling problem associated with sudden magnetic field topology reconfiguration and explosive current formation, particle acceleration, and energy release in the magnetosphere. The simulation-observation results of this project will significantly deepen our understanding of magnetosphere-upper atmosphere coupling processes in the nightside transition region. Funds provided by this grant will promote two young researchers' professional development, including one postdoc. PI Dr. Zou, a female faculty member, will lead the team, mentor the early career scientists, and advise graduate students. \r\n\r\nThis project studies the dynamics of BBFs and their effects on the coupled MIT system using a two-way coupled global MHD-PIC model within the Space Weather Modeling Framework (SWMF) and comprehensive multi-instrument observations. Specific science questions to be addressed include: (SQ1) What are the particle velocity distributions associated with BBF? How do they evolve as BBF propagates earthward? (SQ2) How are the FACs distributed in the BBF dipolarization regions? Are their dawn-dusk asymmetries as suggested by recent theory? Can multiple BBFs and their wedgelets form the traditional SCW? (SQ3) What is the impact of BBF on the nightside IT system in terms of ionospheric density structures and airglow emission? The results of this project will be valuable to multiple new GEM focus groups and will also benefit the CEDAR community by deepening the understanding of the magnetospheric drivers that cause impulsive energy release into the IT system. The proposed activity will also enhance the scientific return of the NSF-supported radar facilities, AMPERE, and SuperMAG projects.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
