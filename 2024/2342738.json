 "awd_abstract_narration": "Every day, advanced applications of physiological computing such as wearable technologies (e.g., smartwatches) and brain-computer interfaces are reshaping our lives and pushing new scientific frontiers. Advancements in the human-technology frontier demand the readiness of next-generation scientists who can further develop and test such technologies. Yet, regions of our nation are experiencing a significant shortage of qualified job candidates. This ITEST design and development project tackles the challenge of workforce development in the state of Alabama, by creating a physiological computing curriculum for upper elementary school children enrolled in afterschool settings. Participating children will measure their own physiological data (such as muscle energy) and design computer programs that react to their data in real time. Through the curriculum and extracurricular activities, the project also exposes participating children and their families to emerging computing careers. By focusing on how participation impacts children\u2019s career aspirations and confidence for learning STEM, the project has the potential to inform current understanding of the barriers, challenges, and successes young learners experience during physiological computing and how their conceptual understanding of foundational computer science concepts evolves. \r\n\r\nAnticipating that future generations of engineers and scientists will need skills related to creating computer applications and programs associated with human movements and emotions via electrical activity, this three-year project will develop and iteratively implement a standards-aligned, physiological computing curriculum with a disciplinary literacy approach that encourages career exploration and critical thinking. The project uses design-based implementation research to examine its hypothesis that participation in the physiological computing environment and related career enrichment activities will enhance elementary students\u2019 conceptual understanding of computer science, self-efficacy for learning STEM, and STEM career aspirations. The project aims to enroll over 100 elementary students and prepare 20 (in-service and pre-service) teachers through professional development to enhance teachers\u2019 technological, pedagogical, and content knowledge to lead the lessons. Data sources include teacher focus groups, student surveys and interviews, students\u2019 conceptual drawings and design blueprints, and eye gaze and scan paths during on-screen problem-solving tasks. This project is funded by the Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program, which supports projects that build understandings of practices, program elements, contexts and processes contributing to increasing students' knowledge and interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and information and communication technology (ICT) careers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
