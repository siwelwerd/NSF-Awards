 "awd_abstract_narration": "Artificial intelligence (AI)\u2014and particularly deep learning\u2014is progressing rapidly from a technical perspective, but, in a number of domains, adoption is still pending over the resolution of important issues. Methods of data analysis and interpretation based on AI are becoming common among law enforcement agencies (LEAs). Typical applications include suspect profiling (e.g., on social media), traffic control (automated license plate detection and vehicle identification), analyzing dark web money flows, child pornography detection, and anomaly detection. Noteworthy and concerning, is the literature on the various ethical and legal concerns surrounding several issues, namely, AI bias. A culturally competent and social science focused approach to AI and Machine Learning approaches in law enforcement is needed at the forefront of this enhanced predictive application of policing. Specifically, artificial intelligence (AI) can be used to enhance justice in order to eradicate the biases that deny targeted people access to resources or freedom through the judicial system. Additionally, AI law enforcement should be used, if and where possible, to overcome discriminatory traits in human policing that have been a problem for law enforcement for decades. This proposal advances a center to keep pace with strategic and technological advancement, particularly, as these endeavors relate to AI, Machine Learning and predictive policing. \r\n\r\nThis planning project\u2019s main objective is to bring together a multidisciplinary group of experts to guide various sheriff departments to navigate challenges and opportunities they encounter as artificial intelligence becomes more embedded and an integral part of law enforcement. The development of AI technology to better society must be approached with a more social scientific focus and include constituents most affected by biases in law enforcement. With most constituents struggling to develop convincing and clear-cut guidelines to direct legislative and administrative considerations, this planning proposal explores the need and capacity of a specific focused center. This center offers guidance on how to implement AI in law enforcement by collaborating with local sheriff departments and expanding to other law enforcement agencies across various states. Trainings in the use of AI must be responsive to the needs of the communities law enforcement agencies are serving. The project develops plans for sustained research and training engagement amongst law enforcement departments, multidisciplinary academic teams, government agencies, policy makers, community group members and other constituents to focus and navigate the paradigm shift that law enforcement experiences with the continued progression of machine learning and specifically artificial intelligence.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
