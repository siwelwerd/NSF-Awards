 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ability to create nanoscale structures and materials has enabled groundbreaking advances in various science and nanotechnology applications. Electron beam lithography (EBL) is one of the most reliable and important techniques for creating ultrasmall nanostructures and nanomaterials. Many ongoing projects in the STEM disciplines have an urgent need for the proposed instrument. The long-range objective in acquiring the proposed equipment is to form a nanofabrication hub at the University of California Irvine (UCI) that (1) cultivates a multidisciplinary nanoscience research and teaching program incorporating EBL at a minority serving public institution, UCI; (2) significantly improves access to and affordability of EBL capabilities in Southern California, particularly at minority-serving institutions such as California State Universities, as well as local industry; and (3) exposes Southern California K-12 students to nanoscale science and technology. Acquiring a dedicated EBL system would significantly enhance UCI\u2019s ongoing nanotechnology research and education for research groups on campus and nearby smaller colleges, opening a path toward leading-edge nanoscale technologies.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: The EBL instrument will enable advanced development of emerging nano-sciences and nano-devices at UCI, including novel nano-photonic devices, nano-bio/chemical sensors, nano-electronic devices, and nano-medical components for transformative technologies that improve human life: for instance, ultrathin metasurface photonics for next-generation imaging and display technologies, nanoscale spintronic devices for novel memory and hard drives, mechanical lab-on-a-chip nanoscale devices and sensitive bio/nano-sensors. Nano-components and devices fabricated by the system (e.g., ultrathin optical lenses, on-chip biosensors) will be used for educational and outreach demonstrations. Broader Impacts: UCI is a minority-serving and public institution serving ~ 25% underrepresented graduate and undergraduate students in the Schools of Physical Sciences and of Engineering. Acquisition of an EBL instrument will facilitate training and education for more than 150 next-generation scientists and engineers in nanotechnology, many of whom are from underrepresented groups. Exploratory use awards and discounted usage fee will be established to enhance nanoscience and nanotechnology research at smaller and minority-serving colleges in Southern California utilizing the instrument. Strong outreach and workshop activities, and our commitment to student success will give underrepresented minority and low-income students an enviable introduction to nanoscience that can help foster greater URM representation in the STEM fields.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
