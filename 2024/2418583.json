 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project, funded by the MPS-LEAPS (Launching Early-Career Academic Pathways) Program and managed by the Broadening Participation Program in the Division of Chemistry (CHE-BP), Professor Blakely Tresca and his students at Kalamazoo College will perform studies focused on developing self-assembled diyne peptoid nanomaterials for sensing applications. Peptoids are synthetic polymers that mimic the structure of peptides and can form self-assembled nanostructures. The weak non-covalent interactions that hold the self-assembled structures together and the need for precise design of the side-chain interactions are challenges in the general use of peptoid nanomaterials. Professor Tresca and his students will develop diyne peptoid monomers to control folding, act as cross-linkers in nanostructures, and facilitate sensing of analytes. The developed self-assembled nanostructures will be used as platforms for colorimetric or electrical sensors. Their studies could advance the fundamental understanding of peptoid self-assembly and could lead to the design of functional peptoid sensors with integrated optical or electrical output for future development of sensors for anionic or neutral analytes. This project will offer early research experience and mentorship for students from diverse backgrounds to develop their science identity, including from groups underrepresented in STEM. In addition, students will work with mentors through workshops on applying for graduate fellowships.\r\n\r\nProfessor Tresca and his students will synthesize 1,3-diyne peptoids and characterize their reactivity in self-assembled nanosheets. They will develop methods to synthesize diyne precursors on a gram scale and to prepare diyne peptoids using an automated synthesizer. Topochemical polymerization of diyne peptoid nanosheets will be initiated with heat and UV light. The reactivity of diyne nanosheets, and properties of the resulting materials, will be measured with IR and UV-Vis spectroscopy, as well as DSC, AFM, and DIC microscopy. Small molecule models will be studied to understand the solid-state packing and reactivity of specific monomers with X-ray crystallography and NMR. Their research will help to describe rational design rules for diyne monomer structures and polymer sequences that may be applied to develop stable nanomaterials as integrated sensors.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
