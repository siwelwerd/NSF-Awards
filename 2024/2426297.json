 "awd_abstract_narration": "The IEEE International Symposium on Performance Analysis of Systems and Software (ISPASS) is a premier forum for presenting, sharing, and discussing advanced academic and industrial research on performance analysis in computer systems and software design. The symposium brings together researchers in the fields related to computer chips and systems, processor architecture, compilers, and operating systems. This award provides travel support funds to help up to 23 undergraduate and graduate students attend and participate in the 2024 IEEE International symposium on Performance Analysis of Systems and Software (ISPASS). The conference is held May 7-9 in Indianapolis, IN. Priority will be given to US citizens and students from universities that do not have a strong tradition in the ISPASS research domain. This grant will also encourage participation by members of under-represented groups, including students with disabilities. Funds from this award will cover expenses such as travel, lodging, and conference registration.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
