 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Texas Power and Energy Conference (TPEC) is a student-run IEEE technical conference that started in 2017. The seventh annual event, TPEC 2024, will be held on the campus of Texas A&M University in College Station, Texas, in 2024. This two-day event will bring together participants from industry and academia to present and discuss the latest technological developments and challenges in the area of power and energy engineering. The conference will include paper sessions, keynote speakers, a student poster competition, and an industrial sponsor and job fair. There will also be a tour included of the Smart Grids Control Room Lab located at the Center for Infrastructure Renewal (CIR) at Texas A&M University.\r\n\r\nThis grant will be used to support students traveling to and attending TPEC 2024. Students will benefit from hearing and discussing new research developments, hearing keynote speakers, networking with industry and academia, and having the opportunity to present their work in a paper or poster. The whole research community in power and energy engineering will benefit as well, by the value and perspectives these students will bring to the event.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

NSF support for TPEC has helped reduce the costs for some of the many students from other universities who travel to and attend the conference. Attendance in 2024 was 207, with 62% students, 30% academics, and 8% industry. About 54% the attendees were from within Texas, with about 38% from outside Texas in the USA, and 8% of attendees international.<br /><br /><strong>Intellectual Merit</strong><br />TPEC&rsquo;s technical focus is electric power and energy engineering. This subject includes electric power systems, power electronics, renewable energy and smart grid, machines, electromechanics, motor drives, cyber and physical security, energy markets, demand response, electric vehicles, and electric grid planning and resilience. The main conference activities at TPEC serve to highlight key challenges in these areas and recent research contributions, to foster collaboration and professional development for students and other attendees. These activities include hearing from our distinguished keynote speakers, breakout research paper sessions, and a student poster competition. The conference also includes a mini job fair, conference meals, sponsor exhibitions, and an optional tour of the Texas A&amp;M Center for Infrastructure Renewal.<br /><br /><strong>Broader Impacts</strong><br />TPEC puts a strong emphasis on student participation. Graduate students do essentially all of the work in planning and executing the conference activities, thereby developing key skills in leadership, communication, and management. Graduate students from around the country and internationally are able to participate in submitting conference papers for peer-review that are eligible to be published by IEEE after being presented in-person in College Station, TX. The conference also provides opportunities for undergraduate students, with a poster competition and volunteer opportunities (some undergraduates submit papers to the conference as well). NSF support for TPEC goes directly to helping reduce the cost of students at US universities to attend TPEC and benefit from the networking, mentorship, presentation experience, and exposure to ideas.</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 02/04/2025<br>\nModified by: Adam&nbsp;B&nbsp;Birchfield</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2341300/2341300_10901339_1738698465227_53526666121_8d407468fd_o--rgov-214x142.JPG\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2341300/2341300_10901339_1738698465227_53526666121_8d407468fd_o--rgov-800width.JPG\" title=\"TPEC 2024 Poster Session\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2341300/2341300_10901339_1738698465227_53526666121_8d407468fd_o--rgov-66x44.JPG\" alt=\"TPEC 2024 Poster Session\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">TPEC 2024 Poster Session</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Texas A&M University</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Adam&nbsp;B&nbsp;Birchfield\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">TPEC 2024 Poster Session</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2341300/2341300_10901339_1738698315957_53526416915_a569da04a1_o--rgov-214x142.JPG\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2341300/2341300_10901339_1738698315957_53526416915_a569da04a1_o--rgov-800width.JPG\" title=\"TPEC 2024 Plenary Session\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2341300/2341300_10901339_1738698315957_53526416915_a569da04a1_o--rgov-66x44.JPG\" alt=\"TPEC 2024 Plenary Session\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">TPEC 2024 Plenary Session</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Texas A&M University</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Adam&nbsp;B&nbsp;Birchfield\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">TPEC 2024 Plenary Session</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2341300/2341300_10901339_1738698493650_53529196850_6d0d543c1d_o--rgov-214x142.JPG\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2341300/2341300_10901339_1738698493650_53529196850_6d0d543c1d_o--rgov-800width.JPG\" title=\"TPEC 2024 Keynote Speaker\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2341300/2341300_10901339_1738698493650_53529196850_6d0d543c1d_o--rgov-66x44.JPG\" alt=\"TPEC 2024 Keynote Speaker\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">TPEC 2024 Keynote Speaker</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Texas A&M University</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Adam&nbsp;B&nbsp;Birchfield\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">TPEC 2024 Keynote Speaker</div>\n</div>\n</li></ul>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n",
