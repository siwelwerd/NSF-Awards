 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project aims to transform spectroscopy systems that identify materials by detecting a specific signature of gamma radiation. Such nondestructive detection technology is used in agriculture, mining, defense, oil and gas, border security, and other industries. The proposed innovation is a novel ultra-compact neutron generator, which is an essential component of material analysis systems used for a wide range of elements. Advantages of the proposed neutron generator are its ultra-low size, weight, and power consumption, which will enable portable detection applications, reduce costs, and greatly expand the potential to adopt this detection technology in more applications and enable its use in tight spaces, such as on board small aircraft or space vehicles. The improved neutron generator will significantly enhance security by improving detection capabilities in applications such as the identification of explosives, hazardous chemicals, and special nuclear material. It will also enable wide-field surveys for agricultural, natural resource exploration, and geological applications. With the neutron-activation analysis industry valued at over $100 million domestically, this breakthrough has the potential to increase this market size by at least $14 million. Thus, the project promises substantial technical, economic, and national security benefits.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this project lies in its innovative use of lithium niobate piezoelectric transformers (PTs) arranged in a novel antiphase configuration to accelerate deuterium and tritium atoms for a nuclear fusion-based neutron generator. This approach uses resonance drive technology to leverage the high gain of the PTs and achieve acceleration potentials that maximize the fusion reaction rate without magnetic or voltage multiplier components. Furthermore, the unique in-vacuum operation eliminates the bulky and expensive high-voltage hermetic feedthroughs. This resulting neutron generator will produce 300 million neutrons per second with a weight of under 5 pounds, a power draw of less than 10 watts, and a volume of less than 90 cubic inches. The research objectives of this project are to develop an in-vacuum mounting strategy to enable the high gain of the PT, develop antiphase resonance drive circuitry, develop a target and ion source that are integral to the PTs, and design a field-forming geometry for the vacuum chamber. Combined, these advancements will result in a neutron generator that surpasses the performance of existing systems, in multiple metrics, by more than an order of magnitude, marking a significant leap in neutron generator technology.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
