 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cal Poly Strong Field Quantum Electrodynamics Research at SLAC\r\n\r\nThis award will enable Cal Poly to continue its research, teaching, and outreach activities in Strong Field Quantum Electrodynamics (SFQED). This award is intended to improve our understanding of quantum electrodynamics in conditions where strong electromagnetic fields exceed the critical field, or Schwinger limit (~1.3x1018Vm-1). Experimental research will be conducted at the Stanford National Accelerator Center (SLAC) in Menlo Park, California, one of the world's leading accelerator facilities. The experiments involve colliding a high energy electron beam with a powerful laser pulse at SLAC's Facility for Advanced Accelerator Experimental Tests-II (FACET-II). SFQED phenomena in nature will be explored as a result of these interactions.\r\n\r\nWith this award, the FACET-II facilities at the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory will be used to enhance particle physics research, teaching, and outreach at California Polytechnic State University at San Luis Obispo (Cal Poly). It is intended that the proposed work will: i) participate in the SFQED collaboration (E-320) shifts and data collection at SLAC both remotely and in person; ii) simulate nonlinear Compton scattering and vacuum pair production for the E-320 collaboration; iii) integrate particle tracking from the beam-laser collision point to the beam detectors into the simulation code to facilitate detailed comparisons between simulations and experimental results; iv) install and commission the newly developed beam diagnostics developed during the previous grant cycle to measure nonlinear Compton scattering; v) Continue to design and develop a single positron calorimeter upgrade. Cal Poly undergraduate students will have the opportunity to gain research experience in SFQED and FACET-II operation during the summer at SLAC and during the academic year at the university as part of this research. The project provides the principal investigator and Cal Poly undergraduate students with an opportunity to push the intensity frontier in particle physics, which may reveal information about the composition of matter and space.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
