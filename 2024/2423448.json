 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader/commercial impact of this SBIR Phase I project centers on overcoming hydrogen storage and delivery challenges using ammonia as a hydrogen carrier. As of 2023, the global hydrogen market is valued at $242.7 billion and is expected to grow to $410.6 billion by 2030. Despite its vast potential, the deployment of hydrogen in decentralized applications, such as refueling stations and remote power generation, remains restricted due to logistical hurdles related to its storage and transportation. Ammonia offers a viable solution, due to its efficient transport capabilities, high hydrogen content, and carbon-free nature, positioning it as a key facilitator in the hydrogen economy. Unlocking ammonia\u2019s potential as an energy carrier requires an efficient ammonia cracking solution. This project proposes an innovative ammonia cracking system based on electrolysis that allows for the on-site conversion of transported ammonia back to hydrogen under ambient conditions. By simplifying hydrogen logistics, this technology aims to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions, particularly in sectors such as transportation and stationary power generation, which account for over 74% of global emissions. This advancement not only promises substantial commercial returns but also supports environmental sustainability and enhances technological understanding in clean energy. \r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this project stems from its innovative strategy for liquefying ammonia under mild conditions and efficiently cracking it through a tailored electrolysis system. Key technical challenges include achieving solvent-free ammonia liquefaction and creating an optimized electrolysis setup for effective ammonia-to-hydrogen conversion at ambient temperatures. The Phase I objective focuses on designing and optimizing a stable, conductive system for ammonia liquefaction, alongside developing an electrolysis-based cracker to maximize hydrogen conversion efficiency and purity. The research will involve comprehensive physicochemical and electrochemical studies, material characterization, and integration efforts to ensure optimal performance across various operational conditions. Anticipated outcomes are a high hydrogen yield with minimal energy consumption, scalable system design, and enhanced robustness under real-world conditions. This project aims to substantially improve the viability and sustainability of ammonia as a clean, carbon-free hydrogen source.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
