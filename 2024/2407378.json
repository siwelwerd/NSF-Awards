 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project lies in its revolutionary approach to treating abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA), a significant health concern especially prevalent among the elderly. This project aims to introduce a novel device that promises to significantly lower the rates of aneurysm related complications and reduce the need for repeat invasive procedures, which are common with current treatments. By potentially saving significant healthcare costs and reducing the frequency of medical interventions, the device presents a transformative solution that could ease the financial burden on healthcare systems and patients alike. Moreover, the project has the potential to expand access to life-saving treatments in underserved and remote areas, thus leveling the playing field in healthcare accessibility. The commercial and societal implications of this innovation could spur economic growth through intellectual property generation and job creation, thereby contributing to the advancement of the biomedical engineering sector.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to address the limitations of current endovascular treatments for abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) by developing a new device that aims to completely seal the aneurysm sac, eliminating the risk of post-procedure endoleaks. The research objectives include validating the device's adaptability to different aneurysm profiles and its compatibility with various aortic locations, ensuring broad patient applicability. The technical approach involves a compressible body unit designed for precision deployment and a dual function that allows for drug delivery post-deployment. The anticipated technical results include demonstrating the device's effectiveness in sealing aneurysms in a benchtop flow model, thereby setting the stage for potential regulatory approval. This project represents a significant leap forward in the treatment of AAAs, offering a more reliable and versatile solution compared to existing methods.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
