 "awd_abstract_narration": "The North American High Order Methods conference series (NAHOMCon) is held June 17-19, 2024 at Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire. This conference brings together researchers and practitioners with an interest in the theoretical, computational and applied aspects of high-order methods for the solution of differential equations impacting increasingly diverse and important problems in biology, climate studies, earth science, engineering, geology and medicine.  The conference engages a broad group of researchers at all career stages representing the mathematical sciences and engineering, as well as practitioners from multiple industrial and government communities, allowing participants to gain new insights and perspectives from experts in various application domains.  The conference format includes both invited speakers as well as submitted contributions to encourage broad participation especially from young scientists and under-represented minorities.  The conference will be held in conjunction with the New England Numerical Analysis Day (NENAD), which provides the opportunity for faculty and students from local universities to convene and discuss new research trends in numerical analysis, and enable people from the many smaller institutions in New England to establish future collaborative partners.\r\n\r\nThis conference brings together researchers and practitioners with an interest in the theoretical, computational and applied aspects of high-order and spectral methods for the solution of differential equations impacting increasingly diverse and important applications. Subjects of the meeting include, but are not limited to, high-order finite difference methods, p- and h-p type finite element methods, discontinuous Galerkin methods, spectral methods, efficient solvers and preconditioners, efficient time-stepping method, and computational aspects for modern hardware environments. There will also be an emphasis on high order methods in the context of data-driven models, including machine learning and data assimilation approaches.  The format of the meeting includes both invited papers as well as submitted contributions in order to encourage wider participation especially from young scientists and under-represented minorities. Two career development panel discussions are scheduled.  The first will be aimed at undergraduates who are interested in graduate school, while the second will focus on careers in industry. The conference website is https://math.dartmouth.edu/~nahomcon2024/\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
