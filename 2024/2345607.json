 "awd_abstract_narration": "This initiative seeks to address the stark underrepresentation of minority groups in the burgeoning field of Quantum Information. By focusing on faculty professional development, we aim to disseminate quantum knowledge and skills, fostering an inclusive educational environment. The emphasis on active learning and hands-on experiences is grounded in extensive research, ensuring that participants not only grasp complex quantum concepts but are also equipped to pass on this understanding to a diverse student population. The broader impact of this initiative aligns with the NSF's mission of advancing knowledge, ensuring the broad implementation of innovative technologies across all communities, and promoting excellence and inclusivity in science and engineering. It contributes to the national endeavor of building a skilled quantum workforce, promoting diversity, and ensuring that advancements in quantum technologies are shared equitably. \r\n\r\nOur proposal, \"Quantum Horizons,\" is a faculty professional development plan aimed at enhancing the quantum education capabilities. The workshop will cover quantum principles, quantum computing, quantum communication, and the implications of quantum technologies, supported by interactive sessions. By addressing fundamental research questions centered on equipping faculty from minority institutions and contributing to a diverse quantum workforce, this research effort stands to have a significant impact on the quantum education landscape, fostering inclusivity and excellence.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
