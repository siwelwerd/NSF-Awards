 "awd_abstract_narration": "The AI-UNITE project aims to empower University of Alaska Anchorage (UAA), the largest post-secondary institution and one of three accredited universities in Alaska, by building the capacity for immediate and long-term artificial intelligence (AI) advancement. To establish UAA as a trusted and effective partner in advancing AI, this project focuses on enhancing curriculum and training programs to meet the diverse needs of various audiences, strengthening inclusivity in AI through targeted outreach and support programs, and boosting AI research and collaboration capabilities to support interdisciplinary and use-inspired research at UAA. AI-UNITE aims to reach beyond the training of a select group of AI experts, to cultivate widespread AI literacy throughout our community, empowering a diverse range of learners to actively shape the development and application of AI for the collective good. \r\n\r\nThe AI-UNITE approach recognizes and accommodates the unique needs, backgrounds, and goals of our diverse community through four targeted initiatives: AI-SPARK for K-12 students, AI-FUEL for students with AI-related backgrounds, AI-IGNITE for industry professionals, students and faculty from non-CS disciplines, and AI-FLARE for the broader community. By equipping individuals with the knowledge and skills to navigate the AI landscape, AIUNITE will establish UAA as a trusted partner and a leader in AI-driven research and innovation in Alaska. Together, these research, education, and outreach activities will create a sustainable framework that facilitates innovation and practical applications of AI, initiate pilot AI-related and student-led projects, develop a mentorship database connecting students with industry professionals, and establish UAA's first AI summer camp, student club, and mobile lab. Additionally, it will enhance UAA\u2019s curriculum to cater to a wide range of learners. By documenting the experiences and insights resulting from this broad portfolio, the project aims to serve as a valuable model for other similar institutions seeking to empower their own community in AI.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
