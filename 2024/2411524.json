 "awd_abstract_narration": "The longstanding challenge of low participation in Afro-Latinos' participation in STEM education and their historically disproportionate representation in STEM fields continues to persist. This project will address this issue by examining how school curriculum and instruction may limit Afro-Puerto Rican students' learning experiences in math and science classrooms. Project activities include exploring perceptions and beliefs about race and student potential in STEM within a regional and cultural context where national identity often takes precedence over racial identity. By leveraging authentic partnerships between education scholars at the University of Puerto Rico-Rio Piedras and middle school leaders in the Loiza Municipality, Puerto Rico's largest majority Black community, this applied study seeks to advance foundational knowledge on how racism and colorism are intertwined in STEM education in Puerto Rico. Additionally, the study aims to provide a nuanced analysis of how school systems can collaborate to ameliorate racial inequities within the Latinx population.\r\n\r\nUsing a case study research design, a mixed-methods approach will gather insights into how the intersectional underpinnings of racism and colorism in schools impact Afro-Puerto Rican students' classroom experiences. Methods include semi-structured interviews and focus groups with school principals, in-service teachers, students, parents, and community members to gather their experiences and perceptions of school climate. Classroom observations and document analysis will complement these interviews, providing a comprehensive view of teaching practices and the school\u2019s racial climate. The qualitative data collected will inform the development of a questionnaire, which will allow for the collection of both quantitative and qualitative data from students, in-service teachers, and parents. Ultimately, this work will contribute to a deeper understanding of school climate and racial dynamics within the educational setting, as well as the barriers to student engagement in school science and mathematics. The team will identify actionable recommendations for fostering an inclusive and supportive school climate, offering valuable contributions to the broader discourse on educational equity and informing policy and practice to better support multi-racial marginalized communities.\r\n\r\nThis project is jointly funded by the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) and the Racial Equity in STEM Education activity (EDU Racial Equity). EDU Racial Equity supports research and practice projects that investigate how considerations of racial equity factor into the improvement of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education and workforce. Awarded projects seek to center the voices, knowledge, and experiences of the individuals, communities, and institutions most impacted by systemic inequities within the STEM enterprise. Programs across EDU contribute funds to the Racial Equity activity in recognition of the alignment of its projects with the collective research and development thrusts of the four divisions of the directorate.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
