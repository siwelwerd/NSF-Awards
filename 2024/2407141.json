 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact of this I-Corps project is the development of Portable Tuned Mass Dampers (PTMD). To reduce excessive vibrations of architectural structures, engineers can either increase the structural stiffness or mass, mainly at the floor levels. Both these options substantially increase overall construction costs. These options also result in sustainability issues; According to the United Nations Global Alliance for Building and Construction Program, 39% of all global greenhouse gas emissions are due to building construction. The floor construction can generate a staggering 10% of greenhouse emissions, which is five times more than what is produced by the entire aviation industry each year. PTMDs can substantially reduce construction costs and help with the reduction of the greenhouse gas emissions produced by excess floor construction materials. \r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. The solution is based on the development of Portable Tuned Mass Dampers (PTMD) to control vibrations in architectural structures. The changing landscape of architecture, including the use of higher strength building materials such as steel and concrete, the tendency of architects to design more elegant, slender, open-plan and long-span structures, and the more common use of highly sensitive equipment in hospitals and research facilities, has resulted in a growing problem of vibration serviceability of architectural structures. A PTMD is made of weight plates, springs, and steel plates with a fraction of the structure\u2019s total weight which can substantially reduce excessive vibrations by moving in the opposite direction of the structure. The PTMD device is portable and can be placed directly on a floor or installed within a floor plenum. Additionally, PTMD can be tuned using a smartphone application without the need for highly technical personnel.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
