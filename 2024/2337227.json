 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-technical summary\r\nAll living creatures on earth are made of cells. Each cell is enclosed by an extracellular\r\nmatrix. You can think of an extracellular matrix as a housing that protects and contains\r\na cell\u2019s contents. In plants, that housing is particularly strong and rigid and is composed\r\nof a wide variety of biopolymers. One such polymer is known as extensin. As its name\r\nimplies, extensin plays an important role in controlling plant growth and extension, and\r\nit does so by forming a polymeric molecular scaffold or frame. This work aims to\r\nunderstand what governs scaffold formation at the molecular level and how we can use\r\nthis knowledge to design new biopolymers that mimic or imitate the properties of\r\nnatural extensins. In the face of global climate change, our reliance on fossil fuels must\r\nbe reduced, not only for use as transportation fuels, but also as chemical/polymer\r\nfeedstocks. Potential industrial applications of this research are numerous and include\r\nthe creation of biodegradable plastics, molecular electronics, food enhancement,\r\ncosmetics additives, etc. This research will also provide training opportunities for\r\nundergraduate and graduate students in biophysical chemistry and biochemistry. New\r\nundergraduate course materials for physical chemistry and biochemistry will be\r\ndeveloped, and various outreach and scientific literacy projects for primary/secondary\r\nschool aged children and adults are planned.\r\n\r\nTechnical summary\r\nExtensins (EXTs) are network-forming hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins found\r\nnaturally in plant cell walls. Monomeric EXTs self-assemble to form insoluble polymeric\r\ncell wall scaffolds. Very little is known about what governs EXT self-assembly at the\r\nmolecular level. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) has been previously used to explore\r\nthe behavior of EXT self-assembly. These studies showed that EXT monomers\r\nspontaneously self-assemble into intricate dendritic scaffolds. Furthermore, different\r\nEXT types displayed different self-assembly behaviors, whereby some EXTs favored\r\nmore xy-plane growth (termed \u2018branching\u2019), while others displayed z-plane growth\r\n(termed \u2018stacking\u2019). These changes were attributed to differences in the repetitive,\r\nmodular, and amphiphilic nature exhibited by different EXTs. To better understand the\r\nmolecular drivers of EXT self-assembly, three objectives are proposed. First, will be\r\nfurther characterize the self-assembly of native EXT glycoproteins by AFM to study\r\ntheir kinetics, pore sizes, and relative growth in the x-, y-, and z-planes. Synthetic\r\nbiology will then be used to create biomimetic EXTs that vary in amphiphilicity,\r\nmodularity, and repetitiveness and test for their self-assembly behavior using AFM.\r\nLastly, the biochemical and biophysical properties of synthetic self-assembled EXTs will\r\nbe characterized and compared with a focus on monomer adhesion strength and\r\npolymer flexibility. Elucidating the molecular rules that govern EXT self-assembly is\r\nexpected to facilitate the rational design of synthetic, plant-based biomimetic\r\nbiopolymers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
