 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides participant support for students and young researchers to attend the World Congress on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management (IEOM) World Congress in Detroit, Michigan, 9-11 October 2024. The conference focuses on research and development activities in advanced manufacturing and digital technologies. US and international researchers present their research results on advanced manufacturing and digital technologies in oral and poster sessions. The conference impacts the engineering and manufacturing communities. Priority is given to participation by women and under-represented minority groups, which promotes diverse participation at the conference. This award benefits the nation through the education of a skilled science and engineering workforce, which is better prepared to provide transformative solutions to the challenges in their chosen fields. This symposium plays an important role in supporting and sustaining the field of advanced manufacturing, which has many important applications in transportation, energy, microelectronics, and other industrial sectors.\r\n\r\nThis participant support is expected to benefit the students\u2019 and young researchers\u2019 professional, scientific, and technical development. Attendance at the conference gives the students and young faculty a broader view of advanced manufacturing and digital technologies, its fundamentals and practice. The conference discusses specialized topics related to advanced manufacturing such as vehicle electrification, AI in manufacturing, smart mobility, smart manufacturing, robotics in manufacturing, digital twins, and industrial automation. Besides technical research, the conference plans to hold workshops on geometric dimensioning and tolerancing (GD&T), production part approval process (PPAP), and programmable logic controller (PLC), and panels on smart mobility, EV charging and others. At the conference, concepts and challenges in advanced manufacturing are identified and presented, and attendees chart new paths forward in the field and rally a new generation of researchers toward them. The conference is attended by US and international researchers, which provides an opportunity for a variety of perspectives to be presented and discussed. The conference is an opportunity for participants to showcase their scientific accomplishments and interact with peers and colleagues in academia, government laboratories and industry.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
