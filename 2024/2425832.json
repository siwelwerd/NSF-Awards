 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 11th International Meeting on Intercellular Communication in Plants (dubbed PD2024) will bring together scientists from the global community who study plasmodesmata and intercellular trafficking. The meeting\r\nis scheduled to be held from September 17th to 20th, 2024 in St. Louis, Missouri at the Donald\r\nDanforth Plant Science Center. The funds from this award will be used to support the participation of early\r\ncareer scientists and persons not traditionally represented in science in the meeting.\r\n\r\nThis meeting will focus on recent developments related to intercellular communication in plants\r\nand plasmodesmata, with a focus on: 1)sharing of research discoveries and progress, and (2)foster\r\ncollaboration and encourage interdisciplinary approaches that will allow rapid future progress\r\nin plasmodesmata biology. The meeting is organized into seven scientific sessions\r\narranged around topics including Intercellular trafficking in Development, Structure and\r\nMembranes of Plasmodesmata, Biophysics and Modeling of Plasmodesmata and Intercellular\r\ntrafficking in Plant-Microbe Interactions among others. The meeting will include Keynote\r\npresentations from experts in the field of intercellular trafficking and from plant mechanosensing\r\nand plant evolution and diversity. PD2024 will especially focus on early career scientists\r\nwith presentations in each session, a special session of \u2018lightning talks\u2019 to allow many early\r\ncareer scientists to share the \u2018main stage\u2019, and poster sessions to disseminate their work more\r\ndirectly with community members.\r\n\r\nThe PD2024 conference is committed to broadening participation and will include\r\npersons from groups traditionally underrepresented in science. The organizing committee itself\r\ncomprises a diversity of scientists including women, persons from minority groups and persons\r\nwith disabilities. The provision of travel support from this award to members of\r\nunderrepresented groups and early career scientists will allows them to participate in this conference. PD2024 will: (1) provide a safe and supportive venue where early career scientist can share their research and ideas, and (2) offer structured activities that foster network building. Funds from this award will also be\r\nused to provide accommodations to persons with disabilities, especially those from the\r\ndeaf/hard-of-hearing community.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
