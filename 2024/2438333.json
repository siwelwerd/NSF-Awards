 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides travel and registration support to graduate students to participate in the 2025 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) International Conference on Nanotechnology (IEEE NANO) that will be held in Washington, DC, July 13-16, 2025. IEEE NANO is the flagship conference of the IEEE Nanotechnology Council (NTC). This annual conference rotates between Europe, Asia, and North America, bringing together researchers, educators, and students working on various aspects of nanotechnology for electronics, computing, materials, photonics, magnetic, acoustics, sensors, robotics, and biomedical applications. The technical program will feature plenary presentations, parallel technical sessions (including both oral and poster sessions), and special sessions and workshops in selected areas of emerging technologies. \r\n\r\nThe award will support 20 graduate students in the form of IEEE Nano Fellowships. The Call for Fellowship Application will be widely disseminated to the graduate students at US institutions through the large network of IEEE NTC Chapters and Women in Nanotechnology (WIN) program and Young Professional Networking program, as well as direct messages to the past participants of the IEEE NANO conferences. An ad-hoc Fellowship Selection Committee will be formed to evaluate the fellowship applications. In addition, the support will help defray the cost for an Early-Career Advice Panel. The panel will consist of members from academia, industry and national labs at different career stages, who will share their experiences in the Graduate School and for the transition from the Graduate School to their respective careers. The Fellowship support and the professional development activity are designed to support the workforce development for the Unites States of America.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
