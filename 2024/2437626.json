 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 2024 International Conference on Microbiome Engineering will focus on the latest advances in microbiome research tools, microbiome biology and microbiome engineering applications, bringing together key stakeholders from academia and industry who have aligned interests. The conference program features talks on a variety microbiome engineering-related subjects, including the latest tools for engineering individual and groups of microbes, engineering animal microbiome systems, engineering plant and soil microbiome systems, and the underlying science of microbial dynamics in microbiomes. The conference covers a broad range of research areas and applications of microbiome engineering, which creates a unique environment for people with diverse expertise to gather and exchange information. Additionally, the conference aims to give students and early career professionals opportunities to share their work, to network with the foremost leaders in the field, and to develop their careers. \r\n\r\nThe field of microbiome engineering is one of the fastest growing and highest impact areas of modern research, with applications in agriculture, ecology and medicine. The 2024 International Conference on Microbiome Engineering will bring together biologists, chemists, and engineers to discuss the ability of microbiome research to address fundamental and applied problems. The sessions feature a broad range of emerging technologies and a diverse set of topics that will impact the next decade of research. The conference is designed to bring together researchers and experts from academia, government and industry in a highly interactive and engaging meeting. Early career and established researchers will have opportunities to interact during organized talks, poster sessions, panels, and many informal gatherings. This platform will allow established and early career scientists to discuss challenges in the field and to establish collaborations to address these challenges.\r\n\r\nThis conference has been co-funded by the Cellular and Biochemical Engineering Program in the Division of Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental and Transport Systems, and the Systems and Synthetic Biology Program in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
