 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a grant to support participation in the conference \"Representation theory and related geometry: progress and prospects\" that will take place May 27-31, 2024 at the University of Georgia in Athens, GA. This conference will bring together a diverse set of participants to discuss two key areas of mathematics and their interplay. Talks will include historical perspectives on the area as well as the latest mathematical breakthroughs. A goal of the conference is to facilitate meetings between graduate students, junior mathematicians, and seasoned experts to share knowledge and inspire new avenues of research. In addition to the formally invited talks, the conference will include opportunities for contributed talks and discussion.\r\n\r\nThe interplay of representation theory and geometry is fundamental to many of the recent breakthroughs in representation theory. Topics will include the representation theory of Lie (super)algebras, and finite, algebraic, and quantum groups; cohomological methods in representation theory; modular representation theory; geometric representation theory; categorification; tensor triangular geometry and related topics in noncommutative algebraic geometry; among others.  More specific topics of interest may include support varieties, cohomology and extensions, endotrivial modules, Schur algebras, tensor triangular geometry, and categorification. The conference website can be found at https://sites.google.com/view/representation-theory-geometry/.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
