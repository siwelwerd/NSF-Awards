 "awd_abstract_narration": "Despite dedicated efforts of federal and state agencies, professional societies, universities, and the private sector to address this issue, racial and ethnic diversity in the ocean studies continues to lag other STEM fields. Current trends regarding representation of historically excluded racial and ethnic groups show that the number of ocean science doctoral degrees awarded annually to members of these groups has not increased substantially over the past decade. From 2014 - 2018, only ~ 6% of ocean science degrees were awarded to Hispanic/Latino, Black, and Native American students, compared to about 14% for science and engineering fields overall (National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics, 2021). This consensus study activity is a collaboration between the Ocean Studies Board (OSB) and the Board on Higher Education and Workforce (BHEW) at the National Academy of Science, Engineering and Medicine (NASEM). It will provide a comprehensive analysis of diversity programs, both within ocean studies and in the broader STEM community, with target metrics to guide the ocean studies community in achieving diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) goals. This study will produce a consensus report for establishing an evidence-based framework to advance these goals in institutions that are critical to the development and success of the future ocean studies workforce. The report will include findings and recommendations aimed at colleges, universities, and other educational institutions, federal and state agencies, Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs), and other ocean organizations \u2013 including business and industry. The longer-term goal is to implement the findings of the report by creating an \u201cAction Collaborative, which is an active space for academic, research, non-profit, industry and other organizations to work together, sharing successes and challenges, and pledging to move beyond pro forma policies to evidence-based practice.\r\n\r\nThe design of this study includes plans to meet with STEM DEI experts from outside of ocean studies to identify effective practices and metrics in other fields and to meet with ocean studies DEI experts to address issues specific to ocean science disciplines, and explore how structural and organizational aspects of ocean studies affect perceptions of professional opportunities and careers. These meetings will provide opportunities for diverse communities to share insights and experiences that the committee will use in shaping the recommendations in the report. The longer-term goal is to implement the findings of the report by creating an active space for academic, research, non-profit, industry and other organizations to work together, sharing successes and challenges, and pledging to move beyond pro-forma policies to evidence-based practice.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
