 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the 2024 edition of the Seminar on Stochastic Processes, held March 13-16, 2024 at Rice University. This annual meeting has had tremendous impact on the probability community since its inception in 1981, both in North America and internationally.  The conference brings together a diverse group of accomplished and early-career researchers and graduate students working in the field of probability and stochastic processes.  There are five invited speakers, delivering three plenary lectures and two distinguished plenary lectures known as the \u201cSSP Founders lecture\u201d and the \u201cIMS Medallion lecture\u201d, and one tutorial speaker. There are two poster sessions with brief introductory talks, two open problem discussion sessions and a panel session on career development. The conference provides all the participants an opportunity to interact and discuss recent advances in probability theory and stochastic processes, and their applications. As such, the conference represents an important networking opportunity for the many dozens of early-career researchers in attendance and it will enhance the careers of the next generation of researchers in stochastic processes.\r\n \r\nThe scientific committee has chosen invited speakers who represent a wide breadth of research areas in probability and stochastic processes, including stochastic analysis, stochastic partial differential equations, backward stochastic differential equations, discrete probability, mathematical finance, stochastic geometry, and mathematical physics. The topics also cover a wide range of application areas including biology, data science, physics and epidemiology. Recent research work by other participants is presented at poster sessions. The open problem sessions provide opportunities for discussions about emerging and challenging topics in probability and stochastic processes and the formation of future collaborations. https://ssp2024.rice.edu/\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
