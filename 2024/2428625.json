 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Critical Resilient Interdependent Infrastructure Systems and Processes (CRISP) project develops an integrated resilience modeling framework for mitigating vulnerabilities in critical interdependent infrastructure systems. The framework evaluates the coupled nature of vulnerabilities across physical and social systems in Miami and Houston. By focusing on the effects of recent hurricanes on the interdependent-infrastructures in energy, water, transportation and telecommunication, and the human-infrastructures interactions, the project explores options for resilience. The system vulnerabilities are quantified with regional inoperability based economic-interdependency models. The project will develop an app for information sharing with the public.  Thus, this scientific research contribution supports NSF's mission to promote the progress of science and to advance our national welfare with benefits that will optimize investments in the nation's critical infrastructures.  \r\n\r\nThe project integrates risk-based models, agent-based simulations, dynamic models of social vulnerability, and models of economic impacts of inoperability. The novelty lies in integrating the interdisciplinary research components: (i) incorporating wind and flood inundation risk into the utility and service disruption models to analyze and determine the extent of interdependent infrastructure failures in energy, water, transportation, and telecommunication sectors; (ii) constructing socio-infrastructural systems of vulnerability and analyzing evacuation/relocation behavior to assess the need for emergent critical infrastructure services; (iii) micro simulation for analyzing coping behavior and facilitating decentralized resilience through information sharing and critical resource pooling; (iv) a macro (city level) inoperability based resilience model to integrate household and social responses with disrupted interdependent infrastructure systems; and (v) developing an app to facilitate and scale up participatory resilience through crowd-sourcing which will be usable in other disaster settings. The project will engage, mentor, and offer an innovative active learning environment for K-12, undergraduate, and graduate students by giving priority to the disadvantaged and underrepresented communities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

As one of several universities on the project team, our specific requirements and goals were to: (1) model the hurricane evacuation decision-making process and interventions such as incentives to evacuate, (2) understand behaviors (e.g., sharing resources and information) that will aid people who remain behind (i.e., do not evacuate) to better survive the hurricane and its aftermath [we call this improved coping ability resiliency], and (3) develop a web-based application (i.e., web app) to aid people in need of assistance during a hurricane event.\r\n\n\nOur six-year $450k funded effort resulted in 38 papers published with 14 students, totaling 57 student-papers (some papers have multiple student authors). These students span every student category from community college undergraduates through post doctoral researchers. Consequently, the above work goes to furthering science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education. The papers, grouped into nine technical topics, span theoretical computer science, modeling of cooperative (i.e., resource-sharing) games with data, modeling and analysis of social psychology phenomena using data, building models to account for human evacuation behavior in natural disasters, infrastructure resiliency, and a web app for improving human resiliency in natural disasters by collecting in situ data in realtime.\r\n\n\nWe have demonstrated through simulation, based on observations in the literature, that police reassuring homeowners that they will patrol neighborhoods during a disaster will encourage more people to evacuate because this will allay fears of looting. We have studied infrastructure resiliency, showing how analyses can help determine the state of infrastructure components (e.g., electric power tower, substation) after a disaster, without manually interrogating every component. These could help utilities to more quickly understand the state of their infrastructure and enable them to make better choices in prioritizing and sequencing resources to bring back online. We have studied cooperation among human game players, looking at differences in human performance and how individual performance affects group performance. These results have analogs in resource sharing during disasters, to improve neighborhood resiliency. Finally, we have built a web app for people to help each other by sharing information and resources in a natural disaster. While this web app requires further testing, it is more than a prototypeit is a functioning web app. If it were to be used in natural disasters, policy planners could learn a lot about how people behave during disasters, e.g., inferring peoples priorities by what actions they take. This is because all user interactions on the web app are time stamped and stored in a database. It is our belief that this work should continue, even if not by the authors. It could have major long-term positive impacts on societal well-being through, for example, better policies driven by greater understanding of human behavior in crises. The idea for the web app came from Pallab Mozumder of Florida International University and the overall Project Principal Investigator for this multi-university collaboration.\r\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/22/2025\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: ChristopherKuhlman\n"
