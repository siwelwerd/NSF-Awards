 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Networking Technology and Systems Early-Career Investigators (NeTS-ECI) Workshop will provide NeTS researchers an opportunity to understand, engage with, and address the challenges associated with developing and executing a research agenda as a new Principal Investigator (PI) in the domain of computer and information networking. NeTS-ECI allows early-career researchers to interact with their peers as well as leaders in the space, in interactive discussions and hands-on breakout activities aimed at developing all aspects of their career from developing research agendas to advising students to long-horizon research success. Each participant will have the opportunity to provide research materials and a short research pitch which will be presented at the workshop and discussed with their peers and mentors with expertise in the space. We expect the workshop will facilitate collaborative network, collaborations, and professional development. The output of the workshop will be a report summarizing the presentations, breakouts, and discussions. The workshop has historically, and will continue, to play an important role in developing early-career researchers in computer and information networking.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
