 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Improving Undergraduate STEM Education: Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSI Program), this Educational Instrumentation project at the University of Puerto Rico at Carolina (UPRCa) will strengthen undergraduate learning in mechanical engineering, instrumentation and control systems, and mechatronic engineering technology. Specifically, this project will secure integrated instrumentation stations with sensors, PLCs, panel views, and visualization systems, which will allow students to gain hands-on experience in configuring, calibrating, and maintaining instrumentation systems oriented towards implementing the Internet of Things (IoT)in courses such as Instrumentation and Controls/ Instrumentation and Controls Laboratory, Sensors and actuators, and Fundamentals of Instrumentation/ Fundamentals of Instrumentation Laboratory. An estimated 70 students and 5 faculty will utilize the project-funded equipment each year. In addition to providing improved experiences in engineering technology courses, the new equipment will also be used in undergraduate research projects and recruitment efforts (such as laboratory tours and equipment demonstrations), and to showcase advanced technology in the field.\r\n\r\nThe goals of this project are to enrich the learning and experiences of undergraduate students by upgrading critical instrumentation equipment and software in mechanical engineering, instrumentation and control, and mechatronics engineering technology. The project will assess the impact of the project funded equipment using course assessments, student surveys, student performance data, and faculty self-assessments. The integration of advanced instrumentation technologies is crucial for preparing students for the demands of Industry 4.0 and smart factories, where real-time monitoring, control, and optimization are essential. \r\n\r\nThis project for HSI program funding, aims to enhance undergraduate STEM education, broaden participation in STEM, and increase capacity to engage in the development and implementation of innovations to improve STEM teaching and learning at Hispanic-Serving Institutions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
