 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact of this I-Corps project is the development of an adsorbent technology that aims to remove perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) from water. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has set a health advisory limit for perfluorooctanoic acid, perfluorooctane sulphonate, perfluorobutanoic acid, and Genx chemicals levels in drinking water that should not exceed single digit parts per trillion (ppt) concentrations. However, current water treatment utilities lack PFAS separation technologies. To meet this requirement, there is a need for effective separation solutions to remove these chemicals from water. This technology presents is a class of aerogel adsorbent media for removal of PFAS for applications in water, wastewater, and industrial effluent water treatment. The goal is to reduce PFAS-contaminated drinking water for the 66% of the U.S. population that is exposed to these chemicals.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of gel and aerogel adsorbent media to promote rapid adsorption of EPA-listed perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) molecules from water.  The adsorbent media have an open-pore architecture with a high specific surface area that adsorbs PFAS with an efficiency approaching 99%. The preliminary research has shown that the media may be tuned to reduce a wide range of PFAS molecules to concentrations below the EPA-mandated limits, outperforming conventional sorbent media. The technology is appropriate for wastewater treatment or residential filters. The polymer gels and aerogels appropriate for this project include, but are not limited to, syndiotactic polystyrene, polyimide, polyurea, polyurethane, and chitosan. Three properties are under evaluation including specific surface area, tunable affinity for different types of PFAS molecules, and the number of small pores that enable confinement of the adsorbed PFAS molecules within the polymer gel. The affinity will be created from the chemical makeup of the gel or from molecular cavities that form.  the gel will be fabricated in different shapes and sizes for easy installation into commercial filtration setups. The technology has the potential to reduce PFAS levels down to EPA limits with rapid kinetics and high selectivity towards short and long chain PFAS molecules.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
