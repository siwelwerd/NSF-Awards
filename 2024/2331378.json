 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Southern Mississippi (USM) located in Hattiesburg, MS is leading a systematic and data-driven approach to develop a novel model (U-Model) in order to establish a more innovative research culture at USM. This project will help foster greater translational research activities that prepare USM students for non-academic careers, accelerate access to university products and services, and strengthen Mississippi\u2019s entrepreneurial ecosystem. Achieving these goals supports Mississippi\u2019s knowledge-based economy and promotes the comparative advantages of the state\u2019s industries.\r\n\r\nUSM will demonstrate the efficacy of the U-Model for supporting higher translational research activities through the implementation of short-term projects and long-term institutional programs that (1) promote human behaviors to shift research culture, (2) increase capacity to enhance innovation, and (3) create inclusive education and training programs that are engaging to women and minorities. University of Arizona, nationally recognized for its very high translational research activities ecosystem, will serve as USM\u2019s mentor institution. Also, Jackson State University, a fellow Mississippi Research Consortium member, will assist USM with the development of inclusive education and training programs.\r\n\r\nThis project is jointly funded by the Technology, Innovation, and Partnerships (TIP) Directorate, the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), the IUSE program in the Division of Undergraduate Education (DUE) and the NSF Research Traineeship (NRT) programs in the EDU Directorate, as well as ENG, SBE, and MPS Directorates.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
