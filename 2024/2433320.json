 "awd_abstract_narration": "Field stations represent crucial sites where the application of FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) principles\u2014concepts designed to improve metadata preparation and ensure that research data is both discoverable and interoperable\u2014can significantly impact local communities by advancing research and innovation. These stations are essential for collecting primary data across various disciplines and present a unique opportunity to enhance community development through improved research practices. One of the primary challenges in field-based research is the efficient management of physical samples, which is vital for data integrity and the integration of different data types. This project has identified significant inefficiencies in how samples are cataloged and managed at these stations, affecting data retention and quality, as well as the integration of sample data with experimental data in adherence to FAIR principles.\r\n\r\nA key challenge in field-based research is the efficient management of physical samples, crucial for data integrity and the integration of various data types. The \"FAIR Samples\" project aims to refine the process of managing these samples from the ground up, emphasizing the integration of FAIR principles into the existing workflows of researchers. The project will explore how a Persistent Identifier (PID)-enabled sample management system can interoperate with other research tools to streamline the entire sample lifecycle.\r\n\r\nThis award by the Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure within the Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering is jointly supported by the Division of Research, Innovation, Synergies, and Education within the Directorate for Geosciences.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
