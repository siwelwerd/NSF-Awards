 "awd_abstract_narration": "Von Neumann algebras arose in the 1930s as a mathematical framework for quantum mechanics. In classical mechanics it is possible to simultaneously observe and measure various properties of a physical system \u2014 for example, the locations and velocities of all of its components. Such properties are often called observables.  Observables be viewed as functions of the underlying system and form an algebra \u2014 they can be added and multiplied.   In quantum mechanics, simultaneous measurements are no longer possible. Mathematically this is reflected by the non-commutativity of the algebra of observables for quantum systems. Nonetheless, many of the operations that can be done with ordinary functions have quantum analogs.  The current proposal studies such non-commutative algebras of observables from the angle of Voiculescu\u2019s free probability theory, which treats observables as random variables. This results in an extremely rich theory that leads to free probability generalizations of classical objects such as partial differential equations and Brownian motion, amenable to analysis by techniques inspired by classical information theory.  This project will promote human resource development through graduate and undergraduate research opportunities and will support students under the auspices of the UCLA Olga Radko Endowed Math Circle.  \r\n\r\nThe proposed research deals with several questions in von Neumann algebras which are approached by free probability and free information methods, including free entropy theory.  This includes further developing PDE based methods in the non-commutative context and strengthening the connection between free probability and random matrix theory.  Among the research directions is a notion of dimension that is based on the behavior of optimal transportation distance, as well as applications of free information theory techniques to von Neumann algebra theory. The project includes a mixture of problems, some coming from existing research directions and some exploring new lines of inquiry.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
