The meeting's website is https://www.unive.it/web/en/2208/home. The ISBA World Meetings are the largest conferences in Bayesian statistics, attracting attendees from all around the world. The travel awards, averaging $800 per person, will partially offset the cost of travelling to Venice from the US, helping PhD students and other junior researchers to participate in the meeting. The selection committee will prioritize funding female researchers and members of minority groups underrepresented in the field.\r\n \r\nThe 2024 ISBA World Meeting will feature keynote talks, invited and contributed talks, poster sessions, and short courses, selected to showcase cutting-edge research in Bayesian statistics. Attendance at the meeting will offer attendees a chance to learn about emerging research topics in Bayesian statistics. In addition, the scientific committee has selected as part of the program multiple talks and posters by junior researchers. This offers junior researchers an opportunity to share their research with an international audience of Bayesian statisticians.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
