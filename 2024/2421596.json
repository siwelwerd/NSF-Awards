 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nontechnical description\r\nQuantum information science exploits the laws of quantum mechanics and has the potential to produce fascinating technologies that would impact many aspects of our lives. In analogy to the classical binary bits used in today\u2019s information technology, the fundamental unit in quantum information science is the so-called quantum bits (or qubits), which are coherent superposition of quantum mechanical states. This research aims to deepen current understanding of electron spins in low-dimensional materials and develop material design principles that could lead to new types of qubits. The research project provides multidisciplinary training opportunities for graduate students and postdoctoral researchers in the areas of material science and quantum optics. It also serves as an exciting opportunity for the training of our next-generation workforce in quantum information science.  \r\n\r\nTechnical description\r\nThe goal of the proposed research is to develop a material design principle for creating spin-active quantum defects in a one-dimensional host and explore their potential for spin qubits. In the first stage of the proposed work, the research team will focus on the design and fundamental studies of the quantum defects. In particular, the team will investigate the influences of the defects\u2019 atomic structures and chemical compositions on their spin manifolds and coherence properties, with the goal of obtaining general design principles that govern spin properties. Quantum operations of the spin qubits will be carried out after the initial design and optimization of the defect structures.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
