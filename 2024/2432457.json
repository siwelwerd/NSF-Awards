 "awd_abstract_narration": "Artificial intelligence (AI) offers potential benefits for the design and operation of bioprocesses. This workshop will bring 150 participants from academia and industry to Los Angeles on Sept. 26-27. They will develop recommendations for bioscience-related AI education and training strategies. Graduate students, post-docs, and early career academics will provide a strong voice as practitioners learning and using cutting edge technology. \r\n\r\nInteractive talks and round-table discussions will be used. Talks focused on emerging trends in AI for bioprocessing will set the tone for the workshop. Subsequent talks and round table discussions will touch on various aspects of curriculum development and delivery. Prominently featured will be discussions regarding the development of case studies and best practices for AI implementation, addressing ethical and regulatory considerations, and enhancing diversity and inclusion in AI education programs. An important component will be industry-academia collaboration in developing, delivering, and evaluating education and training strategies. The involvement of industrial moderators for the round table discussions and the crafting of roadmaps from those discussions is a unique strategy that will provide a practical perspective on industrial expectations for the use of AI tools.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
