 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is to provide the University of California, Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO) funds for Oceanographic Instrumentation that is needed to carry out NSF-supported scientific research. Working within the collaborative framework of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS), the proposed instrumentation will be maintained by the SIO Ship Technical Services department for use by researchers from institutions nationwide who require these oceanographic facilities. SIO will add a Seabird SBE 9 CTD unit, 2 altimeters, 3 PAR sensors, 2 altimeters, and 4 oxygen sensors to the CTD instrumentation package available to all SIO's research vessels. This would ensure continuous availability of the widely used CTD systems and minimization of interruptions in science missions requiring this equipment. Also, SIO will obtain one new MC-800 multicorer and refurbish another to support the coring capability that is in increasing demand from the scientific community. Finally, funds provided would be used to upgrade the underway pCO2 systems installed on the R/V Roger Ravelle and R/V Sally Ride.\r\n\r\nThe principal impact of the present proposal is under Merit Review Criterion 2 of the Proposal Guidelines (NSF 23-525). It provides infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF). The acquisition, maintenance, and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or other organization access to well-maintained, high-quality, calibrated instruments for their research. It ensures collection of high-quality oceanographic data in support of science, reduces the cost of that research, and expands the base of potential researchers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
