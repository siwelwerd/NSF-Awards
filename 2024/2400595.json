 "awd_abstract_narration": "Both children and adults often display essentialist biases\u2014assuming that groups, such as biological species, are uniform in their features\u2014which can lead them to underestimate variability within-species and across generations. This project will examine learners\u2019 understandings of biological variability, a key foundational concept in biology education, that is linked to understanding genetics and inheritance. The researchers will investigate the connection between children\u2019s essentialist biases and their reasoning about the extent and dimensions of biological variability within species. The researchers will conduct a longitudinal study with four to twelve year old children and with adults to chart a clearer picture of how ideas about trait variability develop. This research will provide new insights into children\u2019s categorization of species and into changes in children\u2019s understanding of biological variability that occur with age and experience. This could ultimately allow educators to develop science education interventions targeted to individuals that are designed to increase students' understanding of this core biological concept and to allow understanding of biological variability and genetic inheritance to be evaluated more precisely. This project is supported by the ECR program which supports fundamental research that generates foundational knowledge that advances the research literatures in STEM learning and learning environments, broadening participation in STEM, and STEM workforce development.\r\n\r\nThis proposal will investigate the development of learners' beliefs about biological variability in terms of phenotypic traits and their inheritance. Current methods in educational research for assessing students\u2019 understanding of variability are typically cognitively demanding and time-consuming and have only been able to capture a coarse picture of children\u2019s notions of biological variability. This proposal will introduce a cutting-edge method of mathematical modelling called Markov Chain Monte Carlo with People (MCMCp), an adaptive computer algorithm designed to assess and explore individuals' understanding of biological categories more accurately. MCMCp infers how representative or probable individual category members are in an individual\u2019s category representation. It does this without having to specify all experimental stimuli a priori. Instead, the method explores children\u2019s notions of representativeness adaptively\u2013 that is, it uses the learner\u2019s previous responses in the task to inform which stimuli should be presented to the learner next. Using this approach will enable a more precise characterization of children\u2019s and adults\u2019 species concepts and the extent to which they accept variability in phenotypic expression within a species. The researchers will assess learner\u2019s assumptions about within-species variability across a range of traits and organisms as well as their assumptions about genetic variability--variation between parents and offspring. They will also study non-animal categories (one natural kind, one artifact) to understand whether and how essentialist biases apply to non-biological kinds as well as biological kinds. This research will lay a foundation for designing effective, individualized early education curricula for central biological concepts.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
