 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMP) program assists universities and colleges in their efforts to significantly increase the numbers of students matriculating into and successfully completing high quality degree programs in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) disciplines to diversify the STEM workforce. Particular emphasis is placed on transforming undergraduate STEM education through innovative, evidence-based recruitment and retention strategies, and relevant educational experiences in support of all students no matter their background. These strategies facilitate the production of well-prepared, highly qualified, and motivated undergraduate student graduates who pursue graduate education and/or careers in STEM.\r\n\r\nFor the United States to remain globally competitive, it is vital that it includes the talent of all its citizens and provides exceptional educational preparedness in STEM areas that underpin the knowledge-based economy. The Southern Central Illinois Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (SCI-LSAMP) program has formed an alliance in response to the need for a more diverse and skilled technical workforce. That need still exists and is particularly acute in Illinois. The institutions that make up the Alliance include the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (the lead institution), Bradley University, Illinois State University, Illinois Wesleyan University, Southern Illinois University-Carbondale, and Western Illinois University. Through this project, the Alliance will implement activities to improve academic performance, build community, ease transitions from undergraduate to graduate education or careers in STEM. By the end of the project, SCI-LSAMP will have made a transformational impact on numerous students in the central and southern part of Illinois, providing valuable cross-institutional knowledge on effective and sustainable strategies to facilitate seamless transitions and strengthen the persistence and success of all students in STEM, thereby increasing retention and graduation rates.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
