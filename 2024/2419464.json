 "awd_abstract_narration": "The transition to adulthood is an important period of human development that is characterized by changes in nearly every area of life, including education, friendships, and family life. Despite the importance of this developmental period, little is known about how neurobiological and contextual factors support transition towards greater independence in adulthood. This study advances understanding of factors that support successful transition from adolescence to adulthood by longitudinally measuring brain development, social support, and global functioning (wellbeing in terms of school, work, relationships, and health) in a diverse sample of youth 17-19 years of age. \r\n\r\nThis project uses a prospective longitudinal multi-method design to examine factors that promote healthy development during transition to adulthood. Researchers use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), behavioral measures and questionnaires to test the prediction that (1) neural function associated with extreme levels (too little or too much) of reward sensitivity and tolerance for ambiguous threat is associated with worse global functioning relative to moderate levels of reward sensitivity and tolerance for ambiguous threat, and that (2) social support from parents and friends moderates the link between neural sensitivity to reward and ambiguous threat and global functioning. The project examines these factors in a sample of young people as they transition out of high school or General Education Development programs, following project participants for a period of three years. The outcomes of this research advance understanding of how young people move toward healthy adult lives, and can inform policies and programs aimed at supporting emerging adult independence and success.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
