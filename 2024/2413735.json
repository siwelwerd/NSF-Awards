 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact of this I-Corps project is the development of a Simultaneous Musculoskeletal Assessment with Real-Time Ultrasound technology that enables muscle function monitoring during athletic training and rehabilitation post-musculoskeletal injuries. This innovation enables quantitative, metricized tracking of rehabilitation effectiveness, thereby enhancing the patient's recovery progress using non-invasive muscle-level imaging. Developments in such wearable ultrasound technologies can potentially transform athlete rehabilitation and military personnel training. By enabling real-time objective evaluations of muscle response to rehabilitation programs, the technology could shorten recovery periods in varied ways. For sports medicine staff, it could be used as a tool for fine-tuning return to play by monitoring rehabilitation post musculoskeletal injury in athletes. Similarly, military training centers could leverage this tool to measure new recruits' training and monitor a warfighter's muscle readiness pre- and post-mission, using specific fatigue biomarkers. This multifaceted approach to monitoring rehabilitation outcomes and operational readiness could be applied to medical rehabilitation, athlete performance optimization, and military training efficiency.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. The solution is based on the development of a Simultaneous Musculoskeletal Assessment with Real-Time Ultrasound system that enables detailed muscle-level assessments during rehabilitation exercises, without obstructing human movement. This system combines the utility of ultrasound imaging with the flexibility of small, multi-site, non-intrusive wearable sensors\u2014a capability beyond the reach of conventional hand-held ultrasound systems. This system utilizes motion-mode imaging for subjects during dynamic tasks, unlocking opportunities to discover novel biomarkers and insights into musculoskeletal health and recovery processes in real-time. Ongoing research demonstrates that this innovation offers a reliable means to evaluate muscle function during rehabilitation activities, monitor the progression of muscle recovery over time, and deliver precise, real-time objective data on musculoskeletal health.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
