 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-Technical Abstract:\r\nThis project aims to improve our understanding of East Antarctica's solid Earth, ice sheet dynamics, atmosphere, ionosphere, and sea level by enhancing real-time data retrieval using GPS and Iridium technology. By upgrading existing and deploying new GPS receivers across previously unmonitored regions, the project will enable daily data uploads to funded NSF data repositories, ensuring immediate access to crucial information. These efforts will significantly expand the availability of GNSS data, supporting studies on tectonic motion, glacial isostatic adjustment, and ice sheet mass changes. The project also addresses gaps in atmospheric and ionospheric research, impacting climate predictions and space weather studies. By making data freely accessible through NSF data repositories, this initiative promotes global collaboration and enhances our ability to monitor and understand Antarctica's environmental changes.\r\n\r\nTechnical Abstract\r\nThis proposal aims to enhance observational capabilities in East Antarctica through the deployment of Iridium communications systems and upgrade of Australian GNSS networks in Antarctica, facilitating near-real-time data retrieval and analysis at a fraction of the cost of US deployment of similar GNSS systems. Approximately 10 existing GNSS sites will be upgraded with new Iridium cards, while 20 new receivers will be deployed to expand coverage into previously unobserved regions. Daily data downloads to NSF funded data repositoris will provide immediate access to GNSS observations to US investigatiors, crucial for studying tectonic motion, glacial isostatic adjustment, and ice sheet mass changes. The project will validate geophysical models and improve estimates of ice sheet mass balance, particularly in regions underrepresented in current datasets. Furthermore, the initiative will advance atmospheric and ionospheric research, contributing to climate modeling and space weather predictions. Collaboration with international partners will ensure data interoperability and strengthen global scientific efforts in Antarctic research. The broader impacts include societal benefits through improved sea level rise predictions and enhanced resilience against climate change impacts.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
