 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-Technical Abstract:\r\nIon transport in solid-state materials underpins a wide range of societally relevant technologies. With this CAREER award, supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program in NSF\u2019s Division of Materials Research, the principal investigator and her research group investigate the use of dynamic molecular species as a design principle to facilitate solid-state ion transport. Through targeted materials discovery coupled with state-of-the-art characterization of structure and molecular dynamics, this project unravels the rich and complex mechanisms of ion transport in a class of solid-state ion conductors that has not received a lot of attention so far. Given the essential and ubiquitous role of solid-state ion transport in modern and emerging technologies, this work holds the potential for far-reaching and transformative fundamental and technological advances, for example in the areas of renewable energy technology, neuromorphic computing, and beyond. Also part of this CAREER award are educational efforts to engage learners at all levels through development of a publicly available video series that presents materials chemistry concepts in short episodes for audiences of varying educational levels and backgrounds. Outreach activities seek to broaden participation in STEM through an inquiry-based materials chemistry detective activity aimed at underserved high schools in the Denver metro area.\r\n\r\nTechnical Abstract:\r\nMastery over solid-state ion transport is paramount for broad diversity of applications and technologies, including batteries, fuel cells, neuromorphic computing, and beyond. With this CAREER award, supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program in NSF\u2019s Division of Materials Research, the principal investigator establishes a unique class of solid-state ion conductors and materials design principles that expand the present paradigm surrounding the role of polarizability and molecular dynamics in ion transport in the crystalline solid state. Experimental efforts integrate targeted materials discovery, advanced structural modeling through X-ray and neutron total scattering, and cutting-edge characterization of dynamics and diffusion to understand how dynamic, dipolar species facilitate solid-state ion transport across time and length scales. Educational tools and outreach activities engage learners at all levels with core concepts in materials chemistry. A video series presents materials chemistry concepts at varying levels of technical detail that are accessible to learners at multiple levels. STEM outreach seeks to engage high school students from underserved schools in an inquiry-based materials detective game in which students explore and develop an understanding of the relationships between composition, atomic-level structure, and observable properties in solid-state materials.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
