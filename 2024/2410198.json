 "awd_abstract_narration": "The quantum internet promises to transform communication and sensing as we know it today with potential to redefine information security. Quantum networks will be complex and heterogeneous while being very sensitive to loss. There are several outstanding challenges that need to be overcome before a large-scale quantum network can meaningfully connect users, computers, and sensors. The lack of low-loss and scalable quantum optical devices such as quantum optical sources and memories is a major obstacle in building a large-scale quantum network. Another challenge is efficient and multiplexed generation, storage and distribution of quantum information (e.g. entanglement). Moreover, network elements should be compatible in terms of operational modes, e.g. wavelength and bandwidth. This CAREER proposal focuses on studying novel solid-state quantum photonic devices and takes key initial steps towards multiplexed quantum communication. \r\n\r\nThe PI will investigate nonlinear interaction of electromagnetic fields with engineered materials for quantum network applications. Wafer-scale Lithium Niobate On Insulator (LNOI) materials are proposed as novel hosts for optical centers in solids to create integrated platforms and study linear and nonlinear light-matter interactions in the quantum regime. Thulium (Tm) ions incorporated into LNOI crystals will be considered as active media for controlling quantum optical information. Lithium niobate as a host for Tm ions provides an opportunity for on-chip integration and design of multifunctional devices where high-speed frequency tuning and integrated nonlinearity creates a versatile platform for photonic information processing. The integrated photonic platform based on LNOI together with the broadband absorption spectrum of Tm ions can enable multiplexed (or multimode) quantum information processing. To investigate the feasibility of this approach, the PI will study multimode photon generation, coherent and reversible absorption near 800nm wavelength. He will explore how the interaction Hamiltonian can be engineered by controlling external electric/magnetic fields and spatial coherence among atoms to optimize the quantum interface.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
