 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funding for the second Riverside Workshop on Geometric Group Theory, which is to be held May 3-6, 2024, at the University of California Riverside. This workshop will feature three minicourses given by early-career mathematicians working in the field of geometric group theory. This is an active area of research lying at the interface of geometry, algebra, and dynamical systems, with many applications especially to low-dimensional topology, and which has seen many break-through results over the past decades.  The topic of each minicourse will be a cutting-edge technique or idea developed by the speaker, with an audience of graduate students and postdocs in mind. Each speaker will also produce an expository paper on the topic of their minicourse, and these papers will be compiled into a book, mirroring the 2023 version of the activity.\r\n\r\nMuch of the machinery in geometric group theory is highly technical, and so graduate students looking to enter the field will benefit from careful exposition of the big ideas of the field in lecture series that elaborate extensively on background and examples. The invited minicourse speakers are: Abdalrazzaq Zalloum (University of Toronto), who will speak on the geometry of CAT(0) and injective spaces; Emily Stark (Wesleyan University), who will speak on boundaries of groups; and Inhyeok Choi (Korea Institute for Advanced Study), who will speak on random walks on groups and their applications. The website of the workshop is https://sites.google.com/view/rivggt24/home.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
