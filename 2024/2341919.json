 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will contribute to our understanding of gradient sensing, the ability of cells to sense small differences in chemical concentration across their surfaces, and thereby locate the source of the stimulus. This phenomenon is essential for the development and health of all organisms. The PI uses yeast cells as a model to study the molecular mechanisms underlying gradient sensing, which are thought to be broadly applicable to cells in more complex organisms. In previous studies, he discovered a \u201cgradient tracking machine\u201d that cells must assemble before they are able to sense the direction of the chemical source. In this investigation, he will continue to investigate how this machine functions to decode chemical gradients. During this project period, the PI and his senior research specialist will mentor select biology students from the City Colleges of Chicago, to enhance their chances of graduating from a four-year institution with a BS in a STEM field. The proposed undergraduate research and mentoring program is designed to inspire, instruct, advise, and support underrepresented students who are interested in a STEM career. Two outstanding candidates will be chosen to participate each year based on their academic potential and motivation to pursue a STEM major at a four-year institution. By participating in regular tutoring sessions, paid summer research internships in the PI\u2019s lab, and public outreach events, students will gain experience conducting scientific research, an ability to critically evaluate the research of others, and practice presenting their work. This program is expected to increase the chances of eight students to succeed as science majors at four-year institutions. The investigation will also provide the PI's students with interdisciplinary training through interactions with collaborators who are experts in diverse areas.\r\n\r\nThe best-known gradient-stimulated cellular outputs, chemotaxis (directed cell movement), and chemotropism (directed cell growth), are required for a wide range of biological processes. Although they ultimately exhibit quite different behavior, chemotactic and chemotropic cells face similar challenges: the responding cell must sense small differences in chemical concentration across its surface, determine the direction of the gradient source, and polarize its cytoskeleton toward it. The mating response of the budding yeast S. cerevisiae is chemotropic: mating cells interpret complex pheromone gradients and polarize their growth in the direction of the closest partner. Like many chemosensing cells, yeasts use G protein-coupled receptors to detect chemoattractant. The goal of this project is to understand how yeast cells accurately sense direction in shallow, complex, and dynamic pheromone gradients. Based on discoveries made in a previous project, the PI published a deterministic model of gradient sensing that explains, in broad terms, how yeast cells translate a vanishingly small differential of activated receptors across their surfaces into accurate and robust directional responses. Mating yeast initially ignore the pheromone gradient, as they first colocalize signaling, polarity, and trafficking proteins to the default polarity site they use for budding, building a \u201cgradient tracking machine\u201d (GTM). Once assembled, the GTM moves along the plasma membrane to the point of maximal pheromone concentration, where it marks the chemotropic site used for mating. The primary negative regulator of G-protein signaling, the RGS protein Sst2, is essential for this process, and phosphorylation of one of the G-protein subunits (Gbetagamma)plays a critical role. The priorities of this investigation are to learn how Sst2 is controlled in space and time, how the phosphorylation of the G protein subunit contributes to gradient tracking, and how dynamic intercommunication between GTMs enables mating partners to orient toward a common fusion site. These questions will be answered using imaging, genetic, biochemical, proteomic, and computational approaches.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
