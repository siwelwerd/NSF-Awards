 "awd_abstract_narration": "Flooding is a significant challenge with impacts that are unevenly distributed across communities in the United States. This Research Coordination Network (RCN) addresses the urgent issue of flood injustice by examining the social, economic, and environmental factors that contribute to unequal flood risks and recovery outcomes. Communities of color and those of low socioeconomic status are often disproportionately affected by flooding due to historical inequities and inadequate infrastructure. This project aims to bring together researchers, policymakers, and community organizations to identify and address flood injustice through collaborative research and action. By focusing on interactions between the built environment, natural systems, and social vulnerability, the project seeks to inform public policy and create more equitable flood management strategies, benefiting communities nationwide. It also aims to enhance public understanding of flood risks and empower communities through education and engagement by creating educational opportunities and collaboration among students, researchers, and community members. \r\n\r\nThe network will synthesize data and insights, catalyze action, and advance knowledge on how flood injustice is shaped by interactions between social, natural, and engineered systems. The project will focus on two main research themes: (1) mechanisms of urban development and climate change that shape flood risk futures; and (2) broadening participation and co-production of place-based research to address flood justice. Key activities include hosting workshops that leverage the thematic expertise of steering committee members, fostering collaboration and knowledge sharing among participants. The network will engage diverse community perspectives by incorporating non-profit organizations and government representatives on the steering committee, facilitating workshops that develop strategies for flood justice. The network will also actively involve graduate students, providing opportunities to engage in convergence research and develop skills necessary for addressing complex social and environmental issues. By advancing the integration of justice into Earth System Science, this project will contribute to more equitable flood mitigation and recovery policies, promoting social equity and resilience in flood-prone communities across the United States. Additionally, by focusing on the role of natural infrastructure in mitigating flood risks and examining the financial and social dynamics of flood risk futures, the project will inform equitable urban planning and policy decisions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
