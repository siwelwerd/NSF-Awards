 "awd_abstract_narration": "The three-year renewal REU Site: Transformational Technologies for Next Generation Aerospace Systems is hosted by Florida State University in collaboration with Florida A&M University. This REU site engages 10 students each year in research on advanced aerospace systems, including the theoretical formulation, computational simulation, and experimental validation of design and development. The multidisciplinary nature of these projects will engage students in cross-cutting technologies through their specific research and group activities. Participants will engage with a series of hands-on learning modules on advanced fluid flow diagnostics and wind tunnel testing techniques. The student cohort will be recruited to participate in research activities to prepare them for advanced degrees and/or professional careers in aerospace-related fields. The students will work on individualized projects and participate in group activities such as seminars, lab/industry tours, outreach, and development of learning modules.  \r\n\r\nThe three-year renewal REU Site: Transformational Technologies for Next Generation Aerospace Systems is hosted by Florida State University in collaboration with Florida A&M University. This REU site engages 10 students each year in research on advanced aerospace systems, including the theoretical formulation, computational simulation, and experimental validation of design and development. The multidisciplinary nature of these projects will engage students in cross-cutting technologies through their specific research and group activities. As pointed out by various news reports, the increasing global competition is due to (1) the aging of the current aerospace workforce, (2) the fact that aerospace and related engineering and science fields do not attract enough top students to STEM disciplines, and (3) recent declining trends of engineering graduates going into aerospace fields. The proposed REU site, while combining the strengths of a major research university at Florida State University and an HBCU at Florida A&M University, has many faculty members with established track records in both scholarly activities and recruitment and education of broad cohorts of engineering students. We will coordinate with other ongoing undergraduate student training programs for joint recruitment, professional training, and group activities. Participants will engage with a series of hands-on learning modules on advanced fluid flow diagnostics and wind tunnel testing techniques. The student cohort will be recruited to participate in research activities to prepare them for advanced degrees and/or professional careers in aerospace-related fields. The students will work on individualized projects and participate in group activities such as seminars, lab/industry tours, outreach, and development of learning modules.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis site is supported by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
