 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nuclear physicists who seek to stay in academia aim for permanent positions as university faculty or lab scientists. Those positions require one to conduct and lead research, but also to supervise students/postdocs in their work. Most will draw on their experiences as students, but mentoring is more than just guiding a research project. Just as most physics faculty candidates come without any training in teaching, most physicists enter their permanent positions with no mentoring training.  The PIs of this award will lead twenty-two (22) early career physicists in an 8-hour mentoring workshop that will precede the American Physical Society (APS) Division of Nuclear Physics (DNP) 2024 meeting in Boston, MA. The mentoring workshop will explore aspects that contribute to successful mentor/mentee relationships, help participants develop effective mentoring practices, and build a mentoring network.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
