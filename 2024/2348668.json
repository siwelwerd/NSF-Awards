 "awd_abstract_narration": "The award funds Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program at the School of Physics and Astronomy of the University of Minnesota\u2019s Twin Cities campus. It will enable ten undergraduate physics and astronomy majors to take part in cutting edge research by participating in a ten-week summer program. Each student will work in a research group, supervised by a faculty member, making the transition from classroom instruction to state-of-the-art research, from mastering old knowledge to creating a new one. The project enhances opportunities for development and education for the involved students, on the one hand, and advances the progress of science, on the other. An additional focus emphasizes diversity,  participation of students from underrepresented groups, and first-generation college students. The majority of participants will come from smaller colleges, where they do not have the opportunity to participate in front-line research during the regular academic year. By encouraging students to participate in scientific research, particularly students from non-Ph.D. granting institutions, the summer REU program addresses a critical national need for skilled employees in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) fields. \r\n\r\nThe specific projects will be in astrophysics, cosmology, high-energy physics, condensed matter,  biophysics and space physics. Most of the student projects are anticipated to be in the area of experiment and data analysis. Some projects may focus on theoretical aspects of the areas listed above. A variety of career advancing experiences, such as regular seminars, workshops, excursions, etc will be offered.  This award is co-funded by the Division of Physics and the Division of Materials Research within the NSF Mathematics and Physical Sciences Directorate.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
