 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded by the Major Research Instrumentation Program and the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program. Professor Jordan Boothe from the University of Pittsburgh at Greensburg, on behalf of 3 investigators in two departments across the Division of Natural Sciences, Mathematics, and Engineering, is acquiring a benchtop, permanent magnet 100 MHz nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer. Closely related to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) used in the medical field, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) functions as an analytical method to help determine the structure of molecules too small for detection with the naked eye. Alongside infrared spectroscopy (IR) and mass spectrometry (MS), NMR is used to triangulate data about molecular compounds (and mixtures of compounds) and elucidate structural properties including molecular shape and orientation. NMR uses a high-powered magnetic field to align nuclei of a specific atom or atoms and subjects them to a series of electromagnetic pulses. Based on the reaction of these atoms to the pulses, as well as the relationships between multiple nuclei of the same atom, or multiple nuclei of different atoms (e.g., 1H and 13C) allows for more precise structural determination for the development of a wide range of organic research including \u2013 but not limited to \u2013biotechnology, agriculture, medicine, polymer science, clinical diagnostics, and environmental science. Additionally, this acquisition strengthens both the research infrastructure at Pitt-Greensburg as well as instructional infrastructure. The instrument broadens participation by giving hands-on access to a diverse student population. As a benchtop permanent-magnet instrument, this NMR is easily accessible for teaching in a variety of upper- and lower-level courses, and easy enough to use for outreach activities for the University.\r\n\r\nThe award is aimed at enhancing research and structural education at all levels of undergraduate instruction and research. It especially impacts studies correlating molecular structure and orientation. Use of NMR in research on chemical and biochemical systems is foundational to much of our understanding of molecular structure, with NMR frequently covered as part of the introductory organic chemistry curriculum and revisited throughout later analytical and advanced organic/upper-level coursework. Traditional NMR instruments rely on cryogenic liquids (e.g., liquid helium, sometimes combined with liquid nitrogen) for magnet cooling. Recent advances in benchtop, permanent magnet instruments have provided significantly higher resolution, greater sensitivity, and substantial increase in accessibility for both researchers and introductory student usage. The instrument awarded from this grant will allow for students in introductory organic chemistry classes and analytical chemistry classes all the way through undergraduate senior research capstone projects to characterize molecules, learn fundamental techniques, and provides probes for both 1H and 13C nuclei at 100 MHz resolution. Molecules may be characterized with traditional one-dimensional spectra or two-dimensional experiments such as Correlated Spectroscopy (COSY), Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy (NOESY), and Heteronuclear Single Quantum Coherence (HSQC). Undergraduate students at Pitt-Greensburg work on a diverse set of research projects including water-based organic catalysis, development of novel additives for microalgal biofuels, and the development and the elucidation of metabolic pathways for novel psychoactive substances. Additionally, this instrument will be used to continue efforts to better understand undergraduate chemistry education by looking at novel approaches to NMR instruction, labs, and course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs) across the undergraduate curriculum.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
