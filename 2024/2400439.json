 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-technical Abstract: The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) Research Initiation Award supports science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) faculty with no prior or recent research funding to pursue research at the home institution that focuses on strengthening undergraduate education and research. Seated at Howard University, this project seeks to advance understanding of the role of Afrocultural beliefs, practices, and values in teaching and learning in STEM coursework at HBCUs and how they connect with perceptions of classroom climate and sense of belonging for Black students. While the country navigates an increasingly diverse STEM workforce, it will continue to call on Black professionals to provide critical services in numerous fields. However, Black STEM professionals are woefully underrepresented in the workforce. HBCUs are uniquely equipped to answer the call as they are well-documented producers of Black STEM professionals. However, while research points out strong culturally supportive environments as a critical factor in their success, there is a need to explore the specific pedagogical strategies HBCU STEM faculty utilize in teaching Black students. Also, research should explore how students receive and internalize these strategies. Uncovering the use of STEM teaching practices that specifically support the learning of Black students will increase the successful navigation of STEM coursework, enhance Black students\u2019 experiences in STEM majors, and, ultimately, diversify the STEM workforce. \r\n\r\nTechnical Abstract: This project connects the conceptualization of culturally responsive pedagogy with knowledge of the Afrocultural experience to explore STEM teaching and learning of HBCU faculty and students, respectively. This study uses a qualitative approach to answer three research questions: 1) In what ways do HBCU faculty integrate Afroculturally responsive practices into STEM learning environments; 2) What are STEM faculty and students\u2019 perceptions about Afrocultural beliefs and practices and their value in institutions of higher education; and 3) How does the use of Afroculturally responsive practices influence students\u2019 perceptions of class climate and sense of belonging in their STEM courses? Interviews and Focus groups will capture faculty perspectives of their teaching and students\u2019 perceptions of teaching practices and classroom climate. Also, classroom observations serve as a method of triangulating the data between faculty and students\u2019 perceptions of their experiences. This project integrates research and education goals to clarify the role and use of culture in learning contexts for Black college students, especially in STEM coursework where many see these environments as culture-neutral.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
