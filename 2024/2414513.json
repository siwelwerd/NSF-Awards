 "awd_abstract_narration": "Society relies upon technologies such as power distribution systems and constellations of communications satellites for daily functioning. These technologies are susceptible to the effects of magnetic storms and other severe space weather. This project will study what factors lead to space weather in an effort to better predict impacts. Additionally, the work will involve undergraduate students from under-represented groups in STEM in research at a primarily undergraduate institution. Additionally, an Artist in Residence program will be developed to increase general science literacy and to make links between space science and art.\r\n\r\nThe science objective is to determine nonlinear metrics that specify the dynamical state of the magnetosphere prior to the onset of, and during, extreme space weather. The research will investigate and statistically characterize, model, and forecast the spatiotemporal fluctuations of the ground magnetic field using advanced mathematical techniques. The central hypothesis is that space weather associated spatiotemporal fluctuations of the geomagnetic field follow the statistics of intermittency-induced criticality. Data will be used from arrays of ground-based magnetometers from high-to-equatorial latitudes.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
