 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award funds a workshop series that will engage multi-sectoral actors involved in research, testing, development, and deployment of Marine Carbon Dioxide Removal (mCDR) with community engagement scholars and practitioners in relevant domains to help co-develop a roadmap for building informed and involved communities through engagement and information sharing. It will leverage past, current and planned projects, initiatives and coordination efforts at the local, regional and national levels to avoid redundancy and ensure the optimal use of knowledge and resources to ensure that the supply of and demand for usable and actionable science are effectively reconciled. The design and development of the workshops input, output and outcomes will be guided by a multi- sectoral advisory board representing principal drivers of mCDR science and technology in government, industry, non-government, philanthropic and academic organizations. The workshop will inform the current mCDR research, education and policy development, coordination and implementation activities undertaken by government, industry, non-government and academic organizations. It will help in the building of informed and engaged communities for responsible mCDR by mobilizing evidence-based resource allocation and capacity development activities.\r\n\r\nTwo workshops are envisioned over a twelve-month period. The first workshop will socialize state of the science on community building and define the challenges. The second workshop will identify opportunities and the solution pathways and map responsibility for each sectoral actor. The results and outcomes of the workshops, including recommendation for collective and coordinated actions will be synthesized in a final report and disseminated widely through different channels, formats and platforms accessible to target mCDR stakeholders in public, private, philanthropic and non-governmental organizations.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
