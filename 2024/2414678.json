 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project seeks to advance wireless communication by incorporating a cutting-edge type of reconfigurable antenna, known as a dynamic metasurface antenna (DMA), into multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless communication systems. DMAs consist of tightly packed reconfigurable elements that can provide high beamforming gains at very low power. Unlike conventional antennas, DMAs are passive devices that use tunable components to reconfigure each element and achieve a desired response. This project develops methods to integrate DMAs into MIMO communication to form what is called the tri-hybrid MIMO architecture. The main novelty in the tri-hybrid architecture is the integration of digital beamforming, analog beamforming and antenna reconfiguration all together. If successful, this project will facilitate the development of MIMO wireless communication systems with ten times larger apertures than previously deployed in commercial wireless systems like cellular systems. As a result, such systems will be able to serve more users simultaneously with better spectral efficiency and higher data rates than achieved by state-of-the-art commercial systems today. By developing technologies that consume less power and enable the formation of large, dense arrays, this project will contribute to the progress of science and technological innovation in wireless communications and array processing. From a scientific perspective, this project will result in the development to new approaches for dealing with tri-hybrid MIMO architectures that combine elements of signal processing, circuits and electromagnetics. It will also facilitate the development of new approaches for configuring tri-hybrid MIMO links, some that are data-driven and based on machine learning. The outcomes of this project will improve wireless cellular connectivity including data rates and reliability. \r\n \r\nThis research project aims to develop new models, analyses, algorithms, and design insights through the advancement of the tri-hybrid MIMO architecture. The key component of this new MIMO configuration is the use of reconfigurable antennas in the form of DMAs, in conjunction with analog and digital beamforming. The proposed research will develop key aspects of the tri-hybrid MIMO architecture by leveraging tools from communication theory, electromagnetics, and circuit theory. Utilizing existing circuit and antenna models, the project will create MIMO input-output models that accurately capture waveguide attenuation, mutual coupling between elements, and the impact of reconfiguration on the channel. These models will be used to investigate how DMA reconfiguration constraints affect communication performance and to determine necessary adjustments for other signal processing components in MIMO systems. Specialized algorithms will be developed to address key challenges when incorporating DMAs into a MIMO communication architecture, including over-the-air beam calibration and multi-user beam training, utilizing tools such as machine learning. Insights from the analysis and modeling will guide the design of DMA-based transceivers to maximize spectral efficiency and minimize power consumption. Comprehensive evaluations will demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed designs, algorithms, and analyses by leveraging a combination of electromagnetic, circuit, and communication system-level simulations. The outcomes of this research will provide a comprehensive solution for integrating reconfigurable antennas into large-scale MIMO systems, significantly enhancing future wireless communication technologies.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
