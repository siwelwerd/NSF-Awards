 "awd_abstract_narration": "Flexible electronics require accurate management of device temperatures. However, these flexible devices frequently face challenges in heat dissipation due to internal mechanical damage with repeated use.  Three-dimensional (3D) carbon nanostructures, particularly those made of carbon nanotubes and graphene, are emerging as viable solutions for flexible electronics because of their lightweight nature, exceptional heat management capabilities, and remarkable strength. This project  will explore the ability of the carbon  nanostructures  to handle heat and its relationship to mechanical deformation. By studying the effects of strain on their heat transfer properties, this project aims to enhance the understanding of the complex thermal behavior of carbon nanostructure materials under strain. The project is committed to fostering the next generation of innovators by involving students on projects of flexible electronics using the advanced 3D carbon nanostructures.\r\n\r\nThis project aims to analyze how mechanical strain impacts the thermal transport characteristics of diverse 3D carbon nanostructures such as pillared graphene structures, 3D graphene foam, and carbon nanotube network films. Both experiments and theory will be pursued with the ultimate goal of designing structures that maintain efficient heat dissipation even under mechanical deformation. There is limited information on the impact of strain on the thermal conductivity of 3D carbon nanostructures and the reported results show variability. The proposed research endeavors to bridge this knowledge gap by systematically measuring the thermal conductivities of a variety of 3D carbon nanostructures, each with distinct molecular architectures, utilizing a novel thermal-mechanical characterization apparatus. Molecular dynamics simulations will be instrumental in understanding the molecular-level thermal behavior exhibited by the 3D carbon nanostructures under mechanical strain. These simulations will offer a detailed microscopic view of the heat transfer mechanisms within carbon nanotube-carbon nanotube, carbon nanotube-graphene, and graphene-graphene junctions, particularly focusing on how these interactions evolve when the materials undergo deformation. Success of the proposed research could fast-track advancements in next-generation flexible electronics by introducing novel designs of 3D carbon nanostructures that maintain excellent thermal performance even when strained. Such a development holds promise for wide-ranging applications, potentially revolutionizing fields from human-machine interfaces and consumer electronics to biometrics and healthcare.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
