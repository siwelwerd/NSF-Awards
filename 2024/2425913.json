 "awd_abstract_narration": "The NSF Student Travel Grant award for the gem5 bootcamp 2024  supports the event designed to train early-career researchers in using the gem5 simulation framework for computer architecture research. It aims to facilitate the participation of early-career researchers in a training event focused on the gem5 simulation framework, a critical tool in computer architecture research. The grant seeks to support approximately 13 US-based students, prioritizing those from underrepresented groups and non-research universities.\r\n\r\nThe gem5 simulation framework is a critical tool for exploring new ideas in this field. It allows researchers to model and analyze the performance of different computer architectures under various conditions. By providing support for students to attend the gem5 bootcamp, this award enables more researchers to leverage this powerful tool, thereby driving innovation and progress in computer architecture research. The award contributes to the advancement of knowledge and the development of a skilled, diverse research workforce in the field of computer architecture.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
