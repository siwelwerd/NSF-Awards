 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Regional Innovation Engines Development Award aims to integrate the state\u2019s unique strengths in space, biological, and physical sciences to improve life on our planet. The proposed George Washington Carver (GWC) Science Park Accelerator & Regional Catalyst \u2013 Ohio (SPARC Ohio) Engine seeks to position Ohio as the go-to destination for the projected $1T space economy, revitalizing economically depressed regions in Ohio by creating thousands of jobs, inspiring students of all ages through comprehensive and inclusive education and training programs, and securing US leadership in the emerging commercial space economy.  If successful, the eventual NSF Engine stemming out of this project will leverage: 1) The benefits of technology developed for space, in-space experiments and manufacturing, and unique terrestrial facilities to conduct use-inspired R&D that is all but impossible to perform without space as a catalyst; 2) Ohio\u2019s premier space-related facilities and academic institutions, which provide the Engine\u2019s foundation in space research and workforce development; 3) Proven commercialization practices and a robust accelerator and investor community; 4) A continuum of workforce development programs; and 5) Ohio\u2019s appeal as a highly attractive destination, offering economic incentives and a high quality of living that draw individuals and organizations to establish themselves in Ohio.  \r\n\r\nTechnologies developed for space applications must be highly reliable and sustainable in a harsh environment. Resulting innovations include high-temperature resistant, lightweight, long-life, and high-efficiency products with enormous potential to improve life on Earth. Operating in space offers a unique research and manufacturing environment to a broad range of sectors due to microgravity (which provides weightlessness), a near-vacuum state, and higher levels of radiation. A key enabler of space-based research and manufacturing is access to long-term microgravity. Gravity influences everything on Earth, from the development of life to the interactions between materials. The micro-gravity environment aboard an orbiting spacecraft allows scientists to conduct experiments and develop manufacturing processes that are impossible to achieve on Earth. SPARC Ohio will leverage facilities and services that support both ground- and space-based research to significantly expand the existing partnership between the state and federal government, industry, and academia throughout Ohio. The Engine will develop pathways to connect critical space, biological, and physical science knowledge with regional and national stakeholders to solve use-inspired problems.  Projected outcomes include re-establishing US competitiveness in semiconductors, improving consumers\u2019 lives through innovative products, advancing health and wellness, strengthening food production and security, and promoting environmental sustainability. This Development Award will enable the SPARC Ohio to engage in a regional, collaborative planning process to prepare a future Engine to meet these goals.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
