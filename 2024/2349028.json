 "awd_abstract_narration": "This REU Site award to the University of Wisconsin-Madison, located in Madison, WI, will support the training of 10 students for 10 weeks during the summers of 2024-2026. It is anticipated that a total of 30 students, primarily from schools with limited research opportunities and/or from under-represented groups, will be trained in the program. This research experience will prepare students for further studies in graduate school and equip them to make significant contributions to the fields of cellular and molecular biology in their future careers. Students will learn how research is conducted, and many will present the results of their work at scientific conferences. Assessment of the program will be done through an online tool. Students will be tracked after the program to determine their career paths.  \r\n\r\nREU students will investigate how environmental stressors, including both biotic stressors (originating from living organisms such as pathogens) and abiotic stressors (arising from non-living factors such as nutrient availability), constantly shape the adaptive strategies of all life forms. By actively participating in original research, students will examine how cells detect stresses, transfer and amplify stress signals, and alter cell physiology to adapt to stresses. The program includes diverse projects with research groups from eight bioscience departments (Bacteriology, Biochemistry, Biomolecular Chemistry, Entomology, Forest and Wildlife Ecology, Genetics, Medical Genetics, and Plant Pathology). Students will participate in cohort meetings to help them navigate the research environment, develop science communication skills, interact with bioscience faculty and graduate students, and belong to a supportive learning community so they can get the most from their experience. Students will complete the NSF Responsible Conduct of Research training module and continue learning about research ethics in the cohort meetings. Students should apply through the NSF ETAP portal. Applications are reviewed holistically by the PI, co-PI, and faculty mentor.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
