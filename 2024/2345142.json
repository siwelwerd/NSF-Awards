 "awd_abstract_narration": "KCV EDGE builds on the Kentucky Science & Technology Corporation\u2019s centralized technology transfer mechanism for Kentucky\u2019s public colleges and universities and leverages partnerships such as the Kentucky Cabinet for Economic Development to build competitiveness and capacity in regional institutions for securing and managing research grants. The innovative KCV EDGE model of shared, scaled services acts as a cost-effective, operational, and inclusive growth mechanism for partner institutions by providing lean, targeted approaches to commercialization, funding, and partnership opportunities.  \r\n\r\nKCV EDGE will revolutionize the ability for regional, rural, minority-serving, and technical institutions of higher learning to achieve success in gaining and administering research funding by providing coordinated, holistic support for grant proposal writing, administration/compliance, technology commercialization, and leadership development. The program is designed to be a catalyst for national transformation. Specifically, it aims to dismantle barriers for emerging research institutions by staffing participating institutions to support expanding efforts in research enterprise, establishing reporting systems to assess project impacts, evaluating research challenges and successes, and creating and implementing an accelerator model for research commercialization and grant administration. KCV EDGE will contribute to the competitiveness of Kentucky as a center for research while creating high-quality jobs in the region. Impact will be realized in regional, rural, minority-serving, and technical institutions of higher learning communities, enhancing the research landscape for developing research institutions across the country and building communities of success for future generations.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
