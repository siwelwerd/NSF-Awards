 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national interest by establishing a successful experiential learning program for computer science students from Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). The experiential learning activities will be designed with the goal of strengthening and diversifying the open source workforce which is critical to shaping an equitable technological future. From security to infrastructure, open source is at the core of most modern technology. Recent years have seen increased investment from both the private and public sectors in supporting the creation of academic Open Source Program Offices (OSPOs), cultivation of academic open source ecosystems, and cross-sector collaborations with industry and nonprofit. This project specifically engages undergraduate students from underrepresented groups who have completed foundational computing coursework but are still evaluating STEM career prospects. A key outcome is for more HBCU graduates to have the skills, experience, and technical portfolio necessary to transition directly into open source roles; this means a workforce more reflective of the people its technology serves, and given the community-driven nature of open source, one where professionals can directly impact issues they care about.\r\n\r\nThis project aims to achieve the following primary goals; 1) expose HBCU students with foundational computer science skills to open source career opportunities, and 2) equip participants with workforce-preparatory skills not commonly found in undergraduate computing programs, and which especially benefit a career in open source. This project reflects a collaborative effort between a research university Open Source Program Office, an HBCU, and two industry partners in open source. The researchers have completed a pilot program serving four undergraduates from a single HBCU and seek to scale to serve up to 48 students from six HBCUs over three summers. Participants will learn about open source software career pathways by actually contributing to real world open source projects aligned with their interests. Contributor Catalyst combines in-person and remote modalities (mirroring real world employment conditions), situated learning through scaffolded activities, competitive compensation, and multiple layers of cohort support. Learning is further supported by a layered community of practice, including alumni, program, and industry/project mentors. The researchers plan to iteratively refine, assess, and document the program such that other institutions can adapt it to their own contexts in the future. Project results will be disseminated via publication, presentations and online repositories. The NSF ExLENT Program supports inclusive experiential learning opportunities that provide cohorts of diverse learners with the skills needed to succeed in emerging technology fields.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
