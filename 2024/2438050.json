 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supports students\u2019 travel to the 2024 Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking (ACM MobiCom), which will be held in Washington, D.C., USA, between November 18th and 22nd, 2024. MobiCom is a premier international conference focusing on systems issues in the emerging area of mobile computing and wireless communications. The conference attendance supported by this grant will provide career development and learning opportunities for 25 US-based students, with priority given to students from underrepresented groups (women, minorities, and people with disabilities) or students who would typically find it challenging to attend as the result of having not having a paper accepted in the conference.\r\n\r\nThis proposal will increase the dissemination of the conference's research results to a larger and more diverse audience. Moreover, MobiCom has a strong track record of giving preference in grant awards to women and minority students. To encourage researchers from under-represented groups in their research in the nationally critical area of mobile networking, in the selection process, under-represented groups or institutions will be given priority for about two thirds of the travel awards. Advertising to a wide range of colleges and universities, participants from a more diverse set of institutions should also be able to attend and benefit from the conference.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
