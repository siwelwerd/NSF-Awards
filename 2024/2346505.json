 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project focuses on planning activities associated with the realization of the StoreHub research infrastructure, which aims to support next-generation data storage research. The infrastructure is envisioned to provide a secure, flexible, and collaborative platform for researchers to design, test, and improve data storage technologies. Unlike existing infrastructure, StoreHub will allow researchers to isolate the impact of input/output systems on how computers use data. This capability will enable researchers to form application-specific storage systems with different storage hardware, software libraries, and appropriate cutting-edge technologies. It will accelerate breakthroughs in storage efficiency, speed, and energy-consumption needed across industries. This is especially true for modern supercomputers, where optimizing advanced storage technologies is crucial. The planning effort focuses on engaging relevant research communities to better understand the specific facilities and services that StoreHub should provide to best meet community needs. Specific activities planned include community surveys, community workshops, visioning discussions, focus groups, and online forums.    \r\n\r\nStoreHub is envisioned to democratize access to world-class storage and data management research tools and knowledge. This open platform will be designed to foster a vibrant and inclusive community, empowering the next generation of researchers and innovators. From improved medical data processing to smarter city infrastructure, StoreHub will underpin advancements that improve people's lives. This project recognizes that faster, more efficient storage is more than just a technical challenge; it's how we will unlock breakthroughs for a better future. It is a foundational step towards building next-generation data storage infrastructure for the rapidly changing landscape of the Big Data and AI eras.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
