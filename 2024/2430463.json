 "awd_abstract_narration": "Given the importance of developing a well-equipped United States STEM workforce, the number of STEM postdoctoral researchers has increased more than threefold over the past 40 years. However, inequalities related to power dynamics, race, gender, and the types of training postdoctoral researchers receive persist. While research training and publication have traditionally been the standard for STEM research training programs, these experiences often lack structured and formal community support, especially for postdoctoral fellows. Because many postdocs transition into future positions involving various degrees of teaching, research, and service to their local and connected communities, there is significance and importance to providing effective education and training in these areas. As such, the project team seeks to develop three independent STEM education researchers equipped with distinctive skills in building community-engaged research-practice partnerships. The project aims to train postdoctoral researchers through structured cohort-based training designed to enhance the six core competencies outlined by the National Postdoctoral Association as important for postdoctoral success. These core competencies include discipline-specific conceptual knowledge, professionalism, enhanced research skills, responsible conduct of research, communication skills, and leadership and management skills. The project team plans to recruit postdoctoral researchers from a large and diverse network of scholars through recruiting at academic conferences, virtual recruiting events, and through electronic databases. Recognizing that some applicants will have more tangible products as a function of the prestige or recognition of the attended institution, the project team plans to prioritize applicants\u2019 purpose and focus as indicated within the cover letter and recommendations rather than solely the number of publications and academic pedigree.\r\n\r\nTo achieve the goals of this project, the project team plans to leverage existing collaborations between the project team and partners within and surrounding Houston\u2019s Historic Third Ward to provide postdoctoral researchers with community-engaged research opportunities. The project design is grounded in theoretical and conceptual frameworks that facilitate learning by doing and acknowledges the assets-based cultural capital postdoctoral researchers both bring with them and apply within their research. The project team intends to implement immediate engagement in existing research projects led by the project team, weekly research and mentoring meetings, the opportunity to audit research methods courses of their choosing, and enrollment in the ProQual Institute of Interpretive Research Methods. The project also aims to implement a professional development plan that includes onboarding, creating an individualized development plan, monthly networking, immersive teaching and mentoring experiences, and participation in training on topics such as grant writing and academic writing. \r\n\r\nThis project is funded by the Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) Education Postdoctoral Research Fellowship Program (STEM Ed PRF) with co-funding from the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) and EDU Core Research: Building Capacity in STEM Education Research (ECR: BCSER). The STEM Ed PRF Program aims to enhance the research knowledge, skills, and practices of recent doctorates in STEM, STEM education, education, and related disciplines to advance their preparation to engage in fundamental and applied research that advances knowledge within the field. The AISL Program, supports projects that: (a) contribute to research and practice that considers informal STEM learning's role in equity and belonging in STEM; (b) promote personal and educational success in STEM; (c) advance public engagement in scientific discovery; (d) foster interest in STEM careers; (e) create and enhance the theoretical and empirical foundations for effective informal STEM learning; (f) improve community vibrancy; and/or (g) enhance science communication and the public's engagement in and understanding of STEM and STEM processes.  The ECR: BCSER Program is designed to build the capacity of individuals to carry out high-quality, fundamental STEM education research in STEM learning and learning environments, broadening participation in STEM fields, and STEM workforce development.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
