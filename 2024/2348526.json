 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of an on-farm tool to allow animal agriculture producers to determine how much their animals are eating.  Approximately 70% of an animal agriculture operation\u2019s variable cost of production is the cost of feed.  However, there are few approaches that allow producers to measure their animals\u2019 feed intake, and the limited number of locations that have that capacity are expensive.  The proposed low cost, on-farm tool would allow farmers to identify potential replacement animals that are more efficient, improve how they manage animals in the feedlot and to quantify intakes of animals grazing pasture.  Currently there is no way for pasture animal intake to be determined when animals are grazing at scale.  If 5% of US beef producers made use of this tool that would be 40,000 operations and likely improve the management decisions related to upwards of 500,000 to a million cattle.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on the development of a predictive algorithm to make use of daily animal weight and water intake, along with weather data, to predict daily feed intake. The proposed tool has been trained using data from a specialized feeding barn that has equipment to measure feed intake as well as animal weight and water intake.  Currently, state-of-the-art systems significantly over- or under-estimate the actual feed intake. The proposed tool intends to work in situations where either there is not an expensive feed intake system or in extensive grazing pasture situations where weighing feed is not possible.  The system has been validated on ~2200 animals fed in the barn and almost 100 animals grazing small plots where a ground truth can be determined for grazing feed intake.  Results have shown predictions of individual daily feed intake to within 92-95% accuracy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThis award was to support participation in a National I-Corps Team cohort to better understand the potential for our academic research to lead to commercial activity. We timed our cohort to coincide with the National Cattlemens Beef Association Annual Convention in February 2024. Although we conducted potential customer interviews before and after the convention we were able to interview 73 potential customers in the three days of the convention. We were surprised to learn that almost no one we interviewed made any attempt to quantify how much their animals consume either during the grazing season or even during the winter feeding period. The interviewees would often indicate that their is no technology they were aware of that allowed that data to be collected and in the abscence of that they focused on traits that they could evaluate. We heard comments about the need for such a technology and that if existed it, \"would be the holy grail for cattle graziers\", \"would allow us to save over $600,000 in the next 10 years\", \"would truly make a difference in the operation's input costs, improving profitability\". We felt we had evidence of product-market fit and were very encouraged that we should be pursuing avenues towards commercialization.\r\n\n\nWe then attended the largest bull evaluation sale in the US that provides data on feed efficiency to interview potential customers there. We were somewhat surprised that efficiency was not a critical feature for most of the producers there looking to purchase a bull. We heard that they weren't conviinced that efficiency measured in the dry lot would necessarily equate to grazing efficiency. Most of the people we interviewed said if data existed that demonstrated that link, it would change their decision making. To their knowledge, no such technology exists (which excepting ours is true and ours is not commercially available yet).\r\n\n\nFollowing the National I-Corps course we obtained an excusive license from the university for the technology and submitted a NSF SBIR pitch. The pitch was accepted and we submitted a NSF SBIR proposal to the AG section. Our initial proposal was not funded but we plan to revise and resubmit that proposal. We have also begun negotiating with our equipment vendor to develop a path to incorporate our technology into their offerings and sub-license the technology to them. They have an established reputation, customer network and global reach that should facilitate getting our technology into the marketplace to support needed research; as well as the capacity to evaluate grazing animal individual daily feed intake.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/14/2025\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: MatthewEdmundWilson\n"
