 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national interest by enhancing the learning experience of undergraduate students in the fields of optics and optoelectronics utilizing advanced computer tools to create interactive and evidence-based learning experiences. Importantly, this project seeks to investigate an alternative approach to effectively teach the complex and abstract concepts in these fields, which are significant for developing a skilled workforce in science and technology. By employing cutting-edge simulations and inductive inquiry, the project aligns with current research and best practices to enhance student engagement and understanding. Anticipated outcomes include improved student interest in optoelectronics, enhanced understanding and proficiency in these fields, and additional opportunities for career preparation. Project outcomes have the potential to advance science and technology education by producing a model that can be replicated in other fields, further broadening its impact and fostering innovation in STEM education.\r\n\r\nThis project plans to further develop an Interactive Simulation of Optoelectronic Devices (iSimODE) to effectively convey complex optoelectronics concepts. This will be achieved by creating comprehensive multiphysics virtual models that integrate qualitative and quantitative insights, illustrating the intricate interplay of light-induced electronic, kinetic, and thermal mechanisms. Leveraging advanced full-wave Finite Difference electromagnetic simulations, iSimODE aims to solve a unified equation system, including Maxwell's equations, semiconductor equations (such as Poisson\u2019s equation and drift-diffusion equation), and heat transfer equations, ensuring accurate and realistic simulations. This approach provides students with a unique opportunity to enhance their understanding of optoelectronics by developing conceptual imagery. Unlike traditional methods relying on textbooks or limited digital simulations, the interactive applications empower students to conduct numerical experiments, fostering a more comprehensive learning experience. The project\u2019s goals include assessing the effectiveness of the innovative evidence-based teaching methodology through a four-phase evaluation process, including model validation, optimization, and load testing. The plan is to evaluate the simulations as a learning and teaching tool by analyzing collected data using a mixed-methods approach, gathering both qualitative and quantitative data. Qualitative data will be obtained through student and instructor feedback, open-ended survey responses, and focus group discussions, and analyzed using NVivo software for an in-depth exploration of effectiveness. The project also aims to develop new materials as necessary for Optoelectronics coursework and extend these enhancements to related coursework at participating institutions. Additionally, it seeks to integrate computational optoelectronic research into the curriculum through senior year capstone projects, potentially creating a new undergraduate research experience. The simulations, once developed, will be hosted on a specialized web-based platform that is easily accessible through standard web browsers. This platform plans to enable other institutions to access the simulation tools and materials, integrating these resources into their courses or classroom environments as needed. Findings are expected to advance understanding in the field and will be disseminated through academic publications and conferences, contributing valuable insights to optoelectronics education and computational simulations. The NSF IUSE: EDU Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through its Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
