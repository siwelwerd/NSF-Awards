 "awd_abstract_narration": "Condensed water on the bumpy fungal patches is important for the development, reproduction, and dissemination of fungi; these contribute to contamination in plants, corrosion on engineered surfaces, and the quality of the air in indoor environments. The project will study the relationship between fungal growth and condensation on plant and engineered surfaces. Inspired by biological systems like fungal patches, the research also aims to explore the inter-related roles of condensation and fungi on infrastructure, and indoor air quality such as those in airplanes and enclosed buildings. The educational component of the project is multifaceted, involving undergraduate research and mentorship, with a particular emphasis on involving students from underrepresented minority groups.\r\n\r\nThe technical objectives aim to explore (1) the spatial and temporal variations in the macroscale topography and wettability characteristics of biological surfaces due to fungi; (2) the cumulative effects of macroscale surface topography on repeated condensation; (3) the impact of surface absorption of water vapor on fungi and on the associated phase change heat transfer phenomena; and (4) the development and application of mathematical models. Despite numerous empirical studies illustrating the robust correlation between the expansion of fungal patches, high levels of humidity, and elevated temperatures, the underlying thermal transport dynamics occurring during the periodic phase transitions of water have remained largely elusive. The intellectual significance of this research lies in discovering the mechanisms inherent in phase transitions. The study incorporates precise quantitative evaluations of fungal and plant surfaces, leveraging advanced optical measurement methodologies within a custom-built humidity chamber to facilitate these assessments. Mathematical models that incorporate fungal growth and condensation behavior will also be developed.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
