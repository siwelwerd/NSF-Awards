The initiative hosts virtual events monthly throughout the year, a professional development seminar, a research seminar, and a writing group, an in-person annual conference. The project also maintains a website and listserve with over 550 members and promotes women\u2019s research via social media. Additionally, the initiative collects/analyzes data on women in legislative studies. \r\n\r\nThis project seeks to bring new research and perspectives to scholarship on legislative politics by promoting the study of legislative politics across gender and sub-disciplinary divides. The initiative focuses on the research being done by a diverse set of scholars studying legislatures around the world. One of the aims of the project is to bridge the gap across the study of individual legislatures and the study of legislatures in comparative perspective. Bringing together a diverse set of scholars of legislative politics will encourage intellectual contributions that bridge these subfields. The initiative hosts virtual events monthly throughout the year, a professional development seminar, a research seminar, and a writing group, an in-person annual conference. The project also maintains a website and listserve with over 550 members and promotes women\u2019s research via social media. Additionally, the initiative collects/analyzes data on women in legislative studies.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
