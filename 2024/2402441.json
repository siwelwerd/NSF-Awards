 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will advance the understanding of firearm possession among a specific community living in urban areas characterized by high crime and violence. It expands a seminal study investigating gun possession among community males between the ages of 15 and 24 years old by using grounded theory methods to include the lived experience of females and of incarcerated males and females in the same age group.  This study will fill an academic and practitioner knowledge gap. In addition, the grounded theory methodology focuses on understanding firearm possession in the context of lived experience, informing relevant, feasible, and appropriate decision making and interventions to make cities safer and to meet the varying needs of males, females, and incarcerated populations. The project also replicates the initial study\u2019s research strategy, creating a collaborative of researchers at Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU). This collaborative approach increases the application of the study findings beyond a single site or city. It also strengthens and advances HBCU research capacity, developing the next generation of researchers, informing decision making and practice, and engaging community serving organizations in the research process.\r\n\r\nThis study aims to answer three broad questions: 1) Do the factors driving firearm possession differ by gender among community youth aged 15-24 living in urban high-crime communities? 2) Do the factors driving firearm possession differ between community youth aged 15-24 involved in the criminal justice system for weapons charges versus those living in the community? 3) Do the factors driving firearm possession differ across study sites? It will be conducted in four sites. The work in each site will be led by a seasoned researcher based at an HBCU. Because there is little information about firearm possession among young community adults living in high crime and violent areas, this study is phenomenological using a purposive sampling technique. In partnership with community partners, 300 participants will be recruited to participate in a semi-structured interview. Each study site will interview community members between 15 and 24 years old, including 25 females living in the community, 25 males incarcerated for weapons charges, and 25 females incarcerated for weapons charges. The qualitative analyses will employ grounded theory processes to identify common themes and coding schemes. The coding schemes will allow for quantitative analyses, including examining significant differences by testing the null hypotheses for each specific research question. Based on the research canon, including the original study conducted as a pilot for this study, differences based on gender, incarceration for weapons charges status, and location are expected.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
