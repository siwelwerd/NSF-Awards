 "awd_abstract_narration": "Humanity faces profound challenges in the 21st century. From a rapidly rising population, a warming climate, increased demand for food, fiber, and water, and a rapid loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services, we face environmental problems that are more pervasive and serious than at any time in our history. Accordingly, the next generation of sustainability practitioners, researchers and policymakers will require a broad set of skills to engage in inter- and trans-disciplinary teams to solve the complex environmental issues that face humanity.  This award provides support for the Sustainability Research and Innovation Congress that will be held in Chicago, 16-20 June 2025.  The SRI Congress is the world\u2019s largest annual event focused on sustainability science and innovation, and it offers an exceptionally inclusive and inspiring global platform bringing together research, government, business, and civil society leaders from over 100 countries to meaningfully advance progress toward sustainability.  \r\n\r\nTransdisciplinary research is an emerging area of critical focus to advance real-world solutions to critical societal challenges. The Congress will focus on pathways to solutions and their implementation, highlighting the progress, research, and innovations being developed throughout our world to address the major sustainability issues and challenges confronting us all. The Congress will highlight how many people across the world are applying research and innovation to understanding, mitigating, and adapting to the major environmental stresses facing our planet. Throughout this process, participants will engage with leading sustainability experts, explore the latest sustainability science research and innovations, and forge new collaborations while expanding networks and connecting with new markets. The SRI Congress also introduces a transdisciplinary approach to sustainability, encompassing changes in policies and practices, shifts in attitudes and perceptions, the creation of new relationships and collaborative networks.  \r\nThe Congress is an excellent opportunity for leading sustainability experts from academia, industry and policymaking to engage in collaboration and knowledge exchange to further our understanding of innovative ways to implement sustainable change interventions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
