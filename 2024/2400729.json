 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national interest by enabling the \"convergence\" of the public, private, and education sectors to prepare learners for the \"Cybersecurity Convergence\" workforce (Cyber-Con2). Studies consistently show that demands for cybersecurity workers exceed supplies by large margins and the gap is still increasing. The gap is exacerbated by the rise of information technology (IT) systems and virtual activities. Moreover, the attacks on industrial control systems (ICSs) are frequently observed as plant operations and are more interconnected. The security of operational technology (OT) and ICSs is increasingly important for national security. This collaborative project intends to develop Cyber-Con2 workforce to meet the cybersecurity needs in the region and reduce the gap. \r\n\r\nThe project plans to develop educational and training material in the form of virtual lab libraries for OT/ICS and IT cybersecurity. The materials will be adopted by high schools, community colleges, and universities in the Carolinas. Additionally, learners will have the option to earn industry credentials with support from the private sector. The project will modernize the Academic Cloud with new equipment for cybersecurity. The Academic Cloud is a scalable, purpose-built system for education, training, and research. The project will run an internship program conducted at businesses and governmental agencies and organize tutorials with several communities of practice (COPs) to upskill professionals and train instructors. The COPs include the Cyberinfrastructure Engineering community, the Industrial Cybersecurity COP, the community of users of FABRIC (NSF funded Adaptive Programmable Research Infrastructure for Computer Science and Science Applications project), and multiple training centers. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the Nation's economy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
