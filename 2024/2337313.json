 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project the research team will reanalyze previously gathered but unexamined reactive halogen spectroscopy data from fifteen buoys deployed as a component of the Arctic Observing Network in order to study the magnitude of possible synergies between bromine and iodine and their impact on Arctic ozone depletion. The research team will focus primarily on the impact of iodine chemistry on ozone depletion as recent publications indicate that iodine may have a more critical role in halogen and ozone chemistry in the Arctic than previously assumed. As the data to be used in this project already exists from previous buoy spectrometer observations, this work focuses on reanalyzing the data, comparing the data to other observations, and conducting modeling experiments to examine the potential iodine-influenced atmospheric chemistry in the Arctic. The main hypothesis to be tested in this proposed work is that while reactive bromine still dominates ozone depletion chemistry for most of the Arctic, chemical synergies with reactive iodine may accelerate the process, particularly in some regions. Success in this project is likely to have a strong positive impact on the Arctic atmospheric chemistry community, the broader climate research community, and the public.\r\n\r\nIn the previous NSF-funded project, which focused primarily on bromine chemistry, the research team utilized multiple-axis differential optical absorption spectroscopy (MAX-DOAS) observations from free-floating buoys as a part of the NSF Arctic Observing Network and determined that bromine is the dominant ozone depleting reactive halogen in the Arctic. New research indicates that iodine may have a more critical role than previously assumed. These existing measurements will now be reanalyzed with a focus on iodine chemistry and compared to recent observations of halogens within the Arctic. Seasonal and regional distributions of iodine and bromine amounts will be quantified and validated with collaborative ground-level measurements and a 1-D chemical model will be used to determine the relative role of iodine and bromine in ozone depletion chemistry at buoy locations. A postdoctoral researcher and an undergraduate student will be supported during this project.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
