 "awd_abstract_narration": "Portland cement concrete is a ubiquitous element of the built environment and is a crucial component of building and infrastructure development worldwide. The production of concrete, the most widely used manufactured material, is a contributor to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.  The production of cement results in 4-8% of global energy-related carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions.  There is a need to reduce the CO2 emissions both during construction and throughout the life of the concrete.  The Concrete Advancement Network (CAN), an Industry-University Cooperative Research Phase I Center (IUCRC) established by the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee and Oregon State University, focuses on reducing the global warming potential (GWP) of concrete while improving the long-term durability of concrete thereby enabling significant economic and societal benefits. CAN focuses on implementing nanotechnology advancements, recyclability, digital manufacturing, multi-scale modeling, artificial intelligence, and advanced testing techniques will be used to fast-track the implementation of cutting-edge concepts into this key industrial sector, which frequently relies on older technology. Breakthroughs in the concrete field can be achieved using model-based prediction and verification combined with experimental methods, thereby advancing the pace of technology transfer from concept to implementation.  The CAN center aims to develop innovative concrete mixtures with reduced GWP while establishing methods to quantify the GWP and performance for member companies while training a diverse and skilled science and engineering workforce for the industry at large.  Thus, CAN activities are strategically important to the U.S. economy because they will provide long-term solutions for the nation\u2019s deteriorating infrastructure and meet the demand for transportation and buildings.\r\n\r\nThe CAN University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee site has unique expertise and capabilities related to the use of nanotechnology in concrete, which are translated to the development and effective use of nano-engineered composites, ultra-high-performance concrete, photocatalytic concrete, smart sensor-embedded construction, innovations in by-product utilization, application of supplementary cementitious materials, carbon reduction and sequestration, digital manufacturing, and the extension of service life. In addition, the ISO 17025-certified structural testing facility provides a unique capability to scale-up and verify the concepts developed in the lab. Using advanced analysis and manipulating chemical interactions from nano to mesoscale, CAN researchers aim to develop modern technologies and methods that will result in concrete that is more efficient, more rapidly deployable, and much less dependent upon natural resources. Center research efforts will enable breakthroughs in concrete science by using model-based prediction and verification in lieu of traditional experimental methods, thereby advancing the pace of technology transfer from concept to implementation.  Finally, training programs are planned to help prepare the next generation of engineers while also providing information updates for practitioners.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
