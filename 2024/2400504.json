 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supports a conference that will connect NSF officials, including Dr. Margaret Martonosi, Assistant Director (AD) for Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE) of the National Science Foundation (NSF), with researchers in Puerto Rico's higher education institutions in Computer Science and associated disciplines. Puerto Rico has numerous public and private universities, many of which are Hispanic Serving Institutions offering CISE-related programs. This event disseminates information and opportunities related to CISE in Puerto Rico and promotes collaborations.\r\n\r\nThe Intellectual Merit of this project is to expose Puerto Rico computing related researchers to opportunities in the CISE NSF directorate programs, train faculty on writing successful proposals for NSF, and foster the interactions between members of the Puerto Rico researchers\u2019 community to produce additional increased collaborations. \r\n\r\nThe broader impact of the conference is that it will serve Hispanic Serving Institutions researchers, increasing diversity among researchers in CISE related fields and opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students. It will additionally increase the capacity in computer science and related fields to promote innovation among Puerto Rico researchers.  Through this program, the National Science Foundation\u2019s mission is strengthened by opening more research, training, and career opportunities for a diverse workforce.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
