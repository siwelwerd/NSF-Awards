 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-Technical Abstract\r\n\r\nThis project investigates network-forming suspensions of ferromagnetic colloids. It offers insights and strategies for designing, programming, and controlling both the microstructure and the macroscopic magnetic and mechanical functionalities of these systems. Technological potential broader impacts of this work include bioelectronic devices, benefiting areas of health care and liquid robotics. It also provides rich and novel colloidal physics and may provide a novel perspective on equilibrium gelation.  \r\n\r\n\r\nTechnical Abstract\r\n\r\nNetwork-forming suspensions of ferromagnetic colloids, which are coined \"permanent fluidic magnets\" (PFM), are distinct from well-studied ferrofluids due to the use of larger particles and highly viscous solvents, which suppress Brownian motion and sedimentation. Following application of an external magnetic field, the particles assemble into an anisotropic network structure (i.e., an anisotropic gel), and the material acquires a remnant magnetization.  Specifically, this EAGER proposal aims to test experimentally, with theoretical comparisons, the question of whether the anisotropic networks are equilibrium states or rather arrested or jammed ones. These experiments would be complemented by both simulations and theory.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
