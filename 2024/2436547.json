 "awd_abstract_narration": "In response to a request by the National Science Foundation, the Board on Life Sciences of the Division on Earth and Life Studies of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (National Academies), will plan and facilitate a workshop to define critical issues associated with the publication of studies involving the use of in silico modeling and computational approaches to understand and design biological systems that may fall under the purview of the May 2024 U.S. Government Policy for Oversight of Dual Use Research of Concern and Pathogens with Enhanced Pandemic Potential. For many decades, the coupling of biological sciences with other scientific disciplines has transformed scientific pursuits in biology leading to the development of new technologies, knowledge, and materials for a variety of fields. However, some have expressed concern that these advances are happening at a pace that increases risk across a variety of safety, security, and ethical areas. In 2004, following a meeting of the National Academy of Sciences on scientific communication and national security, a group of journal editors and authors issued a joint statement on considerations of biodefense and biosecurity, laying the groundwork for principles by which journals could proactively maximize public benefit while minimizing the risks of malicious use of biological research. During the past two decades, situations involving security concerns about the publication or communication of certain biological data have highlighted challenges in the uncertainty in assessing risks, lack of accessible resources in analyzing benefits and risks together, and lack of training of peer reviewers of manuscripts submitted to journals seeking input on dual use potential of the information provided. Within this context, the anticipated outcomes of the proposed project are a better understanding of how to assess the benefits and risks, and mitigate the risks to safeguard the benefits of research at the computational/biological intersection at the publication stage; identification of governance options for scientific journals, researchers, institutional administrators, and funders to communicate advances in in silico biology to effectively manage the risks in a manner that continue scientific progress and benefits; and deeper consideration of the scope of and approaches for implementing Section 6.2.2. in the May 2024 U.S. Government Policy for Oversight of Dual Use Research of Concern and Pathogens with Enhanced Pandemic Potential. This project builds on two decades of work by science journals, the National Academies, the U.S. government, intergovernmental organizations, and various nongovernmental and academic organizations.\r\n\r\nThe National Academies will conduct a workshop on opportunities for considering and navigating benefits and biosecurity risks of communicating studies involving computational modeling and analysis, including the use of generative artificial intelligence, of biological systems at the publication stage. The workshop will cover: a) existing statements, policies and guidance, and risk mitigation practices (or safeguards) on dual use research of concern and pathogens of pandemic potential relevant to communication and publication of covered scientific activities; b) challenges and needs to effectively safeguard the benefits and promote the advances of use of computational models and analysis with biological systems, while also mitigating the risks of generating or releasing these models and associated biological information that may be presented to human, animal, plant, and/or ecological health and/or national security; c) relevance and utility of evolving efforts on AI safety to communication of studies involving in silico modeling and analysis and/or generative AI with biological systems; and d) policy options and norms for safeguarding the benefits and advances while reducing the risks. Experts from leading scientific journals that publish research in biology and associated fields, professional societies and associations, Academies of Science, academia, industry, and other nongovernmental entities will be invited to the workshop. Critical themes from the workshop discussion will be summarized in a full proceedings, which will be posted on the National Academies Press website.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
