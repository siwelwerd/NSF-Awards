 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national interest by producing instructional activities to optimize physics quantitative literacy (PQL) development that are grounded in validated ways that students develop reasoning. Introductory physics is required for many STEM majors, in large part, because developing a strong foundation in quantitative reasoning is recognized as being important for their subsequent studies and careers. This project will center on two broad instructional aims: improving quantitative literacy for all STEM majors through physics course-taking, and helping reduce barriers that prevent students from economically disadvantaged communities from entering STEM majors. Instructors can help all of their students improve their essential quantitative reasoning by making PQL an explicit learning objective. In order for that to happen widely, instructors need effective materials and methods they can adopt and adapt in a variety of contexts, as well as validated assessments to measure PQL and models for analyzing and interpreting the results. The significance of this project is the development and dissemination of these instructional materials.\r\n\r\nThis project aims to accomplish two goals. The first goal is to create an emergent model of PQL development based on student resources. Using methods related to item response theory and knowledge space theory, this project plans to augment analysis of existing multiple-choice tests by defining a partial-credit scoring model that recognizes the value of students\u2019 responses to test items that are partially correct. By analyzing data from students in introductory, middle-division, and upper-division physics courses, the project aims to produce an emergent longitudinal model of PQL development based on the landscape of student responses to test items across multiple courses. The second project goal is to develop, implement and disseminate instructional materials and methods that will be founded on the emergent model of PQL development. These materials will help students conceptualize the algebra and calculus quantitative reasoning that underpins STEM quantitative literacy and will be disseminated widely across a variety of learning environments to broaden the impact for a diverse group of learners.  The model of PQL development produced will be used as a framework to guide the production and refinement of: 1) modular, cooperative activities that can be used in small group settings, think-pair-share lecture settings, or as homework, and 2) formative assessment questions that can be used on tests and quizzes. The NSF IUSE: EDU Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through its Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
