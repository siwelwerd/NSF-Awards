 "awd_abstract_narration": "The \u201cShanks Workshop on Combinatorics and Graph Theory\u201d will take place at Vanderbilt University, April 13-14, 2024. The focus of the workshop will be on structural graph theory, extremal combinatorics, graph coloring, Ramsey theory, and their intersections. The workshop will highlight significant recent achievements in these areas and provide a platform for researchers to share recent insights and tools, communicate their work, share open problems, and build new collaborations. The goals of the workshop are to (1) bring together researchers in combinatorics and graph theory to communicate and exchange ideas; (2) promote open problem-sharing and discussions among participants; (3) expose junior researchers to the latest developments in these areas; and (4) broaden and stimulate the research of junior, female, and underrepresented researchers.\r\n\r\nThe field of combinatorics concerns problems and techniques in discrete settings. It is closely related to other areas of mathematics and has many applications ranging from evolutionary biology to computer science and from logic to statistical physics. Graph theory is one of the oldest parts of combinatorics, and it has numerous natural connections to other areas. The workshop will feature two plenary speakers and eight early-career speakers. Moreover, we plan to organize an open problem session and a discussion session that allows participants of the workshop to exchange insights and ideas on open problems that are relevant and interesting to the larger mathematics and computer science community. The workshop website is located at https://my.vanderbilt.edu/cgt2024/.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
