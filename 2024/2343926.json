 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project, the PI and project team will deploy the Doppler on Wheels (DOW) mobile radar platform in order to provide hands-on experience in radar meteorology for more than 50 undergraduate students in meteorology, physics, and broadcasting degrees at the State University of New York College (SUNY) at Oswego. The DOW will be used to provide an opportunity for undergraduate students to apply their foundational knowledge of radar meteorology to real-world applications. The PI and project team will additionally welcome the local community during a \u201cCommunity Day\u201d for tours as well as an \u201cAsk a Scientist\u201d panel. Additionally, a total solar eclipse will occur on April 8, 2024, in which this project will join other SUNY at Oswego community outreach efforts.\r\n\r\nThere are four education goals included in this work: (1) to establish a foundational understanding of radar meteorology via undergraduate classes; (2) student-driven development of four experiments to be conducted using the DOW; (3) the empowering of students that they can participate in the scientific process; and (4) the development of communication skills through field campaign experiences and subsequent presentations. There are also two outreach goals: (1) an increase in the community awareness of the importance of radar systems with regards to public safety during high-risk weather events; and (2) a demonstration of possible career paths within meteorology.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
