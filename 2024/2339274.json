 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project focuses on questions in analytic number theory, and concerns properties of the Riemann zeta-function and of more general L-functions. L-functions are functions on the complex plane that often encode interesting information about arithmetic objects, such as prime numbers, class numbers, or ranks of elliptic curves. For example, the Riemann zeta-function (which is one example of an L-function) is closely connected to the question of counting the number of primes less than a large number. Understanding the analytic properties of L-functions, such as the location of their zeros or their rate of growth, often provides insight into arithmetic questions of interest. The main goal of the project is to advance the knowledge of the properties of some families of L-functions and to obtain arithmetic applications. The educational component of the project involves groups of students at different stages, ranging from high school students to beginning researchers. Among the educational activities, the PI will organize a summer school in analytic number theory focusing on young mathematicians, and will run a yearly summer camp at UCI for talented high school students.\r\n\r\nAt a more technical level, the project will investigate zeros of L-functions by studying their ratios and moments. While positive moments of L\u2013functions are relatively well-understood, much less is known about negative moments and ratios, which have applications to many difficult questions in the field. The planned research will use insights from random matrix theory, geometry, sieve theory and analysis. The main goals fall under two themes. The first theme is developing a general framework to study negative moments of L-functions, formulating full conjectures and proving partial results about negative moments. The second theme involves proving new non-vanishing results about L-functions at special points. Values of L-functions at special points often carry important arithmetic information; the PI plans to show that wide classes of L-functions do not vanish at the central point (i.e., the center of the critical strip, where all the non-trivial zeros are conjectured to be), as well as to study correlations between the values of different L-functions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
