 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Phase I Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is significant, as it addresses the critical need for high-purity diamond substrates in various ongoing science programs. Several of these programs have been hindered by lack of Diamond substrates which are repeatable and reproducible as well as being commonly available. project\u2019s advancement will not only propel scientific research but also has the potential to revolutionize industries by improving the performance and capabilities of devices such as photonic switches. Large 10 mm size diamond substrates will be produced, a size which is currently not available. The research focus is upon the societal benefits include advancements in technology that contribute to national security and healthcare, particularly in areas such as radiation therapy dosimetry. The commercial impact is promising, with the potential to establish the United States as a leader in semiconductor diamond production which has been and setting up a large-scale PE-CVD (Plasma Enhanced Chemical Vapor Deposition) diamond platform for limited lab production.  Diamond devices, when manufactured can lead by creating technology and economic growth to commercialization across a range of fields spanning:  semiconductors and advanced electronics, optical lenses/Raman laser, high voltage switches, and radiation monitoring devices.  \r\n\r\nThis SBIR Phase I project proposes to address the challenge of limited availability of high-quality diamond substrates, which hinders progress in various ongoing commercial and science programs. The research objectives include establishing a nitrogen matrix study to control and maintain consistency in nitrogen levels, which has been a significant barrier in the past. The project will grow and fabricate diamond substrates with the required purity and dopant levels, tailored for specific applications. The research will utilize Plasma-Enhanced Chemical Vapor Deposition (PE-CVD) to grow diamond films and create Standard Reference Materials (SRMs) for potential standardization. Anticipated technical results encompass providing nitrogen matrix slices for evaluation, establishing nitrogen selection for a Photonic High-Frequency (HF) microwave switch. This project is strengthening the only domestic supply chain that has been established since 2020 for semiconductor Diamond Substrates.  The project aims to significantly advance the field by delivering semiconductor diamond devices that outperform current offerings in High frequency Microwave switching and proton irradiation therapy dosimetry as well as other applications.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
