 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact of this I-Corps project is based on the development of an innovative and cost-effective mechanical ventilator designed to address critical respiratory needs in low-resource settings. Acute respiratory distress affects about 3 million people annually, with mortality rates reaching 90% in under-resourced areas. This technology aims to save lives, benefiting patients with lung infections and those undergoing some invasive surgeries. With a 71% survival rate among ventilated patients, this solution could substantially elevate survival rates. Additionally, the cost-effectiveness of this solution could provide financial relief to healthcare systems, enabling reallocation of funds to other pressing health issues and fostering a more efficient healthcare system. This project contributes to global health equity, enhancing the quality of care in underserved communities through high-quality, low-cost, practical engineering solutions. \r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. The solution is based on the development of an innovative and cost-effective mechanical ventilator designed for low-resource communities. The technology focuses on a streamlined mechanical ventilation system that provides continuous respiratory support for patients with acute respiratory distress. The device's reliability, durability, and ease of use, even by non-specialized healthcare workers, are essential functionalities. By excluding unnecessary high-end components, the device remains effective while significantly reducing costs. Technical results from extensive prototype testing demonstrated the ventilator\u2019s ability to deliver consistent and adjustable ventilation to both neonates and adults. Performance evaluations in simulated environments confirmed its efficiency and reliability, showcasing its potential to maintain critical respiratory functions without continuous manual operation. The merit of this project lies in bridging the health resource gap with practical engineering solutions tailored to low-resource constraints.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
