 "awd_abstract_narration": "What drives land degradation? How do people cope with its impacts and consequences across regional, sub-national, and local scales? What responses are resilient for both humans and nature?  To address these questions, this project develops a novel methodology, using globally available data, to identify emerging \u201cbright spots\u201d of improving ecological conditions and human resilience and emerging \u201chot spots\u201d of land degradation and human vulnerability to reveal factors associated with human and ecological resilience. By contrasting drivers and responses in areas of bright spots and hot spots with similar ecological and socio-economic conditions, the research identifies and translates what worked in bright spots into action plans for hotspot areas. \r\n \r\nThe research has important implications for challenging theories on deforestation and land transitions as well as human adaptive responses. This project integrates household surveys and community-level interviews with drone-derived imagery nested within \u201cbright spots\u201d and \u201chot spots\u201d. Results may identify potential behaviors and practices that can be replicated to improve household and ecological resilience in tropical forest frontiers globally. The project improves understanding of interactions among social and biophysical system components that can help inform United Nations (UN) member nations of monitoring and evaluation towards achieving UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the UNCCD Strategic Objectives for desertification, land degradation, and drought.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
