 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supports a conference that will broaden the reach of NSF-funded research across five states (Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Rhode Island, and Delaware) located in the Atlantic and Northeast regions of the United States. These states have historically received less than average NSF funding. Principal Investigators (PIs) from different types of institutions across the states will be invited to participate. The conference will give participants the opportunity to gain new knowledge on how to develop well-designed research projects and write strong research proposals. This will enhance the competitiveness of participating PIs in securing NSF grants. NSF program officers (POs) representing the four different clusters within the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences (MCB) will also attend the conference. These POs will provide information on the different types of funding opportunities available at the NSF. The POs will also share insights into the grant proposal application process.\r\n\r\nThe conference will be held at the University of New Hampshire (UNH), a public research university located in Durham, NH. Invitations will be extended to PIs from universities and colleges of all types in the geographic region served by the conference. These will include research universities like UNH, Primarily Undergraduate Institutions (PUIs), Minority-Serving Institutions (MSIs), and Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). A particular focus will be placed on ensuring strong representation of women investigators and investigators from groups historically under-represented in STEM.  During the conference, participants will have many opportunities to interact with each other and will be encouraged to explore possible collaborations that could enhance cross-institutional connections and lead to stronger grant proposal applications. The overall impact of the conference will be extensive: it will not only directly benefit the participants, but it will be further amplified as PIs will likely share their newly acquired knowledge with colleagues at their home institutions and beyond.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
