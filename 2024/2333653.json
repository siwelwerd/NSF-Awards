 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project empowers post-secondary students, especially those from Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs), to seize lucrative opportunities in the rapidly growing blockchain job market, which currently faces the trend of outsourcing. Blockchain-related careers are among the most sought-after professions of the future, yet many students lack clarity regarding the blockchain career paths suitable for their interests and abilities. This career assessment technology will bridge this knowledge gap, enhancing students' understanding of various career possibilities within the blockchain industry. By doing so, the technology aligns with the needs of both businesses and educational institutions while contributing to the national welfare by facilitating the entry of young adults into high-paying careers. This project offers a unique career matching platform that guides students from diverse academic backgrounds, including both technical and non-technical majors, toward highly skilled blockchain positions. \r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to address the shortage of a skilled blockchain technology workforce in the United States, which has resulted in the outsourcing of blockchain-related jobs to other countries. The primary research objectives involve quantifying the relationship between an individual's interests and their potential suitability for blockchain-related employment while offering versatile career path recommendations. This project examines key career attributes such as creativity, risk-taking propensity, and analytical skills, aiming to identify correlations with potential blockchain roles. The research will explore the hobbies and interests of current blockchain professionals and establish a mathematical formula that aligns attributes with various job titles, as reported by hiring managers. Field testing will be conducted at HBCUs and MSIs to validate the effectiveness of the formulas and scoring system, ultimately recommending suitable web3 blockchain job titles to students.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
