 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Thirty-third Cumberland Conference on Combinatorics, Graph Theory and Computing, will be held at Mississippi State University from May 18 to 19, 2024. The conference is part of an annual series that brings together internationally renowned researchers, industrial mathematicians and computer scientists, as well as postdocs, graduate students, and undergraduate students, to discuss the latest advances in combinatorics, graph theory and computer science. The conference will also contribute to advancing junior researchers and researchers from underrepresented groups. \r\n\r\nThe 2024 edition of the conference features five plenary speakers: Dr. Noga Alon (Princeton University), Dr. Guantao Chen (Georgia State University), Dr. David Conlon (California Institute of Technology), Dr. Virginia Williams (MIT), and Dr. Thomas Zaslavsky (SUNY Binghamton), who are leading researchers in combinatorics, graph theory and theoretical computer science. There will also be 40 to 60 contributed talks. The conference website is (https://www.msu.edu/cumberland2024).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
