 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports research in relativity and relativistic astrophysics. A large component of the research is aimed at the numerical solution of Einstein's equations by supercomputer simulations. The main impact of the work will be in gravitational wave astrophysics. The award will increase our understanding of gravitational wave signatures from the inspiral and collision of two neutron stars. The research also impacts broader areas of computational science. The computational techniques developed by the investigators can be used to solve problems in other areas, including fluid dynamics, meteorology, and seismology. Young researchers trained in these techniques are in great demand in academia, national laboratories, and industry. Relativity, black holes, and neutron stars continue to fascinate the public and allow science to be communicated broadly. The investigators upload movies to YouTube for public viewing and regularly give outreach talks about their work and other interesting scientific events.\r\n\r\nThis award will support the study of gravitational waves from binary neutron star mergers. The research is aimed at solving Einstein\u2019s equations numerically using simulations run on NSF-funded supercomputers. One of the major goals is to accurately track the inspiral and merger of binary neutron star systems, particularly focusing on the gravitational waves emitted in the late inspiral just before the stars collide. All resulting research will be publicly available.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
