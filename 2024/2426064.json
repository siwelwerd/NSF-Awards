 "awd_abstract_narration": "Advances in optimization have become the cornerstone for the success of many\r\nmodern applications arising from fields like machine learning, signal processing and\r\ncontrol. However, as applications become increasingly complex, simply scaling up the\r\ndata and problem dimension is no longer sufficient to construct high-quality models. It is\r\nalso important to jointly model different kinds of hierarchically coupled sub-tasks\r\nwherein the solution of one optimization problem builds upon that of others. Unlike\r\nstandard single-level optimization problems, algorithms tailored for solving hierarchically\r\ncoupled problems are less explored. Bi-level optimization (BLO) thus draws wide\r\nattention across the aforementioned fields due to its power in modeling the complicated\r\nhierarchical decision-making process.\r\n\r\nIn this proposal, we plan to study the BLO problems, and in particular, a subclass of it\r\nwith specific lower-level structures that is challenging and has strong applications in\r\nmodeling the hierarchical structures arising in modern machine learning and\r\nengineering applications such as adversarial learning, inverse reinforcement learning,\r\nand continue learning. Specifically, we propose to study the hard instances of BLO\r\nwhere the lower level is nonconvex or constrained, which is much less explored and\r\ninherently difficult. This proposal intends to develop a suite of new approaches that not\r\nonly advance the state-of-the-art BLO literature, but more importantly, can help\r\naccelerate the adoption of BLO as a generic tool to model, analyze, and innovate on a\r\nwide array of emerging ML applications. Further, we also plan to develop a\r\nbenchmarking suite that evaluates the state-of-the-art BLO algorithms on relevant ML\r\nproblems and beyond. This project will further integrate an educational plan with the\r\nresearch goals by i) revamping the existing optimization and ML courses with BLO\r\ncomponents; ii) developing a new course project on applying BLO algorithms to ML\r\nproblems; iii) directly involving undergraduate and graduate students in research,\r\nespecially from under-represented groups; and iv) outreaching to the general public, in\r\nparticular K-12 students.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
