 "awd_abstract_narration": "The shift from fossil fuels to biomass (e.g., crops) for renewable energy and valuable chemicals has broad support from both government agencies and the scientific community. However, current biomass conversion techniques, which depend on thermocatalysis, are energy-intensive due to the need for high temperatures and pressures. Conversion using electricity (electrocatalysis) is a more sustainable approach but requires better understanding of the mechanisms involve as well as stable catalyst. This NSF EPSCoR Research Fellows project combines catalysts development expertise from the University of Delaware with electrocatalysis experts at the Renewable & Sustainable Energy Institute at the University of Colorado to advance the fundamental understanding of biomass conversion. With the use of specialized techniques, the effect of the catalyst shape and size, as well as the chemical environment (electrolyte) can be interrogated in real time as the reactions are happening. This level of insight will help design more efficient and stable catalysts not only for biomass conversion but also for conversion of CO2 and hydrogen production. This fellowship will support an early-career PI in establishing and sustaining a multidisciplinary research program. It will also provide educational opportunities and hands-on experience to undergraduate and graduate students in the areas of renewable energy and sustainability. \r\n\r\nThis Research Infrastructure Improvement EPSCoR Research Fellows project would provide a fellowship to an Assistant Professor and training for a graduate student at the University of Delaware. Electrocatalysis has been identified as green, viable method for the up-conversion of biomass compounds. However, there are still challenges that need to be addressed with regards to catalyst efficiency, selectivity, stability, as well as knowledge gaps on the conversion mechanisms. The overall objective of the proposed research is to develop efficient, selective, and stable catalysts for electro-conversion of furanic compounds via understanding of structure-activity-mechanism relationships. The central hypothesis is that the activity and selectivity can be modulated by the size/shape of nanocrystals-based electrodes and spectator ions in the electrolyte. The hypothesis will be validated in collaboration with researchers at the Renewable & Sustainable Energy Institute at the University of Colorado. Through this collaboration, mechanistic insights will be gained employing the specialized techniques of in situ attenuated total reflectance surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR-SEIRAS) and differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS). The results from this work are poised to bridge knowledge gaps in the field of electrocatalytic biomass conversion, provide insight into the interplay between the electrode-electrolyte interface, and advance the development of effective catalysts. In addition to the innovative research, this fellowship will allow the early-career PI to gain access to and training on ATR-SEIRAS and DEMS which will be transformative for the PI\u2019s research program and the institution.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
