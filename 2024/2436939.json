 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports attendance at the 9th Physics At eXtreme (PAX) workshop, focusing entirely on next-generation gravitational-wave science opportunities and challenges. PAX is a discussion-driven workshop and includes experts from a wide range of fields that will benefit from next-generation detectors: astronomers, astrophysicists, general relativity theorists, cosmologists, nuclear physicists, numerical relativists, and data analysts. PAX provides the optimal venue to identify actionable items and initiate collaborations to tackle the work needed to maximize the scientific output of the next-generation detectors.\r\n\r\nNext-generation detectors will be built in the second half of the 2030s when the current generation of students will lead the field. A major goal of PAX is to directly and actively involve early career scientists in shaping the future of the field. The 9th PAX workshop will include an early career scientist lunch where young and experienced researchers can discuss how to make academia more accessible and equitable.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
