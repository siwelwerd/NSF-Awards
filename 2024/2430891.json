 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact of this I-Corps project is the development of a new skin grafting method that enhances healing for chronic wounds like those from burns, skin cancer, and diabetes. This project introduces an advanced technique aimed at maximizing skin area expansion during split-thickness skin graft surgery while minimizing mechanical strain within grafts. The commercial potential of this innovation lies in its ability to reduce the amount of healthy skin needed for grafting procedures, thereby minimizing patient trauma and improving recovery. Additionally, by minimizing strain generated within grafts, this solution reduces the likelihood of cell activation, thereby decreasing the risk of postoperative complications such as secondary skin contracture. Beyond benefiting individual patients, this technology could set new standards in surgical practices, leading to more efficient healthcare delivery and lower long-term healthcare costs. \r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. This solution is based on the development of precise mathematical models and experimental techniques that unravel the complexities of skin graft mechanics. This research has led to the creation of innovative meshing patterns for skin grafts that enhance graft expansion and minimize internal strain, minimizing donor site trauma and improving healing outcomes. These advancements are based on solid mechanobiological principles and represent a significant improvement over traditional skin grafting techniques, which often result in skin waste and even graft failure.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
