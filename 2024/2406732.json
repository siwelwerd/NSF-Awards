 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support for the 29th Southern California Geometric Analysis Seminar to take place during the period 04/13-14, 2024 at UC San Diego. Geometric analysis is an important and growing field in modern mathematics - connecting the tools of analysis to the structures and frameworks of geometry. It is a discipline with links to many other branches of mathematics and physics. The goal of this seminar is to disseminate recent progress in geometric analysis to the Ph.D. students, postdoctoral researchers and mathematicians in the Southern California Area and beyond. Organizers plan on a broad and diverse recruitment.\r\n\r\nGeometric analysts have combined the powerful tools of analysis with the foundations of geometry to solve a large number of problems across wide-ranging fields of study. These include global geometry, algebraic geometry, topology, several complex variables and fields within physics such as general relativity and string theory. This event will feature seven internationally known, invited speakers. More information is found at the conference website at https://mathweb.ucsd.edu/~scgas/.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
