 "awd_abstract_narration": "The three-year renewal REU Site: Exploring the Limits of Life- Understanding Biofilms in Extreme Environments is hosted by Montana State University\u2019s (MSU) centers of excellence, the Thermal Biology Institute (TBI) and the Center for Biofilm Engineering (CBE). The REU Site supports 10 students each year. Participants will explore the limits of life in extreme environments and through team-orientated learning and guided research, helping students study the physical, chemical, and biological underpinnings of biofilm-forming microorganisms in extreme environments. The goals of the REU program are to 1) increase the participation of students who are members of underrepresented groups and students from institutions with limited research opportunities in innovative science and engineering research; 2) empower more undergraduates to pursue advanced degrees in engineering, microbiology, and related disciplines; and 3) strengthen and encourage the persistence of students in STEM through novel research and professional development. Participants will also learn how to communicate scientific findings in written and oral formats. Creating a community of learners/researchers is at the forefront of this REU Site, with students participating in academic and social events, including professional development seminars, weekly workshops, a local science and technology meeting, outings to experience life in Montana, and immersion in the extreme biofilms of Yellowstone National Park via a three-day sampling trip.\r\n\r\nThe three-year renewal REU Site: Exploring the Limits of Life- Understanding Biofilms in Extreme Environments is hosted by Montana State University\u2019s (MSU) centers of excellence, the Thermal Biology Institute (TBI) and the Center for Biofilm Engineering (CBE). The REU Site supports 10 students each year, and participants will work on an extreme biofilm research project under the guidance of faculty experts. As part of their research, program participants help a) understand and predict the observable characteristics of biofilms in extreme environments, b) examine biofilm activities in targeted built environments, and c) screen extremophilic biofilms for novel degradation, valorization, and/or living functional materials use. Students are involved in all phases of their research project, from formulating a research work plan and understanding research methods to gathering and interpreting data. Program assessment will leverage the online SALG URSSA evaluation tool and student interviews, with longitudinal tracking surveys used after the program to gauge the degree to which our REU experience has had a lasting effect in retaining students in science and engineering. Participants will also learn how to communicate scientific findings in written and oral formats.
