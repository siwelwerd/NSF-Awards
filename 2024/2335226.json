 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II\r\nproject addresses the limitations of mass-produced footwear sizing by introducing size-inclusive bespoke custom-fit shoes. Poorly fitted footwear is an increasingly costly and painful problem with growing human, economic, and environmental implications.\r\nIncorrect footwear fit is a significant driver of foot pain and disorders, including toe deformities, corns,\r\nfoot ulceration, and ankle pain. Additionally, e-commerce is on the rise, wherein up to 40% of shoes\r\npurchased online are returned with poor fit as the biggest driver. These reduce retail margins and increase\r\nfootwear\u2019s carbon footprint. Custom-fit shoes can solve the problem of poor fit; however, traditional\r\ncustom-fit is a labor-intensive process. Advancements in artificial intelligence can modernize and scale\r\ncustom-fit shoe manufacturing, potentially reducing price points and lead times. \r\n\r\nThe proposed project aims to implement an automated solution for custom-fit footwear with three methods: (1) smartphone-based foot scanning and fit survey to obtain foot measurements and footwear construction preferences utilizing artificial\r\nintelligence, (2) automation of shoe last personalization, and (3) adaptive shoe componentry for custom-fit shoe construction. \r\nThe project utilizes artificial intelligence and machine learning, 3D modeling, computer vision, and 3D manufacturing to: (i) develop and deploy a highly accurate virtual foot image-to-measurements machine learning model; (ii) expand a shoe\r\nlast library to train and implement a machine learning model for foot measurement-to-shoe last\r\nprediction; (iii) manufacture custom-fit shoes by combining personalized last with a compatible adaptive\r\nsole; and (iv) establish a customer feedback system for iterative shoe modification by incorporating user\r\nqualitative responses and sole wear patterns.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
