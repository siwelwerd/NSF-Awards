 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact of this I-Corps project is the development of product to detect fever in babies and young children using a temperature sensitive textile. The initial application is a headband to monitor forehead temperature that uses yarn coated with a pigment that changes color when the temperature increases. The product is envisioned to be used in hospitals, daycare centers, and homes by caregivers of infants and young children who may need to be monitored for fever. The goal is to allow caregivers to monitor body temperature continuously with less effort while maintaining the comfort of the infant or child. \r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. The solution is based on the development of temperature-sensing textiles utilizing yarns that are coated with thermochromic pigments. The thermochromic yarn changes color once its surface temperature surpasses a specific threshold. A prototype has been developed to detect body temperature on the forehead by incorporating thermochromic yarn into the headband of a hat. The threshold temperature is tailored to facilitate color changes for the purpose of detecting the presence of fever. Integrating functional textiles into clothing and textile accessories may have benefits for healthcare and other applications.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
