 "awd_abstract_narration": "Healthy crop production in the U.S. is critical for not only the food and nutrition security of the U.S. and the world but also the prosperity of the U.S. economy. The USDA Agricultural Innovation Agenda calls for increasing U.S. agricultural production by 40% while cutting its environmental footprint in half by 2050. Sound crop management decision-making is a key to achieving this ambitious goal. An example of such decision-making is \u201cshould I irrigate my cornfield today? If so, by how many inches of water?\u201d Traditionally, such decisions are made by individuals based on their empirical judgment, which is often subjective and less optimal. Science-based, data-driven approaches for cropping decision-making rely on timely and accurate information on current and predicted future conditions of crop and environment to make optimal decisions. However, it remains a challenge for stakeholders to adopt the data-driven approach because they do not have full and effective access to the timely and accurate information and lack facilities or knowledge to process the information. This project will meet the challenge by offering the data-driven optimal cropping decision-making services nationwide up to field scales through developing and operating the CropSmart digital twin. The services will be accessible to users through both web portals and smartphone Apps. This project will help USDA to archive its innovation goal, enhance food and nutrition security of the U.S. and the world, and bring hundred-million-dollar economic return and huge environmental benefits to U.S. economy and society annually.\r\n\r\nCropSmart, to be built and operated by this project, is a digital replica of real-world cropping systems over the contiguous US up to 10-m spatial resolution. It will not only accurately represent the current crop and environment conditions, but also predict, with acceptable confidence levels, future conditions with hypothetical \u201cwhat if\u201d scenarios, resulting in actionable predictions. CropSmart will provide three services to users: 1) user-specific decision ready information on which the user can make data-driven decision; 2) \u201cwhat if\u201d tradeoff service which will generate consequences (e.g., yield, economic return, or environmental footprint) of different user decision options so that the user can find the optimal decision; and 3) decision advice service which will automatically generate optimal decision based on a user\u2019s decision goal. CropSmart will be built by integrating the advanced remote sensing, crop and environmental modeling, AI/ML, agro-geoinformatics, and digital twin technologies through the multi-disciplinary convergence approach. The major project activities will include: 1) implementing CropSmart to support at least 6 types of top-priority decision-making use-cases specified by the user community; (2) deploying CropSmart operationally to cultivate its user community and show its gaming-change impacts; 3) broadening adoption, participation, and impact through a comprehensive education, extension, and outreach program; and (4) establishing a community-based CropSmart.org and implement the sustainability plan to sustain CropSmart activities after project expires and maximize the long-term project impacts. At the end of the performance period, this project will deliver the CropSmart software package, the operational CropSmart services, and a sustained community of at least 6,000 users.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
