 "awd_abstract_narration": "Interest in reforming criminal punishment and immigrant detention has been growing in academic, political, and societal circles. Community supervision programs were developed as reform options intended to provide more constructive treatment of the individuals involved in comparison to carceral alternatives. These programs include probation, parole, and pretrial electronic monitoring in the criminal legal system and alternatives-to-detention programs in the immigration system. However, as the researchers established through a pilot project, in the effort to ensure compliance with supervision requirements, community supervision programs can have unforeseen consequences for supervised individuals, such as high levels of surveillance, criminal profiling, and criminal system involvement for immigration detainees. This research adds to scientific understanding by identifying the specific elements of community supervision that create significant experiences of criminalization for supervised individuals in both the criminal legal and immigration spheres. The research also explores how the effects on individuals\u2019 everyday lives, their family relationships, and their ability to participate constructively in community life also reflect trends in broader social systems such that low-income, racially-minoritized individuals are affected disproportionately. The knowledge gained can contribute to the development of more effective community supervision policies and programs and also to the overarching effort to reform criminal punishment and immigration detention. \r\n\r\nFocused on the consequences of community supervision programs in both the criminal legal and immigration systems, this research investigates three key questions: 1) How do the state and state actors conceptualize and enforce individuals\u2019 compliance with the requirements of community supervision programs? 2) How do supervised individuals and their families experience and perform compliance with supervision requirements? 3) How do compliance dynamics contribute to racial disparities in the experience of supervision? The answers are pursued through a multi-method approach that includes courtroom observations, interviews, and photo-voice narratives. Grounded in the methodology of Participatory Action Research, the project team includes individuals with prior experience of community supervision with the rationale that those most a\ufb00ected by the social problem at the heart of the research should contribute to conducting the research. The comparison of the criminal justice and immigration realms enables the researchers to highlight parallels and contrasts and thus to contribute to emerging scientific and policy attention to the intersection of these fields. Findings from this research augment scientific understanding of how policies and institutional practices intended to be humane and race-neutral might result in racially-patterned negative experiences for individuals and those around them. This understanding provides a basis for future reform initiatives that seek to avoid the consequences of community supervision, especially for members of vulnerable communities, and to inform new approaches to penal and immigration reform.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
