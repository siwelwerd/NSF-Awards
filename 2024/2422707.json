 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 23rd International Conference on Biochemical and Molecular Engineering (BME XXI) will be held in Dublin, Ireland from July 21-25, 2024. The conference will emphasize accelerating biochemical/biotechnology solutions to address emerging threats to humanity including climate change, disease, inequity, biosecurity. The meeting addresses the mission of NSF, which has been increasingly committed to integrating the engineering sciences with the life sciences, encouraging research and development in multidisciplinary areas, educating the next generation of young scientists, and supporting cutting edge science to answer current and future challenges as well as making sure US-based scientists are globally engaged. \r\n\r\nThe conference is a unique forum to bring together intellectual leaders from across the globe and across a broad sampling of cutting-edge research areas that impact biochemical engineering.  The topics for discussion will include (1) Applications of AI to Biotechnology, (2) Automation in Biomanufacturing, (3) Sustainability, (4) Building the Biomanufacturing Workforce, (5) Democratizing Access to Biotechnology, and (6) Biosecurity.  The conference will generate a publication addressing the state of the art and dictions for future development in these areas.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
