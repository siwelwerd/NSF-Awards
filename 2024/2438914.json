 "awd_abstract_narration": "NSF FAIROS Research Coordination Networks (RCNs) work to build and enhance coordination of researchers and other stakeholders advancing Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) data principles and Open Science (OS) practices. The initial cohort of 10 awards span a wide range of disciplines and have advanced FAIR-OS efforts as well as convened RCN-specific events. To broaden their impact and focus future directions, it is an appropriate time to take stock of RCN efforts and work together to both contextualize successes and clarify gaps as needed to plan sustained efforts in FAIR and Open Science across the US Science research landscape.\r\n\r\nThis PI Meeting will support a community-driven and community-focused effort to help define the role that federal agencies can play in accelerating the pace of FAIROS. The workshop will bring together the research teams in their varied stages of maturity to encourage and support those in their early years while providing new ideas for more mature efforts facing persistent gaps.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
