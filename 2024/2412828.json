 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Standard Model of particle physics has successfully described a wide range of experimental data. Nonetheless, cosmological measurements have shown that the particles described by the Standard Model correspond to only about 5% of the energy density in our universe, with the remaining 95% corresponding to dark matter and dark energy. Despite making up most of the energy density in the universe, very little is known about the dark components of the universe and their dynamics. Professor Marques-Tavares' research focuses on developing new ways to search for particles and forces in this dark sector of the Universe, leveraging data coming from accelerators, astrophysical observations, and cosmology. This research aims to shed new light on two central questions related to dark sectors: whether they have non-gravitational forces; and whether the dark matter energy density is made of multiple species of particles or just one. This work advances the national interest by promoting the progress of fundamental science. In addition, the PI will mentor graduate students and postdocs involved in this research, which contributes to the development of the national STEM workforce.\r\n \r\nThe possible non-gravitational interactions of dark sector particles can be divided into two categories, they can either couple dark sector particles to the standard model or they can be forces that are confined to the dark sector. The PI will conduct a meticulous investigation of new signatures coming from theoretically motivated mediators of forces between the dark sector and the standard model in astrophysical objects, such as gamma-ray emissions following core-collapse supernovae, due to the decay of these mediators, and in cosmology, from late decay of mediator particles produced in the early universe. In addition, the PI will also determine the sensitivity of future lepton colliders to scenarios in which these mediators have larger masses and decay invisibly. To search for forces confined in the dark sector, the PI will study the impact of interactions of dark matter with other dark sector components on the cosmic microwave background and in observations of the large-scale structure of the universe.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
