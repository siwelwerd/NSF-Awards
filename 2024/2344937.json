 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project aims to serve the national need of preparing high-quality mathematics and science teachers committed to teaching in high-need school districts across North Carolina to improve student outcomes. Districts across the state are experiencing critical teacher shortages, particularly in mathematics and science. Additionally, the demographics of teachers do not match the diversity of students. Research shows that students perform better when they are taught by a teacher who matches the demographic characteristics of students.\r\n\r\nThis project at North Carolina State University (NC State) partners with the Wake County Public School System, North Carolina Central University, Wake Technical Community College, and the College of Sciences at NC State to recruit a diverse pool of scholars interested in becoming mathematics and science teachers. The program will select 21 scholars and provide them with learning experiences to deepen their understanding of the content they are teaching, as well as pedagogical strategies to engage students from diverse populations. Evaluation activities will provide insights into how the project prepares and retains beginning teachers. The project will also examine the institutional impacts of the project on the degree programs at NC State. By the time these 21 scholars have met their teaching service requirement, approximately 9,000 students in high-need districts will have the opportunity to receive mathematics and science instruction from these highly qualified teachers. Findings from evaluation efforts will be disseminated broadly through conference presentations and publications. This Track 1: Scholarships and Stipends project is supported through the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program (Noyce). The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 STEM teachers and experienced, exemplary K-12 teachers to become STEM master teachers in high-need school districts. It also supports research on the effectiveness and retention of K-12 STEM teachers in high-need school districts.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
