 "awd_abstract_narration": "Stanford Institute for Theoretical Economics Summer Workshop (SITE) plays a vital role in the profession of economics, serving as a forum that attracts top scholars from around the world to bring together economic theorists and applied economists with an active interest in the theoretical foundations of their work. SITE workshops create an environment that promotes interaction, stimulates discussion, and encourages collaboration leading to research on new topics as well as new applications of economic theory. The workshops also provide an opportunity for leading senior investigators and rising junior researchers and students to present leading-edge economic research, engage in critical scientific discussion, share and strengthen research results, initiate and collaborate on new research, and promote exchanges across disciplines. SITE's support of junior-level scholars and those from underrepresented groups promotes their professional development, providing an opportunity to present their work, and receive feedback from and engage with the full array of participants \u2013 peers to senior scholars. SITE also attracts an international and interdisciplinary audience providing an opportunity for diverse scholars, who might otherwise not have worked together, to learn from one another and explore questions that relate and apply to other fields.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the SITE Summer Workshops is to advance economic science for the benefit of society. SITE contributes to the understanding and application of economic theory to processes, institutions, and systems, nationally and globally. Each year sees an exchange of organizers, which ensures broad representation for choice of topics and selection of speakers. With the increasingly interdisciplinary nature of economics research, SITE workshops contribute to and promote the rapid dissemination of the latest, topical research not only to economists but also to researchers, policymakers, and scholars in other disciplines, as well as government and private sectors. The wide range of interests and expertise of the economists involved guarantees that many topics will be offered. Many of the concepts presented at SITE have contributed to widely accepted economic theory and broadly applied economic practice. The dissemination of scientific knowledge strengthens both empirical and theoretical economic analysis and research methods and improves the understanding of the processes and institutions of the U.S. economy and of the world system of which it is a part. SITE maintains an online archive where digital versions of the presented papers are available for public viewing, which benefits those who cannot attend the sessions and facilitates the dissemination of the knowledge and research presented at the workshops.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
