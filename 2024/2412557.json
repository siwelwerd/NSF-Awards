 "awd_abstract_narration": "This I-Corps project focuses on the development of a sustainable resource management technology to foster a circular economy for critical metals. The technology focuses on efficiently recycling scarce resources like gold, crucial due to its finite nature and the human rights and environmental issues associated with its extraction. This technology not only reduces pollution but also could generate job opportunities, aiding economic growth. The technology has the potential to accelerate recycling while cutting operational costs. The solution could also extend to other chemical separations like water remediation, potentially impacting various industries and environmental initiatives. Commercially, it can enhance efficiency, reduce costs, and provide a groundbreaking platform for diverse applications, indicating a substantial, positive influence on scientific and technological understanding.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. The solution is based on a technology for refining precious metals, particularly gold, from electronic waste, addressing the inefficiencies and environmental impact of current methods. The technology uses an electrochemical process based on the selective adsorption activated by electricity. This innovation results in a 99% pure output without chemical consumption. The technology stands out for its speed, compactness, ease of use, and cost-effectiveness compared to traditional methods of gold purification. Potentially, it can be 50% cheaper, 100 times faster (a single-day process compared to months), simpler (by a factor of four over refining), and scalable. The technology could change gold recycling in electronics, where only 9% get properly recycled. It consumes minimal electricity (renewable energy-compatible), providing an economically viable, swift, and straightforward solution. This technology presents an opportunity to meet escalating demand for gold recycling while advancing sustainability in a lucrative market, potentially transforming e-waste recycling practices globally.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
