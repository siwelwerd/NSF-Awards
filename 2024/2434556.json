The meeting is planned for August 12-13, 2024, at the Le Meridien in Charlotte, NC. CSSI PI meetings provide a forum for PIs to share technical information about their projects with each other, NSF program directors and others; to explore innovative topics emerging in the software and data infrastructure communities; to discuss and learn about best practices across projects; and to stimulate new ideas of achieving software and data sustainability and ensuring a diverse pipeline of CI researchers and professionals. PIs also provide valuable feedback to the program on emerging opportunities and challenges. This year we expect to see the effect of AI on NSF research community and the potential for new cyberinfrastructure.   This year we will use 3 poster sessions to enable every attending PI to communicate their research results towards the goals of the CSSI. We will also have 3 panels focused a) on the proposed development of AI Research cyberinfrastructure through the National AI Research Resource (NAIRR ) initiative, b) on ensuring technical and operational sustainability of CSSI supported cybertools, and c) on the development of workforce for these. Breakouts for participants to discuss and provide concrete feedback will complement the posters and panels.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
