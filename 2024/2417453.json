 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national interest by creating an efficient, scalable method through which a wide range of undergraduate students can find, analyze, and understand relevant biology research in research journals. Such experiences give students an understanding of recent advances in the field, allow them to make stronger connections between research and real-world applications, improve their professional skills, and support them in becoming lifelong learners. By creating an innovative model called Peer-Reviewed Presentation Exchange (Perepex), the project aims to provide students in many different biology courses with opportunities to engage in low-stress, structured discussions and presentations of biology research papers. This approach will allow a much broader range of students to have access to powerful learning experiences that traditionally have been available only in smaller, advanced courses in selective institutions.\r\n\r\nThe project's goals include adapting and refining the Perepex model for large-enrollment courses and less selective institutions, while focusing on inclusivity and effective peer feedback mechanisms. The project will leverage five years of successful outcomes from an advanced biology course and the expertise of biology educators and a learning scientist. Methodologically, it will employ easy-to-use, low-cost technologies to facilitate seamless integration into existing courses. The project team plans to study the effectiveness of this model in improving students' engagement and self-efficacy, as well as the quality of peer feedback in various educational contexts. Dissemination of results will be conducted through conferences, journal publications, and a dedicated website.\r\n\r\nThe NSF IUSE: EDU Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through the Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports creating, exploring, and implementing promising practices and tools.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
