 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research in this project concerns one of the basic questions in mathematics: solving algebraic equations. The information of the solutions are encoded in various mathematical objects: algebraic cycles, automorphic forms and L-functions. The research will deepen the understanding of these mathematical objects and the connection between them, especially in high dimensions, which requires solving many new problems, developing new tools and interactions in diverse areas, and appealing to new perspectives which may shed new light on old problems. It will also advance the techniques for understanding the arithmetic of elliptic curves, particularly the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture, one of the seven Millennium Prize Problems of the Clay Mathematics Institute. The PI will continue to mentor graduate students, organize conferences and workshops, and write expository articles.  \r\n\r\nThe PI will work on several projects relating arithmetic geometry with automorphic L-function, centered around the common theme of the generalization and applications of the Gross--Zagier formula. The PI will investigate the Kudla--Rapoport conjecture for parahoric levels. The PI will extend the arithmetic inner product formula to orthogonal groups, and study the Bloch--Kato conjecture of symmetric power motives of elliptic curves and endoscopic cases of the arithmetic Gan--Gross--Prasad conjectures. The PI will also investigate a new arithmetic relative trace formula approach towards a Gross--Zagier type formula for orthogonal Shimura varieties.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
