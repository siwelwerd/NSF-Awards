 "awd_abstract_narration": "The International Conference on Foundations of Computer Aided Process Design will bring together and foster interaction among world-renowned experts from academia and industry, researchers and practitioners from government laboratories and several industries, graduate students, and post-doctoral associates. A dedicated and highlighted session featuring rising star junior researchers in process and product design to discuss future challenges, opportunities, and the frontiers of product and process design. This conference will also provide a unique vehicle for disseminating the state of the art in product and process design through its fully indexed and citable proceedings, its website, and more importantly through the informal discussions on research, education, training, and industrial needs.\r\n\r\nThe conference will create a technical and scientific forum for the topics of design for sustainability; technology R&D and energy transition modeling; process design for decarbonization; electrification, de-fossilized chemical, and process industry; carbon capture; green hydrogen production; and renewable energy systems; and AI and machine learning for process and product design; and education, training and industrial needs in product and process design. Special plenary sessions are planned for focusing on design for sustainability and resilience, design and energy transitions, and advances and opportunities of artificial intelligence and machine learning in product design.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
