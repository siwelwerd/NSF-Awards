 "awd_abstract_narration": "This NSF Regional Innovation Engines Development Award is focused on developing alternative packaging using waste materials. It seeks to build the foundations of an ecosystem that will address packaging waste pollution through a total transformation of existing practices via convergence and coordination of diverse stakeholder groups. Essentially, the goals are to reduce the amount of plastic material in landfills and to increase the lifespan of plastic materials by developing and/or refining alternate markets for plastics use. The project is led by Michigan State University Research Foundation, with the Region of Service broadly defined as encompassing the Great Lakes Region.\r\n\r\nThis project will help change the current treatment of packaging as waste into profitable feedstocks that, combined with agricultural and industrial wastes, will supply the packaging supply chain. The Great Lakes Region is an economic powerhouse representing some of the largest paper and plastics manufacturers and end users. The SHAPE Engine, through its established, growing, and diverse ecosystem of educational institutions, government entities, non-profits, communities, and companies of all sizes, will seamlessly identify and fill all the gaps impeding sustainable packaging today. The effort seeks to establish the Region as a world leader in decarbonized, circular, bio-based, and recycled plastic and paper packaging that addresses United Nation's Sustainable Development Goals, and ultimately could help other regions and countries mirror its successful deployment and institutionalization of sustainable packaging. Partnerships to expand technology translation, commercialization, and enhanced development of a diverse community workforce are key components that will be addressed in this project.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
