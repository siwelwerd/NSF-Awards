 "awd_abstract_narration": "In FY2021, the Division of Chemistry at National Science Foundation (NSF) launched a new highly collaborative program (the Molecular Foundations for Biotechnology - MFB), which supports fundamentally new approaches in molecular sciences to drive new directions in molecular biotechnology, a critical and emerging technology of the 21st century. The program has grown into a direct partnership between the National Institutes of Health\u2019s National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) and six divisions across four NSF directorates. Eleven awards were made in the first two funding cycles, and a third funding round is in progress.  \r\n\r\nWith support from the Division of Chemistry (CHE) and the Directorate for Technology, Innovation, and Partnerships at NSF, Dr. Anthony Boccanfuso of University-Industry Demonstration Partnership is organizing a workshop for awardees in the first two funding cycles, other academic investigators, and a strategic set of private sector representatives to consider the progress of the MFB program (Day 1), followed by a day dedicated to exploring current federal agency approaches to translating research and the commercial and translation potential of the research thrusts (Day 2). The ultimate goals of this workshop are to assess the translational potential of the MFB program, bring in possible investment from the business sector, and identify other technical areas needing additional investments.  The workshop is slated to take place in Spring 2024 in the Washington, DC region.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

These areas should be well suited for the multidisciplinary research that the MFB initiative can catalyze. Key areas for follow-on discussion included:\r\n\n\nI. Innovations in Target Identification\r\n\n\nTarget identification remains a key element of biomedical science, in which innovations in fundamental science can be game changers. This has been seen particularly in activity-based protein proteomics, an area identified in the research discussions. In terms of biological regulation/signaling, there remains a need to develop new tools that allow the investigator to read individual proteoforms. Membrane proteins and receptors and RNAs, including micro-RNA and other non-coding RNAs, are important and less well-characterized areas of biomacromolecular space to explore.\r\n\n\nII.

Novel Modalities to Manipulate Biology\r\n\n\nThere are a number of mechanisms by which cellular biology can be re-routed using heterobifunctional small molecules that serve as proximity inducers. While most of these proximity inducers involve two unrelated ligands for two different targets connected via linker, there is also interest in molecules that do not require a linkermolecular glues. The novel modalities that take such a chemical approach to manipulate biology hold great promise for new ways to approach biological targets.\r\n\n\nIV. Delivery\r\n\n\nDelivery of a therapeutic agent to a specific targeted site involves multiple scales, from targeting particular physiological loci to controlling/limiting organ distribution or specificity for a discrete tissue type or cell type, to crossing the cell membrane, to targeting particularly sub-cellular compartments. There was interest among company participants in the fundamental chemistry and biology that underlie successful carrier mechanisms, particularly for cargo like mRNA that cannot be too generally immunogenic but must safely be delivered to the targeted cell nuclei for translation into the antigenic protein or protein fragment to induce the specific targeted immune response desired.\r\n\n\nV. Bioorthogonal Chemistry\r\n\n\nParticipants expressed the need for the discovery and development of a much larger array of chemical transformations that can be performed in biological systems. Such tools are useful for targeting specific cell-surface glycoproteins or receptors, for example, and may allow for many more in vivo self-assembly and selection approaches in chemical biology, the surface of which is only now beginning to be scratched.\r\n\n\nVI. Big Data, Data-Sharing Repositories, Data Analytics, and AI and ML\r\n\n\nWidely accepted formats and repositories for data storage arose as an important sub-theme. One potential focus could be in the Human Proteome Project, fully characterizing what could be some one million expressed proteoforms. The data challenges for such an effort are significant, but this could have major implications for bringing the full weight of innovations in omics measurements to the level of smart, readable, personalized fingerprints to guide future efforts in molecular personalized medicine.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nBiomedical Long-Term Broader Impacts\r\n\n\nThe leaders from pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies articulated several clear priorities in terms of challenge areas in biomedical science, specifically:\r\n\n\nI. neurodegenerative indications;\r\n\n\nII.    cardiovascular health;\r\n\n\nIII.    oncology/cancer biology; and\r\n\n\nIV.    immune system-related indications.\r\n\n\nHigh-level themes emerging from the workshop included the critical role of data (storage, analysis, and shared access), as well as tools and platforms that can leverage AI and machine learning to enhance discovery and a list of next steps to execute on this goal.
