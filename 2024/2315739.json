 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Regional Innovation Engines Development Award is focused on leveraging a growing ecosystem in quantum science-based technologies through research and development in the central Wisconsin to Illinois region. The award supports Quantum Crossroads, a unifying structure strengthening existing partnerships in the region and within the quantum technology field \u2013 including CQE (Chicago Quantum Exchange) which will serve as the institutional home for the project team. Main organizational partners include government, academic and corporate representatives and their organizations, with a focus on each aspect of the engine: workforce development, regional innovation, DEIA, as well as research and technological advancement.\r\n\r\nQuantum computing is a multidisciplinary field comprising aspects of computer science, physics, and mathematics that utilizes quantum mechanics to solve complex problems significantly faster than on normal (\"classical\") computers. The field of quantum computing includes hardware research and application development. Associated with quantum computing are quantum sensing and quantum communications. The technical focus of this award is on building the necessary R&D and translation plans foundations to support a practical infrastructure to connect existing quantum nodes, building new nodes, and then providing funding to researchers to use this new and existing infrastructure.  Due to a lack of understanding around how quantum technology can benefit stakeholders, the plan includes education around quantum technology not only to the public, but to investors, entrepreneurs, teachers, and researchers. Partnerships with industry and/or national laboratories are keys to success.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
