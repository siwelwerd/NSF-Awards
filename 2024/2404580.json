 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Missouri State University ADVANCE Adaptation project--Access, Climate, and Equity (ACE) Initiative--will induce positive, sustainable, systemic change for STEM faculty by implementing evidence-based practices that will foster a climate of equity in MSU\u2019s STEM departments. Guided by rich institutional data, the project will increase access through equitable hiring, facilitate a more welcoming climate, and improve equity in tenure and promotion to associate professor for all faculty in STEM.\r\n\r\nThe ACE Initiative seeks to adapt evidence-based strategies for (1) training search committees and tenure & promotion committees, (2) department chair professional development, and (3) early career management. Formative and summative assessment will be conducted by an internal evaluator, and additional guidance will be provided by internal and external advisory groups. The project can serve as a model for other public, regional institutions.\r\n\r\nThe NSF ADVANCE program is designed to foster gender equity through a focus on the identification and elimination of organizational barriers that impede the full participation and advancement of diverse faculty in academic institutions.\u202fOrganizational barriers that inhibit equity may exist in policies, processes, practices, and the organizational culture and climate. ADVANCE \u201cAdaptation\u201d awards provide support for the adaptation and adoption of evidence-based strategies to academic, non-profit institutions of higher education as well as non-academic, non-profit organizations.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
