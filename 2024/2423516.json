 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 2024 Optogenetic Technologies and Applications Conference will have an expanded range of topics and will emphasize burgeoning areas of research such as optogenetics in cell-free systems, optogenetics methods for in vivo and in vitro stimulation, and optogenetic applications in biotechnology.  The broader range of topics will allow the conference to host scientists and engineers with diverse backgrounds. The conference will also allow students and early career professionals to share their work and learn about new advances in a rapidly growing field. Additionally, the conference will promote the continuous growth of members of the optogenetic research community, encouraging discussions among normally separated scientists and engineers and encouraging collaborations, which are critical for the development of new optogenetic technologies and applications that support the bioeconomy. \r\n\r\nOptogenetics is an emerging technique that allows researchers to use light to control living cells. Optogenetics has a myriad of applications in fields such as healthcare, energy, and chemical manufacturing. Because of rapid advancements in the field and its potential to be used in industry, the 2024 Optogenetic Technologies and Applications Conference is designed to showcase cutting edge basic and applied optogenetics research. The Conference touches on a broad range of topics, including optogentics in nuerobiology, in vivo applications of optogenetics, optogenetic applications in cell-free systems, and optogenetic applications in biotechnology.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
