 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Poisson 2024 Summer School and Conference will take place July 1-12, 2024 in Naples, Italy at the headquarters of the Accademia Pontaniana at the University of Naples. Poisson geometry is a highly interdisciplinary field which has found numerous applications\r\nboth to mathematics and to many areas of physics. The goal of Poisson 2024 is to make the latest developments in the field accessible to participants at all career stages, initiating an active exchange of ideas and giving them an opportunity to form new collaborations. The first week of this program will consist of a summer school of five minicourses delivered by senior experts, whose goal is to introduce junior researchers to a broad range of topics in some of the most active areas of Poisson geometry. The second week will feature a research conference with twenty talks by leading researchers and early-career emerging experts that will highlight recent breakthroughs. The purpose of this award is to support the participation of US-based researchers, especially those at an early career stage, in this international event.\r\n\r\nThe program of the meeting will survey the latest progress in a broad range of areas with links to Poisson geometry. The summer school will have a strong training component that features both introductory courses in Dirac geometry and shifted symplectic geometry as well as more advanced surveys of deformation quantization, mathematical physics, and quantum groups. The conference will include talks on a variety of rapidly developing research topics, including symplectic and Dirac geometry, generalized complex structures, Lie algebroids and Lie groupoids, geometric mechanics, Poisson algebraic geometry, integrable systems, higher structures, non-commutative geometry, quantum groups, and rapidly developing areas of Poisson-Lie groups and cluster theory. During the opening of the conference, the winners of the Andre Lichnerowicz prize for notable early-career contributions to Poisson geometry will also be announced. More details can be found at https://sites.google.com/view/poisson2024/poisson-2024.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
