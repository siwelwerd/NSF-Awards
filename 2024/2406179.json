 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) through Targeted Infusion Projects supports the development, implementation, and study of evidence-based, innovative models and approaches for improving the preparation and success of HBCU undergraduate students so that they may pursue science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) graduate programs and/or careers. The goal of this project is to develop and implement three new courses and significantly enhance the newly established Bachelor of Science program in cybersecurity at the University of the District of Columbia.\r\n\r\nThe project aims to accomplish this goal through four primary objectives: 1) design and implement new cybersecurity coursework for skills in high demand; 2) increase research capacity by engaging students in cybersecurity research; 3) recruit and retain minority and female students via a multi-campus learning community of a Cybersecurity and Emerging Technologies Awareness program, and 4) increase early exposure and interest in cybersecurity in K-12 by developing and offering a cybersecurity summer camp. It is expected that at least 500 undergraduate, community college, and K-12 students will be directly impacted, and benefit from, the proposed activities. This project will address the national shortage of skilled cybersecurity professionals by engaging underrepresented students and equipping them with high-demand cybersecurity skills and will thus protect national security and public safety.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
