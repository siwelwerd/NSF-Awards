 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is the derisking and catalyzing of a novel backdrivable gearbox technology that will potentially step-improve robotic and automation system operating costs, mean-time-before failure, efficiency, high throughput, and manufacturing capabilities, especially in microgravity/space environments. Having the potential to isolate vibrations and operate far longer without maintenance compared to the status quo, integrating this backlash-free gearbox with commercial-off-the-shelf servo motors and controllers could enable commercial original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and U.S. government entities to create platforms and commercial space stations with higher throughput and faster iterative research capabilities in the microgravity environment, offering a plethora of benefits for semiconductor, biotechnology, advanced materials, and other industries.  The targeted specifications are relevant to end-effectors with flight heritage to enable rapid transition for lunar, low-earth orbit, terrestrial robotic manufacturing, and scientific applications.  Through investment in this technology, this HUBZone-certified firm is concurrently creating STEM and manufacturing jobs in the HUBZone area in which the company resides and increasing exposure to STEM in the community at large.  Moreover, the company\u2019s products are and shall continue to be, fully U.S.-sourced and manufactured to stimulate the U.S. manufacturing economy and supply chain security.\r\n\r\nThis SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop and validate the operating principle of the patent-pending innovative flux angle mapping magnetic gear and determine space-actuator feasibility for the commercialization of magnetic gear technology. The proposed noncontact magnetic gear is an entirely new magnetic gearbox topology with a novel set of operating principles that differ from all other existing magnetic gearbox topologies and have never been demonstrated as an operational prototype.  It has been validated previously by high-fidelity finite element analysis (FEA) simulation and analytical derivation.  The first key objective of Phase I is to design, fabricate, and test a prototype FAM magnetic gearbox.  The second key objective is to use FEA combined with the first prototype's experimental results to re-simulate and characterize the performance of a second-generation minimum viable product magnetic gear. The mechanism to assess success is the achievement of four milestones: (1) designing a manufacturable technology demonstrator, validating manufacturability; creating an operational prototype (2) demonstrating the expected gear ratio, validating the fundamental operating principle and (3) performing in concordance with the simulation results, validating our models; (4) designing a full-scale space-relevant gear with calibrated models, validating commercial feasibility.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
