 "awd_abstract_narration": "Social integration (interconnection to others and location within the social network) has been associated to health, survival, and reproductive success in several social species, including humans and non-human primates. Despite its importance, the pathways through which non-human primates develop social integration are poorly understood. This study addresses this issue through the longitudinal study of a social non-human primate species that has significant commonalities with humans (e.g., fission-fusion dynamics and cooperative infant care). The study follows individuals from birth to adulthood, analyzes allomaternal (non-mother) care, and assesses how social bonds form, and how individuals become integrated into social networks. The longitudinal nature of the study allows for the examination of social integration changes, as well as its impacts, across the life span. The study develops educational materials for the public and K-12 students. The study also trains students from diverse geographic regions.   \r\n\r\nTo investigate how early rearing environments and maternal social networks impact the origins and development of social integration the study focuses on a non-human primate species with high variability in rearing strategies. Given that individuals from this species are born in litters the study compares sibling, that shared the same rearing environment, as well as non-siblings. The selected species has a short developmental period that allows for the longitudinal study of social integration across the lifespan. Researchers collect data on rearing strategies (single vs. communal nesting, allomaternal care presence/absence as well as quantity), social integration (through social network analysis), and rearing choices. Ultimately, the study evaluates the impact of allomaternal care and cooperative breeding on the evolution of social integration. \r\n\r\nThis research is supported by the Biological Anthropology and Animal Behavior programs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
