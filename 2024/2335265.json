 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will create a novel language learning platform grounded in learning science to make language learning more accessible and inclusive, build human connections at home and abroad, utilize artificial intelligent (AI) learning solutions into stronger alignment to the needs of educational institutions, and exemplify the potential of decentralized social media for social connectedness through language learning. The project introduces a unique approach where students \u2018learn a language while texting their friends,\u2019 leveraging innovations in AI to create scalable, playful, and social language learning experiences. The project's competitive edge lies in its novel application of proprietary artificial intelligence algorithms which promote social learning and the expansive network of educators and students it aims to connect. Engineered to address the $1.2B global language learner market, by year three of commercialization, annual revenues are estimated at $2.5M. \r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project proposes an intelligent language learning environment which facilitates \u201clearning by doing\u201d within the context of peer-to-peer instant messaging conversation. The project integrates human and artificial intelligence (AI) to immediately augment student communicative abilities while fostering learning and supporting educator practices. Technical objectives are organized by and assessed according to the product goals of privacy and security of the instant messaging platform and AI tools, student engagement, educational efficacy, and scaling to additional languages. The product will be verified private, secure and aligned for the university market. The product will engage students in 20x more conversation practice per semester than direct competitors. Efficacy studies will demonstrate gains across key metrics for developing language proficiency. Achievement of these goals will position the product to address the needs of US university language educators with clear and objective evidence of core value propositions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
