 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project from Freescale LLC will be on scalable additive manufacturing of micro and macro scales for analog electronics, artificial intelligence (AI), and sensing applications. The project will leverage recent advancements in electrohydrodynamic and micro-transfer printing, alongside AI-controlled manufacturing, to produce micro and macro-scale electronic devices with a submicron resolution. The resulting devices will have the capability of computing and sensing, similar to biological brains. The project will strengthen domestic microelectronics innovation and production capabilities and support US leadership in AI and quantum computing. New intelligent systems developed using these techniques can help address challenges in healthcare, aerospace, defense, transportation, energy, and more.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project aims to demonstrate the manufacturing of\r\nfully printed functional devices using an innovative multifunctional printing platform for next-generation electronics. The platform will provide development, optimization, and delivery of specialty inks with\r\nconductive and semiconductive properties that will be printed on rigid and flexible surfaces to produce analog computing and sensing functionality. The platform will support printing at micro and macro scales, leveraging real-time feedback and artificial intelligence (AI) control for intelligent composition modification, delivery parameter optimization, and scalable manufacturing. Currently, conventional lithographic fabrication of functional devices is expensive and inefficient, as it requires complex supply chains, expensive hardware, and offshore production. This STTR project will combine precise inkjet printing for thin layer deposition and micro-transfer printing for large-area development to enable seamless fabrication of functional devices for sensing and analog computation in days instead of months, bypassing the complexities of modern silicon manufacturing.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
