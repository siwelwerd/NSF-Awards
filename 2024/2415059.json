 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides funds to support participation in the  Student Research Workshop in the Computational Linguistics at the North America Association for Computational Linguistics (NAACL) 2024 Conference during the period of July 16-21 in Mexico City, Mexico. The ACL is the primary international organization in the field of natural language processing and language engineering. The Student Research Workshop (SRW) is an established tradition at ACL conferences, allowing students to present their research, experience a global conference in their field of, and receive invaluable feedback from senior researchers. \r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this award is that it enables doctoral students to exchange insights and receive feedback and guidance. The workshop format is a stimulating environment for students to present their work and be exposed to outside perspectives at a critical time in their research career. The Student Research Workshop welcomes two types of submissions: research papers and thesis proposals.  The feedback that students receive from other students and faculty members helps them enhance their own dissertation research proposals. The broader impact of this grant is that it facilitates new research collaborations and professional networks, as well as developing a greater awareness of ongoing cutting-edge research.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
