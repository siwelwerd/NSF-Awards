 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site award to Furman University, located in Greenville, SC, supports the training of 10 students for 10 weeks during the summers of 2024-2026. In this program, funded by the Division of Chemistry, participants pursue collaborative research projects, with a focus on providing undergraduate research opportunities in all branches of chemistry for students early in their studies. In addition, Furman\u2019s research accelerator model will help develop more robust undergraduate research programs at Primarily Undergraduate Institutions (PUIs) across the Southeast. Participants take part in a three-week program that combines the beginning stages of research with modules taught by the faculty on various activities essential for the research enterprise. They also take part in a Pathway Program, which prepares them for graduate school or industrial careers.  \r\n \r\nThe students undertake individual projects encompassing all fields of chemistry. These projects include organic synthesis of natural products, nanomaterial synthesis and materials characterization, inorganic synthesis, computational chemistry directed towards basic problems in physical chemistry, understanding the chemistry of the origins of life, developing photocatalysts for converting light into electricity or fuels, biochemistry of fungal pathogens and protein-DNA binding, electron paramagnetic resonance and optical absorption spectroscopy, understanding the structure and function of DNA-bound sliver clusters, investigating the degradation of herbicides, and developing and applying mass spectrometry instrumentation to solve clinical, biological, and environmental problems. To increase diversity in the STEM pipeline, the REU program incorporates visiting teams of students and faculty from small colleges, HBCUs, and technical colleges, thus serving as a facilitator and incubator, a place where visiting faculty can build research programs that will amplify the REU program beyond the borders of Furman.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
