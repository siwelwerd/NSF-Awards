 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Partnerships for Innovation - Technology Translation (PFI-TT) project is to introduce new materials to the market that generate high intensity THz-frequency light. These materials will meet the growing needs of many current and emerging scanning and sensing applications that are limited by the strength of THz-frequency light sources. The introduction of brighter THz light sources into current and developing scanners will provide enhanced resolution and sensitivity in a broad range of imaging and sensing applications, including in airport scanners, medical imaging devices, and quality control scanners in manufacturing. These results will expand the impact of THz-frequency scanners, which are safe (non-ionizing radiation) and can provide unique information in many scanning, medical imaging, and sensing applications. The project will also train a diverse group of undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral researchers in the field of materials development and entrepreneurship.\r\n\r\nThe proposed project involves the scale up of newly discovered organic materials capable of generating high intensity terahertz-frequency light. Scanning and imaging instruments that employ terahertz-frequency light are safer than many common X-ray based scanners yet are often limited by the lack of bright terahertz-light sources. The organic new materials being produced for commercialization in this proposal provide nearly double the THz light output from current commercial sources. The scale up and growth of larger terahertz-generating crystals will meet the growing demands of companies and researchers who are developing new terahertz-based technologies and who require brighter terahertz sources. Organic materials generally have limited lifetimes due to decomposition under ambient conditions. On this project, commercialization of our prototype layered crystal structures will both enhance THz output and minimize crystal damage during terahertz light generation. These more robust sources of terahertz light will enable the use of organic terahertz light sources in scanners and imagers that previously could not employ this technology due to the short lifetime of organic crystals. In combination, the commercialization of these technologies will facilitate rapid growth in the terahertz scanner sector, enabling safer and more sensitive scanning and imaging technologies.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
