 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project utilizes DNA, the fundamental genetic material of all living organisms, as a construction material for nano-scale structures. The potential impact of this research spans multiple fields, including healthcare, where it could lead to breakthroughs in disease detection and treatment, and nano-engineering, offering new methods for manufacturing at the nanoscale. Leveraging the inherent base-pairing properties of DNA, the project employs a novel strategy known as slat assembly, where DNA sequences are designed to fold into elongated slats that then piece together to form complex geometries. This approach aims to circumvent the limitations of previous DNA assembly methods\u2014specifically, the high costs and error rates associated with constructing larger structures. Slat assembly stands to substantially lower these barriers, enabling the creation of more intricate and vast nanostructures.  Furthermore, by integrating these advancements into academic curricula, the project also seeks to equip a new generation of scientists with the interdisciplinary skills necessary to push the boundaries of what is scientifically possible.\r\n\r\nThe focus of this project is to refine and advance slat-based DNA assembly as a solution to the challenges currently faced in DNA nanotechnology, specifically the errors associated with algorithmic self-assembly and the scalability issues of hard-coded approaches. The research team will engage in a systematic exploration of slat assembly, starting with computer simulations to design DNA-based slat systems that promise to mitigate growth errors. These theoretical designs will be brought to empirical testing through a series of incremental experiments. Initial phases will replicate and then simplify existing slat-based motifs, progressing to the development of motifs capable of arbitrary size expansion. This sets the groundwork for implementing algorithmic growth patterns within these scalable platforms, a novel endeavor within the field. The project includes designing slats of variable lengths and shapes, a technique that requires precise control and innovation beyond current methodologies. Successful implementation of these strategies will demonstrate the feasibility of algorithmic growth using slats, exemplified by constructing a discrete version of the Sierpinski triangle. This project represents a pivotal step towards achieving scalable, error-minimized assembly of DNA nanostructures, with significant implications for the future of nanotechnology and its applications across various disciplines.\r\n\r\nThis project is jointly funded by the Foundations of Emerging Technologies program in the Division of Computing and Communication Foundations and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
