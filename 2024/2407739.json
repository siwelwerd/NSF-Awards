 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research conducted under extreme pressure conditions (up to millions of times atmospheric pressure) provides important information regarding the structures and processes occurring within the inner Earth, and results in the discovery of novel, technologically relevant materials such as diamond. The crystal structures of materials found under extreme pressures are of fundamental importance across a wide range of scientific disciplines, however, they can only typically be examined using extraordinarily small and powerful X-ray beams found at large user facilities with limited access. This MRI proposal will enable the acquisition of an instrument utilizing a liquid-metal anode X-ray source, which is a novel technology that enables high-brilliance, tightly focused X-ray beams at the home laboratory scale. The instrument will enable accelerated research progress across a range of geo-, chemical and physical sciences, providing enhanced access to a diverse user base of researchers.\r\n\r\nRecent breakthroughs in the development of liquid-metal anodes allow for synchrotron-type X-ray measurements to be carried out in a standard laboratory setting. The state-of-the-art microdiffractometer equipped with a liquid-metal anode (MetalJet) will allow for the local collection of synchrotron-quality data >300 days a year. The proposed microdiffraction system incorporates a 160 kV liquid-metal anode, modified with custom adaptations for high-pressure, single-crystal, and micro-inclusion crystallography to meet the diverse research needs of local scientists and external collaborators. The instrument will have a transformative impact on high-pressure research, enabling in-house studies of equations of state, melting, chemical reactions, and thermal conductivity of deep planetary minerals, as well as the detailed study of diamond inclusions in natural and synthetic samples. These results will deepen understanding of a range of Earth and planetary materials and mineral phase assemblages and accelerate progress in the discovery of new technologically relevant materials.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
