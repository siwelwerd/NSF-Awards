 "awd_abstract_narration": "Gender stereotypes\u2014including related to science, math, and intellectual potential more generally\u2014take root in early childhood and contribute to immediate and long-term gender disparities in science engagement and achievement. The goal of this project is to reveal the processes underlying the development of such stereotypes in early childhood, while at the same time developing new approaches to reduce stereotype acquisition. The project tests the hypothesis that subtle but powerful features of how parents talk about gender with young children contribute to the development of a general, abstract belief that gender leads to fundamentally different kinds of people.  In this way, language that contributes to the abstract expectation that boys and girls are fundamentally different from one another facilitates stereotype acquisition, even if the language itself does not include any stereotypic content. The present project tests this conceptual model and compares it to theoretical alternatives via an intervention design that targets different aspects of parent language and knowledge. This project will test whether targeting the language that young children hear about gender can reduce the development of gender stereotypes over time, while also addressing fundamental questions about how beliefs are spread across communities through subtle features of language. \r\n\r\nThis project will conduct an experimental intervention study with longitudinal follow-up involving young children (ages 3-4) and their parents. The experiment involves unmoderated remote, intervention research that facilitates participation across broad and diverse populations of families. The intervention targets mechanisms in parent-child conversation that facilitates the acquisition of social stereotypes in early childhood. Families of approximately 450 children will be randomly assigned to one of three experimental conditions, targeting either the (a) linguistic structure of parents\u2019 references to gender, (b) parents\u2019 knowledge about stereotype development, or (c) a control condition.  Then, the project will remotely document parent-child conversations referring to gender and code the conversations for features of content and linguistic structure using cutting-edge artificial intelligence methods. They will then chart the trajectory of children\u2019s language related to gender stereotypes about science, math, and intellectual ability over eighteen months. This research will reveal how language contributes to the development of gender stereotypes over time, while at the same time identifying new intervention approaches for disrupting their acquisition.\r\n\r\nThis project is supported by NSF's EDU Core Research (ECR) program. The ECR program emphasizes fundamental STEM education research that generates foundational knowledge in the field. Investments are made in critical areas that are essential, broad and enduring: STEM learning and STEM learning environments, broadening participation in STEM, and STEM workforce development.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
