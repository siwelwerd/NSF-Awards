 "awd_abstract_narration": "The acquisition of an ultra-high accuracy digital microscope at Mercer University will significantly advance multidisciplinary research in developing coated materials with antibacterial and antifungal properties. This tool will enable researchers to evaluate coatings on various substrates, potentially leading to alternatives to traditional antibiotics. The microscope's applications extend to investigating surfaces of polymers and composites used in multiple industries, aiding in the development of protective coatings to enhance material performance and longevity. It will also facilitate studies of wear and erosion, addressing critical concerns in aerospace and oil and gas industries. The grant will enhance experimental participation for faculty and students across various engineering and science disciplines, providing valuable training opportunities and broadening the participation of underrepresented groups. Additionally, the microscope will serve educational purposes, enriching the curriculum and integrating research with education. This dual-use approach will provide students with hands-on experience using cutting-edge technology in real-world scientific investigations, ultimately contributing to advancements in national health, economic growth, and societal welfare.\r\n\r\nThe research enabled by this instrument includes exploring the benefits of using thin films for antibacterial water treatment and antifungal attachment to polymeric surfaces and subsequent biofilm formation. The ultra-high accuracy digital microscope enables structures\u2019 analysis before and after thin films deposition and after exposure to microbes, examining coatings\u2019 morphology and performances. Thin films are deposited onto substrates using the DC high vacuum magnetron sputtering system. The digital microscope is also facilitating study of surface degradation for materials exposed to accelerated weathering conditions. It is supporting the development and optimization of thin films capable of protecting polymers, 3D printed polymers and composites against the synergistic effects of ultraviolet radiation, moisture and temperatures. It is enhancing the experimental study of erosion and further development of models for protection against erosion and abrasion. The digital optical microscopy is supporting the fundamental research by ensuring fast 3D evaluation of the volume loss and surface roughness permitting extended optimization studies of materials in contact.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
