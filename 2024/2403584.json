 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is concerned with a broad range of research in gravitational physics, including research projects in classical general relativity and quantum field theory in curved spacetime. The main aim of this research is to obtain a deeper understanding of the implications of Einstein's theory of general relativity for phenomena involving black holes, as well as the nature of quantum phenomena in strong gravitational fields. The research will involve the direct participation of graduate students in all aspects of the research, and it will thereby contribute to their training. The areas of research associated with this award are of considerable interest to the public, and activities will be undertaken, such as giving public lectures, that aid in the dissemination of scientific knowledge to the public.\r\n\r\nThe specific research topics include (i) An analysis of decoherence effects in scattering theory, including the unphysical properties of \"bare electron'' incoming states from infinity; (ii) an analysis of whether the quantum stress-energy tensor must always be singular on a Cauchy horizon, thereby enforcing strong cosmic censorship; (iii) an analysis of properties of a new definition of the entropy of a non-stationary black hole; (iv) an analysis of whether traversable wormhole solutions can exist in classical Einstein-Dirac or Einstein-Dirac-Maxwell theory; (v) an analysis of the gravitational spin Hall effect and the determination as to whether this is a Gaussian beam effect rather than a WKB effect; and (vi) an investigation of whether and how one can make sense of mathematically ill-posed equations that are intended to represent effective field theories for alternatives to general relativity.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
