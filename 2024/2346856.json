 "awd_abstract_narration": "Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are essential to our daily lives, powering a wide range of devices from smartphones and laptops to electric vehicles, providing portable energy storage that enables modern convenience and mobility. The manufacturing process of LIBs involves assembling key components such as the positive, negative electrode, separator, and electrolyte, followed by a critical formation process. During formation, the battery undergoes charge and discharge cycles to develop the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer on the negative electrode, crucial for battery performance. However, this formation process is time-consuming, particularly in large-scale production lines where it adds significantly to overall manufacturing costs. Understanding and optimizing the formation process to reduce time while ensuring quality and performance is essential for making LIBs more economically viable. This project aims to revolutionize the way LIBs are formed and manufactured by embedding advanced optical sensors directly into the batteries. The PI and collaborators hope to gain real-time insights into the formation process focusing on SEI formation. Understanding SEI formation better could lead to more efficient battery production, improved performance, and increased safety. Additionally, this research could pave the way for smarter battery management systems, optimizing energy usage and enabling seamless integration with renewable energy sources and smart grids. Ultimately, the project aims to create more sustainable and resilient energy solutions for the future, benefiting both industry and society as a whole. Funding from the NSF would support this innovative research endeavor, driving advancements in battery technology and fostering a skilled workforce for tomorrow's challenges. It not only offers opportunities for educational enrichment and diversity through hands-on learning experiences in STEM fields but also promise societal benefits such as enabling sustainable energy solutions and reducing reliance on fossil.\r\n\r\nThe primary goal of this project is to enhance our understanding of LIB formation processes through the integration of advanced optical sensing technologies, particularly focusing on the dynamic evolution of the SEI layer during battery formation. Specifically, the research will utilize silicon Fabry-Perot Interferometer (FPI) and fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors to differentiate between temperature fluctuations and electrochemo-mechanical stresses during battery formation. These sensors will be embedded directly within the battery structure, allowing for in-situ monitoring of temperature and strain variations. By correlating sensor outputs with battery behavior metrics and developing optimization strategies for formation processes, the project aims to streamline LIB manufacturing and improve battery performance and efficiency. The project's technical approach involves the fabrication and integration of the optical sensors into LIBs, followed by comprehensive testing and analysis to monitor SEI formation in real-time. The silicon FPI will excel in high-resolution temperature measurement, while the FBG will provide accurate insight into electrochemo-mechanical stresses. By subtracting temperature signals obtained from the FPI, the research will effectively disentangle temperature fluctuations from stress/strain variations encountered during battery formation and cycling. This innovative approach not only offers a non-invasive solution for internal, real-time monitoring of LIBs but also holds the potential to advance the field of battery science and engineering. The project's intellectual significance lies in its potential to deepen our understanding of LIB formation processes, foster collaboration across disciplines, and pave the way for more efficient and sustainable energy storage solutions, benefiting both industry and society at large.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
