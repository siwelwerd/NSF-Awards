 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-technical description:\r\nAs labor demands rise, new work-force training and educational programs are needed to raise the number of students with quantum information science and engineering (QISE) skills early on. Scaled quantum education is needed to reach different learners who were left out of technology revolutions in the last century. Center-scale approach is advantageous when (1) a discipline is new and experts have limited capacity, (2) long-term solutions are needed, and (3) a challenge spans multiple sectors. Pre-PhD quantum education and workforce development meet all these criteria. Overall, center-scale investments will increase capacity and equip U.S. students for opportunities in this promising industry. To meet these demands, the workshop will brainstorm center-scale programs, in response to planned requirements of the upcoming reauthorization of the NQI Act. \r\n\r\nTechnical description:\r\nThis meeting will bring together specialists from higher education, K-12 education, industry, and government to address quantum education and a national resource. Participants will address center-scale quantum education investment opportunities, benefits, and constraints. The workshop paper will frame current and future quantum education programs and investments to create a diverse, quantum-ready workforce.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
