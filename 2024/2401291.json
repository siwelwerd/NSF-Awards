 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-Technical Summary\r\n\r\nThe 2024 Solid State Chemistry Gordon Research Conference (GRC) and Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) are supported in part by the NSF Division of Materials Research (Solid State and Materials Chemistry Program).  They take place at Colby-Sawyer College in New London, NH, with the GRC (July 21-26, 2024) featuring discussion of cutting-edge research from the best scientists worldwide at all stages of career, and the associated GRS (July 20-21, 2024) directed to training younger scientists to present their research.  The topics discussed under the scientific theme of \"Diverse Approaches to Functional Materials: Synthesis, Characterization, and Data-Driven Discoveries\" are important for fulfilling NSF's missions to promote the progress of science (e.g., to discover better materials by gaining a deeper understanding of how their properties are controlled by their structure); to advance national health, prosperity, and welfare (e.g., to solve critical problems in energy and sustainability); and to secure the national defense (e.g., to develop robust systems for energy self-sufficiency).  To address these challenges, the unique format of these meetings promotes unencumbered exchange of unpublished research results and exploration of new ideas through diverse viewpoints from scientists in academia, industry, and government laboratories.  The relatively remote location of these meetings ensures that participants are free from distractions and promotes informal interactions between early career and more experienced researchers to help grow the scientific community.  In the GRS, graduate students and postdocs learn from peer mentors to present research ideas in a professional setting, acquire confidence, develop leadership skills, and consider potential career paths.  The programs for these meetings reflect a strong commitment to diversity initiatives, ensuring that participants from traditionally underrepresented groups are given opportunities to present their research, that they receive registration and travel support, and that those with special needs are appropriately accommodated.  An open forum called the \"Power Hour\" is scheduled within the GRC to promote discussion about challenges in diversity and inclusion in the scientific community.\r\n\r\nTechnical Summary\r\n\r\nSolid state chemistry focuses on the synthesis, structure, properties, and applications of materials with extended structures.  It contributes to significant advances in fundamental scientific knowledge, through initiatives connected with NSF's \"Big Ideas,\" including Quantum Leap (e.g., quantum and magnetic materials, superconductors), Harnessing the Data Revolution (e.g., high-throughput materials discovery through machine learning), and Mid-scale Research Infrastructure (e.g., in situ and in operando characterization).  It makes broad impacts to confront critical problems in energy, sustainability, and societal needs, including batteries, solar cells, lasers, magnets, light-emitting diodes, hard materials, superconductors, and catalysts.  The fundamental goal of solid state chemistry is to design better materials with greater control and predictability, by developing relationships connecting composition and structure to the properties and function of materials.  At the Solid State Chemistry GRC and GRS, researchers are invited to share their diverse approaches to solve this problem, by proposing new creative synthetic routes, applying more powerful characterization tools, and developing data-driven methods to discover new materials. Different perspectives are offered from scientists at all stages of career in academic, industrial, and national laboratories.  The scope is expanded to new classes of materials, such as topological solids, high-entropy alloys, hybrid materials, and mixed-anion compounds.  To encourage deeper scientific inquiry, the format of both meetings includes ample opportunities for discussion during the oral and poster presentations.  The \u201cno publication\u201d policy fosters open communication and many networking activities provide opportunities to initiate collaborations, promote learning, and maximize use of shared infrastructure.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Solid state chemistry has been responsible for developing many new materials leading to technological advances which help to solve critical problems related to energy (e.g., batteries), sustainability (e.g., water splitting), and societal needs (e.g., energy transition). To address these challenges, scientists in this community aim to synthesize new materials, characterize their structures and properties, and apply data-driven approaches to discover them more quickly. The themes explored in the conference program encompassed mixed-anion compounds, metastability, functional electrochemical materials, magnetic and quantum materials, thermoelectric and optical materials, advanced characterization techniques, computational approaches to accelerating materials discovery, industrial applications, materials for energy and sustainability, and societal implications.\n\n\nThe GRC featured exciting presentations from a diverse group of 28 speakers, of which 13 were women. Ample time was provided for thoughtful discussion among speakers and participants, moderated deftly by discussion leaders. A special session was held to commemorate Frank DiSalvo, a longtime stalwart of the solid state chemistry community who made significant scientific impacts especially in the topics of energy and sustainability. In the spirit of the GRC, which encourages new ideas to be explored, a late-breaking topic session was held to discuss the implications of \"altermagnetism,\" which may be a fundamentally new form of magnetism with properties that may be useful for magnetic materials. The GRC was extremely well attended by 175 registered participants, with a broad range of representation. In the course of the week, over two sessions each held over two days, 136 participants presented posters showcasing their latest research results, leading to ample opportunites for interaction and collaboration. Selected participants were invited to give previews of their posters in short 1-minute, 1-slide talks. A key component of the conference is the Power Hour, which addressed barriers to inclusion and equity faced by scientists in different kinds of groups, and offered meaningful actions that can be taken. Several well attended informal panels were held in the evenings to connect younger and more senior scientists to discuss careers in academic, industry, and government laboratories. Many networking and social activities took place throughout the week to foster collaborations, promote learning, and grow the scientific community by getting to know each other better.\n\n\nThe associated GRS focused on providing opportunities for graduate students and postdocs to discuss their research, while promoting training and learning, as well as building collaborative relationships. The GRS was also well attended by 65 registered participants. It featured 10 talks, moderated by peer discussion leaders, in topics such as synthesis, structural investigation, advanced chacterization, and computational methods. To guide young scientists, a panel discussion was held to offer advice about navigating careers in academic, industrial, and government laboratories.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/12/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: ArthurMar\n"
