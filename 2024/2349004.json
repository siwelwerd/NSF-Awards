 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 9th Lake Michigan Workshop on Combinatorics and Graph Theory will be held at Western Michigan University on April 13-14, 2024. The workshop will benefit graduate students and junior researchers in the field of discrete mathematics working at institutions in the Great Lakes area. It will be built around three sets of two tutorial lectures, focusing on state-of-the-art techniques and results that the speakers feel are underrepresented in typical graduate sequences and on emerging techniques on which the speakers are particularly qualified to expound. There will also be short talks by students and younger faculty members. There will be ample unscheduled time during the weekend, allowing new research collaborations to commence and active collaborations to be continued. Junior participants will establish valuable connections with more senior colleagues and receive guidance from them in a relaxed and informal environment. The tutorial speakers for the 2024 workshop are confirmed to be David Conlon (California Institute of Technology), Wes Pegden (Carnegie Mellon University), and Liana Yepremyan (Emory University).\r\n\r\nThe topics that will be addressed include homomorphism inequalities between graph densities, probability spaces driven by geometric constraints, and graph colorings, among others. The conference website is https://sites.google.com/wmich.edu/dudek/9th-lake-michigan-workshop\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
