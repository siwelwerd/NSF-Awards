 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will contribute to the national need for well-educated scientists, mathematicians, engineers, and technicians by supporting the retention and graduation of high-achieving, low-income students with demonstrated financial need at Connecticut State Community College Naugatuck Valley (CSCCNV), an associate\u2019s degree-granting Hispanic Serving Institute (HSI). Over its 6-year duration, this project will fund scholarships to 60 unique full-time students who are pursuing Associate degrees in Biology Studies, Biochemistry Studies, Chemistry Studies, Computer Information System, Computer Science Studies, Electronic Engineering Technology, Engineering Science, Mathematics Studies, Mechanical Engineering Technology, Physics Studies, and Technology Studies. Most scholars will be first-year college students and will receive at least 2 years of scholarship and be funded through graduation. Additional high-achieving students will be supported for at least 1 semester, through graduation. The project aims to increase student connectedness and STEM identity through programming designed to overcome cultural and institutional barriers to student success in STEM, building strong social, academic and professional support networks. Scholars will have access to mentoring from diverse role models, professional development, and a breadth of academic supports. The project will support students through common barriers to degree completion by employing active advising with STEM faculty, participation in STEM internships, research opportunities, and professional conferences. Since CSCCCNV enrolls a high population of underrepresented students, this project has the potential to broaden participation in STEM fields and generate knowledge on effective practices to support talented low-income students. \r\n\r\nThe overall goal of this project is to increase STEM degree completion of low-income, high-achieving undergraduates with demonstrated financial need. The goals of the project are to: 1) increase the academic performance of STEM scholars in the first and second year of college; 2) ensure STEM scholars\u2019 sense of connectedness by fostering motivation towards a STEM career and growing career-relevant skills; and 3) reduce the financial burden of obtaining a STEM degree. The relationship between connectedness, STEM identity, and student outcomes will be assessed via surveys, student case studies, and institutional data at the beginning and end of each academic year. Outcomes from this project are designed to identify the most effective program components, which will be reported to serve as a model for other institutions. Project results will be disseminated internally at Connecticut State Community College, at regional and national conferences and through peer-reviewed publications. This project is funded by NSF\u2019s Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics program, which seeks to increase the number of low-income academically talented students with demonstrated financial need who earn degrees in STEM fields. It also aims to improve the education of future STEM workers, and to generate knowledge about academic success, retention, transfer, graduation, and academic/career pathways of low-income students.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
