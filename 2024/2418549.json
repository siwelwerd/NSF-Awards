 "awd_abstract_narration": "Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) and its applications are of paramount importance in the ongoing fourth industrial revolution, which is marked by the seamless fusion of physical and digital systems. This project aims to revolutionize Artificial Intelligence (AI) education by establishing a remotely accessible AIoT infrastructure, making state-of-the-art labs available to a broader student audience for immersive learning of AI with hands-on experiences. This project seeks to address several fundamental issues in AI education and workforce development. First, it will address the imbalance in AI education, which focuses on primarily building software skills, by integrating exposure to essential hardware components for a comprehensive understanding of the field. Second, it will address the resource constraints faced by many educational institutions, which limit their ability to offer state-of-the-art, hands-on AI learning experiences. Third, it will promote access for underserved minority groups, fostering diversity and innovation in the field. Through collaboration and resource sharing among participating universities, University of Florida, North Carolina A&T, and Prairie View A&M University, this project will directly impact over 30 instructors and 1,500 undergraduate students across institutions. Additionally, the project will leverage partnerships with industry leaders to align educational content with industry needs and standards, enhancing the relevance and applicability of AIoT education. From a broader perspective, the project will advance the AI field by developing foundational content through an integrated approach that highlights the interplay among AIoT components. It will also introduce immersive learning strategies to enhance student engagement and understanding, making AI education more inclusive and accessible. This inclusivity fosters diversity, creating a talent pool with varied perspectives that can drive innovation in the industry. \r\n\r\nThrough the deployment of an innovative hardware-in-the-loop system, the project focuses on developing an immersive AIoT learning platform, which will be remotely accessible for students across institutes. This platform will include well-integrated modules on AIoT fundamentals, including security, connectivity, sensor design, and machine learning. The research will be guided by key questions aimed at enhancing AIoT technology, expanding its accessibility to a diverse student population, and investigating the educational impact of immersive technology in AIoT learning. To evaluate the impact of the immersive learning environment on student outcomes, relevant data will be collected and analyzed. Usability and feasibility studies will initially test the modules with qualitative analysis assessing their impact on learning and engagement. During classroom integration, student activity data will be analyzed using learning analytics and deep learning techniques to identify common challenges. Finally, the impact of the modules will be evaluated by comparing baseline data from unmodified courses with data from those incorporating AIoT modules. Paired t-tests will examine pre- and post-learning differences, while qualitative analysis of interview transcripts will offer supplementary insights. The project will help address workforce shortages, promote technological advancements, and help maintain global competitiveness in the evolving AI landscape by preparing a new generation of AI professionals.\r\n\r\nThis project is funded by the Research on Innovative Technologies for Enhanced Learning (RITEL) program that supports early-stage exploratory research in emerging technologies for teaching and learning.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
