 "awd_abstract_narration": "To support Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs) in increasing their research enterprise (RE) capacity, the Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities (HACU) will organize a series of VOLAR\u00c9 Institutes; a series of research capacity building institutes for HSIs, encompassing three cohorts of institutions over three years. Each Institute will span a yearlong program of activities.  The VOLAR\u00c9 Institutes will train a new research workforce at HSIs in a deliberate and systematic way by offering accessible and actionable information and tools to build a strong and inclusive national research system. \r\n\r\nThe VOLAR\u00c9 Institute will build upon HACU\u2019s strong network of HSIs to broaden participation in STEM. VOLAR\u00c9 consists of research capacity building institutes spanning three years involving cohorts of institutions. Its primary goals are to launch research initiatives by providing administrative leaders, staff, and faculty with a framework for conducting needs assessments and collaborative action plans. VOLAR\u00c9 also aims to create cooperative consortia among regional HSIs to share research resources and expertise. Additionally, it offers professional development, mentoring, and coaching to help VOLAR\u00c9 institutions pilot new research strategies and build the capacity to sustain and expand expertise and infrastructure.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
