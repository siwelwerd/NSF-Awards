 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the support of the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program in the Division of Chemistry, Prof. Heather Maynard of the University of California, Los Angeles will use gold to make materials found in nature better.  Prof. Maynard proposes that chemicals containing gold can be used to modify proteins with plastics. Proteins are not only found in food, but are also interesting materials, and some can even be used as medicines or to produce chemicals that are useful for society.  By modifying proteins with plastics, they will last longer and may be able to function better.  Prof. Maynard\u2019s research group will study the gold compounds to make ones that will modify proteins in a specific way with a range of different plastics, in order to make the proteins better.  This project will help students at UCLA learn the techniques necessary to later obtain jobs that benefit the United States.  In addition, Prof. Maynard will teach the importance of proteins and plastics to Brownie and Girl Scouts in Los Angeles area.  Furthermore, K-12 teachers in Los Angeles will be given tools to be able to teach gold chemistry to their students.  \r\n\r\nGold(III) complexes will be employed for the cysteine arylation of proteins with polymers. By utilizing a combination of theory and experiment, protein conjugates with complex polymer architectures will be achieved, the kinetics of the reaction will be understood, and that expansion of the synthesis from carbon-sulfur to other bond formations will be possible.  This research will develop new, highly efficient syntheses to prepare advanced protein-polymer conjugates and polymeric materials.  Other efforts will include outreach to girls in Los Angeles Brownie and Girl Scout Troops. This will reach a diverse population of girls at the critical age where role models in science are needed. Furthermore, the impact of the research project will be augmented by introducing a new module on bioconjugation in UCLA\u2019s Nanoscience Teacher Workshops.  This will allow teachers to disseminate bioconjugation knowledge to K-12 students in the greater Los Angeles Area.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
