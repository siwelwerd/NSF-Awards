 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award from the National Science Foundation will be used to enable early career scientists to attend the 27th International Congress on Plant Reproduction. This is an important professional development opportunity that will help to build research capacity and expertise in an area that is critical for crop productivity. The 27th International Congress on Plant Reproduction will be held in Providence, RI from July 7-10, 2024. This is the premier international conference dedicated to reporting advances in our understanding of how plant reproduction works at the cellular and molecular level. This field is particularly important for advancing crop productivity because reproduction is central to production of crops like corn, wheat, and rice. In addition, research in this field has led to advances in breeding technology, which benefit all crops. The conference will be highly interactive and will facilitate formal scientific discussion via oral presentations to the entire group and poster presentations to smaller groups. \r\n\r\nThe conference will attract ~200 scientists from around the world, with most participants coming from North America, Europe, and Asia. The conference will feature an eminent group of speakers representing multiple nations and multiple career stages and expertise. They will present their findings in major areas of research in molecular plant reproduction, ensuring a comprehensive and insightful program. Plant reproduction is sensitive to temperature and other stresses and is directly required for production of key agricultural products like maize kernels, rice and wheat grains, and tomato fruits. As we face the challenge of feeding a growing population in a changing climate, we must build a diverse and inclusive research community that is dedicated to working in this critical field. Travel awards will be granted to researchers at United States institutions who would otherwise be less likely to attend, including participants from predominantly undergraduate and minority-serving institutions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
