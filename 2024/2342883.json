 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is for support of student travel to the 29th ACM Symposium on Operating Systems Principles (SOSP 2023), Oct. 23-26, 2023. For over 50 years, SOSP has been a leading forum for innovative research in operating systems. Continuing in the SOSP tradition, SOSP 2019 will bring together leading researchers and luminaries in the field and will feature the best and brightest of the PhD candidates in computer systems. Participants present and discuss their research and experience and cover the full range of theory and practice. The goal of SOSP and this travel grant is to advance science by bringing together researchers from across the computer systems community - including distributed systems, operating systems, and broad computer systems - to foster cross disciplinary approaches and to address shared research challenges. This cross-disciplinary emphasis makes it well suited as a target for student participation.\r\n\r\nThis travel grant support the attendance of at least 12 US-based graduate and undergraduate students. Participation in leading conferences is an extremely important part of graduate students and advanced undergraduate students - school experience, providing the opportunity to interact with more senior researchers and to be exposed to leading edge work. This award provides a concrete opportunity to broaden participation. Funds will be dispersed with preference given to students who would not otherwise be able to attend the conference, paying particular attention to diversity.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
