 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Improving Undergraduate STEM Education: Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSI Program), the IUSE-HSI Track 1 Pilot Project: Recruitment, Bridge Course and Undergraduate Research Experience (RBCURE) project is an interdisciplinary project that will enhance the quality of undergraduate education and research in the natural sciences at West Texas A&M University (WTAMU).  Specifically, the project will enhance academic experiences in non-major STEM courses with a goal to attract more underrepresented minority students from non-major science courses into Geology and Chemistry; two disciplines at WTAMU that have low representation of diverse student populations. The project is also committed to retaining students through meaningful and practical research experiences that can position students for success as undergraduate researchers and in prospective STEM careers and advanced degrees. By tailoring learning modules (through online bridge courses) and properly training STEM research faculty with effective teaching practices (through thoughtfully designed workshops), the project will be proactively (rather than reactively) preparing students for future job opportunities and participation in the U.S. STEM workforce.\r\n\r\nRBCURE will be guided by two project goals: to enhance undergraduate STEM education in non-major STEM courses and to improve student experiences in both the classroom and the research laboratory. Fulfilling the goals of RBCURE will be accomplished through four project activities: 1) curriculum design in two non-major science courses (Geology and Chemistry); 2) creation of two online bridge courses to facilitate transitioning from the course for non-majors to the subsequent course for students selecting a science major;3) development of a research faculty workshop on STEM mentoring; and 4) development of an online module system for new research students. The project objectives are: to have equitable representation of student success in redesigned Geology and Chemistry non-majors part one courses by increasing ABC/DFIX ratios; to evaluate the effectiveness of two online bridge courses for student success and recruitment into part two science major geology and chemistry courses; to assess the effectiveness of a research faculty development workshop designed to identify best practices for conducting undergraduate research; to improve research student experiences by providing online support modules intended to front-load research information that students would complete at the start of their research project; and to develop an IUSE-HSI Track 2 Implementation and Evaluation (IEP) proposal for submission that uses findings and lessons learned. The HSI Program aims to enhance undergraduate STEM education and build capacity at HSIs. Projects supported by the HSI Program will also generate new knowledge on how to achieve these aims.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
