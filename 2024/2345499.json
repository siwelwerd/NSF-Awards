 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of automated manufacturing of fiber-reinforced polymer composites (FRPCs). The proposed technology may be used to develop cost-effective and lightweight FRPC parts for use in a wide variety of applications and industries including aerospace, energy, automotive, and biomedical. Traditional manufacturing of FRPCs relies on expensive tooling and molds, long heating cycles in ovens and autoclaves, and labor-intensive processes, making the production of FRPCs slow and cost prohibitive. The proposed technology is an advanced manufacturing method based on the automated handling and placement of composite materials using robotic platforms and rapid rigidization of the material during the manufacturing process. The proposed manufacturing method allows for rapid, cost-effective, and energy-efficient production of customized composite parts. In addition, the proposed mold-free manufacturing method enables the design of complex composite structures that cannot be produced using traditional approaches. The new design capabilities may support the development of lighter ground and aerial vehicles as well as larger wind turbines for more efficient energy conversion.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on the development of an advanced manufacturing platform for the rapid and automated manufacture of high-performance fiber-reinforced polymer composites. The proposed technology relies on the placement of carbon fiber reinforcements impregnated with a thermoset resin along desired 3D paths using a robotic platform followed by in-situ, instantaneous curing and rigidization of the composite material. Controlled placement of the material to construct the desired structure eliminates the need for molds and tooling commonly used in the composite industry. Controlling the process parameters allows for manufacture of FRPC parts with a low void content and high concentrations of carbon fiber reinforcements. In addition, the ability to cure in-situ and rigidize composites enables freeform, support-free manufacturing in midair and achievement of three-dimensional reinforcements. The proposed technology may cut down the energy use compared to traditional approaches, leading to more sustainable practices.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
