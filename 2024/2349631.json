 "awd_abstract_narration": "The renewal three-year REU Site: Collaborative Research: REU Site, NanoNYC is hosted by Columbia University (Columbia Nano Initiative-CNI) and the City University of New York- Advanced Science Research Center (ASRC). Each year ten students will participate in a joint program between the institutions focusing on nanoscience and engineering. Participants will engage in advanced work in a range of areas including optics, chemistry, and electronics, and develop their network as well as technical skills in the area.  In addition to conducting lab research, students will have access to advanced instruments and facilities. A structured training series, weekly seminars and a tiered mentoring approach will promote collegial and mentoring relationships among students, mentors (graduate students and post-docs, and faculty).  Over the course of the REU, students will learn new methods and tools, and have opportunities to present their research. Underserved undergraduates will be targeted in recruitment efforts.  By actively participating in the REU research community, students will learn new skills, build their research resumes, and acquire the confidence that will enable them to pursue STEM opportunities in graduate school or along other career paths.\r\n\r\nThe renewal three-year REU Site: Collaborative Research: REU Site, NanoNYC is hosted by Columbia University (Columbia Nano Initiative-CNI) and the City University of New York- Advanced Science Research Center (ASRC). Each year ten students will participate in a joint program between the institutions focusing on nanoscience and engineering.  In addition to conducting lab research, students will have access to advanced instruments and facilities. Students in the program will participate in and contribute to cutting-edge nanoscience and engineering research activities and will have the opportunity to delve into a specific aspect of nanoscience; develop skills in identifying a research question / hypothesis and devising a research proposal; and conduct experiments using advanced instruments. Over the course of the REU, students will learn new methods and tools, and have opportunities to present their research. This research encompasses three thrusts \u2013 synthetic nanoassembly, interfaces and heterostructures, and nanophotonics, each an exciting frontier of science. The REU will introduce underserved undergraduates to the array of opportunities that are open to nanoscience graduates. By actively participating in the REU research community, students will learn new skills, build their research resumes, and acquire the confidence that will enable them to pursue STEM opportunities in graduate school or along other career paths.\r\n\r\nThis Site is supported in part by funds provided to the National Science Foundation by the Semiconductor Research Corporation.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
