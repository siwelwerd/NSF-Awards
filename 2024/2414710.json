 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact of this I-Corps project is focused on the development of soft 3D printing materials that can be used in anatomical models, with the goal of reducing the training times and costs associated with medical and surgical education. The project aims to improve the efficiency of healthcare training methods by enabling high rates of hands-on practice across a broad range of medical training scenarios. Accessible training tools can help address the shortage of nurses and doctors, reduce healthcare costs, and save lives through the reduction of medical complications.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. This solution is based on a rubber resin that can be used in high-resolution, yet accessible and off-the-shelf 3D printers. While the majority of commercially available 3D printable resins demonstrate the mechanical properties of hard plastics, this proprietary technology allows the creation of parts that are softer than common materials on the market. The introduction of the new resin will enable the rapid prototyping of high-resolution rubber components with complex geometries that would be prohibitive to produce using conventional manufacturing methods.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
