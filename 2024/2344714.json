 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of the proposal is to investigate a new paradigm for integrating multiple chemical functionalities into a bio-inspired system similar to vascular and nervous systems. The specific functionalities to be investigated are power distribution and information transfer through the electrolyte and information transfer through soft, ionic connections between electrochemical transistors. Results from this research will enable multifunctional synthetic vascular systems that store energy, provide mechanical transmission for actuation, allow communication, and improve computation of nearby electronics. The experimental outcomes and theoretical tools developed during this work will contribute towards overcoming fundamental challenges of autonomy, control, and energy storage in soft robotics. Although these capabilities will be targeted towards soft robotics, they will be broadly useful across all robots and machines. To realize the project goals, the PI will combine fundamental research and educational activities into an integrated program that will train a new generation of scientists and engineers to work at the intersection of electrochemistry, electronics, and robotics through extracurriculars, interdisciplinary courses, undergraduate research, and community development. Students will gain knowledge and skills in areas desired by industry. New initiatives will also increase the involvement of women, underrepresented minority, and first-generation students in national Formula electric racing competitions. \r\n\r\nModern machines are engineered by integrating specialized components that excel at individual predetermined functions. In contrast, biological systems such as the circulatory, muscular, and nervous systems achieve impressive capabilities through the use of multifunctional chemical processes in an aqueous electrolyte. Despite this diverse functionality, aqueous systems are rarely found as active components in machines due to the difficulty of controlling all the chemical functionality and interfacing with the electrolyte. The intellectual significance of this work will be results from new experiments and theoretical models to understand power and information transmission in electrolyzed fluids. The knowledge gained from studies of ion and dissolved oxygen kinetics under transient conditions with multiple interacting electrodes will enable three new functionalities in the same electrolyte: wire-free distributed power delivery (mimics the animal circulatory system), direct current power and information transmission through the electrolyte (mimics a nervous system), and information transmission through soft, ionic connections between organic electrochemical transistors (for neuromorphic computing). Additionally, undergraduate students will build and measure the heat transfer coefficient of electrolytic fluids, and study their ability to store energy and transport heat.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
