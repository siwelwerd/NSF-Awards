 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact of this I-Corps project is the development of advanced technologies to enhance magnetic resonance imaging systems. This innovation aims to significantly improve the safety and quality of imaging, particularly benefiting patients with metal-based medical implants. By reducing the dependency on high refractive indices materials and simplifying the system architecture, the technology can lower operational costs, making high-quality diagnostic imaging more accessible and safer. This advance promises to address critical gaps in current medical diagnostic capabilities, opening high-quality imaging to a broader market, including resource-limited and rural areas. Preliminary market surveys indicate a strong demand for safer, more efficient imaging solutions, highlighting the technology's potential to transform healthcare diagnostics and improve patient outcomes.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. This solution is based on the development of a dual-layer design tailored for magnetic resonance imaging systems. The technology finely tunes and manipulates electromagnetic waves, enabling in situ adjustments to adapt to different imaging configurations seamlessly. Initial research has demonstrated that this design can enhance image quality and safety in high magnetic field systems, providing a significant improvement over current technologies. Experimental setups have validated the feasibility of the solution, indicating its potential to achieve high diagnostic accuracy while shortening scan times and ensuring patient safety.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
