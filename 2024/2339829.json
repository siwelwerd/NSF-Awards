 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many problems in human microbiology, astronomy, high-energy physics, fluid dynamics, and aeronautics involve large collections of moving \"particles\" with complicated dynamics. Learning how these systems work requires developing statistical procedures for estimating these dynamics on the basis of noisy observations. The goal of this research is to develop scalable, practical, and reliable methods for this task, with a particular focus on developing statistical theory for applications in cosmology, cellular biology, and machine learning. This research will also include a large outreach component based on broadening access to research opportunities for undergraduates and graduate students.\r\n\r\nThe technical goals of this proposal are to develop computationally efficient estimators for multiple particle tracking in d dimensions when the particles evolve based on a known or unknown stochastic process, to develop Bayesian methods for posterior sampling based on observed trajectories, and to extend these methods to obtain minimax estimation procedures for smooth paths in the Wasserstein space of probability measures. The research also aims to develop estimators for more challenging models with the growth and interaction of particles.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
