 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II\r\nproject concerns greater affordability, accessibility, and accuracy of physical therapy for patients and\r\ntherapists. The product to be commercialized will contribute to developing innovation around immersive\r\ntelehealth experiences, exploring the future of work for physical rehabilitation in the metaverse,\r\nestablishing standards in embodied telehealth, and grounding novel scientific research methods within VR\r\nfor healthcare from a California-based startup with the goal of increasing access to care. Establishing a\r\nremote immersive virtual platform will provide a means for in-patient success metrics and full-body virtual\r\nguidance. Patient throughput potentially could be doubled through remote visits in virtual environments\r\nand automated physical health documentation. The platform will be designed with accessibility in mind\r\nwith patients from \"medical deserts,\" where patient care is significantly limited by hospital capacity,\r\nphysical distance, doctors per population, and cost. Remote physical rehabilitation tools and predictive\r\nphysical therapy analytics will benefit patients without adequate insurance coverage. This technology\r\ncould lower hospital visits, enable clinics to remain open during future pandemic periods, decrease costs\r\nfor patients and clinics alike, and begin detecting physical health needs earlier to help manage the pace\r\nof recovery.\r\n\r\nThe proposed project aims to expand a novel physical rehabilitation telehealth solution through the\r\ncontinued research of an instrumented and gamified immersive virtual reality platform for physical therapy\r\nand healthcare monitoring. This technology addresses the shortcomings of widely used telehealth platforms (often videoconferencing) where therapists find it difficult to perform common evaluations\r\nsuch as movement abilities and balance coordination tests. The solution will expand upon an embodied\r\ntelehealth platform with 3D virtual avatars and predictive AI tools to assess user biomechanics in real-time\r\nextending to full-body assessment while providing normative assessment metrics, creating a goal\r\nstandard for remote physical therapy care. The development method will continue to utilize user-centered\r\ndesign with a panel of therapists to ensure accessibility and usability of the prototype systems by their\r\nrelevant stakeholders. Such research will incorporate predictive biomechanical analysis to increase the\r\nreliability and repeatability of physical therapy measures and exercise programs for remote monitoring\r\nat the clinic or the patient\u2019s home. Iterative prototyping with user experience will be conducted to\r\nestablish in-patient success metrics and full-body virtual assessment. This innovation will enable greater\r\naffordability, usability, and effectiveness of physical therapy for patients and therapists.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
