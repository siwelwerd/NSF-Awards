 "awd_abstract_narration": "The IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM) has established itself as the world\u2019s premier research conference in data mining. It provides an international forum for the presentation of original research results and the exchange and dissemination of innovative and practical development experiences. The conference covers all aspects of data mining, including algorithms, software, systems, and applications.  Student travel awards permit full participation by those who are primary authors on accepted papers.  A PhD forum and a Women in Science Research Forum are part of the agenda, and will help early career researchers to learn and exchange cutting-edge research ideas and help them communicate on different aspects of career development.\r\n\r\nData mining and machine learning are now being broadly applied to nearly all disciplines, transforming science, engineering, medicine, healthcare, finance, business, and ultimately society itself.  The award will be used to provide travel support for students and early career researchers, with a special focus on women and minorities, for the following activities: 1) To help fund the travel of Ph.D. students who are primary authors of full papers that have been accepted to the technical program; 2) To help fund the travel of Ph.D. students who are participating in the Ph.D. Student Forum; and 3) To help cover the travel expenses of women researchers to participate in the Women in Science Research Forum.  This proposal aims to provide the crucial funding needed to support the participation of graduate students and early career researchers who will become future leaders in the science and engineering field. As an effort to engage young researchers, the IEEE ICDM 2024 will involve them in the meeting organization and include mentoring activities in the conference program.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
