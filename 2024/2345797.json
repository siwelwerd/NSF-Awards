 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recognizing the virtuous cycle between culture and creativity and technological innovation, the goal of this project is to bring an important strategic asset of the United States, viz., the creativity and innovative abilities of individuals in all regions across the country, into stronger, more productive, and sustained relationships with STEM research, innovation, and workforce development.  \r\n\r\nHow the world communicates and creates is now increasingly intertwined with critical and emerging technologies explored and applied in NSF-supported research. Gathering experts and stakeholders from across the country, this project aims to develop actionable steps within a five- to ten-year roadmap that addresses three key aspects of this intersectional opportunity. First, it examines the role of regional culture and creativity in strengthening innovation ecosystems. Second, it builds on recommendations from the National Academies, successful initiatives in other countries, and hands-on experience in industry and higher education to develop programs and pursue stronger connectivity with the nation\u2019s STEM R&D programs in support of the continued competitiveness of U.S. industries involved in the creative sector. Finally, it develops novel strategies to expand and diversify the STEM workforce through support and engagement with fields at the intersection of technology, innovation, and creativity. This is consistent with the National Science Board\u2019s 2022 redefinition of the STEM workforce in Science and Engineering (S&E) Indicators to encompass all workers who use science and engineering skills in their jobs.\r\n\r\nThe potential for profound long-term impact ranges from improved integration of local innovation ecosystems into the fabric of regional life; to nationwide increases in diversity in STEM fields by successfully attracting and retaining students, workers, and researchers who are interested in creative and innovative work; to continued global competitiveness through better integration of the three most resilient aspects of U.S. soft power: educational institutions, cultural production, and technological innovation. A key objective is to engage a broader cross-section of the nation to participate in NSF\u2019s mission in user-inspired and translational research, as embodied by the activities of its Technology, Innovation, and Partnerships Directorate. This project will also develop strategies to enhance the connections between people with a range of traditional skills and crafts found across the states and territories with modern computational techniques. By emphasizing national priority technologies, such as AI, the project will maximize its impact and complement other TIP programs.\r\n\r\nTo achieve these objectives, a project office will be created at UCLA to conduct an approximately year-long series of activities including competitively awarded regional workshops across the country, an industry summit involving NSF, and a national conference. Deliverables include a roadmap that highlights collaboration opportunities with a wide range of partners including in academia, industry, community organizations, and local, state, and federal government. The project seeks to establish how existing and new programs could 1) enhance and sustain innovation ecosystems through thoughtful and deliberate connections to the creative and innovative activities in a given region; 2) support U.S. competitiveness at the intersection of technology and creativity in critical and emerging areas of innovation; and 3) strengthen the STEM workforce through deeper engagement with students, faculty, workers, and organizations who apply STEM skills and innovations in a broad range of creative activities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
