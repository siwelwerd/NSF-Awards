 "awd_abstract_narration": "Human health is strongly linked with the health of animals and our ecosystems. Uncontrolled infectious diseases can devastate animal populations and be transmitted to humans, causing significant socioeconomic disruptions. The COVID-19 pandemic is a recent example of how disease can alter life as we know it on every corner of the planet. It is widely recognized that enhanced surveillance for zoonotic pathogens is foundational to protection of human and animal health, and prevention of the next pandemic. The proposed work will accelerate the development of an affordable intelligent E-nose system capable of using volatile metabolites from animals and humans to identify diseases. We will leverage the use of rapid prototyping and collaboration networks to produce a portable, low-cost, high-performance E-nose device for deployment in various field environments. By doing so, professionals working with animals and humans will be able to identify viral infections in real time, allowing for expeditious interventions to minimize disease transmission. The outcomes of the project will reach beyond the societal impact of the E-nose technology by broadening participation of underrepresented groups in STEM. This project will provide research opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students, K-12 workforce development, public engagement with science, and training of industry professionals. It will be particularly impactful in communities where diseases are commonly underdiagnosed.\r\n\r\nThe proposed work will develop a portable and intelligent E-nose system to detect volatile metabolites (VM) associated with high consequence infectious diseases in animal and human samples (e.g., feces, urine, and saliva). The goal for this technology is to accelerate the ability to rapidly detect specific diseases in both individuals and populations, thereby minimizing the time required for responding to and controlling incipient outbreaks of infectious diseases. During Phase 1, the sensor system will be fabricated and trained to detect infection by avian influenza viruses, followed by the detection of other infections in domestic and wild animals and humans in Phase 2. Diverse sensing data with superior low detection limit will be achieved through defect- and nano-engineering sensing materials. High dimensional sensing data will be collected by individual modulated heating temperature and illumination wavelength and intensity. A machine-learning model will determine the sensitivity value and the profiles for optimum temperature and illumination. Physical and chemical sensor arrays will be integrated with embedded electronics to reduce the overall Size, Weight, Power and Cost profile. Open-source electronic prototyping platforms will be utilized to achieve rapid prototyping and manufacturing with minimum development cost. The advances proposed by this project will redefine technologies that support the data\u2013information\u2013knowledge pathway and accelerate the process of turning basic measurements into actionable intelligence. This device has practical, life-saving applications that complement conventional approaches to disease prevention and management by providing real-time monitoring.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
