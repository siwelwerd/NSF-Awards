 "awd_abstract_narration": "Even though all human activities require goods and services from nature for their sustenance, conventional engineering has kept ecosystems outside its decision boundary. Ignoring or undervaluing these critical ecosystem goods and services (ES) has resulted in their over use and degradation, and can also mean lost opportunities for innovation and environmental sustainability. Recent efforts are accounting for the role of ecosystems in supporting human activities and are demonstrating the many economic, environmental and societal benefits of including nature in human decisions. Such advances related to engineering design and life cycle assessment have been demonstrated through case studies, but rigorous methods are needed for systematic inclusion of ecosystems in engineering decisions. This work will advance the framework of Techno-Ecological Synergy (TES), with specific focus on developing methods for, 1) integrated design of chemical processes and ecosystems on and around manufacturing sites while accounting for their temporal and spatial variation, 2) including ecosystem services in life cycle assessment (LCA) by means of a rigorous mathematical framework, 3) education and outreach activities to improve knowledge about ecosystem services among students and practitioners.\r\n\r\nLocal TES design at a manufacturing site will be formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem that accounts for spatial and temporal variation of these systems such as the intermittent availability of many ecosystem services versus the continuous demand for these services from human activities. The mathematical framework for ES in LCA will explicitly include ecosystems in LCA along with their synergies and trade-offs in providing ES, and their interaction with technological systems. It will enable calculation of\r\nsustainability metrics by comparing the demand and supply of ES at multiple spatial scales. This work will be in collaboration with an expert in ecosystem services, and will be applied to problems of interest to industry sustainability.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

In this work, we developed a general framework for TES design and applied it to several manufacturing processes.&nbsp; Typical results are in Fig. 2 for a chlorine manufacturing process in Galveston, Texas. This figure shows the trade-off between the cost to company and cost to society from the manufacturing process while addressing air pollution using only conventional technologies (salmon curve) versus using technologies along with native forest vegetation (green curve). The TES approach can reach net-zero pollution (zero cost to company) with only a slightly larger cost to the company. This conveys the opportunities from TES design since it can benefit from nature's ability to support industrial activities while reducing environmental impact in a cost-effective manner.&nbsp; Such solutions can greatly outperform conventional techno-centric designs.&nbsp; Such insight is confirmed via other case studies including power plants and hybrid energy systems.&nbsp; Further work in this domain demonstrated the benefits of TES design to two power plants in Ohio and a hybrid energy system in Kentucky.&nbsp; All cases confirmed the benefits of seeking synergies between industrial and ecological systems, and the value of shifting the engineering paradigm to explicitly include the role of ecosystems and its carrying capacity in engineering decisions.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Techno-Ecological Synergy in Life Cycle Assessment.</strong>&nbsp; Life cycle assessment (LCA) is a popular approach for assessing the sustainability of products and processes.
