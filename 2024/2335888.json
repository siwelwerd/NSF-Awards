 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project focuses on understanding and harnessing a naturally occurring phenomenon where certain bacteria called Wolbachia sterilize insect sperm and thereby alter insect reproduction. Sterilization of harmful insects with safe bacteria is a revolutionary approach to pest control which can reduce and mitigate harmful effects of pesticide over usage. The bacteria and this sterilization mechanism are currently being used to sterilize and reduce mosquito populations which thereby reduces transmission of mosquito borne disease. This study delves into the underlying chemical mechanisms by which these bacteria sterilize insect sperm. By exploring this biological interaction, the project aims to enhance agricultural productivity and public health by controlling pests that damage crops and spread disease. It also provides an environmentally friendly and species specific alternative to traditional pest management methods. Additionally, this research incorporates and explores the usage of artificial intelligence (AI) in biotechnological applications. Researching and developing educational curriculum at the intersection of AI and biotech will facilitate the creation of new tools and contribute to a highly advanced biotechnological workforce. The developed curricula described by this proposal will be within the public domain, thereby democratizing access to the most cutting-edge scientific knowledge. The project directly contributes to societal well-being by improving food security and public health while reducing environmental impact.\r\n\r\nThis research project aims to dissect the mechanisms and evolutionary origins of Wolbachia-induced cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI) in insects. Specifically, the study seeks to delineate the molecular targets of CI and the role of mobile genetic elements, such as transposons, in the transfer and mobilization of CI genes. Utilizing a combination of experimental models across various Wolbachia strains and insect hosts, the research will test hypotheses related to the conservation of CI targets in embryonic development, the mobility of CI genes facilitated by transposons, and the evolution of CI from ancestral prokaryotic selfish elements to eukaryotic expression systems. The experimental approach encompasses cutting-edge techniques including liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) for protein analysis, CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing for gene function studies, and the application of artificial intelligence algorithms to model evolutionary processes. These methodologies will enable precise mapping of interactions between CI factors and host proteins, and assess the evolutionary dynamics of gene transfer mechanisms contributing to CI. By integrating computational and biotechnological sciences, the project aims to uncover new insights into host-symbiont interactions and develop novel biocontrol strategies for insect management, thereby addressing critical gaps in our understanding of reproductive manipulation by endosymbionts. This project not only advances the fundamental science of microbial-host interactions but also provides a framework for the application of AI tools in evolutionary biology and genomics.  This project is jointly funded by IOS/SII and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
