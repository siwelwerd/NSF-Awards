 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fluorescence imaging in live animals is transforming brain science. However, the light that travels through\r\nbrain tissue undergoes unwanted scrambling or its trajectory as the tissue becomes thick, which ultimately\r\nalters the original direction of travel. Thus, it remains a challenge to obtain clear, high-resolution images of\r\nthe brain for fluorescence imaging at depths beyond the thickness of human hair. This work will develop a\r\nnew type of optical microscopy\u2014space-time-pulsed engineered-excitation for diffraction-free imaging\r\n(SPEEDI)\u2014that makes use of exotic space-time wave packets (STWPs), which have been found to resist\r\nscrambling by objects encountered along its travel path. Experiments pursued will incorporate various types\r\nof tissue specimens, and results will be compared to those obtained us other conventional types of\r\nmicroscopy techniques. The project will also provide a platform to recruit students from diverse\r\nbackgrounds to learn about microscopy. Scientific concepts learned from the project will also be integrated\r\ninto an existing optics course.\r\n\r\nThe proposed technology will allow imaging across all Neocortical layers using one-photon (1P) sources,\r\nwhich are significantly more affordable than multiphoton sources, broadly enhancing accessibility. SPEEDI\r\nwould be able to provide 1P imaging at depth with cellular precision without surgical removal, and it would\r\nenable depth-resolved use of 1P-optimized indicators, including the next generation voltage indicators. As\r\nSPEEDI is based on utilizing a new type of optical field, all of the advantages afforded from using twophoton\r\nand three-photon sources would also apply, e.g., further enhancement of penetration depth and\r\nsignal-to-background ratio. In addition, the novel level of control obtained by modifying the underlying\r\nspatiotemporal spectral structure of SPEEDI enables exquisite manipulation of the properties of the STWPs\r\nin space and time, providing diffraction-free and dispersion-free propagation (of any order in the time\r\ndomain), tunable group velocity, and temporal focusing over short distances in any medium. This level of\r\nexquisite control of the spatiotemporal properties will permit the introduction of ultra-high group-velocity\r\ndispersion (GVD) into the space-time wave packets (STWP), which will broaden rapidly on a controllable\r\nlength scale even in free space or a low-GVD medium. Therefore, by first introducing group-delay\r\ndispersion (GDD) into the initial generic pulse used to synthesize the STWP, the GVD enables the temporal\r\nfocusing of the pulse at a prescribed depth. Indeed, the focusing depth can be tuned by either changing the\r\ninitial GDD or modifying the GVD introduced into the STWP, both of which can be realized electronically\r\nwith no moving parts.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
