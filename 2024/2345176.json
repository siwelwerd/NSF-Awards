 "awd_abstract_narration": "Disruptions in food supply linked to the global pandemic have exposed vulnerabilities in the globalized agricultural-food supply chain resulting in an increased focus on the risks to domestic food and nutrition security. This project will advance the practice of use-inspired convergence research and novel data-driven techniques to address the resiliency of local and regional food systems. Findings from this research will extend understanding of barriers to wholesale and institutional procurement of local food and how technological solutions can be employed. This project will enable access to data insights by harnessing the capabilities of advanced Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML) techniques, ensuring usability. The technology developed will support rural development and the economic livelihoods of small farmers and food businesses. Furthermore, enhanced knowledge of consumer insights and market channels will reduce food losses and enhance crop diversification, supporting resiliency in agricultural value chains. More broadly, the technology will increase the availability of safe and nutritious local food, supporting integrative health in American communities.\r\n\r\nThe first phase of this use-inspired research project entailed extensive investigation of user needs and low-fidelity prototype development of Cultivate IQ, a data-driven technology platform that will strengthen the resiliency of regional food systems. In the second phase, we will build the platform components, including refinement of the computational models leveraging AI/ML to forecast market prices and demand, and deliver other production and consumer data insights to food distributors, such as food hubs, and small and mid-sized farmers. The project team includes academic and industry partners and key collaborators from the public and private sector who will deploy a technology solution at a scale that has significant implications for the grand challenge of food and nutrition security. The project aims to support producers' access to cost of production profitability analysis, as well as user-friendly dashboards for geographically relevant and actionable data insights across key decision points in the food supply chain, such as price and consumer demand forecasting for specialty crops (fruits, vegetables, and nuts), regionally grown and processed meat, and value-added products. This key data will inform small food and farm business decisions by utilizing AI/ML techniques such as predictive models for future food demand. Additionally, the technology will leverage advances in AI/ML computer vision, alongside geospatial technologies and imagery, to analyze crops, including the identification of crop types and anomalies, vegetation index, and the estimation of cropland sizes across a region. Cultivate IQ's market insights will create regional supply efficiencies and support production planning to meet the growing demand for local and sustainable products.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
