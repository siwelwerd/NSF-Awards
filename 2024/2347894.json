 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the conference, Frontiers of Geometric Analysis, scheduled to take place from June 3rd to 7th, 2024, in Santa Cruz, California. The conference's program has been thoughtfully curated to bring together global leaders and experts in various fields related to geometry and mathematical physics, with a strong emphasis on analytical methods. The event seeks to foster collaboration and knowledge exchange among renowned experts, junior researchers, and members of underrepresented groups, enabling them to explore the latest research trends and future directions in these and related subjects. By inviting speakers from diverse areas of research, the conference aims to spark new collaborations and facilitate the exchange of ideas. Given the conference's diverse nature, it offers an excellent opportunity for graduate students and emerging mathematicians to interact with leading researchers from various facets of geometric analysis, gaining valuable insights into the road ahead. \r\n \r\nThe conference will include close to twenty five lectures, specifically addressing recent advancements in three important and interconnected subjects: Geometric Flows/PDEs, Complex and Kahler Geometry, and Construction and Applications of Moduli Spaces. To encourage collaboration and idea-sharing among attendees, the proposed conference will adopt a unique format based on the \"flipped classroom model.\" Each speaker will deliver a concise 30-minute presentation, followed by a 20-minute open discussion period, during which the audience can pose questions and seek clarifications. A session-chair with expertise in the topic of the talk will moderate the discussion. The conference will also include a panel on REU activities in differential geometry. This award will provide travel and lodging support for participants based in the United States. For more details, including a list of speakers and organizational information, please visit the conference website at https://sites.google.com/umd.edu/frontiers2024/overview.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
