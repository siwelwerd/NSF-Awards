 "awd_abstract_narration": "The manufacturing sector's growth in northeastern South Carolina is challenged by the community's ability to provide skilled technicians capable of meeting workforce needs. Northeastern Technical College's (NETC) Technical Engineering for Advanced Manufacturing (TEAM) project will address this concern by developing a technician-based engineering technology program. The TEAM project, in collaboration with a Business and Industry Leadership Team (BILT) will design and implement a technical engineering for advanced manufacturing curriculum to address the specific technician needs of their workforce partners. The TEAM project identifies underserved demographics within the NETC service area for inclusion with engagement and enrollment initiatives in secondary and post-secondary environments. Through the TEAM project and its broader impacts, NETC will address two significant community needs: 1) provide relevant, evidence-based course offerings resulting in a qualified pool of technicians for future workforce needs, and 2) to prepare workers for high earning, in-demand employment opportunities informed through active collaboration with business, industry and educational partners. The TEAM project's impact with the local workforce is expected to be significant and sustainable with a substantive return on investment.\r\n\r\nSeveral significant goals and initiatives will be undertaken by the TEAM project. The TEAM project, a cooperative venture with the NETC science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) faculty in collaboration with BILT members will be charged with creating an engineering technology curriculum designed to address current and future workforce needs. The TEAM project will develop new engagement and enrollment initiatives informed with best practices utilized by other successful initiatives. The TEAM project will establish a Mechanical Engineering Technician A.A.S. Degree program at NETC that aligns with local workforce needs and will foster alliances with BILT partners to incorporate strategic, evidence-based initiatives including internships, externships, apprenticeships, mentoring, tutoring, supplemental instruction, customized wrap-around services, and/or professional development services with a mission to increase recruitment, retention, graduation, and employment of non-traditional, underserved and underrepresented populations. The program model created by the TEAM project will be readily available for review and/or replication by other entities. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education (ATE) program of the National Science Foundation (NSF) that focuses on the education of technicians to fill roles in advanced technology fields which drive the nation's economy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
