 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Engineering Research Initiation (ERI) award supports research with the primary goal of exploring a first-of-its-kind, integrated, sustainable, and multifunctional civil infrastructure system that has optimized mechanical properties, responds to environmental stimuli, powers itself, and self-monitors its condition. The novel concept of self-recognizing composite structural elements (SR-CSEs) is developed to build the foundation for the next generation of civil infrastructure systems with optimized structural performance, extreme environmental tolerance, intrinsic sensing, and energy harvesting functionalities. The research project intends to directly develop a smart infrastructure system. The SR-CSEs concept transforms the composite structural elements into sensing mediums and energy harvesters. They can not only provide the required structural performance but also harvest energy from external loadings and conduct continuous health condition monitoring. Applying the developed technology to address the most pressing problems that the traditional infrastructure industry has encountered will lead to reduced cost and enhanced infrastructure life , which in turn will boost our nation\u2019s economy, security, and competitiveness. In addition, this research program combines the expertise of civil engineering, materials engineering, electrical engineering, and advanced manufacturing, providing valuable training opportunities for both graduate and undergraduate students from diverse backgrounds. The researchers will also actively engage with NMSU outreach programs to extend outreach and recruit talented K-12 students to participate in the program. \r\n\r\nThe specific goal of this project is to transform fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) composite structural elements into SR-CSEs. The research goal will be pursued through the following tasks: (i) Explore optimal material designs and structural performance for selected FRP composite structural elements by using novel generative artificial intelligence techniques. (ii) Examine new paradigms of how sensing and energy harvesting functionalities can be integrated into FRP composite structural elements to form SR-CSEs. (iii) Understand and quantify the relationships among the structural element designs, external loading, and the generated output of the developed SR-CSEs by conducting numerical, theoretical, and experimental studies. (iv) Evaluate the feasibility and scalability of SR-CSEs prototypes using high-fidelity numerical simulation, and small-scale and mid-scale laboratory tests. The successful completion of this project holds the promise of transformative impact by pioneering the development of a novel category of integrated and multifunctional infrastructural elements. These elements are poised to serve as the foundation for the advancement of intelligent and sustainable infrastructure systems.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
