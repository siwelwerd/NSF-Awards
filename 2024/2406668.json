 "awd_abstract_narration": "A major goal of modern astronomy is the detection of Earth-like exoplanets. To do this, it is necessary to block the light from the central star so that any planets are not lost in the glare.  Blocking out this central bright star is a significant challenge that must be met in order to find and study faint Earth-like planets. This investigation will contribute toward this goal by developing a new type of coronagraph, a special device for blocking the starlight, for mid-infrared instruments. The investigators will demonstrate this new technology through a first-of-its-kind observation of a nearby star that could lead to the discovery of new exoplanets. This program will more broadly impact society through student research and education opportunities.  In addition, the investigators will help to develop a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce by hosting a workshop on the technique of coronagraphy, and promoting the full participation of women, disabled persons, and underrepresented minorities in STEM fields through teaching and inclusive educational programs.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis project will result in the manufacture and commissioning of a new type of coronagraph for mid-infrared exoplanet imaging observations: the Quadruple Annular Groove Phase Mask (Q-AGPM). The Q-AGPM builds on the successful design of the classical AGPM.  The quadruple-etched design in a single unit will enable the nulling power of the typical AGPM design to be combined with multiple beams and/or multiple beam positions to mitigate the mid-IR background through differential imaging. The investigators anticipate a Q-AGPM equipped 8m telescope to be two and a half times more sensitive\u2013covering an estimated ~60% of the current gap between imaging warm sub-Neptunes and super-Earths around the closest stars. They will demonstrate this gain in sensitivity by conducting a test observation. In a one week campaign (approximately three to six nights, depending on weather), the team will demonstrate the sensitivity of a single-target long exposure, which could lead to the discovery of new exoplanets. This program will more broadly impact the community by creating student research opportunities and by hosting a workshop for advanced undergraduate and graduate students that will focus on the history, modern designs, and important scientific results of coronagraphy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
