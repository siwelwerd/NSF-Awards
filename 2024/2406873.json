 "awd_abstract_narration": "Astronomers are just beginning to understand when and how planets form around young stars, with deep implications on the prospects for life in the Universe. While rocky planets similar to Earth are located close to their stars, these innermost regions are typically too close-in to study with conventional telescopes. This project will combine light from multiple telescopes operating as an interferometer \u2013 the CHARA array - to measure the temperature and map the surface density of the inner disk surrounding solar-mass and intermediate-mass young stars. Repeated observations will track moving clumps of dust that could be indicating accretion/wind physics or local planet formation. Outreach programs at rural community colleges will draw local high school students into higher education. An inspiring educational experience is planned for middle-schoolers in \u201cWolverine Pathways,\u201d a University of Michigan program offered to communities in the Detroit-metro area who are historically under-represented in state colleges. \r\n\r\nThe CHARA Array is the longest-baseline optical/infrared interferometer in the world. Researchers at the University of Michigan developed the MIRC-X and MYSTIC instruments which combine all six CHARA telescopes with broad 1.1-2.5\u03bcm wavelength coverage simultaneously, while also supporting access by the broader astronomical community through open time administered by NOIRLAB. In commissioning data, the team has discovered hot, time-variable emission inside the expected dust destruction radius. In this project, they make a modest upgrade to the telescopic instrumentation; measure multiwavelength data to assess the disks temperature; expand the target sample to stars of diverse masses, luminosities, ages, and accretion rates; and measure time-domain follow-up data. This project improves research infrastructure by providing new software tools, such as the first MYSTIC-ABCD pipeline, written in Python and C, and it makes the source code publicly available. Regarding broader impact, an outreach program with St. Clair County Community College develops authentic research modules with an internet-enabled telescope, supporting STEM students transferring to 4-year colleges.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
