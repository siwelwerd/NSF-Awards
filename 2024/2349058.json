 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Visiting and Early Research Scholars' Experiences in Mathematics (VERSEIM-REU) is a ten-week research program in applied and pure mathematics at Tufts University. Each year for three years, nine students will be mentored through summer research activities.  The program will target students from institutions with limited research opportunities who are at the early stage of their mathematical education. The program will offer these students a preview of mathematical research and career choices in academia, industry, or government. Scholars will be trained to write and present their work in front of their peers and VERSEIM faculty. Professional development opportunities will be provided focusing on graduate studies in the mathematical sciences. Social activities with other groups of students on campus will be scheduled to encourage and stimulate cross-disciplinary interactions.\r\n\r\nThe program will offer research opportunities in applied and pure mathematics, including applied (numerical) and pure (harmonic) analysis, geometric group theory, machine learning, number theory, integral geometry, mathematical biology, quantum algorithms for solving PDEs, and tomography. Program Scholars will be provided with research tasks that are accessible and mathematical techniques that are appropriate and interesting. Based on their investigations, the Scholars will be expected to draw conclusions, prove theorems, make conjectures, pursue further explorations, and possibly publish or present their results at scholarly meetings, lectures, or conferences.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
