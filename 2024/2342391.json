 "awd_abstract_narration": "Magnetogenetics is a groundbreaking technology that utilizes an alternating magnetic field and magnetic nanoparticles for noninvasive and wireless control of protein functions inside the body. This tool is not only valuable for basic research but also helps develop next-generation precise medical treatments. However, there has been an ongoing debate about the underlying mechanisms of magnetogenetics, mainly because of questions about how energy is converted on the nanoscale. This project aims to understand the nanoscale energy production and transfer required for protein activation. The research will integrate novel modeling and experimental methods for comprehensive analysis of transient heat generation by individual nanoparticles. Through this research, the PI will lay the groundwork for magnetogenetics, contributing to the design of better magnetic nanoparticles for biomedical research and healthcare, such as brain studies, cancer treatment, and organ preservation. This project holds the promise of transforming these fields in unprecedented ways. Furthermore, the PI is committed to empowering the next generation of researchers by providing students with research experiences in state-of-the-art nanotechnology and molecular biology through the integration of research, teaching, and training. Efforts will be made to increase the participation of students from underrepresented and low socioeconomic groups and women engineers by utilizing established NIH and NSF training programs at the University of Kentucky.\r\n\r\nMagnetogenetics is a groundbreaking biological technology that uses an alternating magnetic field and magnetic nanoparticles for deep tissue stimulation of cell activities, unlocking new opportunities for fundamental research and disease treatment. However, the validity of magnetogenetics has been a topic of ongoing debate, primarily due to uncertainties about nanoscale energy conversion phenomena. These debates arise from the intricate interplay of physical and chemical processes in the noisy biological environment and a lack of theoretical and experimental tools that can analyze nanoscale events at the single nanoparticle level with the temporal resolution needed to match the magnetic field's frequency. To address these challenges, this research integrates innovative modeling and experimental methods for thorough analysis of magnetic nanoparticle heating. The successful execution of the project will establish a solid theoretical foundation for magnetogenetics and offer crucial principles for the rational design of magnetic field-responsive molecular switches for advanced biomedical technologies. Additionally, the PI is dedicated to training the next generation of researchers by providing high school, undergraduate, and graduate students with research experiences in state-of-the-art nanotechnology and molecular biology. Efforts will be made to increase the participation of students from underrepresented and low socioeconomic backgrounds, as well as women engineers, through established NIH and NSF training programs at the University of Kentucky.\r\n\r\nThis project is jointly funded by the Nanoscale Interactions Program (NI) and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
