 "awd_abstract_narration": "Trapped ions are a critical approach for quantum computing, precision sensing, timekeeping, and the study of fundamental physics. To realize operational quantum advantage for computing, and to improve precision for sensing, timekeeping, and fundamental physics measurements, the number of trapped ions in these systems must be scaled up. Yet, this would require laboratories full of sensitive, complex equipment, limiting their portability, scalability, and accessibility to broader communities. The PI proposes a transformational approach that converges trapped ion quantum research with integrated photonics research to solve these problems and demonstrate their application to quantum and fundamental physics problems. This research will transform the stability of these systems and advance the state-of-the-art performance, resulting in trapped ion physics experiments that are more reliable and accessible, and allow these technologies to propagate to new fields of research and applications. This convergence research will be augmented with development of multiple hardware, integration, and software open-source tools to enable customized trapped ion physics experiments, so they are accessible to broader audiences and applications. The PI is also developing interactive educational physics tutorials which will incorporate this research into the classroom to advance the broader understanding of quantum physics and technologies.\r\n\r\nThis project will develop a new trapped ion integrated platform co-designed with integrated photonics which will have versatile applications for quantum computing, quantum sensing, trapped ion optical clocks and fundamental physics measurements. To achieve high fidelity qubit operations, the project will investigate new nanofabrication techniques, rapid packaging, and co-design of ion traps with new integrated photonics to utilize atomic transitions more resilient to errors. To scale the platform, the project will work on miniaturizing not just the optical delivery with photonic grating couplers but also the optical stabilization and control through monolithic integration of advanced photonics within the trapped ion processor itself. For trapped ion optical clocks, eliminating phase instability between the laser reference and the trapped ion though monolithic integration would enable portable operation resilient to vibration. This resilience also improves the reliability of trapped ion systems, removing operational overhead and complexity, thus making them easier to scale and more accessible to applications outside the laboratory. To foster broader adoption of these technologies the project will develop multiple open-source tools, including process design kits, ion trap surface simulation, and modular optical layout libraries. Altogether, the development of a new integrated trapped ion platform co-designed with integrated photonics will improve their performance, portability, and scalability with transformative impacts on quantum computing, sensing, timekeeping, and measurements of fundamental physics.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
