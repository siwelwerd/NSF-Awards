 "awd_abstract_narration": "This interdisciplinary project at Florida Southern College aims to enhance biomechanical analysis instruction in undergraduate STEM education by integrating 3-dimensional motion capture technology into the curriculum. This project aims to provide students with a holistic understanding of human movement. Students will not only learn about biomechanics but also gain hands-on experience in collecting and analyzing movement data using cutting-edge technologies like computer vision and machine learning. Additionally, the project will provide computer science students with rich datasets and collaboration opportunities across the fields. The project will develop a framework for engaged learning, providing students with immersive educational experiences both inside and outside the classroom. Curriculum modules will be designed to seamlessly integrate biomechanics and data science concepts, fostering a deeper understanding of human motion and its applications. \r\n\r\nThe collaboration between Exercise Science, Computer Science, and Doctor of Physical Therapy programs seeks to achieve three primary objectives: (1) The project aims to evaluate student learning transfer, engineering design skill development, technological literacy improvement, and retention across the curriculum, through the integration of the DARI motion capture system into Exercise Science courses. (2) The project will assess the impact of near-peer mentoring on persistence in STEM fields and changes in student self-efficacy in mathematical thinking and engineering design skills. (3) The project will evaluate undergraduate learning outcomes, engineering design skills in computational modeling, and technological literacy related to artificial intelligence and machine learning. The project team plans to advance open-source databases in human movement research and enhance the validity and accessibility of motion capture technology.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
