 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project investigates recently discovered monumental hydraulic features at an important archaeological site. Through excavations and a series of analyses (e.g., soil and faunal), the project examines how a group of people that lacked political centralization or marked social hierarchies built large and complex hydraulic features such as reservoirs, embankments and possible canals. The project examines larger questions regarding human collaboration and expands knowledge of earlier societies\u2019 organizational and building capacities. The research also expands the current understanding of monumentality and the emergence of complex societies. This study promotes international collaborations, provides training opportunities for graduate students, includes local people into the knowledge-building process, and contributes to public information through talks and museum exhibits.  \r\n\r\nThe study aims to establish: (1) when these monumental hydraulic features were constructed, (2) whether they were contemporaneous with other monumental constructions at the site; and (3) the functions these features served (e.g., ritual and aquaculture). To fulfill these aims the study excavates multiple areas at the site (e.g., an embankment, a lagoon shore, an artificial island and a monumental structure) and analyzes soil samples recovered from these as well as previous excavations. The study cores artificial reservoirs and the local lagoon to collect and analyze soil, shell and fish bone samples.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
