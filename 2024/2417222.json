 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national interest by developing an innovative and much-needed Quantum Sensing (QS) curriculum and effective roadmap for quantum engineering education. Although engineering is essential to the success of QS applications, few academic programs in the US teach QS to engineering students outside of physics classes. In support of the National Quantum Initiative and the quantum industry, it is important to teach topics in quantum information science and technology to engineering students. This project will test out a QS module in two different research university environments \u2013 one a research-intensive polytechnical university, the other a large-scale public research-intensive university. Specifically, the project involves collaboration between Colorado School of Mines, University of California Davis, and MITRE (a non-profit research organization). A portable QS curricular module will be created for incorporation into quantum courses for engineering students across a broad variety of programs nationally. The QS module will significantly assist instructors involved in quantum engineering education with development of programmatic materials.\r\n\r\nThe module will utilize a magnetic sensing platform based on nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamond. The widely used Canvas learning management system will be employed for pre-class reading, lecture notes, active learning and homework assignments. For hardware, a relatively inexpensive mobile diamond NV center-based quantum magnetometer OSCARCUBE will be adopted for hands on lab education. Important educational research questions will be investigated, for example, what teaching methods in quantum sensing create more engineering student engagement and inclusion leaving students with a positive attitude toward engineering as a whole and quantum information in particular? What are the minimal set of key physics concepts necessary to understand quantum sensing? Also, what kind of affordable and effective quantum sensing training hardware platform can be created for deployment in teaching-focused schools? QS itself is of high importance in many fields providing effective alternatives to MRI technologies for medicine and neuroscience as well as options for navigation and timing to support the nation's armed forces and space vehicles. The project will contribute significantly to training of engineers to work in quantum-related fields. The NSF IUSE: EDU Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through its Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
