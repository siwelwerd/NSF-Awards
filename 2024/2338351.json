 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Chemical Catalysis Program of the Chemistry Division, Dr. Anna Wuttig of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Chicago is developing a new class of electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) that are self-healing by design. The research goal is to access durable energy conversion devices, namely fuel cells, by targeting a platform based on non-covalent interactions to produce self-assembled electrocatalysts for the ORR. Advances in energy conversion and storage science hinge on the development of new strategies for electrocatalysis. Dr. Wuttig and her team members have developed a synergistic education plan to broaden the participation in electrochemistry at the undergraduate and high school levels by building electrochemistry lab-based modules designed to meet student working levels in chemistry and physics. \r\n\r\nTo produce stable and self-healing ORR electrocatalysts, the Wuttig group approach merges the organic and inorganic synthesis of amphiphiles with in-situ non-covalent self-assembly of the electrocatalyst at polarized electrodes. By advancing this non-covalent synthetic technology, this research aims to (i) generate a new series of self-assembled ORR electrocatalysts containing first-row transition metals and (ii) carry out structure-function relationship studies to reveal the key structural features that are necessary for self-healing and thereby durable ORR catalysis. The Wuttig research team will work to achieve this understanding by characterizing non-covalent layer dynamics and thickness of model (noncatalytic) self-assembled layers, synthesizing self-assembled layers that contain well-defined first-row transition metal electroactive units and characterizing their ORR activity, and optimizing the stability for self-healing by tuning non-covalent interactions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
