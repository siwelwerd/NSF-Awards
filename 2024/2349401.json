 "awd_abstract_narration": "This NSF award will support the participation of U.S. based participants to the conference \u201cCombinatorial and Gauge theoretical methods in low-dimensional topology and geometry\u201d, to be held at Centro di Ricerca Matematica Ennio De Giorgi in Pisa (Italy) in June 3-7, 2024. The conference will bring together experts in combinatorial and analytical techniques in low-dimensional topology with the aim of exploring new interactions between the two sets of tools. In particular, the grant will fund the participation of young researchers with the concrete goal of fostering new international collaborations.\r\n\r\nThe past few decades have seen a tremendous advancement in our understanding of low-dimensional topology, and several of the most original results have come to light when the tools from analysis and combinatorics are used in combination. The conference will explore new developments in topics at this interface such as: knot theory, braid groups, and mapping class groups; constructions and obstructions in 4-dimensional topology; classification questions in contact and symplectic geometry; singularity theory and its relation with Floer theory. More details can be found on the conference website: http://www.crm.sns.it/event/519/\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
