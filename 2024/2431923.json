 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact of this Partnerships for Innovation - Technology Translation (PFI-TT) project is realized through the development of sodium-based batteries that utilize abundant raw materials and environmentally friendly processing methods to foster a more sustainable and economically efficient energy landscape. By moving away from the traditional lithium-ion technology, these batteries have the potential to lower production costs and alleviate supply chain constraints associated with lithium and other critical but scarce elements like cobalt and nickel. Additionally, these sodium-based batteries are poised to enhance fast-charging capabilities and improve operation in cold environments. Such advances hold promise in enabling wider application in diverse areas such as large-scale energy storage, electric vehicles, and portable power tools. The research will contribute to the training of a new generation of scientists, engineers, and entrepreneurs in the field of energy storage as they will develop expertise in new materials synthesis and characterization techniques.\r\n\r\nThe project aims to scale up cathode synthesis for sodium-based batteries and demonstrate superior performance in large-format cells by filling the knowledge gaps between the lab-scale coin cells in half-cell configuration and the practical pouch cells of sodium-ion batteries and anode-free sodium metal batteries. The research and development activities will advance (1) fundamental understanding of the heat and mass transfer dynamics and concurrent particle nucleation and growth dynamics during the synthesis, under various combinations of precursor formulation, initial temperature, feeding rate, and air inlet temperature conditions; (2) interactions between component species in the electrode slurry from the microscopic interparticle capillary stress to the bulk rheology effects; (3) the effectiveness of greener processing methods including using water to replace expensive and toxic solvents, and a solvent-free dry processing technology for making ultrathick electrodes. The tasks are designed to combine high-throughput operando rapid assessments and simulations to extract and consolidate precision understandings.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
