 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Regional Innovation Engines Development Award focuses on improving sustainability through applied materials innovation and adoption, specifically in the medical device and infrastructure materials sectors. These twin focus areas leverage deep materials science expertise present in several regional research universities and a host of small- and medium-sized manufacturing firms to address several major materials sustainability challenges, including: the lack of biodegradable high density polyethylene; foam insulation hydrofluorocarbon emissions; lack of low-carbon/high-strength concrete that is economically feasible; and others. FuzeHub Inc., the lead organization, is a part of the NIST Manufacturing Extension Partnership and Empire State Development's Division of Science, Technology, and Innovation \u2013 the economic development arm of the State of New York. The regional coalition includes a range of additional partners, with academic institutions like Clarkson University, Cornell's Center for Materials Research, the University at Buffalo, and SUNY at Binghamton. The coalition also includes Launch NY, Buffalo Manufacturing Works, MedTech Association, and other non-profit organizations, and industry coalitions.\r\n\r\nMaterials innovation and manufacturing sustainability are timely and of societal importance. This team is mapping the directions for translation and workforce development of use-inspired research that can stimulate economic development within the region and beyond. The region has an established level of expertise in materials science and has the research talent to drive innovation in the sector. The project seeks to build the foundations of a future materials innovation ecosystem by developing a robust and diverse network of partners through this award.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
