 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Partnerships for Innovation - Technology Translation (PFI-TT) project is to create light signal microchips using special materials that will work faster and more efficiently. With the emergence of the virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) displays that are forecasted to grow into a $100 billon industry, there is high consumer demand for smaller, more efficient, and higher-performance wearable gadgets and devices.  These devices use special microchips to guide light on the glass surfaces to overlay digital content on visual objects that the eyes see.  One important design factor in such AR/VR devices is the use of low refractive index materials, which can enhance contrast and reduce optical losses and provide higher-quality images. The existing materials falls short and have poor mechanical properties, limiting the optical efficiency and mechanical robustness of the devices. This key challenge will be addressed by a novel material, which has a unique combination of low refractive index and high mechanical stiffness. The proposed material is expected to be light and will improve the efficiency of such microchips by 40% and can be widely adopted in next-generation wearable devices.\r\n\r\nThe proposed project will enable the manufacturing of a nanolattice material that can break the traditional optical index vs mechanical stiffness trade-off observed in existing low-index material. Commercially available low-index materials are limited and are unable to achieve index less than 1.3. The index can be further reduced by using porous materials; however, the random porosity can significantly degrade mechanical properties at low density. The proposed research aims to directly engineer the architecture and material composition of the nanolattices to enable optical index of less than 1.2 while maintaining over 10 GPa stiffness, properties that are not possible in traditional materials. Through a partnership with stakeholders from academia, industry, and the start-up ecosystem, this applied research will be accomplished by addressing key technology barriers in nanolattice modeling, integration processes, and scalable manufacturing. The main goals for this project are: (1) Optimize the optical and mechanical properties of the nanolattice material, (2) develop high-yield integration processes to embed the nanolattice material into photonic waveguides, and (3) demonstrate scale-up manufacturing and benchmark throughput with industrial partners. If successful, this project will enable the scalable manufacturing and facilitate the commercialization of nanolattice materials for the emerging wearable AR/VR industry.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
