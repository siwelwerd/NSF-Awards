 "awd_abstract_narration": "The IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory (ISIT) is the premier international conference on information theory, the scientific discipline that studies the mathematical foundations of efficient, reliable, and secure communications, e.g., for telephony, television, wireless, optical, and data storage systems. It has been promoted under the umbrella of the IEEE Information Theory Society (ITSoc) since 1954, originally every two years and annually since 2000. Recent editions of the ISIT have had around 1000 paper submissions with 600 papers accepted and 850 participants including 350 students who benefit from the excellent learning and networking opportunity that ISIT provides. This award supports the participation of US-based students in ISIT 2024, which will be held in Athens, Greece from July 7-12, 2024. Participation at this conference will enhance the research experiences for students and provide increased opportunities for new collaborations.\r\n\r\nStudents form an integral part of the Information Theory community, and the IEEE ISIT Conference continues to promote student participation through the ISIT Jack Kiel Wolf Best Student Paper Award, the creation of the ISIT tutorial series, and the Information Theory Society Student Committee. Students comprise about one-third of the participants at ISIT, and the travel funds offered through  this award will support the attendance at the 2024 ISIT by students enrolled in a graduate or undergraduate program in the United States and whose papers have been accepted for presentation.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
