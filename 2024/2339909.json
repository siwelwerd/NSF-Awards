 "awd_abstract_narration": "Public Abstract: Traditional bioelectronic implants have paved the way for groundbreaking advancements in medical diagnostics, therapeutics, and research. However, their reliance on invasive surgical procedures poses significant limitations. In this paradigm-shifting proposal, we introduce a novel method that eliminates the need for surgery altogether. Our primary focus lies in the development of bioelectronic brain implants that hold the promise of identifying target brain regions and autonomously implanting themselves. Once implanted, these devices will facilitate high-resolution brain stimulation, offering unprecedented control over neural activity. This pioneering approach not only revolutionizes the field of neural stimulation but also opens doors to a myriad of possibilities in neuroscience and medical intervention. By obviating the need for invasive surgery, our proposed method promises safer, more accessible, and more precise interventions for neurological disorders and brain research.\r\nTechnical Abstract: Bioelectronic implants provide a versatile platform for diagnosis, therapeutics as well as basic research but require invasive surgery. Here, we propose a paradigm shift: wherein intravenously introduced ultra-small bioelectronic devices, circulate through vasculature to implant in target regions, without the need for surgery. Specifically, in this proposed work, we aim to develop the bioelectronic brain implants that can recognize target brain regions and self-implant overcoming one of the body\u2019s strictest biological barriers: the blood-brain barrier without any surgery, and enable brain stimulation with high spatio-temporal resolution, leading to the first non-surgical brain implant for neural stimulation. Accomplishing this requires innovations in diverse fields of applied physics, electrical- and bio-engineering and we are uniquely enabled due to our expertise in not only physics and solid-state nanoelectronic devices but also in bioelectronics, synthetic biology and neural engineering. The proposed technology, to our knowledge, is a radical departure from all existing bioelectronic interfaces and if successful can lead to a new field of self-implanting biomedical devices. It is not only nearly non-invasive but it can also be extended to applications where surgery may not be even possible (such as intricate body parts challenging to access surgically, or patients not suited for invasive procedures). Specifically, the proposed first non-surgical brain implant for neuromodulation overcomes the challenges of existing brain stimulation technologies by enabling spatio-temporally precise targeted neuromodulation without any surgery and creates pathways for novel brain therapies. This technology is modular and beyond brain, it can have vast applications in numerous other arenas including cardiac pacing, therapeutic modulation of peripheral nervous system, tissue engineering and regenerative medicine to name a few.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
