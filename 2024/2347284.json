 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Design and Analysis of Experiments Conference 2024 (DAE 2024) will meet May 15-17, 2024 on the campus of Virginia Tech in Blacksburg, VA. It will bring together researchers from across the United States and beyond, and from both academia and industry, to focus on advancing the statistical techniques for experimentation that empower knowledge discovery. It will provide a forum for interaction, discussion, and exchange of ideas on novel research for designing effective experiments, and for analyzing the data that they produce. The aim of the conference is to increase the efficacy of data collection in areas as wide-ranging as autonomous driving, drug development, environmental monitoring, infectious disease dynamics, cybersecurity, and manufacturing, among many others, and so accelerate the pace of innovation in all of these domains. DAE 2024 will emphasize inclusion and mentoring of young researchers and minorities, and in so doing will be a cog in the development of the next generation of statistical experts in the techniques of experimental design.\r\n\r\nDesigned experimentation and the corresponding techniques for analysis are integral to the process of scientific discovery, be it in engineering, medicine, commerce, manufacturing, or indeed in any of the vast range of human activities where continuing knowledge acquisition is a requirement for advancement and success. Driven by these needs, developments are rapidly taking place in experimental design and analysis research, in both traditional and emerging areas of applications. As new areas of application arise, correspondingly new computational tools are enabling the development of better designs for data collection in complex problems. Technical sessions of DAE 2024 will include leading experts addressing Covering Arrays and Combinatorial Testing; Online Experimentation; Sequential Design, Active Learning, and Bayesian Optimization; Design Issues in Uncertainty Quantification; Orthogonal Arrays and Related Designs; Causal Inference and Experimental Design; Design Challenges in Transportation; and more. Additional features will include roundtable discussions, mentoring sessions for junior researchers, and poster sessions highlighting advancements in addition to those covered in the technical sessions.  Further details about the conference may be found at https://sites.google.com/view/dae2024/dae-2024.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
