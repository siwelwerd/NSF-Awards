 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will provide NSF support for students to attend and participate in the IEEE International Conference on Big Data to be held in Washington DC December 15-18, 2024. The grant will be used exclusively for students in US-based institutions, and it will enable the supported students to travel to the conference and thus participate in the conference and its associated workshops. The funding will defray the registration, travel, and lodging costs for the students.\r\n\r\nIt will enable a life-enriching first-time experience for many students, giving them a taste of the research environment in both academic and industrial circles worldwide. VLDB is a premier conference in the area of databases that brings together technical research papers, tutorials, and workshops centered on various aspects of database research and practice. Participation in this conference will enable the students to enhance their scientific foundation and build their professional networks, and thus contribute directly to training the next generation of scientists who are both consumers and developers of technology in database management system design and implementation. The grant will have a direct impact in creating a highly-qualified workforce who can take on the emerging data science challenges of the future.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
