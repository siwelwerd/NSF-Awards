 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award funds U.S. participation in a workshop on \"The Future of Challenge-Driven Partnerships,\" co-organized by the University-Industry Demonstration Partnership (UIDP) and the University of Cambridge Center on Science, Technology and Innovation Policy (CSTI). The workshop, scheduled for summer 2024, will bring together stakeholders from the government, academic, non-profit and industry sectors in North America and Europe to share insights and experiences in advancing collaborative research partnerships to address complex challenges. Challenges such as the COVID-19 pandemic or climate change and resilience require multi-sector, multi-national, multi-disciplinary research and development approached. The workshop will focus on how to accelerate and strengthen multi-stakeholder partnerships to develop breakthrough innovations that tackle urgent and complex challenges. \r\n\r\nThe workshop program will gather current trends, experimental approaches, and best practices to advance and accelerate the progress of grand challenge-driven innovation priorities, programs, and strategic partnerships. Among the topics to be taken up are contracting, intellectual property, research security, international collaboration, measuring success, partnership models, innovation ecosystem development, and talent development. The collective insights and recommendations from the assembled research thought leaders will be shared in a report to be issued after the meeting.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
