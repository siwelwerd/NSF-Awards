 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will enable a novel class of in-space proximity operations. This research has the potential not only to sustain and improve space operations, but also to strengthen national security and result in a thriving economy in space.  The expected advances include sophisticated capabilities for satellite inspection, repair/upgrade, end-of-life servicing, debris remediation, and even manufacturing and assembly operations. This project's emphasis on the safety, robustness, and autonomy of missions also ultimately paves the way for safer human spaceflight operations and contributes to vital areas like debris mitigation and collision avoidance. This effort also extends to the exploration of frontier technologies such as asteroid mining.  This project's approach creates commercial opportunities and unlocks the in-orbit servicing, assembly, and manufacturing value chain.\r\n\r\nThis SBIR Phase I project will synthesize Neural Lyapunov functions, which can be integrated into filter schemes for any type of control system that accepts state feedback from multi-sensor measurements. The primary objective of this study is to enable the inspection and capture of uncooperative, uncontrolled, and unprepared objects. This ability is achieved by fusing data from multiple sensors and applying barrier functions, rooted in Neural Lyapunov theory, to ensure safety within actuation limits and state constraints during the docking and 'combined stack' phases (i.e., when a servicer is docked with a client spacecraft). Furthermore, this technology developed path planning algorithms that use real-time optical measurements to account for the detumbling rates of client satellites, ensuring safer inspection and docking maneuvers. These steps are critical for ensuring safe autonomous operations during the docking phase and combined stack maneuvers. The final outcome of this research is to develop a mission design, analysis, and planning tool to help operators account for different mission scenarios involving in-orbit proximity operations, while analyzing tradeoffs of safety assurance versus fuel optimization.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
