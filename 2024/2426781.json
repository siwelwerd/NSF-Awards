 "awd_abstract_narration": "The homeless population faces challenges in accessing consistent insurance and healthcare, leading to frequent visits to emergency rooms for health issues that could be managed at walk-in clinics. This reliance on emergency services creates a significant financial strain on hospital systems and cities. Moreover, a lack of cell phones hinders homeless persons' ability to access telehealth services. Limited clinic hours exacerbate health issues among the homeless community. This planning project is addressing the unique healthcare needs of homeless individuals through an innovative telehealth approach that will advance health equity and promote the well-being of vulnerable populations in Hampton Roads, Virginia, and beyond.\r\n\r\nThe project investigates the effectiveness of implementing telehealth kiosk services to address healthcare disparities among homeless populations in Virginia and the United States. Through collaboration with healthcare providers, community organizations, and technology experts, the project team is planning to develop and deploy telehealth kiosks tailored to the unique needs and challenges faced by homeless individuals. By leveraging emerging technologies, such as generative artificial intelligence, Large Language Models, and interactive text conversation, patients access kiosks to obtain information regarding what type of care they need. By answering questions the technology will guide individuals to self-management, make an appointment at a nearby clinic, or seek emergency care. The project improves access to healthcare services, provides educational content for chronic disease, enhances health outcomes, and alleviates financial burdens on cities and communities. The project is embedded in the partner facilities that the homeless already go for their services and have trust in their service providers and offered services. Through rigorous evaluation and assessment, investigators measure the impact of telehealth kiosk services on healthcare utilization patterns, health outcomes, and overall well-being among homeless populations.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
