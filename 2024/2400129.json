 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 2023 Cell Free Systems Conference will focus on the latest advances in the fields of cell free biology, synthetic biology, chemistry and bioengineering, bringing together key stakeholders from academia and industry who have aligned interests. The conference\u2019s program includes many aspects of cell free systems research, including diagnostics, protein engineering, circuit design, synthetic cells, high-throughput characterization, and fundamental biological mechanisms. The conference is unique, as it focuses specifically on cell-free systems and all the exciting ways that the systems are being applied. A major goal of the conference is to create an environment where a diverse group of researchers can gather and exchange information. Additionally, the conference aims to give students and early career professionals opportunities to share their work, to network with the foremost leaders in the field, and to develop their careers.\r\n\r\nCell free biology is a rapidly growing and highly impactful area of research, with applications in biotechnology, energy, medicine, and materials. The Cell Free Systems Conference will bring together researchers and experts from academia, government, and industry in a highly-interactive and engaging meeting. The conference will enable professionals and young researchers to interact and learn through organized talks, panels, question and answer discussions, and poster sessions. The conference will feature a variety areas of cell free systems research, including cell free biosensing and diagnostics, bottom-up cell free systems, cell free metabolic engineering, and cell free systems for understanding biology.  Early career and established researchers will have opportunities to interact during organized talks, poster sessions, panels, and many informal gatherings. This platform will allow established and early career scientists to discuss challenges in the field and to establish collaborations to address these challenges.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
