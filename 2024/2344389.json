 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mitigating corrosion is a grand challenge that costs the United States nearly half a trillion dollars annually. Current corrosion control measures, which mainly rely on chemical coatings, often come with high cost and risks to human and environmental health. Microorganisms play key roles in corrosion, in which they can either accelerate or inhibit corrosion of metal surfaces. In this project, the researchers will develop a biological coating system fabricated with 3D bioprinting that can be applied for corrosion control. This bio-inspired coating design takes advantage of naturally occurring microorganisms that strongly inhibit corrosion. By harnessing the power of microorganisms and microbial biofilms, the biological coating developed through this project will provide long-lasting protection against corrosion to many types of infrastructure, improving their resilience and sustainability.\r\n\r\nTo develop this biological anti-corrosion coating, the researchers hypothesize that both the chemistry and microbiology of the coating material need to be deliberately designed and fabricated using 3D bioprinting. This biotechnology development also requires co-production with a convergent team of interdisciplinary academic researchers and experts from industry and government, especially as it can be applied to many types of infrastructure and surfaces. To accomplish these goals, this Phase 1 project will (1) develop an initial design of the 3D printed biological coating, and (2) establish proof-of-concept that functional and self-healing microbial biofilms can be 3D bioprinted. Specific target industries and surfaces for the biological anti-corrosion coating system in Phase 1 include vehicle parts, agricultural machinery, and transportation and energy infrastructure. Both objectives will be carried out through an iterative and collaborative approach between the academic, industry, and government project partners.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
