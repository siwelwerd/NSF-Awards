 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project seeks to protect the integrity of digital content and maintain public trust. The rapid advancement of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) has made it easier to create and manipulate digital content. Current tools for detecting AI-generated content are fragmented and challenging to use. The project team is developing an all-in-one digital content forensics platform designed to streamline the forensic analysis process. By integrating multiple tools into a single platform, it aims to empower users by providing a reliable and user-friendly platform for evaluating digital content. \r\n\r\nThe project employs a user-centered design process, involving extensive qualitative interviews and user studies to understand needs and workflows. Based on the findings of these studies, the team is integrating various digital content forensic tools into a single platform, supported by a robust organization for the coherent navigation and selection of the tools. The team is also exploring explanation methods to enhance user comprehension of each tool\u2019s outputs. Finally, to help users make the most of this platform, the team is creating novel game-based training scenarios and comprehensive ethical frameworks based on professional norms. The team is disseminating this work and other information about the project through workshops and professional networks in multiple user communities that will be able to leverage this platform to maintain the integrity of online digital content.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
