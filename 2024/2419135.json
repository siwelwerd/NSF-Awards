 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will focus on the development of chemical mechanisms and models for evaluating the potential effects of atmospheric gases and particles on visibility, human health, ecosystems, and climate. Detailed studies will be conducted in environmental chambers under simulated atmospheric conditions for investigating the reactions of volatile organic compounds and the resulting products and aerosol that are formed. The mechanisms and models developed in this project can be used as modules in chemical transport models for regional and global simulations to predict the fates of organic compounds and the effects of organic gases and aerosol on atmospheric composition, visibility, the hydrologic cycle, climate, and human and environmental health.\r\n\r\nThe primary objectives of this project are: (1) to conduct experimental studies to achieve an improved understanding and quantitative description of the effects of molecular structure and oxidation regime on the gas- and particle-phase products of reactions of monoterpenes with hydroxyl radicals (OH); and (2) to use this information to develop reaction mechanisms and models for predicting the chemical composition, yields, and properties of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formed over a range of atmospheric oxidation conditions.\r\n\r\nThis project will support the training of students in organic chemical analysis, kinetics, atmospheric chemistry, aerosol science and technology, and data analysis.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
