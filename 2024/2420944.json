 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to improve learning outcomes and passing rates for the introductory biology courses and to provide research experiences to undergraduate students. At the investigating team's institution, the completion rate of STEM degrees falls dramatically for students receiving a grade below C in introductory biology courses. This project looks to increase the passing rate of these introductory courses to improve the retention of undergraduate students in biology. chemistry, biochemistry, and related majors. Recent studies show that other factors, such as early exposure to research and targeted applied learning practices, play a prominent role in STEM retention for students. To enhance learning outcomes, the project will use cost-effective 3D printed materials to increase visual and conceptual learning and will engage students in the creation and testing of these materials. The project will also create open educational resources (OER) to reduce textbook cost to students and implement a Summer - Biology Research Experience and Knowledge (Summer-BREaK) program to expose students to mentored research. \r\n\r\nThis project aims to: 1) develop interactive learning materials to improve conceptual learning and increase passing rates in introductory biology courses; 2) integrate project-based research into the newly written OER lab manuals; and 3) facilitate student engagement in mentored research through the Summer-BREaK program. Project evaluation efforts will assess student perspectives and their impacts on academic success, employing both qualitative and quantitative methodologies. Quantitative and qualitative data will be synthesized and analyzed with a convergent case study approach to understand how the project activities work together within their contexts to achieve the project goals. The anticipated outcomes of the project are: 1) increased passing rates in introductory courses; 2) increased participation of Hispanic and other students from historically underrepresented populations in STEM research; and 3) faculty engagement in new opportunities to develop evidence-based teaching approaches that improve student learning and engagement. Project materials and findings will be disseminated through conference presentations, peer-reviewed publications, and workshops. All resources will be openly licensed and shared so that other institutions may replicate and adapt this curriculum. This project is funded by the Improving Undergraduate STEM Education: Hispanic-Serving Institutions Program, which aims to enhance undergraduate STEM education, broaden participation in STEM, and increase capacity to engage in successful STEM educational improvement at HSIs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
