 "awd_abstract_narration": "There are 285 million people with blindness and low vision (pBLV) worldwide. One dramatic correlate of vision loss is unemployment, with rates as high as 81% in urban environments. Employment disparities stem, in large part, from difficulties with transportation to and from work and wayfinding within the workplace itself. This project takes a fundamental step in addressing the employment challenges of pBLV through a powerful assistive-navigation platform, the Visually Impaired Smart Service System for Spatial Intelligence and Onboard Navigation (VIS4ION). VIS4ION is a discreet, instrumented backpack with an array of miniaturized sensors integrated into straps that connect to an embedded system for computational analysis. Real-time audio and tactile feedback are provided through a binaural bone conduction headset and an optional reconfigured waist strap turned haptic interface. A prototype platform, partly developed through the Phase 1 Convergence Accelerator Grant, provides valuable microservices for pBLV, including real-time navigation, scene understanding, and obstacle avoidance, all of which could transform workplace experiences for pBLV. This translational Phase 2 project broadly seeks to bring the current VIS4ION prototype to a commercial system for impact in real complex workplace environments. The work will leverage new developments in conversational AI, machine vision, networking, and haptics, along with extensive trials with users. To realize the goals for this multi-faceted project, a transdisciplinary team has been assembled that spans technology development, engineering, translational medicine, and business management, supported by partners in private industry (Google, AT&T, and Qualcomm), non-profits for pBLV (Lighthouse Guild and VISIONS), and government agencies for transport and disabilities (MTA, DOT, and NYC office for persons with disabilities).\r\n\r\nThis translational project will be executed in four inter-connected tasks: (1) boosting independent AI-based microservices for smart wearables with a specific focus on a navigation pipeline that supports indoor and outdoor journeys, with zero infrastructural requirements; (b) enhancing coordinated microservices through custom AI ensembles and conversational AI; (c) building network connectivity resilience through unique video rate-adaptation algorithms; and (d) executing extensive system usability testing in transit hubs, hospitals, and workplaces. Beyond the envisioned impact on medicine, science, engineering, and improving the lives of pBLV, this program will foster formal and informal learning opportunities for graduate, undergraduate, medical, and high school students in clinical and fundamental STEM/STEAM research. These training opportunities will foster multi-pronged and multi-disciplinary team approaches critical to the development of innovative solutions for complex real-world problems.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
