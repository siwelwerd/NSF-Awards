 "awd_abstract_narration": "For six decades, the semiconductor industry has relied on reducing the sizes of transistors, memory, and wires from microns to nanometers. The conventional approach of  \u201ccramming more components\u201d onto the same chip area, leading to greater functionality and lower cost per function over time, is approaching its physical limits.  However, a seismic shift in the future of semiconductors can be enabled by building three-dimensional (3D) integrated circuits (ICs) with much higher density than have been possible through conventional, lateral scaling. \r\n\r\nThis project will develop the fundamental steps necessary to accomplish such a vision through an inter-disciplinary approach from nanomaterials to systems, in a manner that will accelerate their lab-to-fab translation. The project will pursue the integration of atomically thin materials (e.g. one- and two-dimensional semiconductors like carbon nanotubes and MoS2) into individual circuit layers, which will then be stacked in 3D to achieve high-density circuits. The research will also advance the materials science and reliability of 3D integration, areas of inquiry that have received limited attention to date. The 3D integrated circuits which this research could enable, are expected to be much more energy-efficient (over 50x) than today\u2019s technology due to the tight integration of logic and memory, with potentially massive impact from low-power wearables to large energy-hungry data centers. This project will also educate the future US semiconductor workforce in a unique way with much broader exposure (from materials-to-systems) than a traditional education which \u201csilos\u201d the various components (e.g. materials vs. circuits). The team will build on a strong track record of mentoring students who have gone into the semiconductor industry, and their educational efforts will be scaled up through online learning. These efforts could have a large societal impact, as contributions to US semiconductors are seen as major growth opportunities for industry, as important for our quality of life, and as critical to our economy and national security.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
