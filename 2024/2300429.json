 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) through Research Initiation Awards (RIA) provide support for junior and mid-career faculty at Historically Black Colleges and Universities who are building new research programs or redirecting and rebuilding existing research programs. It is expected that the award will help to further the faculty member's research capability and effectiveness and improve research and teaching at the home institution. This award to Johnson C. Smith University aims to investigate green technology and its application to inhibit bacterial growth. Specifically, it is hypothesized that the phytochemical constituents found within citrus fruits have natural antimicrobial activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae. The project is designed to engage undergraduate students in fundamental research, as well as strengthen the research-based pedagogical approaches of the Principal Investigator. \r\n\r\nUnderstanding the fundamental plasmonic, Green Nanotechnology (e.g., method/route) response of Silver Nanoparticles (AgNPs) interacting with Streptococcus pneumoniae, is critical in combating the rising threat of antimicrobial resistance. The aims of the proposed study are threefold: (i) Determine the antibiotic influence of plant extraction on the proliferation of various S. pneumoniae isolates, (ii) Examine the effect of Green synthesized AgNPs on planktonic growth of S. pneumoniae, and (iii) Determine the cytotoxicity of green synthesized, Citrus (Citrus sp.) peel synthesized Ag Nanoparticles on noncancerous, upper respiratory cell lines. In this study, Citrus (Citrus sp.) peel extracts are used as an eco-friendly, reducing and stabilizing agent. The synthesized AgNPs characterization involves using Ultra-violet (UV)-Visible Spectroscopy (UV-Vis), Fourier-transform Infrared Spectroscopy, (FTIR), Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS): Zeta Potential, X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). While this research addresses alternative approaches to combat bacterial growth against antimicrobial resistant bacteria in a more biological, economical, and eco-friendly manner, the results have the potential to shed light on new knowledge and treatment(s) for medical implants (e.g. catheters, joint prostheses, and pacemakers) and dental implants/orthodontic devices as well as maintenance of pipes/plumbing systems (e.g. biofouling), ship hulls and underwater structures, food processing equipment, and water distribution systems.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
