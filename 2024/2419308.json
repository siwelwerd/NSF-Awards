 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Ninth International Conference on Mathematical Modeling and Analysis of Populations in Biological Systems (ICMA-IX) will be held at the University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee, on October 18 - 19, 2024. ICMA-IX builds upon the success of eight previous conferences, each of which had over 100 participants. The aim of this conference is to have participants from a wide variety of backgrounds, various career levels, and from underrepresented groups. The conference will highlight significant recent developments in mathematical biology and provide a forum for the participants to meet, to communicate their scientific discoveries, and to initiate new collaborations.  By bringing together a new generation of researchers along with the established experts, the aim is to cultivate new collaborations and networks that can help junior researchers as they advance their careers. \r\n \r\nMathematical modeling in biology and medicine is becoming ever more important and impactful. This became more visible than ever to the general public during the years of the recent Covid-19 pandemic when crucial policy recommendations were made by epidemiologists and modelers based on mathematical models of the dynamics of the disease. Further applications include a better understanding of cancer spread and its treatment, the working of the nervous system and interactions of species in ecosystems at various scales. ICMA-IX will continue the tradition of  including a plenary talk based on the paper that won the Lord May Prize awarded by the Journal of Biological Dynamics. The conference will feature mathematical modeling in biology diverse in both its applications and its techniques. By its very nature, this research is interdisciplinary and collaborative. Thus, conferences are crucial events to bring together researchers and students from different areas.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
