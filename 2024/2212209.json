 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will extend the range of on-hand wireless communications devices to austere and remote environments. Public safety agencies will now be able to utilize available resources more efficiently, precisely geolocating distressed individuals and/or connecting individuals in need with specific resources and personnel to facilitate their rescue. The propeller-enabled Projectile Assisted Repeater/Relay Of Transmissions (PARROT) technology will benefit the civilian market that requires communication in remote locations or emergency situations. Potential customers include individuals whose vocation or vacation takes them into austere locations where the ability to communicate effectively may be compromised. Additionally, the PARROT would be a lifesaving piece of equipment for individuals whose work often requires them to be in areas lacking robust or functioning communication infrastructure: commercial truck drivers, Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) agents, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) responders, search and rescue teams, etc. \r\n\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project highlights how communications solutions historically evolved by modulating the specific frequency range, whereas the approach applied to solving this problem is to allow the user to prescribe the location of a relay and rapidly introduce that physical relay (capable of loitering for sufficient time to allow for two-way communications) into their environment. The envisioned device could utilize existing tools to deploy its innovative technology. Additional variants could be developed as part of all-in-one kits supplied to outdoors enthusiasts. The principal scientific and engineering research objectives are to engineer, develop, and design electronic components small enough to fit in the desired form factor, yet rugged enough to withstand the significant set-back forces associated with ballistic, short-tube launches. Computer aided design/manufacturing (CAD/CAM) processes will be used to model, prototype, test, and evaluate the design. Once that task is completed, the device will be able to safeguard the lives of first responders and outdoors enthusiasts globally.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
