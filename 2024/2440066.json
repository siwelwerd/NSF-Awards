 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant supports United States (U.S.) student attendance at the 2024 version of the ACM International Conference in Ubiquitous and Mobile Computing (Ubicomp) and the International Symposium on Wearable Computers (ISWC), which will take place together in Melbourne, Australia. Ubicomp and ISWC are leading events in ubiquitous, mobile, wearable, and interactive computing that foster the exchange of cutting-edge research and innovations among global researchers and practitioners.  The conference serves as a platform for advancing knowledge and technological applications in this field, as well as a place to build the research community.  Having a strong representation of U.S. student researchers at the conference is crucial to both develop the community and to uphold U.S. competitiveness in this important field. \r\n\r\nThe grant funds will be used to facilitate up to 16 U.S.-based students attending the doctoral colloquium associated with the conferences. Students will be selected primarily based on the potential of their work's contributions to the field and to society more generally.  The selection committee will also give some weight to selecting a set of attendees from a diverse set of institutions and backgrounds, as well as to promising first-time attendees who do not yet have papers at the conference.  Attending students will benefit from receiving experienced mentors' feedback on their work as well as the chance to connect to more senior researchers in the field.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
