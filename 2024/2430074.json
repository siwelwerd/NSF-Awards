 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact of this I-Corps project is the development of agricultural technology for soil health management. Currently, precision farming and soil testing for soil health management is limited by \u201cwet chemistry\u201d laboratory testing methods that require extensive sample handling and produce chemical waste. This technology may offer commercial soil testing capabilities that use locally tailored calibration models made to service clientele from specific regions, with low labor demands and no chemical waste. The goal is to connect current soil testing services with \u201cbig data\u201d and remote sensing in agricultural systems. The use of this technology may allow the connection between precision farming and soil testing for soil health management to meet the growing demand for improved access to soil health measurements as well as data to inform policy and management decisions.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of soil spectral libraries (n > 3000 spectra) and predictive models for quantifying agronomically important soil properties. The technology uses mid-infrared (MIR) spectroscopy and an instrument that allows a seamless interface with the world\u2019s largest MIR spectra library.  Other testing technologies are based on near-infrared (NIR) technology and rely on either local or undisclosed and unverifiable spectral libraries. In soil analyses, MIR regularly outperforms NIR because it captures fundamental vibrations with much higher resolution and provides superior measurement of soil properties. In addition, this technology can quantify multiple soil properties with a single scan, compared to traditional soil analyses that require lengthy procedures for each property of interest. In the future, the goal is to leverage both local and national spectral libraries and existing soils data from potential customers. This soil analysis tool may put more information into the hands of land managers leading to better decisions and positive ramifications for building soil health and sequestering carbon in soils.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
