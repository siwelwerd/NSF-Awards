 "awd_abstract_narration": "Technical and scientific engagement and collaborations between the United States and Brazil are of great value and importance for the US and the scientific community at large. This is particularly true in the areas of cybersecurity and privacy where both countries share a long and strong history of remarkable scientific research and innovation. The proposed workshop, designed and developed in close coordination with a counter-part collaborator in Brazil will help create an opportunity and an environment to facilitate a collaborative new research initiative between the US and Brazilian academic research communities. Working in close coordination and in collaboration with the Universidade Estadual de Campinas (UNICAMP), we have identified a broad and diverse group of academic researchers from across the US, as well as a corresponding group of researchers from the State of Sao Paulo in Brazil with common research interests and expertise. The proposed workshop will take place in Brazil in March 2025, and it will include keynote presentations, breakout discussion groups, and short presentations from participants from each Country. The event will create an opportunity for knowledge exchange and for the establishment of new collaborative research initiates to be pursued by the multinational team.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
