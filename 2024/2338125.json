 "awd_abstract_narration": "This CAREER project focuses on Earth\u2019s radiation belts, which are populated with energetic electrons and present a hazardous radiation environment for spacecraft operating within.  Understanding the dynamics of radiation belt electrons is of scientific interest and practical need.  Energetic electron deep injection is believed to be the dominant source of the inner belt; however, the mechanism causing such deep injections is still unclear.  This project aims to establish an integrated program of research and education centered on understanding energetic electron fast, deep injections and space radiation environment and increasing the involvement of students from historically underrepresented groups in space physics.  This project will support an early-career female faculty member in research, outreach, and education efforts and train graduate and undergraduate students in both research and education activities.  The education component involves support for various outreach programs targeted at 6-12th grade students from underrepresented groups using an interactive and adaptive learning module, redesigning a space physics course using evidence-based scientific teaching strategies, and mentoring undergraduate and graduate students in both research and education activities.  Together, these activities will engage students from 6th grade to graduate level, especially female students and those from historically underrepresented groups in STEM, in inspiring learning experiences in space physics and positively impact the STEM pipeline.  \r\n\r\nThe overarching research goal of this project is to systematically investigate the characteristics of radiation belt electron (100s of keV) fast, deep injections in the inner magnetosphere and quantify the role of large-scale, quasi-static electric fields on these injections.  The integrated education goal is to improve the STEM pipeline by engaging students from historically underrepresented groups in inspiring learning experiences in space physics.  Three objectives to be addressed include: 1) Investigate the characteristics of 100s of keV electron fast, deep injections and their relation to the solar wind/geomagnetic conditions and large-scale, quasi-static electric fields using multispacecraft observations; 2) Quantify the role of large-scale electric fields in 100s of keV electron fast, deep injections using event-specific modeling; and 3) Develop an interactive and adaptive learning module on space radiation environment and space weather impacts to disseminate via outreach programs targeting 6-12th grade students from historically underrepresented groups and integrate into an undergraduate/graduate course redesigned using evidence-based scientific teaching strategies.  These objectives will be achieved through multispacecraft observations of energetic electrons and electric fields, event-specific modeling, and developing a learning module on space radiation environment for various outreach and educational activities.  The successful completion of this project will significantly contribute to our understanding of the inner radiation belt formation, promote the long-neglected but critical role of quasi-static electric fields in radiation belt dynamics, and positively impact the STEM pipeline.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
