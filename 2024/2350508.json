 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support for the 2024 Workshop in Noncommutative Geometry and Analysis that will be held at the California Institute of Technology, March 11 - 13, 2024. This is the next iteration of the annual workshop series, which began in 2022. The main goal of the workshop is to foster scientific and social interaction among early career mathematicians in various branches of mathematics, ranging from noncommutative geometry to geometric analysis. Recent advances in and interactions between these fields have given rise to a growing need for such a meeting specifically dedicated to these topics. This event is designed to have a relatively small number of participants, and it will provide a valuable platform for graduate students and postdocs to engage with current research frontiers in these areas.\r\n\r\nMany of the recent developments in noncommutative geometry, index theory, geometric analysis and mathematical physics have focused on problems related to scalar curvature, minimal surfaces, and mathematical general relativity. The main goal of this workshop is to promote a better understanding of those latest developments and their interrelationships. A recent program concerning scalar curvature has given rise to new perspectives and inspired a wave of recent activity in this area. The theory of minimal surfaces has made significant strides on old questions pertaining to regularity or existence questions, while uncovering new problems related to adjacent fields. In the field of general relativity, results using harmonic maps have improved our understanding of the classical Positive Mass Theorem. This workshop aims to facilitate communication among participants from those diverse fields, fostering opportunities for potential collaboration. More information is available at the workshop webpage, https://sites.google.com/view/ymncga-2024/home\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
