 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to develop a highly flexible robotic arm called CoBRA (Continuum Bioinspired Robotic Assistant) to help people with daily tasks and improve their independent living skills. Inspired by origami, these soft robots are lightweight, adaptable, and safe for human interaction, making them perfect for use in homes and healthcare environments. The research is focused on creating robotic arms that can handle complex tasks like picking up items from shelves or opening cabinet doors and drawers, which are difficult for many existing assistive devices. The ultimate goal is to enhance the quality of life for people with disabilities or who use wheelchairs, to promote independence, and to ease the workload of caregivers.  Furthermore, the breakthroughs in designing and controlling these soft robots could also open up new possibilities for their use in industries, manufacturing, and services. The research team is committed to exploring avenues for the translation of this technology, which could significantly benefit the robotics and healthcare industries. This award will also contribute to STEM education, further enhancing its societal impact.\r\n\r\nThe research aims to advance the field of soft robotics, continuum robots, and manipulation control. This will be achieved by integrating a modular system architecture with customizable design algorithms, allowing for the design of robots tailored to specific assistive tasks. The project will incorporate advanced proprioceptive sensing and real-time smooth inverse kinematics, enhancing the robots' ability to adapt to external loads and avoid obstacles while performing precise movements. Additionally, the project will introduce advanced control strategies, including clothoid-based visual servoing and model predictive control, to ensure accurate and safe interaction with the environment. The project's overall goal is to deliver highly capable and reliable assistive systems that improve performance over existing tools and methods. If successful, these robots will be capable of carrying a cup full of water without spilling its contents and opening and closing doors. This will be achieved through an iterative process of building, modeling, controlling, and testing these robots in a comprehensive evaluation plan with real-world use cases.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
