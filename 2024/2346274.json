 "awd_abstract_narration": "iCn3D is an interactive web-based software for studying molecules in biology. It helps visualize and analyze 3-dimensional (3D) models of molecules like proteins, study how these proteins are built, and how they interact within cells and between cells.  What makes iCn3D unique is that it lets people share these models online using special weblinks. This sharing fosters teamwork in biology research and in education and enables collaborative research among scholars as much as citizen science. In education, the sharing allows interactive teaching of biology and chemistry concepts around molecular structure: teachers can exchange course materials and assignments with students who can then turn their assignment back through weblinks. The software is free and already has a large community of users worldwide and a growing community of developers. This project, called iCn3D POSE, aims to: a) scope a self-sustaining open-source ecosystem (iCn3D-OSE); b) create a management organization and a roadmap to transition iCn3D into such an open-source ecosystem; and c) begin building an active collaborative community of users and content developers for a sustainable open-source ecosystem. The ability to access structural models of proteins marks a significant advancement in biology and medicine, enabling researchers and clinicians to delve into molecular structures and propose mechanisms for biological functions and malfunctions, to lead to new ways of understanding and treating diseases. However, analyzing 3D protein structures remains a specialized field, often requiring collaboration with experts in protein structure and modeling to develop accurate hypotheses. \r\n\r\nThe iCn3D-POSE project aims to facilitate the collaborations by leveraging iCn3D's data-sharing features. Through its web-based platform, iCn3D allows scientists to exchange 3D visual representations of molecules (molecular scenes), comparative structural analyses, and annotations, fostering interaction not only with the 3D structures but also among researchers themselves. In the long term, the project aims to create a collaborative and sustainable ecosystem around iCn3D, involving users, developers, organizations, and experts in various fields. In Phase I, the project aims to engage all the potential stakeholders in research, education, and training (collaborators/developers, users, potential scientific advisors, community at large, etc.) in the public and in the private sector, through conference sessions, workshops, hackathons, and interviews. This collaboration will help develop a robust, well-informed, and sustainable plan for the successful development of the open-source ecosystem. By empowering a dynamic community, the iCn3D POSE project holds the potential to drive transformative advancements in education and in research and lead to new ways of understanding biology and diseases at the molecular level.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
