 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Improving Undergraduate STEM Education: Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSI Program), this Track 1 project aims to improve outcomes for undergraduate students in introductory programming courses at the University of Puerto Rico at Ponce (UPRP). There is a substantial need nationwide for additional computing professionals, and UPRP has seen increased enrollment in computer science courses. This project will implement coding bootcamps as co-curricular supports to strengthen programming skills and improve outcomes for students enrolled in Algorithms and Programs Development I and II, which are core computer science courses at UPRP. These bootcamps will be offered with face-to-face, online, and self-paced options and will involve skill-specific training, coding projects and interactive, engaging contests. The project will also include opportunities for students to explore careers through company tours and shadowing experiences. The ultimate goal of the project is to create a supportive environment that fosters a sense of community, improves programming skills, and enhances the overall experience for computer science students.\r\n\r\nThe primary objectives of the project are to assess the impact of co-curricular coding bootcamps on students' academic performance, motivation, confidence in programming skills, engagement, sense of belonging, and peer connections. The project will encourage students to explore exciting and lucrative career opportunities in computing. These industry experiences and the project's emphasis on strengthening student outcomes and increasing degree attainment in computer science at UPRP will also broaden participation of Hispanic individuals in the computing workforce. Offering bootcamp experiences in parallel to coursework across a typical semester, as opposed to as a pre-semester or summer experience, is relatively uncommon and represents a source of potential new knowledge for the higher education community. Project research and evaluation will explore the impact of this model, identify aspects of the implementation that are particularly effective, and provide insights that will support adoption and adaptation to a broad collection of institutions. Results obtained will be shared through webinars and workshops, facilitating the exchange of insights and best practices in computer science education. This project is funded by the HSI Program, which aims to enhance undergraduate STEM education, broaden participation in STEM, and build capacity at HSIs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
