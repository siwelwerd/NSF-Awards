 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Industry University Cooperative Research Center (IUCRC) award funds the planning phase of the University of North Dakota (UND) in their activities to join the proposed Center for Infrastructure Security in the Era of AI (ISEAI). George Mason University (GMU) is the lead site of the Phase I proposal for creating ISEAI.  ISEAI aims to address the urgent need for robust protection against cyber threats in vital sectors like financial services, energy, and healthcare. By focusing on these high-risk areas, the project supports national security and economic stability. After successful completion of the planning phase, the (UND) proposers will be eligible to submit a site addition proposal to join an existing IUCRC.  \r\n\r\nThe grant aims to initiate collaboration between academic researchers and industry partners to explore and address current and future cyber threats to critical infrastructure. It will utilize AI to enhance resilience against both traditional and AI-enabled attacks. UND will collaborate with industry and government partners across the North Central region, including North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, and surrounding areas, to develop innovative solutions for securing diverse infrastructure systems\u2014from transportation to energy distribution.\r\n\r\nThis initiative has the potential to make an impact by translating research findings into practical applications that improve infrastructure security. UND\u2019s expertise in cybersecurity, energy research, and unmanned aerial systems (UAS) will drive advancements in technology and foster a collaborative environment among researchers, industry, and government. The grant will facilitate technology transfer, promote economic growth, and contribute significantly to national security and resilience.  The project will positively influence workforce development by involving students at all educational levels.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
