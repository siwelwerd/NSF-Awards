 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project investigates how climate change impacts coastal communities in an urban environment. Social and environmental disruptions due to climate change are rapidly increasing, often disproportionately impacting those with the fewest resources to adapt. Water is arguably the central element of climate risk; where, when, and how it moves affects the frequency and severity of floods, droughts, fires, storm surges, hurricanes, and excessive heat. These weather events often have unpredictable impacts on human wellbeing, especially when compounded by legacy pollution. The urgency, novelty, and complexity of these challenges call for multiple, coordinated approaches that prioritize and amplify community voice and integrate a range of input. Based on this perspective, this project brings together stakeholders from different sectors and agencies to provide timely and ongoing insights on the degree to which urban climate interventions are effective, equitable, and sustainable. \r\n\r\nResearchers on this project analyze (1) the alignment between water infrastructures, policies, and practices with emerging climate and environmental challenges (e.g., floods, storms, contamination, loss of coastal ecosystem functions) (2) the impact on coastal communities of recent climate-oriented interventions, and (3) promising approaches to policy development, implementation, and community engagement, based on direct experience of coastal communities. Methods include ethnographic fieldwork, community-based participatory action research, interviews, legal and policy analysis, and analysis of ecological and demographic data. Deliverables include reports and peer-reviewed publications; partnerships with other researchers, community organizations, and government agencies; undergraduate research and teaching modules to support upward mobility and competitiveness of students; evidence-based recommendations for processes that respond to community priorities; and ultimately the creation of a sustainable research center at a minority-serving institution.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
