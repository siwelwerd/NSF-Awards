 "awd_abstract_narration": "This planning phase award to the University of Wyoming (UW) will explore the feasibility of a partner site of the proposed Industry University Cooperative Center (IUCRC) called AI/ML driven Research in Infrastructure Trust Assurance and Sustainability (AMRITAS). The project spans critical sectors such as energy, finance, agriculture, transportation, and defense. The Phase I project proposal for creating the AMRITAS center is led by the Colorado State University (CSU).  After successful completion of the planning phase, the (UW) proposers will be eligible to submit a site addition proposal to join an existing IUCRC.  This project supports NSF\u2019s mission to promote scientific progress, enhance national health, prosperity, and welfare, and secure national defense.\r\n\r\nUW\u2019s research within AMRITAS will focus on developing resilient infrastructure solutions that mitigate risks from random disturbances and intentional adversarial threats. By leveraging cutting-edge artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) technologies, UW seeks to promote safe, secure, and reliable infrastructures while advancing ecological sustainability and social equity. Key objectives include ensuring the trustworthiness of AI/ML models by addressing data validity, quality, authenticity, and bias, as well as enhancing the collaboration between AI/ML systems and humans. \r\n\r\nWhen realized, the UW partner site aims to tackle critical challenges in infrastructure development and sustainability across Wyoming and neighboring regions. By integrating research internships and industry collaborations, UW seeks to cultivate a skilled workforce equipped to address emerging infrastructure and cybersecurity challenges. The project will also enhance environmental sustainability, reduce energy risks, and promote social equity in infrastructure development.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
