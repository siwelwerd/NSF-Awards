 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project team will provide hands-on laboratory training in a classroom setting for science and engineering students and teaching assistants by utilizing the Facilities for Atmospheric Research and Education Ice Nucleation Cold Stage from North Carolina State University. In this work, students will learn about fundamental concepts of material and environmental science, such as phase change, phase transition temperature, crystallization, and physical nucleation. Teaching will begin within a sophomore class in the Fall of 2024 followed by a freshman class in the Spring of 2025. Students will come primarily from West Texas A&M University, but some will be selected from the nearby Hispanic-serving Amarillo College. The experience to be gained by the students will be valuable and is very likely to enhance their understanding of ice nucleation research and how laboratory data is utilized for research purposes.\r\n\r\nThe objectives of the project are: (1) acquiring and setting up the Ice Nucleation Cold Stage at a minority-serving institution, (2) developing an education module in atmospheric ice nucleation and replicating the Ice Nucleation Cold Stage instrument, (3) teaching the newly designed module to approximate 60 students; and (4) conducting outreach activities with Amarillo College. The Ice Nucleation Cold Stage will be used during the Fall semester and a duplicate Ice Nucleation Cold Stage will be replicated for use in the Spring 2025 semester. Two undergraduate teaching assistants will be recruited for classroom teaching.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
