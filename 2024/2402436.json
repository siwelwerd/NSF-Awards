Those speaking at the meeting include the leading researchers across arithmetic, analysis and geometry.\r\n\r\nThe conference will provide high-level talks by mathematicians who are both outstanding researchers and excellent speakers. These will synthesize and expose a broad range of recent advances in number theory as well as related developments in analysis and dynamics. In addition to the talks by leading researchers there is also time allotted for a session on the best practices for mentoring graduate students and postdocs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
