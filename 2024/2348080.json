 "awd_abstract_narration": "Collaborative Research: Designing Intelligent Industrial Robots for STEM Inclusion by Leveraging Self-Determination Theory to Foster Autistic Talent in Manufacturing Work\r\n\r\nWorkforce diversity is crucial in today's rapidly changing world. Autistic adults, with their unique perspectives and skills, can significantly contribute to workplace diversity. However, compared to similarly qualified peers, they often struggle to find and retain jobs, including in STEM fields where the U.S. faces an increasing skills gap. Autistic adults comprise at least 2% of the U.S. population, so increasing their employment rate could meaningfully expand and enhance the U.S. manufacturing and STEM workforce. This project aims to address this issue by developing smart industrial robots that provide personalized support for autistic employees in manufacturing and STEM work environments. By creating more supportive and inclusive workplaces, we seek to improve job retention, income, and independence for autistic employees. Furthermore, this initiative will help bridge the skills gap in manufacturing and boost economic growth. The advancements from this project will also enhance educational opportunities and improve employment prospects for autistic adults, fostering more neurodiverse and productive work environments that drive innovation in the U.S. manufacturing sector.\r\n\r\nThis project focuses on developing smart industrial robots that offer personalized support for autistic employees in STEM and manufacturing jobs. Our approach combines the co-design framework of mutual shaping with the principles of Self-Determination Theory (SDT). We will engage key stakeholders, including autistic adults and industry experts, throughout all development cycles in an iterative design process to advance industrial robot intelligence.\r\nThe primary objectives of this project are twofold: (1) to co-create support approaches based on SDT that address fundamental psychological needs (i.e., autonomy, competence, and relatedness) through interviews, focus groups, and human-in-the-loop simulations, and (2) to enhance robot intelligence for accurately identifying and meeting workers' psychological needs in manufacturing settings, resulting in adaptive and personalized support. By integrating SDT-based support into industrial robot design, we anticipate increased motivation, work quality, and job satisfaction for all employees. This neuro-affirming work environment will, in turn, promote inclusion, productivity, and innovation in the STEM workforce.\r\n\r\nThis award has been made in response to the NSF solicitation \u201cWorkplace Equity for Persons with Disabilities in STEM and STEM Education\u201d (NSF 23-593). This project is funded by the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) Program in the Division of Research on Learning in Formal and Informal Settings (DRL) in the Directorate for STEM Education.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
