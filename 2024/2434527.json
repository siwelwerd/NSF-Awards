 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact of this I-Corps project is the development of a process called bio-mining to extract rare earth elements. Currently, hydrometallurgical technologies are energy- and cost-intensive, inefficient, and have environmental and safety issues associated with the use of concentrated acids and solvents. Rare earth elements have similar chemical properties, making them difficult to separate. This technology uses microorganisms at circumneutral pH in a closed vessel bioreactor. This method is designed to minimize hazardous waste generation and make critical minerals processing more efficient. Mines may use this approach to process ores with less waste costs and environmental contamination. In addition, a full-scale facility would enhance clean-up of abandoned sites and decrease mine waste due to increased efficiency and reduced hazardous chemicals. Sustainable biology-based mining may provide a means to obtain critical minerals needed for advanced technologies used in health, defense, clean energy, and many consumer products.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of a critical mineral processing technology. The technology is based on a sustainable extraction and semi-separation process that uses natural microbes that extract and bind to high-value critical minerals without the use of hazardous chemicals. The microorganisms perform a two-in-one step that both extracts and concentrates rare earth elements. The process produces a powder that may be sold or further purified into pure metals and is 40% lower in cost than current processes. The process is performed at room temperature, which avoids the energy costs of high-temperature processes currently being employed. In addition, this solution also may be performed on the mine site to reduce the need to transport large amounts of waste material. This technology may support U.S. technology companies that use rare earth elements in aerospace, defense, medical, and electronics manufacturing.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
