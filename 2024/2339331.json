 "awd_abstract_narration": "Restoring the ability to walk is a high priority for rehabilitation in patient populations. Neuromechanical simulations \u2013 a computer modeling approach for simulating how the nervous system and body interact to control movement \u2013 show promise as a tool to identify the best rehabilitation intervention to improve walking function. However, current simulations often focus on predicting an optimal solution (such as walking faster or more symmetrically) without regard to how this will be achieved. This CAREER projects seeks to develop a new neuromechanical simulation framework that models how patients adapt to walking rehabilitation. The framework will lay the foundation for a new and potentially transformative approach for patient-specific prescription of gait rehabilitation. This CAREER project will also pursue outreach and educational activities to (1) train the next generation of engineers to prioritize clinician and patient perspectives and (2) educate clinicians and patients about the potential of neuromechanical simulations in gait rehabilitation.\r\n \r\nThe investigator\u2019s long-term goal is to develop neuromechanical simulations for clinical decision-making in gait neurorehabilitation. Towards this goal, this CAREER project seeks to develop a novel simulation framework that models the adaptation of neuromuscular control underlying the restoration of functional gait ability. As a proof-of-concept, the investigator will develop this framework on an error-augmentation based gait training intervention that amplifies instability to challenge and retrain walking balance control. The research activities are divided into two interconnected foci. Focus one will capture muscle activity and kinematics from a diverse population - young adults, older adult fallers, and stroke survivors -  while walking in the error-augmentation environment. Focus two will develop a simulation framework to model individual-specific adaptation to this environment. This project will first develop a theory-based framework in which neuromuscular control is optimized via exploration to maximize walking balance and minimize effort. The framework will be augmented by incorporating individual-specific muscle coordination impairments and adaptation constraints derived from experiments to better simulate the adaptation process in patient populations.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
