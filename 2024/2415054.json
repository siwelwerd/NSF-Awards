 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader/commercial impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the design and implementation of wideband radio-frequency front-end systems with phased arrays, which are poised to transform wireless communication hardware development. The front-end market continues to expand with a fast annual growth rate of >13% till 2030 to reach 60 billion USD. However, this market is highly fragmented in terms of applications and frequency bands. While customized front-end components are commonly developed for specific applications, the potential for wideband designs to unify and standardize solutions has yet to be realized at an economic scale. The proposed Radio-Frequency Fractional Hilbert Transformation design theory in this project establishes a crucial foundation for developing ultrawideband beamforming integrated circuits. In addition to this type of products, the company plans to expand its portfolio by incorporating wideband functional blocks such as power amplifier modules.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation (SBIR) Phase I project focuses on exploring the feasibility of designing ultra-wideband beamforming integrated circuits using the innovative Radio-Frequency Fractional Hilbert Transformation design theory. Through this project, the company aims to validate the ultra-wideband beamforming concept, assess its performance impacts, identify crucial design parameters, and create a prototype to demonstrate its effectiveness in a 1x4 phased array. As the initial phase of the project, the team will design and implement multiple radio-frequency signal processing units using commercially available components and printed circuit boards. These units form the fundamental building blocks for the project's objectives. Upon successfully completing the second step\u2014assembling and characterizing the performance of ultra-wideband beamforming circuits using signal processing units\u2014a 1x4 phased array demo system will be developed. This will highlight the technology's capabilities and potential. The ability of this array to scan radiation patterns across frequencies from 2 to 18GHz will be critical in demonstrating the successes of Phase I and setting the stage for Phase II of the project. Additionally, the company will explore integrated circuit-based solutions to further enhance the implementation of ultra-wideband circuits within the project.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
