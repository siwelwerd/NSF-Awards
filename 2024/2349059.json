 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goals of this multi-institutional NSF REU program are the following: i) Offer high-quality research experiences and professional development events that provide participants the skills necessary to succeed at scientific research, ii) implement an application process that fosters a cadre of participants each year reflecting the diversity of the U.S., iii) provide opportunities for REU participants to continue work on their REU research beyond completion of the program, and iv) strengthen partnerships between three local Atlanta HBCU institutions as well as with Georgia State University (GSU). Building upon the previous NSF AOG REU program (NSF 1852040), it is expected that the proposed partnership of Georgia Tech, Spelman College, Morehouse College, Clark Atlanta University, and GSU, along with recruitment of participants across the U.S., will provide an opportunity to recruit and train a diverse group of participants each year of the program. It is hoped that the program will help student participants increase their chance at being accepted within AOG-related graduate school programs, which, in turn, will prepare them to be successful within M.S. and Ph.D. degree AOG career positions and increase diversity within these fields.\r\n\r\nDuring each summer of the funding period, 10 REU student participants will work with a faculty mentor who has an active research group in an area of interest to the student. Undergraduates will participate in a diverse array of projects within AOG-related fields, ranging from the atmospheric sciences to climate science, oceanography, geosciences and planetary science. Students will play an integral role in designing their research project, including conducting a literature review, crafting a research question, goal or hypothesis and subsequently investigating this through data collection and analysis, derive conclusions related to their study and present their findings in written and oral form. Throughout the program, REU students will participate within regular group meetings, professional development sessions improving scientific research and communication skills as well as discussion focused on ethics and graduate school planning, and visits to regional private and public-sector organizations with AOG-related interests. Overall, the program will acquaint participants with a broad array of projects, enhance their presentation skills, and provide a perspective of AOG research in a scholarly, entrepreneurial, economic, ethical, and interdisciplinary framework. Furthermore, the program will benefit from shared activities with established REU programs in other disciplines within the College of Sciences at Georgia Tech.  At the beginning of the program, as well as during weeks 2, 5 and 10, REU students will be asked to participate in an anonymous survey to provide feedback about their experience to inform REU personnel of successes within the program and where improvement is required.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
