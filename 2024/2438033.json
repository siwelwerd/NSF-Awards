 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant supports research that will advance investigations of lithium transport in multilayer systems with nano-sized layers, under realistic operating conditions. Lithium is of immense importance in the development of a diverse set of applications, such as drug release for pharmaceuticals, quantum technology and electronics, and energy storage devices such as batteries. Interfaces are more prevalent in nanosized systems and can drastically change the functionality of a material for lithium transport. Understanding lithium transport through the interfacial systems can have a significant impact on the design and applications of nano-scaled multilayer systems. This joint project between the University of Kentucky of USA and Technische Universit\u00e4t Clausthal of Germany will develop a specialized measurement technique of neutron reflectometry and numerical modeling to investigate lithium transport in nano-scaled multilayer systems. Results from this research will help to strengthen U.S. standing and influence in the development of electric vehicles and hybrid electric vehicles, increase the safety and reliability in pharmaceuticals, quantum technology, and energy storage devices, as well as help the American workforce become more competitive in these industries through the training of graduate and undergraduate students. The PI will also actively recruit and mentor women and minorities to foster their interest in the fields of nanotechnology and energy storage.\r\n\r\nThere is a lack of systematic investigations of atomic transport through interfaces and confined systems by standard diffusion measurement techniques. The primary goal of this joint research project between the University of Kentucky of USA and Technische Universit\u00e4t Clausthal of Germany is to develop advanced in-situ techniques for investigating atomic transport that can clarify the rate mechanisms responsible for anomalous atomic transport through interfacial systems and aid in the design of nano-scaled multilayer systems of high quality. Specifically, the research group from the University of Kentucky will develop and parameterize models for Li+ transport in nano-scaled Si/Li3NbO4 multilayer systems and aim to find approximate and numerical solutions for the nano-scaled multilayer systems studied using neutron reflectometry by the research group from the Technische Universit\u00e4t Clausthal of Germany. The dependence of Li+ transport on mechanical stress and space charge zones at the interfaces will be examined to elucidate the mechanisms responsible for anomalous atomic motion through interfacial systems. Students will be trained in the development of in-situ neutron reflectometry and modeling analysis to understand the rate mechanisms controlling atomic transport in multilayer systems with nano-sized layers and to design nano-scaled multilayer systems of high quality.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
