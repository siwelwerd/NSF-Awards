 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop a new phased array communication technology which will be able to achieve lower power consumption, smaller form factors, and more affordable price targets. Phased arrays antennas are essential for satellite communications and the broader 5G, defense, and automotive radar markets. The company\u2019s new phased array architecture will significantly decrease the power consumption and the number of silicon chipsets that are required. This is particularly important in thermally limited and power-constrained environments like mobile platforms and satellite communication systems and leads to the reduction of batteries, bulky power supplies, and additional cooling components. Addressing the high cost and power consumption of these phased arrays will have a significant, positive impact on the commercial opportunity by enabling step changes in performance (like data rates and capacity) or reducing costs for sensitive customer segments.\r\n \r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will demonstrate a more power-efficient and cost-effective phased array semiconductor technology. This technology uses a novel ultra-low loss, high-linearity, passive beamforming circuit in a unique low-power architecture. In the receive configuration, this technology will be able to achieve a 75% reduction in power consumption due to a 4x reduction in the number of receiver signal chains. In Phase I, the company aims to advance their ultra-low loss beamforming technology to achieve even lower losses, which will enable the combination of the beamformer with their unique low-power architecture. The following objectives realize these goals: 1) development of the novel ultra-low loss beamformer and integration with a receive front-end, 2) fabrication and performance of benchtop testing on the integrated receive circuit, and 3) performance of over-the-air testing of small and moderately sized phased arrays using the receive circuit. The low-power beamforming technology will overhaul current phased arrays, eliminating many of the lossy, power-intensive and expensive components traditional units require. This technology will enable the creation of higher performance, lower cost phased arrays for many critical industries ranging from satellite communication to 5G to radar.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
