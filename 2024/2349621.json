 "awd_abstract_narration": "Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory (LDEO), located in Palisades, NY will host a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program. The title of the program is \u201cInterdisciplinary Cutting-Edge Research through the Analysis of Global Data\", and it will provide ten-week research internship opportunities for ten undergraduates each summer from 2024-2026.\r\n\r\nThe program takes students from posing a cutting-edge scientific question, to gathering and analyzing data, developing conceptual hypotheses, and culminates in activities that communicate their results to scientific and broader audiences. Students work with LDEO\u2019s interdisciplinary research community and are individually mentored by at least one of LDEO\u2019s more than 200 PhD-level scientists. The global data theme focuses the experience on data-driven, solutions-oriented approaches to scientific questions. A lecture series on forefront research and workshops in professional ethics, data display and analyses, scientific writing and poster presentations, and career opportunities add depth to the experience. The program includes a formal outcome-based evaluation by an educational professional. The program is co-funded by the Division of Ocean Sciences and the Division of Earth Sciences.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
