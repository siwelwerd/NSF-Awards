 "awd_abstract_narration": "Copper (Cu) plays a critical role in the transition to renewable energy. This metal is also crucial for giving access to electricity to approximately 2.6 billion people. To this end, a better understanding is needed of how Cu accumulates in significant concentrations. This project will improve the understanding of the conditions that produce magmas that form Cu deposits. Most of the world\u2019s Cu comes from porphyry Cu deposits. The researchers will test models of porphyry Cu deposit formation by studying deposits in Sonora, Mexico. They also aim to develop geochemical tools that can help the discovery of new deposits and ensure the availability of Cu in the future. This project will support a Latino early-career scientist at a minority-serving institution and train a graduate student and two undergraduate students from groups underrepresented in STEM fields. The project will also enhance collaboration between US and Mexican researchers through joint fieldwork.\r\n\r\nProposed models for the formation of porphyry Cu deposits rely on the oxidizing signature of parental magmas. However, whether this redox signature is source-controlled or controlled by processes occurring during magma ascent remains a contested question. To help settle this important ongoing debate (which will result in a better understanding), they will measure the redox state and constrain the petrogenesis and geochemical signatures of adakites and porphyry Cu deposits in this region. This combined approach will not only improve the understanding of porphyry-Cu-deposits formation but will also aid in future exploration efforts. This project will support a Latino early-career scientist and train a graduate student and two undergraduate students from underrepresented groups at a minority-serving institution. This research project will also foster international collaboration between US and Mexican researchers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
