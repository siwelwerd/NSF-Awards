 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the support of the Chemical Catalysis program in the Division of Chemistry, Professor Wesley Bernskoetter of the University of Missouri-Columbia is studying new applications for carbon dioxide in the production of commercial chemicals.  A large portion of commercial chemicals used to produce consumer goods, including plastics, synthetic fibers, and medicines are derived from petrochemical sources.  This project will develop new catalytic processes that combine abundant and renewable carbon dioxide resources with other reagents to provide alternative routes to valuable chemicals. The project aims to identify which features in catalyst structures control reaction selectivity in order to minimize the formation of undesired byproducts.  Effective control of catalyst selectivity enables more efficient chemical synthesis and new technologies in sustainable chemical production. This project will provide practical training to a new generation of scientists, including those from historically underrepresented groups in the chemical sciences.  Team members aim to increase recognition of diverse petrochemical-derived products in society and increase awareness of the need to develop more sustainable routes to consumer goods. The project partners with the University of Missouri Stevens Scholars and related programs to broaden the participation of underrepresented groups in chemistry and develop future leaders in science.\r\n\r\nUnder this award, Professor Wesley Bernskoetter and his team at the University of Missouri-Columbia are studying new catalysts for valorizing carbon dioxide via coupling with ethylene.  The project seeks to couple various stoichiometric combinations of carbon dioxide and ethylene to produce a range of mono- and dicarboxylate small molecules, such as acrylates, methylmalonates, succinates and adipates.  These are chemicals with significant commercial value; through mechanistic studies the project seeks to establish pathways to control the selective production of carboxylate feedstocks.  These studies are fundamental but have elements of use-inspired research.  Thus, if successful, this research will contribute to the technology required to advance a range of current research in sustainable chemical production, including the production of fuels from CO2 and the incorporation of CO2 into renewably sourced polymers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
