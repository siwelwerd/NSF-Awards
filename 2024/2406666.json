 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) award establishes a state-of-the-art shared research facility at the University of Oklahoma (OU) centered around a cutting-edge Superconducting Nanowire Single-Photon Detector (SNSPD) system. Supported by the NSF Division of Electrical, Communications, and Cyber Systems, this technology represents a significant advancement in detecting extremely faint light signals, even at the level of individual photons, from a broad range of light sources. This capability is crucial for advancing multiple fields of science and engineering with significant national impact, including quantum technology, nanophotonics, and biomedical imaging. By making this technology readily available to researchers and students at OU, neighboring universities, industries, and across the region, this project will accelerate discoveries with the potential to revolutionize secure communication, enhance medical diagnostics, improve the energy efficiency of computing, and more. Furthermore, the project integrates the SNSPD system into educational programs, enriching annual workshops with close collaboration with vendors and the OU Center for Quantum Research and Technology (CQRT). These workshops will facilitate research collaboration and enhance our academic curricula, leading to the training of a new generation of scientists and engineers equipped to tackle complex challenges and drive technological innovation for the benefit of society.\r\n\r\nThis project funds the acquisition and implementation of a multi-channel Superconducting Nanowire Single-Photon Detector (SNSPD) system. This state-of-the-art technology pushes the boundaries of light detection, capable of sensing extremely faint signals \u2013 even individual photons \u2013 with remarkable precision and speed. The SNSPD system boasts a high detection efficiency exceeding 85%, exceptional timing jitter under 15 picoseconds, a count rate exceeding 80 MHz, and a dark count rate below 10 Hz. Designed for accessibility and collaborative use, the system features a closed-cycle cryostat, ensuring stable low-temperature operation essential for the nanowires' superconductivity. This eliminates the reliance on liquid helium, enabling user-friendly operation, low maintenance, and extended operational life beyond 10,000 hours. Multiple users can access the system simultaneously through fiber-optics connections to individual channels, making it a versatile resource for a wide range of research endeavors. The system operates across a wide range of spectrum, spanning from 800 nm to 2200 nm, unlocks unique opportunities across diverse scientific fields such as quantum experiments (800-1700 nm), advances high-speed and neuromorphic photonics (980-2200 nm), and biological deep-tissue imaging (1600-2000 nm). Beyond research, the project emphasizes education, collaboration, and outreach. By integrating the SNSPD system into workshops and both existing and new courses, the SNSPD system will become a powerful tool for STEM education. This initiative will promote interdisciplinary collaboration, attract top talent to OU, and broaden participation from underrepresented groups in cutting-edge scientific research.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
