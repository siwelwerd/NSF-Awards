 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Principal Investigator in this Facility and Instrumentation Request Process (FIRP) Track 1 Education and Outreach project will utilize the Single-Particle Soot Photometer (SP2) instrument to measure black carbon in synthetic and ambient air as part of the Senior Mechanical Engineering Lab Course at Francis Marion University which is a primarily undergraduate institution. The use of the SP2 will provide opportunities to discuss principles of fluid mechanics, physics, and statistics with students. After the SP2 instrument is returned, further experiments with a low-cost air sensor will enable additional education opportunities. It is expected that approximately 15 mechanical engineering students will gain experience with the SP2. \r\n\r\nThere are five primary tasks in this project. First, the PI will receive training on the SP2 at Clemson University. Second, the PI will develop lecture material for the lab course. Third, the PI will receive and set up the SP2 instrument. Fourth, the PI will deliver lecture and lab sessions. Finally, the PI will write up findings and publish the results in an educational journal. The SP2\u2019s ability to provide real time black carbon data will enhance student learning objectives in the mechanical engineering lab by enabling students to analyze real time black carbon data with appropriate experimentation and draw conclusions pertaining to black carbon concentration.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
