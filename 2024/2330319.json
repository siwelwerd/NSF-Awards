 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cold spray is a promising technique for additive manufacturing of structural materials. It operates in the solid state and overcomes many limitations of traditional casting and fusion-based additive manufacturing. While progress has been made in understanding the processing science of cold spray for metals and alloys, the knowledge of manufacturing metal matrix composites via cold spray remains limited. The objective of this project is to develop a fundamental understanding of the process-microstructure-property relationships for additive manufacturing of metal matrix composites via cold spray. The knowledge gained from this program can be translated to aerospace, energy, and defense industries for reliable manufacturing, repair, and safe operation of metal matrix composites for structural applications. The team will focus on developing the upcoming generation of students, preparing them to excel in the area of additive manufacturing through a series of targeted, high-impact initiatives. These initiatives include mentoring undergraduate student researchers from underrepresented groups, developing integrated online course modules, and outreach to the general public via a virtual microstructure library with a user-friendly, web-based portal.\r\n\r\nThe goal of the project is to develop manufacturing science for cold spraying metal matrix composites and to develop a mechanistic understanding of deformation and failure in these materials. Novel core-shell powder particles and double reinforced powder particles will be designed and used for cold spraying metal matrix composites. Underlying mechanisms that control the behavior of cold-sprayed composites will be studied with in situ experiments: (i) individual powder particles with a focus on processing, and (ii) bulk materials with a focus on mechanical performance. A systematic exploration of single-particle impacts using Laser-Induced Particle Impact Test (LIPIT) will be used to understand the underlying bonding mechanisms in the different bi-phase systems. The information obtained from the single-particle impact experiments will guide the deposition of bulk-scale composites, which will be fully characterized using time-resolved 3D x-ray computed tomography (XCT) and diffraction. The samples with the most desirable characteristics, based on microstructure and pore density, will be further tested in situ to elucidate the mechanical behavior and fracture mechanisms. This project has the potential to significantly expand the applicability of cold spray to a broader range of materials and applications, enabling researchers and engineers to tailor materials with specific attributes and performance characteristics.\r\n\r\nThis award is co-funded by the Advanced Manufacturing Program of the Division of Civil, Mechanical and Manufacturing Innovation and the Metals and Metallic Nanostructures Program of the Division of Materials Research.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
