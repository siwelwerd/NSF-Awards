 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will carry out exploratory research to lay the foundation of Researching Team-Based Learning in high-school physics classes that will leverage the existing Physics of Living Systems Teacher (PoLS-T) Network of high-school physics teachers to investigate how to implement team-based learning (TBL) in the high school physics curriculum. Even though the pursuit of science is inherently collaborative, physics high-school education generally does not explicitly involve the development of team-based skills. The goal is to explicitly promote collaborative teamwork skills for students, as teamwork and collaboration are central to the future work environment of current school children. Teamwork increases productivity and efficiency, enhances social skills and communication, increases diversity, and enables learning. Students with access to quality physics education at the high school level will be better equipped to select and succeed in STEM majors, thus opening a career trajectory in medicine, research, governmental agencies, environmental sciences, to name a few. These types of careers are positioned to address some of our planet's most critical threats. The project will also impact diversity and inclusion efforts by diminishing gaps in physics preparedness when students get to the university level. \r\n \r\nThe research lies in the exploration of potentially transformative insights into the implementation of Team-Based Learning in the high-school physics curriculum. There has been very little work on team-based learning a the high-school level and there are quite a few obstacles to overcome. For example, most instructors have never been trained to switch from a curriculum developed for individuals to a team-based curriculum. Students, too, are not used to collaborate on both assignments and assessments. And, finally, parents often want their children to be educated the same way as they were educated. The proposed work will research potential bottlenecks to implementation and shed light on how to fit Team-Based Learning in diverse classroom environments.\r\n\r\nImplementing Team-Based Learning at the high-school level has several broader impacts. It enhances student engagement and improves learning outcomes by promoting active participation, critical thinking, and problem-solving. Team-Based Learning also develops essential teamwork and communication skills, preparing students for future academic and professional success. It fosters an inclusive and equitable learning environment by valuing diverse perspectives and encouraging peer support. Additionally, Team-Based Learning prepares students for higher education and professional settings, while providing opportunities for teacher professional development through the adoption of new instructional strategies and collaborative practices.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
