 "awd_abstract_narration": "The American Museum of Natural History will host the Science Research Mentoring Program Conference (SRMPCon) designed as an opportunity to exchange ideas and strategies centered on evidence-based, inclusive, research-focused mentorship for underrepresented minority youth. Particularly for youth who have been historically underrepresented in STEM, effective mentorship can lead to the development of a STEM identity, confidence in STEM learning, and a sense of belonging in STEM fields.  Many education programs across the U.S. offer mentored research experiences to underrepresented minority high school youth, but they often operate in isolation, limiting the exchange of strategies for fostering inclusive mentorship environments. Through this conference, participants will have the opportunity to increase their knowledge about ways of improving their mentorship programs.\r\n\r\nOver three meetings (two virtual sessions and one in-person three-day conference held at the American Museum of Natural History) participants will explore the institutional drivers that shape mentorship in their programs and will design concrete strategies that build on collective assets to address institutional barriers. Conference participants will include program administrators, scientist mentors, and science educators working within structured research mentorship programs for high school students who are historically underrepresented in STEM. SRMPCon will produce reports on the proceedings from an external evaluator and will compile the initiatives and strategies created by participants. These results will be disseminated widely in collaboration with the Partners for Network Improvement team at STEM PUSH, an NSF INCLUDES Alliance (NSF #1930990). This conference aims to shift institutional priorities to recognize the value of mentorship and cultivate environments that encourage evidence-based, inclusive mentorship, serving to diversify the workforce and bring valuable perspectives to STEM fields.\r\n\r\nThis award has been made in response to solicitation NSF 22-622. This conference is supported by the NSF Eddie Bernice Johnson INCLUDES Initiative (NSF INCLUDES), which motivates and accelerates collaboration for systems change to broaden participation in STEM and the Advancing Informal STEM Learning program, which supports projects that: (a) contribute to research and practice that considers informal STEM learning's role in equity and belonging in STEM; (b) promote personal and educational success in STEM; (c) advance public engagement in scientific discovery; (d) foster interest in STEM careers; (e) create and enhance the theoretical and empirical foundations for effective informal STEM learning; (f) improve community vibrancy; and/or (g) enhance science communication and the public's engagement in and understanding of STEM and STEM processes.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
