 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact of this I-Corps project is the development of a lower cost, robust, sample transfer system for studying air-sensitive materials in a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). The product will allow air-sensitive samples to be loaded into a SEM without exposing samples to atmospheric oxygen. Air-free analysis of reactive materials is required to engineer materials such as batteries and some microelectronics. The development of a low-cost, air-free sample transfer system will reduce costs for companies studying air-sensitive materials, improve the time to results, and help enable research advances critical for technology infrastructure.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. This solution is based on the development of a directly attached glove box which mates to the vacuum chamber of a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). This innovation consists of a transparent, air-tight dome with gloves for sample manipulation. The dome is fitted with inlet valves for introducing a gas (such as argon) that creates the desired oxygen-free atmosphere inside the dome. A Bluetooth connected oxygen and water sensor is utilized inside the dome, so the user knows when it is safe to unpackage the air-reactive sample and transfer it into the SEM for analysis. During tests of the air-free transfer system prototype, it was shown that no measurable oxidation occurred on the outer surfaces of lithium metal when being shuttled in and out of the scanning electron microscope. Studying the same sample after being in room air yielded the growth of several hundred nanometers of lithium oxide formation on all surfaces of the metal, validating this innovation as an aid in research on air-sensitive materials.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
