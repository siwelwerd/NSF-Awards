The 2024 meeting in Boulder, Colorado in April 2024 is co-sponsored by NASA, NSF and NOAA in partnership with the private sector. NSF funding is to support students participation and travel to the workshop. \r\n\r\nSpace weather remains a current priority for federal science, operations, policy, and societal resilience. Since 1996, the Space Weather Workshop has been the premier meeting for the space weather communities to share information and network among industry, academia, and government agencies. The organizing committee includes experts from all these sectors as well as two student representatives. The program highlights space weather impacts in several areas, including communications, navigation, spacecraft operations, aviation, and electric power. The conference will also focus on identifying the highest priority needs for operational services that can guide future research and identifying new high-value research capabilities that can be transitioned into operations. The integration of undergraduate and graduate student participation into all aspects of the workshop contributes to the development of the next generation of our nation's space weather researchers and forecasters.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
