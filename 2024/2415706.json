 "awd_abstract_narration": "As Deaf people today continue to be underrepresented in professional STEM settings, this project aims to open the public\u2019s eyes to how diverse peoples contribute to science in unique and extraordinary ways and, in doing so, change how they view Deafness and disability. The project will create a bilingual American Sign Language (ASL) and English documentary film that features the Deaf individuals who participated in the groundbreaking research that enabled the achievements of the U.S. space program in the 1950s and 1960s. These brave volunteers were able to endure extreme motion tests, allowing scientists to study the origins of motion sickness. The film will explore why they did it, what they endured, and what science learned through their help. By watching the film, Deaf youth may learn that members of their linguistic community are needed in STEM research and subsequently envision themselves as scientists. Notably, the PI, film director, and most of the production crew are Deaf . The film will be accessible by Deaf, hearing, and Blind audiences, and employ filmmaking techniques that advance new models for presenting content in ways that are culturally respectful and technically accessible by all. In addition to the film\u2019s national broadcast by PBS stations, the Intrepid Museum in New York City will host a screening and discussion with surviving test subjects. A companion website and viewer guides will also be created to support viewer engagement. \r\n\r\nThis Research on Wide-reaching Public Engagement with STEM project is funded by the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program, which seeks to advance new approaches to, and evidence-based understanding of, the design and development of STEM learning in informal environments. This includes providing multiple pathways for broadening access to and engagement in STEM learning experiences. The documentary film, which targets learners ages 11 and up, will tell a story that reveals not only a hidden component of early space history, but also how diverse peoples contribute to science in unique and extraordinary ways. Rather than being based on themes of pity or overcoming, the film will show how diversity of the human condition made this particular research possible. As such, the film has the potential to change attitudes about disability. The Deaf in Motion project will also advance knowledge about informal STEM learning by conducting research and evaluation studies that investigate: how the film can build a sense of belonging in the STEM fields for Deaf youth and adults; how the theory of Deaf Gain (i.e., perceived loss as asset) can be applied to efforts in informal learning settings to encourage deeper thinking on ability versus disability; and the accessibility features/decisions that filmmakers and other informal STEM practitioners can use to encourage people to reexamine their biases about normalcy and value human diversity. A mix of Deaf and hearing investigators will conduct this research using interview and survey methods with film viewers. Through screenings and discussions, the project will further enhance the public\u2019s engagement with important STEM concepts and broadening participation aims.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
