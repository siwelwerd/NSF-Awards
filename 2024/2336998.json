 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national interest by developing dynamics and control learning packages with four open-source components to improve engineering education. Engineering students taking dynamics, vibrations, and control theory courses often struggle to acquire a deep understanding of complex engineering concepts due to the highly mathematical nature of the content, lack of prior knowledge, and limited teaching tools. This Engaged Student Learning Level 2 project intends to develop learning packages to offer multiple representations of knowledge that can help students bridge theory with practice, develop problem-solving skills, and gain a comprehensive understanding of vibrations and control theory in a practical context. This project has the potential to produce advancements in understanding of student learning by exploring what ways these multiple representations are most effective for faculty and students.\r\n\r\nThe proposed learning packages include four main components: (1) 3D printed lab equipment designs; (2) virtual simulations; (3) virtual assistant-based AI support; and (4) guided learning activities. The project team plans to explore three research questions: (1) To what degree can learning packages enhance student learning capabilities around dynamics and controls within the context of carefully designed AI-assisted learning experiences using hands-on equipment and virtual simulations? (2) Why do potential users choose to use one or more parts of the dynamics and control learning package? (3) Which element or combinations of elements in the dynamics and controls learning package are most beneficial for its users? This project aligns with NSF\u2019s vision to remove barriers to participation in STEM, and with its goal of empowering STEM learners while creating new knowledge about the learning process. The NSF IUSE: EDU Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through the Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
