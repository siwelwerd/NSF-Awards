 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support to the Earthquake Engineering Research Institute (EERI) to organize programming at the 2024 EERI Annual Meeting in Seattle, Washington, held on April 9-12, to capture the lessons learned and future research directions resulting from the 2023 Kahramanmaras, Turkey Earthquake Sequence. This programming will bring together researchers, practitioners, emergency managers, policy makers, and federal, state and local experts to develop a cross-disciplinary research agenda by showcasing a very broad set of observations from this earthquake sequence in a single venue. By engaging a wide range of participants, the programming will ensure that lessons learned inform both future research and future mitigation actions that have the potential to save lives, reduce damage, and maintain critical post-event services, thus fostering national, state, and local health, welfare, and prosperity. Recommendations from the programming will be shared widely with the broader research and earthquake risk reduction community through a summary report to be posted on EERI's website (https://www.eeri.org) and the Natural Hazards Engineering Research Infrastructure (NHERI) website (https://www.DesignSafe-ci.org). This award supports the National Science Foundation's role in the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program (NEHRP).\r\n\r\nThe 2023 Kahramanmaras, Turkey Earthquake Sequence presents a major learning opportunity for the U.S. research and practitioner community across many disciplines. The programming will include a plenary session, break-out sessions, poster session, and a reconnaissance data publishing workshop. The programming will cover a wide range of topics, including geotechnical and structural engineering, seismology, geology, ground motion, lifelines, public health, emergency management and response, and public policy. The data workshop will provide participants with the skills necessary to publish their reconnaissance data in the DesignSafe Data Depot so that the vast amounts of reconnaissance data collected is available for future research. Through the participation of attendees from a wide range of disciplines and the integration of experts from academia and practice, the programming will also start important dialogues that promote future and continued knowledge transfer from research to practice and vice versa, thereby opening new areas for discovery and innovation. EERI will work with the NEHRP agencies to convene a multi-disciplinary organizing committee to plan the programming.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
