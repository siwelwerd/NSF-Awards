 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Instrumentation and Facilities award, led by PI Shim at Arizona State University(ASU), will upgrade the laser-heating system used in diamond-anvil cell experiments. These types of experiments are crucial for understanding the Earth's deep interior. The proposed enhancements include the abilities to heat Earth materials to very high temperatures, and increase high-precision sample positioning, and high-resolution imaging. These upgrades address current limitations, thereby enabling more advanced research into understanding extreme conditions, like those found in the Earth's deep interior. This upgrade is significant as it will enable researchers to explore the processes and chemical evolution of early Earth, contributing to our broader understanding of planetary formation and evolution. Over the years, Shim's lab has become a nurturing ground for aspiring early career scientists, particularly those from groups historically excluded from STEM, with numerous students advancing to academic institutions, national laboratories, and industry, thereby contributing significantly to fields encompassing not only Earth science but also materials engineering. The upgrade will further expand these educational opportunities, reinforcing ASU's commitment to diversity and excellence in scientific research and education by both advancing scientific understanding and continuing to foster an inclusive environment for future scientists.\r\n\r\nThis award will upgrade the Shim lab's laser-heating system at ASU to enhance heating quality in diamond-anvil cell experiments, enabling higher temperature heating, independent control of laser power on both sides of the sample, pulsed beams for hydrogen-media experiments, precise sample positioning, and high-resolution imaging. This upgrade is crucial as the current system, relying on a single 100 W fiber optic laser for double-sided heating, limits heating capabilities beyond 3000 K and lacks components for pulsed heating, which is pivotal in studying hydrogen in Earth's deep interior. Implementing these improvement will allow students and postdoctoral researchers to conduct important experiments, to expand understanding of early Earth processes and chemical evolution.Furthermore, the enhancement to the system aligns with the commitment to inclusive research, demonstrated through mentoring and publications involving undergraduate students, particularly those from underrepresented backgrounds. The upgrade will expand undergraduate research opportunities at ASU, furthering diversity in STEM, and particularly benefiting its status as a Hispanic Serving Institution under Title III and Title V programs. Alumni of Shim's lab have pursued advanced degrees and hold notable positions in STEM fields.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
