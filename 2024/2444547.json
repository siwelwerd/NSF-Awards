 "awd_abstract_narration": "To incentivize and inspire additional evidence-based research, especially using\r\nrandomized controlled trials (RCTs), and to continue collaborations and projects examining student votes in national elections, this project supports the Student Vote Research Network (SVRN) conference. Conference participants present and discuss evidence-based research conducted during election cycle and engage in discussions about ongoing and future potential collaborations in this underexplored area of research. Invited conference attendees include a diverse and interdisciplinary group of junior and senior faculty, graduate and undergraduate students, and postdoctoral fellows. Attendees also include scholars from large research institutions, smaller liberal arts colleges, community colleges, Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSIs). Presentations will be made from recipients of 2024 SVRN subgrants. The conference will be open to the public.\r\n\r\nThe workshop has significant positive impacts that include building connections between scholars and practitioners, providing helpful feedback for participants, and generating new scholarship in the underexplored area of student political participation.
