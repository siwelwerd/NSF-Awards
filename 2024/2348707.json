 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national interest by integrating a state-of-the-art Cyber Range into a cybersecurity program at Johnston Community College (JCC). This project intends to provide students with hands-on experiences of live fire cyberattacks. The students at JCC will validate and showcase their acquired skills through the proposed badging system while earning credentials alongside their degree program. This project intends to provide a safe and real-world training environment. The project team plans to share their cybersecurity curriculum with other community colleges and foster potential collaborations with others. In addition, the project team plans to hire skilled female candidates and offer opportunities to individuals with backgrounds in IT/cybersecurity, such as veterans with security clearances and people with hearing loss due to their military service.\r\n\r\nThis project has three goals: 1) creating a hands-on cybersecurity training range to prepare technicians for industry, 2) increasing female enrollment in cybersecurity, and 3) improving the knowledge and inclusiveness of cybersecurity faculty and administrators for the deaf and hard-of-hearing community. JCC is in close proximity to the North Carolina Research Triangle Park, which affords students more opportunities to enter the cybersecurity field as highly skilled technicians. The project has the potential to address talent pipeline and diversity issues and to increase the number of skilled women, veterans, and people with disabilities in this field. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program, focusing on educating technicians for advanced-technology fields that drive the Nation's economy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
