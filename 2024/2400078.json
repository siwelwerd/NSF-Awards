 "awd_abstract_narration": "A growing body of research has examined parents\u2019 efforts to support young children\u2019s number and spatial math skill development in the home. Past research typically examines home math activities or parent talk about math and spatial concepts during the preschool years. However, during elementary school, it is unclear how parents balance greater academic rigor and homework assistance, increasing digital media use, and home math activities to support children\u2019s continued math learning. This study examines children\u2019s number and spatial math development in the context of families\u2019 home math environments. The goal is to identify areas of stability and change in parental support of children\u2019s math learning beginning in toddlerhood through first and second grades. Findings from this study will inform educators and parents about the home math practices that enhance math learning during early elementary school and the role of parents\u2019 math engagement during child development. \r\n\r\nThis project draws data from a longitudinal study of 30-month-old children (N = 280) and their parents and follows them into early elementary school. First, multi-method measurement of the home math environment (HME) will be collected in middle childhood. Second, associations between the first-grade home math environment and gains in math skills from first to second grade will be examined. Third, continuity in children\u2019s number and spatial math skills from early childhood to middle childhood will be investigated. Fourth, this study will examine whether early childhood math skills and home environment uniquely predict middle childhood math skills. Children will complete assessments of math skills during two home visits in first and second grades. A combination of structured observations, surveys, and time diary interviews will measure children\u2019s home math environment. The first and second grade data will be linked to early math skills and HME measures collected at ages 2 and 3 in the Parents Promoting Early Learning project (DRL-1920545). By identifying how early differences in number and spatial skills emerge, and the extent to which these foundational skills predict later math skills after the transition to school, this investigation will help inform future math interventions for young learners.\r\n\r\nThis project is cofunded by NSF's DRK-12 and EDU Core Research (ECR) programs. The ECR program emphasizes fundamental STEM education research that generates foundational knowledge in the field. Investments are made in critical areas that are essential, broad and enduring: STEM learning and STEM learning environments, broadening participation in STEM, and STEM workforce development.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
