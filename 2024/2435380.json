 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Center is jointly supported by NSF Office or International Science and Engineering and Directorate for Biological Sciences, the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council and the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, the National Research Foundation of Korea, and UK Research and Innovation.\r\n\r\nThis project establishes a Global Center focused on advancing the use of macroalgae (seaweed) in the global supply chain. It contributes to a sustainable future by offering new opportunities for economic growth while addressing critical environmental challenges. Sustainable development relies on renewable natural resources to produce goods and services. Macroalgae are highly productive and environmentally friendly. They offer a promising resource for producing fuels, food, and other valuable products. They grow faster than traditional crops, require less water, and provide essential nutrients. Growing macroalgae helps achieving net-zero carbon emission. Despite this remarkable potential, macroalgae are underutilized in industrial and environmental applications. This project harnesses this potential by driving research, innovation, knowledge sharing, and education. By bringing together a global network of experts and stakeholders, the center leverages diverse knowledge.  The aim is to ensure that the sustainable growth and conversion of macroalgae into valuable products is financially viable. Another focus is on ensuring that the associated emerging industries are equitable and beneficial to communities across the supply chain. The project also provides support and training to undergraduate and graduate students and postdoctoral associates at University of California - Berkeley, as well as educational outreach to businesses and consumers for a sustainable macroalgal-based bioeconomy. \r\n\r\nThe center supports research in biodiversity, cultivation, and processing technologies, laying the groundwork for a robust and equitable macroalgae economy. The project establishes the International Bioeconomy Macroalgae Center (IBMC) to advance the macroalgae bioeconomy by addressing key knowledge gaps. The IBMC\u2019s activities will focus on five key areas: 1) Foundational Research in Biodiversity and Genomics: Expanding knowledge of macroalgae species diversity and genetic traits for use in cultivation and conservation; 2) Cultivation and Harvesting: Developing and optimizing techniques for macroalgae cultivation and scaling production; 3) Processing & Conversion: Innovating methods for converting macroalgae into fuels, chemicals, and other products; 4) Circularity and Waste Management: Maximizing the efficient use of macroalgae biomass and minimizing the environmental impact; 5) Supply Chain and Socioeconomic Considerations: Designing and optimizing supply chains for macroalgae-based products and integrating socioeconomic considerations to ensure that the macroalgae bioeconomy is economically viable and socially equitable. Headquartered at UC Berkeley, the IBMC will collaborate with institutions worldwide, integrating diverse expertise to build a sustainable macroalgae industry. The center will seek additional international funding from both the private and public sectors to expand research and foster global collaboration.  The overarching goal is to establish a robust global macroalgae bioeconomy that supports sustainability and economic development.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
