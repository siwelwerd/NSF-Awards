 "awd_abstract_narration": "The NSF CAREER program seeks to nurture PIs with innovative programs in teaching and research who are leaders in their field. The Division of Integrative Organismal Systems (IOS) CAREER awardee conference will provide its CAREER awardees with continued professional development support as they seek to strengthen their existing programs and navigate new challenges and opportunities in mid-career. This two-day conference, to be held near NSF Headquarters at the Westin Old Town Alexandria, Virginia on November 21-22, 2024, will create formal and informal opportunities for interaction among two cohorts of current IOS CAREER awardees. This meeting will create opportunities for participants to share successes and challenges of ongoing CAREER projects and to stimulate discussion of new ideas for research and education, including synergistic research across IOS core programs.\r\n\r\nThe overall goal of the conference is to foster the exchange of ideas. Specific goals include: (1) developing opportunities for collaboration, peer support, and learning among CAREER awardees; (2) discussing new strategies for building and managing a portfolio of NSF projects; (3) increasing awareness of NSF programs and new initiatives; (4) sharing new tools and techniques for research and teaching; and (5) discussing research priorities and nucleating new, cross- disciplinary collaborations. Through these activities, IOS CAREER awardees will benefit from the guidance provided by their peers that will help them maintain and strengthen their research and teaching programs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
