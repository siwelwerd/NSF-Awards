 "awd_abstract_narration": "Measuring the spatial variation of chemical elements in soil, sediment and rock is crucial for understanding life-supporting processes in Earth\u2019s Critical Zone \u2013 a thin near-surface zone where life, soil, water, rock, and air interact. This proposal aims to acquire a \u00b5-XRF instrument to measure and map the spatial distribution of plant-essential nutrients (e.g., P, Ca, K) in modern and fossil soils. This instrument will also aid groundwater, sedimentology and geoarchaeology research by mapping chemical changes in minerals from aquifer sediments, flood and lake deposits, ancient river channels, and prehistoric rock quarries. The \u00b5-XRF instrument at the University of Memphis will be used to train students and researchers residing in the broader mid-South region. This instrument, and the proposed Institute of \u00b5-XRF at the University of Memphis, will create opportunities for students and promote diversity and inclusion through summer programs and visiting research fellows.\r\n \r\nUnderstanding how chemical elements are cycled between different Earth systems, e.g., plants, soil, rock, river and aquifer sediment, is needed to predict system behavior under environmental and climate change scenarios. A common problem in these geochemical studies is resolving spatial changes in chemical elements at the micrometer scale. Nondestructive spatial imaging of geochemistry using a \u00b5-XRF instrument will provide a means to resolve small-scale 2- and 3-dimensional changes in chemical composition. This tool will support soil geomorphology, hydrology, and sedimentology research, providing insights into weathering processes, sediment deposition, and paleoclimate reconstruction. The \u00b5-XRF will foster education and training for students in the economically distressed Delta Regional Authority area, benefiting early career scientists and providing research opportunities for up to 150 students over the next 3-5 years.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
