 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of North Texas ADVANCE Adaptation project, UNT CRECE, will induce positive, sustainable, systemic change for STEM faculty by implementing evidence-based practices that will foster a climate of belonging in UNT's STEM departments. The project will develop a sustainable, data-driven, systemic change model that removes structural barriers and builds equitable workspaces, policies, and support systems. Guided by over a decade of institutional data, CRECE seeks to build inclusive departmental climates, develop institutional strategies for faculty success, and implement data-based decision-making processes. \r\n\r\nToward the first aim of building inclusive departmental climates, this project will implement a chair institute for inclusive excellence and healthy workplace initiative. Strategies for faculty success will be accomplished through holistic and transparent assessment policies and a community of practice built on mentoring and mentor training. Data-based decision-making processes will be achieved through intersectional data-collection founded on equitable practices and department chair data-based decision-making initiative. The project can serve as a model for other research-intensive Hispanic-Serving Institutions.\r\n\r\nThe NSF ADVANCE program is designed to foster gender equity through a focus on the identification and elimination of organizational barriers that impede the full participation and advancement of diverse faculty in academic institutions.\u202fOrganizational barriers that inhibit equity may exist in policies, processes, practices, and the organizational culture and climate. ADVANCE \u201cAdaptation\u201d awards provide support for the adaptation and adoption of evidence-based strategies to academic, non-profit institutions of higher education as well as non-academic, non-profit organizations.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
