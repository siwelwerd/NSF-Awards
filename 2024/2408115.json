 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project enables the acquisition of a state-of-the-art Rigaku SmartLab SE X-ray Diffraction System (XRD) to be housed in the College of Science at Marshall University.  The instrument will expand research capabilities and related educational initiatives across a multitude of disciplines including materials science, chemistry, physics, engineering, geology, forensics, and pharmaceutics.  Research and design of novel materials have expanded dramatically in recent years, and the structural characterization data generated by advanced diffractometer systems lie at the core of emerging materials technologies.  Reflecting that trend, the new XRD system will provide educational opportunities and hands-on training to over 63 graduate students, and 425 undergraduates.  The new system will replace an obsolete GE XRD-6D/vs4 diffractometer installed in the 1970s.  The SmartLab SE system is ideal for bridging the dual research and educational needs of the Marshall University community, as it is highly automated, modular, and multipurpose.  The instrument is suitable for a range of materials and sample types and has the flexibility to be used for both research and education, given its ease of operation and accessibility to both novice and experienced users.\r\n  \r\nThe SmartLab SE XRD instrument represents a quantum leap in structural analysis capabilities at Marshall University.  The system will significantly enhance the university\u2019s research profile, leading to new insights in multiple scientific fields.  Examples specific to this project include advanced research into the development of new materials for ion batteries, the study of polymorphisms in cancer drugs, identification of clay minerals in units of shale, fireclay, and tonstien with significant amounts of rare earth minerals, and the characterization of biomaterials for tissue engineering, among other thrusts.  The instrument\u2019s advanced features will allow for more precise and accurate experimentation, opening doors to innovative research that was previously not feasible utilizing the prior X-ray diffractometer.  From the societal perspective, the instrument will 1) enhance educational objectives through the incorporation of XRD into the curriculum, 2) promote a culture of shared resources by fostering collaboration with other institutions and state agencies, 3) advance STEM outreach to underrepresented groups, recognizing that West Virginia ranks 49th in median household income in the country and Marshall\u2019s undergraduate population includes 48% first-generation college students, and 4)  extend the project\u2019s impacts beyond academia, benefiting local communities, and industries.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
