 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project intends to explore the vitality of research in the field of statistics and consider the future of the discipline. The study will highlight the significance of recent discoveries, the rate of progress at the frontiers of statistics, and emerging trends and fields, as well as address the developments in the realm of deep learning, artificial intelligence, and data science, as well as the statistical questions that motivate this growth. Additionally, the role of statistics in the interactions between mathematics, engineering, and computer science will be examined. The report will also illustrate the importance of statistics in key research domains, such as public health and medicine, and materials science, as well as the impact of research and training in the statistical sciences on science and engineering. This study aims to foster a forward-looking discussion about the state of the statistical sciences and emerging opportunities for the discipline and its stakeholders, including applications relevant to industry and technology, innovation and economic competitiveness, the internet, health and well-being, national security, and other areas of national interest. NSA and NIH also contribute to the study. \r\n\r\nThe National Academies will assemble an interdisciplinary ad hoc committee to produce a forward-looking assessment of the current state of the statistical sciences and emerging opportunities for the discipline and its stakeholders as they look ahead to 2035 and beyond. The study may make recommendations to funding agencies on how to adjust and expand their portfolios of activities and partnerships to understand the evolution of the field and strengthen the impact of the discipline. Specifically, the study will assess: The state of research in the statistical sciences, examining aspects such as the significance of recent developments and highlighting current and emerging trends, challenges, and directions. It will further assess statistical research in allied fields, and interactions between the statistical sciences and the mathematical, computational, engineering, materials science, and related fields such as biostatistics, probability, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and data science. The study will also examine the statistical needs to support scientific and technological advances, including the importance of statistical sciences and the strength of interdisciplinary collaborations. The role of statistical sciences in key research domains for American competitiveness, such as manufacturing, materials science, blockchain, biomedical and biological sciences, public health, medicine, health equity, geosciences, environmental health and science, astronomy, and energy applications. Finally, the study will also assess statistical education, training, and workforce development.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
