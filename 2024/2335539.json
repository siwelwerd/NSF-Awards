 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader/commercial impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is its potential to improve approaches addressing pediatric Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), a condition affecting 10 percent of all U.S. children. The primary challenge families face is accessing psychosocial treatment, a crucial component of comprehensive care. Many families cannot access these interventions due to various barriers including cost, time, and a shortage of mental health professionals. This project introduces a self-guided, family-focused ADHD treatment mobile application complemented by a virtual coach. By addressing caregiver stress, which plays a significant role in treatment outcomes, this innovation offers a scalable, affordable, and effective solution. This initiative aligns with the National Science Foundation's mission to promote scientific progress and support the well-being of the American public, especially during the current youth mental health crisis. The potential commercial and societal impacts of this project include enhancing scientific understanding of ADHD treatment, providing a competitive advantage in the digital health sector, and addressing a significant market opportunity in mental health care. \r\n \r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project utilizes artificial intelligence (AI) and large language models (LLMS) to create a scalable, accessible, and robust caregiver-centered mobile treatment system for pediatric ADHD, complemented by a virtual coach. The innovative aspect lies in merging human-centered design with rules-based conversational AI and an empathetic chatbot, aiming for a lasting, scalable impact on caregivers of children with ADHD. The intent is to broaden access to evidence-based psychosocial interventions, improve adherence to these treatments, and achieve superior outcomes. ADHD, a condition that hinders self-regulation and executive function, affects a significant portion of U.S. children. Despite the known advantages of early intervention, many affected children do not receive optimal care. The project's objectives include the co-design of the app, which incorporates a multi-module psychosocial intervention and caregiver coping techniques; the development of the virtual coach's role with clinician guidance using AI; and a proof-of-concept test involving caregivers. The project will assess feasibility and acceptability, and gather preliminary data on potential improvements in caregiver and child wellbeing.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
