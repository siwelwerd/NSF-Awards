 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent discoveries have suggested that bivalves might hold the secrets to understanding ageing. Like tree rings, bivalves record growth increments in their shells. Today, one of the longest-lived animals on the planet is the clam Arctica islandica, which can live for over 500 years. In addition to this species, over a dozen modern bivalves have been shown to live for over 100 years. While longevity of modern bivalves is well known because of their economic importance, very little is known about the lifespans of fossil bivalves. This work examines lifespans and growth rates of fossil bivalves to understand the phylogenetic (evolutionary relationships) and environmental controls on longevity. This project provides authentic research experiences for students at a Hispanic Serving Institution and creates workshops for current high school teachers and undergraduate students majoring in science education. The project is funded by the Sedimentary Geology and Paleobiology Program and the Biological Oceanography Program.\r\n\r\nLife history data derived from using the tools of sclerochronology can contribute to a better understanding of macroevolutionary processes. However, the field of life history analysis applied to fossil organisms is in its infancy and much work remains to be done. This proposal will unite the fields of sclerochronology and paleobiology and lay the foundation for a new path of research. Using fossil bivalves, the three primary questions are: 1) is lifespan a heritable trait; 2) can body size trends be explained by changes in life history strategy; and 3) do latitudinal life history gradients change in alternate climate settings. The educational component of this project will: 1) modify an Invertebrate Paleontology course into a course-based undergraduate research experience; 2) run workshops for current high school teachers and undergraduate students pursuing teaching degrees; 3) create paid lab assistant positions and support attendance at national conferences for undergraduate students; and 4) increase community and K-12 student access to the Sam Houston Natural History Collections.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
