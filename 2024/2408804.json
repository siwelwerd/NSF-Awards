 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award from the major research instrumentation program supports the acquisition of a multi-scale, integrated imaging capability, ranging from micrometers to nanometers at Grambling State University (GSU). The instrument enables students at GSU to collect and analyze nanometer scale surface images in three-dimensions (3D) to understand how laser plasma ablates surfaces in various environments including liquids. Researchers will explore research to study the effects of microgravity on liver tissues by probing the mechanical properties in nanometer scale, and to obtain understanding of layered magnetic nanoparticles for stronger magnets; as well as to get insights into the distribution of grain and composition in nanocomposites for hypersonic vehicles. The project will help students gain cutting edge expertise and will attract more students into STEM fields. This will enhance the students\u2019 learning in intermediate level physics courses including Optics as they learn the concepts of Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), quantum tunneling of electrons, and more. The on-campus reliable access to the nanoscale imaging capability, especially in liquid environments, will help recruit, retain, and graduate tomorrow\u2019s STEM workforces with interdisciplinary skills.\r\n\r\nThis acquisition of multiscale imaging at Grambling State University (GSU) brings new research capability at this HBCU institution. The current research activities at GSU will be enhanced through data collected by the new instrument. Researchers will be able to study the effects of microgravity on liver tissues, to obtain understanding on layered magnetic nanoparticles for stronger magnets, as well as the distribution of grain and composition in nanocomposites for hypersonic applications. GSU researchers will be able to study liver tissues by probing the mechanical properties of the cells after prolonged exposure (weeks) to simulated microgravity. They will also be able to investigate the physics of confined plasma to understand how the laser ablated materials transform into novel nanoparticles (NPs) and Quantum Dots (QDs) during the Laser Ablation in Liquid (LAL) process. The capability to image surfaces immersed in liquid will eliminates the need to transfer the samples through air, effectively eliminating doubts about potential surface contamination because the target surfaces can be imaged as ablated in the liquid cell of Atomic Force Microscope.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
