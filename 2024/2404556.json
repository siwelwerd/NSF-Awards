 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is a portable device providing focused magnetic field applications for treating cancer using magnetic nanoparticle-based cancer strategies, but in patients with metallic implants (e.g., joint replacements, pacemakers, stents) who are currently ineligible for the treatment due to their peripheral effects. Cancer treatments typically require customized strategies and the appropriate tools for treatment without damaging the surrounding tissues. The proposed innovation aims to provide contactless heating of electrically conductive materials in challenging areas to directly access of the patient, enabling access to a subset of patients for an emerging therapy for cancer treatment who are currently ineligible due to compatibility issues with the form of energy delivery and their peripheral effects. The potential opportunity of the 2 million patients with either pancreatic and prostate cancer who may be contraindicated for existing systems represents a 131MM annual market opportunity.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to advance the development and evaluation of hand-held induction heaters for cancer treatment. The system aims to provide magnetic fluid hyperthermia (MFH), an emerging electromagnetic thermal treatment for treating cancer. The system proposes benefits to current larger and more complex systems with exclusion criteria for patients with metallic implants below their neck due to heating risks.  The objectives are to (a) develop methods to deliver signi\ufb01cant thermal energy to pancreatic and prostate porcine organs in vivo, and (b) characterize and validate the extent and severity of tissue damage using patented, unique, deep technology on swine models. This project will focus on its feasibility as a cancer treatment, to advance the proposed technology from a Technology Readiness Level 4, representing laboratory validation, to Level 6 indicating the technology has been validated in a relevant environment. The Phase 1 results will finalize feasibility assessments for a novel instrument that enables an emerging MFH cancer treatment but for currently contraindicated patients, into clinical practice for human use, at a future stage.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
