 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of a new device that can help broadly advance gene functional studies, crop breeding and the development of novel plant-based products. The technology could produce positive impacts in sectors including agriculture, energy, and environmental science. The improved efficiency of DNA and protein delivery into plant cells can potentially increase the production of genetically modified crops without transgene (foreign gene(s)), providing a product that is much less restricted by federal regulations globally.  The technology could help address food insecurity in addition to energy and environmental challenges by helping produce more and better energy related biocrops.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on the development of a platform that can improve the current biolistic delivery system in terms of efficacy and consistency. The interdisciplinary approach could help build a high-impact technology platform for the field of plant gene editing.  The original biolistic device, gene gun, was designed more than 30 years ago. This technology is a straightforward attachment to the current device, which can alter the flow and trajectory of the particles towards the tissue. By carefully designing the geometry of our device, we can significantly increase the delivery efficacy by optimizing the aerodynamic flow and creating more focused and even pressure on the plant tissue. Our preliminary data has shown > 20x increase in DNA delivery efficiency to onion epidermis cells. In addition, our design can be quickly modified using three-dimensional printing technology to accommodate plant tissues of different species with different geometries. Furthermore, this device has shed light into the poorly understood biolistic system, enabling further research into how the gene gun works could improve understanding of the entire biolistic system.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
