 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides participant support for attendees of the 7th International Conference on Advanced Nanoparticle Generation and Excitation by Lasers in Liquids (ANGEL); Charlottesville, Virginia; 26-31 May 2024. The conference focuses on new research and development activities in laser-based nanoparticle synthesis for applications in clean energy, medicine, and advanced manufacturing. Students, faculty, and researchers from industry present their latest research results on laser-based synthesis of nanoparticles in oral and poster sessions. The conference impacts the advanced manufacturing and broader engineering communities. Priority is given to student and young faculty participants, particularly female participants and those who belong to minority groups underrepresented in science and engineering. This approach promotes diverse participation at the conference, in the short term, and in STEM fields, in the long term. This award benefits the nation through the education of a skilled and diverse manufacturing workforce, which is better prepared to provide transformative solutions to the challenges in their chosen fields. The conference plays an important role in supporting and sustaining the important field of nanoparticles and nanomaterials, which are important components in energy, medicine, microelectronics, and quantum research. This conference is timely because of the increase in global demand for high quality, tunable nanomaterials, and nanoparticles.\r\n\r\nThis participant support is expected to benefit the students' professional, scientific, and technical development. Attendance at the conference gives the students and faculty a broader view of nanoparticle synthesis, its fundamentals, advanced manufacturing, advanced characterization, and applications. The conference is attended by U.S. and international experts and researchers, thus a variety of perspectives are presented and discussed. The conference is an opportunity for participants to showcase their scientific accomplishments, interact with peers and colleagues in academia, government laboratories and industry, and extend their network within the broad materials processing and advanced manufacturing communities. Attendees learn about state-of-the-art research in laser synthesis and processing of colloidal nanoparticles, biomedical applications of laser-nanoparticle interactions, advanced modeling and experimental probing of laser-nanoparticle interactions at the limits of spatial and time resolution, and other emerging topics in the general area of laser-materials interactions in liquids via access to several technical and professional development talks by leading domestic and international speakers. Students and young faculty enhance their communication skills through oral and poster presentations and in-depth discussions of their work with peers in their technical areas. This interactive experience significantly broadens student education, increases their enthusiasm for their research topic, acquaints them with expectations for scientific careers, and exposes them to new approaches for innovative research.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The ANGEL conference is the main research conference in the field of laser synthesis of nanoparticles and nanomaterials in liquids. In 2024, it was the first time the ANGEL conference was held in the United States, providing an opportunity to boost the development of the advanced laser-based nanoparticle synthesis techniques in this country. It was a timely undertaking, as the rapid growth of global demand for nanoparticles with tunable structure and properties has been driving an accelerated development of laser-enabled synthesis of nanoparticles in liquids over the last decade. The conference web site is https://angel-conference.org/</p>\r\n<p>The program of the conference consisted of 12 oral sessions and 2 poster sessions, which included 8 invited, 38 oral, and 34 poster presentations. The conference brought together 92 participants from 14 countries and 4 continents. This number included 42 participants from the Unites States, the largest representation of our country in the history of the conference. To a large extent, the active participation from the United States was enabled by this NSF award, which supported 28 students and young researchers. In the selection of NSF-supported participants, priority was given to student and young faculty at the early stage of their careers, particularly female participants and those who belong to minority groups underrepresented in science and engineering. In particular, 10 out of 28 students and young researchers supported by this award are female. Most of the students supported by NSF also participated in a one-day pre-conference tutorial on the generation of nanoparticles by laser ablation in liquids. The tutorial was conducted by leading experts in the field and included a hands-on component demonstrating, in real time, generation of colloidal nanoparticles by laser ablation. The participation in the ANGEL conference and tutorial has made a strong positive impact on all students and young researchers supported by this NSF award. This impact is evidenced by student testimonials highlighting opportunities for new collaboration and networking, as well as increased enthusiasm for exploring new research directions.</p>\r\n<p>The best oral and poster student presentations, as well as the most notable achievements and creative ideas were recognized by several ANGEL awards, including the Fojtik-Henglein Prize and a newly established Shafeev Award. One of the graduate students supported by this NSF award took the 1st place best student poster presentation award. An informal interaction among the conference participants was facilitated by a half-day-long cultural program that included an excursion to Monticello, the house and plantation of Thomas Jefferson, and a banquet at the Wool Factory at the historic Woolen Mills in Charlottesville. The cultural program was appreciated by the participants, as the majority visited Charlottesville for the first time, and for many it was the first visit to the United States. The dissemination of the results presented at the 7th ANGEL conference was facilitated by publication of two Special/Focused Issues of established journals in fields related to this conference, the Journal of Physical Chemistry C and the Beilstein Journal of Nanotechnology.</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 03/11/2025<br>\nModified by: Leonid&nbsp;Zhigilei</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div
