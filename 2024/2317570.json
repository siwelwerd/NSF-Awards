 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Mathematical Sciences Institutes Diversity Initiative (MSIDI) is a collaboration among US mathematical sciences institutes to increase the participation of underrepresented groups in the mathematical sciences. The member institutes include the American Institute of Mathematics, the Institute for Computational and Experimental Research in Mathematics, the Institute for Pure and Applied Mathematics, the Institute for Mathematical and Statistical Innovation, and the Simons Laufer Mathematical Sciences Institute. In this project MSIDI will organize ten scientific conferences and workshops with the long-term goal of enhancing research capacity in the US by increasing scientific and networking activities for mathematicians from underrepresented groups, increasing opportunities for mentoring and identifying role models for early career researchers from underrepresented groups, and highlighting the successes of mathematical scientists from those groups.\r\n\r\nThe proposed conferences include one Blackwell-Tapia conference, one Infinite Possibilities conference, one LatMath conference, three Modern Math workshops, one workshop on Mathematics on Racial Justice, two Roots of Unity conferences, and one Applied Mathematics skills Improvement for Graduate studies Advancement conference. These conferences are complementary to the core activities of the institutes and are important for the goal of increasing participation in key activities that are integral to a career in the mathematical sciences, as well as in the institutes' core programs. Each conference will be organized by one lead institute in collaboration with all MSIDI member institutes. More information can be found on the MSIDI webpage at https://www.mathinstitutes.org/diversity.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
