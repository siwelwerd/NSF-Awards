 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project enables high-performance and low-cost lithium metal anodes to be used in solid-state batteries. This solid-state battery technology, with fast charge and cycle lifetime, has been demonstrated using a lithium metal foil as the anode. However, lithium metal foil is a major cost driver and, thus, a commercial barrier. This research focuses on the development of pre-lithiation processes for 3-dimensional scaffolding materials to introduce a lithium source to the high-performance anode at a far cheaper cost than that of lithium metal foil. By removing the cost barrier to this solid-state battery platform, this project will enable the technology to expand the number of vehicle market segments that can electrify. This high-performance technology, combined with the underlying solid-state batteries, will address a $1 billion market for fast-charging electric vehicles that is rapidly growing.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this project is to determine the feasibility of using multiple alternative lithium sources in place of thick lithium metal foil in the anode of solid-state batteries.  The research also seeks to develop an understanding of the kinetics and thermodynamics of the lithiation process in the solid-state battery. While high performing, thick lithium metal foil is a challenge to process with roll-to-roll manufacturing. This research and development will focus on methods to include lithium in the anode that are more easily combined with typical manufacturing processes. The team will investigate the fundamental kinetics and thermodynamics of each approach\u2019s lithiation and de-lithiation process during cycling. By identifying alternative lithium sources with comparable kinetics to lithium metal foil, this project will develop a high-performance anode that greatly improves the manufacturability of the solid-state battery cells.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
