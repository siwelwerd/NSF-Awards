 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Incoherent Scatter Radar Community and Research Workshop will be held in San Diego, California, in June 2024. For over 60 years, Incoherent Scatter Radars (ISRs) have provided the geospace community with valuable and unique data about the state of geospace over a vast range of altitudes, geographical locations, and time scales ranging from seconds to full solar cycles. These observations have contributed to significant advances in space science and fundamental plasma physics. The Workshop will facilitate ISR science by generating a report that outlines the state and direction of the ISR community, as well as action items to improve the community and dissemination of ISR associated materials. This workshop will generate research collaborations through research talks (prioritizing students and early-career researchers), discussions on open scientific problems, and by building a cohort of people interested in ISR science.\r\n\r\nThe 2024 workshop will begin developing: (1) a \u201cliving\u201d long-term ISR community vision document, (2) a unified ISR data management plan, (3) an ISR Facility User Guide, (4) a standard ISR textbook, (5) highly qualified personnel development and training, and (6) a regular North American ISR community workshop. The proposing team is diverse, and this workshop had interest from a diverse group of individuals. The workshop also aims to have a strong student presence by overlapping with the student day at the Coupling, Energetics and Dynamics of Atmospheric Regions (CEDAR) Workshop 2024, encouraging students to attend and present at this workshop, and by working with the 2024 CEDAR student reps to have a presence during the CEDAR workshop.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
