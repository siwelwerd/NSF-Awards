 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal involves basic fundamental mathematical research at the intersection of analytic function theory, harmonic analysis, and operator theory. Motivation to study these questions can be found in partial differential equations, which are fundamental to the study of science and engineering. The solution to a partial differential equation is frequently given by an integral operator, a Calderon-Zygmund operator, whose related properties can be used to deduce related properties of these partial differential equations. In general, studying these Calderon-Zygmund operators is challenging and one seeks to study their action on certain spaces of functions, by checking the behavior only on a simpler class of test functions. In analogy, this can be seen as attempting to understand a complicated musical score by simply understanding a simpler finite collection of pure frequencies. The proposed research is based on recent contributions made by the PI, leveraging the skills and knowledge developed through prior National Science Foundation awards. Through this proposal the PI will address open and important questions at the interface of analytic function theory, harmonic analysis, and operator theory.  Resolution of questions in these areas will provide for additional lines of inquiry.  Funds from this award will support a diverse group of graduate students whom the PI advises; helping to increase the national pipeline of well-trained STEM students for careers in academia, government, or industry.\r\n\r\nThe research program of this proposal couples important open questions with the PI's past work.  The general theme will be to use methods around ``testing theorems,'' called ``T1 theorems'' in harmonic analysis or the ``reproducing kernel thesis'' in analytic function theory and operator theory, to study questions that arise in analytic function theory, harmonic analysis, and operator theory.  In particular, applications of the proof strategy of testing theorems will: (1) be used to characterize when Calderon-Zygmund operators are bounded between weighted spaces both for continuous and dyadic variants of these operators; (2) serve as motivation for a class of questions related to operators on the Fock space of analytic functions that are intimately connected to Calderon-Zygmund operators; and, (3) be leveraged to provide a method to study Carleson measures in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces of analytic functions.  Results obtained will open the door to other lines of investigation.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
