 "awd_abstract_narration": "The International School of Cosmic Ray Astrophysics (ISCRA) is a biannual summer school designed to provide an overview of the field to graduate students and young postdoctoral scholars through both lectures and informal discussions with Particle Astrophysics experts.  This is the only regular Particle Astrophysics summer school and it has an excellent history of training future leaders.  This award offsets the total cost per participant and allows around 12 graduate students and young postdocs from the US to attend.  The ISCRA represents a major contribution to the education of these attendees.  Proceedings are also published for broad dissemination.\r\n\r\nThe 23rd ISCRA course will take place in Erice, Italy, from the 20th through the 28th of July 2024.  The theme of the course is \u201cMulti-Messenger Astroparticle Physics\u201d.  Discussions will include neutrino and gravitational wave astronomy, the highest energy particles, acceleration and interactions of high-energy radiation, balloon, satellite, and ground-based measurements, the propagation of high-energy radiation through the galaxy, and future space- or ground-based experiments.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
