 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Improving Undergraduate STEM Education: Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSI Program), the aim of the conference proposed by the University of Puerto Rico at Aguadilla will enhance research funding accessibility for faculty at institutions of higher education in Puerto Rico's western region. The initiative addresses challenges such as limited proposal writing experience, inadequate preparation resources, and lack of professional networks by organizing a comprehensive conference. This conference will provide training, facilitate workshops, and foster collaboration among researchers, thereby increasing federal research proposal submissions and contributing to a more equitable and inclusive research environment in Puerto Rico.\r\n\r\nThe project will pursue three primary objectives: (1) Inform professors, administrative staff, and faculty from universities, community, and technical colleges about National Science Foundation (NSF) funding mechanisms to encourage and increase their participation in research proposal submissions. (2) Conduct an interactive and educational workshop to provide participants with detailed knowledge of NSF Program Directors' roles and functions, best practices for preparing, submitting, and managing successful research proposals, including budget development and financial management, while promoting inclusion, equity, and diversity in research. (3) Promote collaboration and networking among researchers and NSF Program Directors through group work sessions, interactive discussions, and networking opportunities during the conference. Anticipated outcomes include enhanced research capacity, increased proposal submissions, and a more diverse and innovative scientific community in Puerto Rico. The HSI Program aims to enhance undergraduate STEM education and build capacity at HSIs. Projects supported by the HSI Program will also generate new knowledge on how to achieve these aims.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
