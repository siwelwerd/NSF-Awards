 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Marco Lopez is awarded a National Science Foundation Mathematical and Physical Sciences Ascending Postdoctoral Research Fellowship (NSF MPS-Ascend) to conduct a program of research, education, and activities related to broadening participation by groups underrepresented in STEM. This fellowship supports the research project entitled \"Thermodynamic Formalism at CUNY\". The project activities will be conducted at the host institution, CUNY Graduate Center, under the mentorship of Professors Tamara Kucherenko and Christian Wolf.\r\n\r\nThermodynamic formalism extends many of the ideas from statistical physics to dynamical systems with chaotic behavior, which appear in many other branches of science. His research program is concerned with the computability of some dynamical quantities, and with advancing the flexibility program in thermodynamic formalism. In addition to the research program, Dr. Lopez will organize outreach programs for NYC\u2019s large K12 student populations of Spanish-speakers, such as a bilingual tutoring program and the Spanish Math Circles.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
