 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is being granted to the Materials Research Society (MRS) to primarily support travel and participation costs for American university students and young scientists attending the upcoming 12th African Materials Research Society (A-MRS 2024) conference. The conference will take place in Kigali, Rwanda from December 16th to 19th, 2024. Organized by the African Materials Research Society (AMRS) with strong backing from the US-based MRS, the core objective is to advance knowledge and enhance understanding in various fields of materials science and technology, to promote collaboration and progress in materials research, and fosters connections between researchers across the globe. The African-MRS conferences play a crucial role in unifying Africa's materials research community: These conferences bring together Africa's rapidly growing pool of materials researchers but also connecting Africa to global research by bridging the gap between African and international materials research, including the US. A key goal is to create a platform for leading scientists worldwide to interact with their African counterparts, fostering a deeper understanding of the impact of materials on development, the state of materials science in Africa, the research needs and collaboration opportunities. This year's conference will encompass a wide range of materials science topics, including nanotechnology, energy, and advanced materials.\r\n\r\nThe African-MRS conference is spearheaded by the African MRS, Rwandan and African scientists, and backed by the US-based MRS. It acts as a central hub, drawing researchers from across the continent. The conference bridges the gap between basic and applied research, fostering knowledge sharing, collaboration, and activities in the diverse fields of materials science. This year, roughly 500 attendees from Africa and globally are expected. Themes address both global concerns like energy and health, and African-specific needs like construction materials and sustainable biomaterials. Leading international experts will present new research and set future research directions. Highlighting the African MRS's commitment to education and building research capacity, the conference provides a unique platform for US and African students to interact with each other and leaders. This year's broad themes include biomaterials, agriculture, energy, construction, and nanotechnology, with a special session on the African Light Source project. Additionally, pre-conference workshops and sessions focusing on women and girls in science, and entrepreneurship are planned.\r\n\r\nThis project is jointly funded by the Division of Materials Research (DMR), the Division of Chemical Bioengineering, Environmental and Transport Systems (CBET), and the Historically Black Colleges and Universities \u2013 Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) within the Division of Equity for Excellence in STEM (EES). DMR  supports fundamental experimental and theoretical materials research and education. CBET supports innovative research and education in the fields of chemical engineering, biotechnology, bioengineering, and environmental engineering. HBCU-UP provides awards to strengthen STEM undergraduate education and research at HBCUs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
