 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact of this I-Corps project is the development of a patient-centric device that treats xerostomia (dry mouth) by providing moisture to the mouth at a controlled rate through the night. Xerostomia originates from head and neck cancers, Sj\u00f6gren disease, diabetes, medications and other causes. Loss of saliva at night causes serious sleep deprivation, mouth sores, dental decay, and other serious maladies. Drinking wets the mouth in the daytime, but people cannot drink all night. The device is compact, durable, and requires neither an external power source nor extensive maintenance. In the U.S., studies estimated that 19% of the population or 63 million people suffer from xerostomia.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. This solution is based on the development of an over-the-counter device that is applied within the mouth to treat xerostomia (dry mouth). The product is engineered from both traditional and modern computational and experimental physics. It is constructed using Federal Drug Administration approved materials and designed for easy customer use. The device utilizes a novel design that carefully replicates the delivery of moisture to a dry mouth at a rate compatible with the common flow rates of saliva. Preclinical studies demonstrate both the ability to control moisture flow without the use of power and the device viability. Low maintenance, simplicity of use, easy access, and affordability defines the translational potential of this technology.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
