 "awd_abstract_narration": "Manufacturing is pivotal to Wisconsin's economy, exporting $23.3 billion in products and engaging over 15% of the state's workforce in 2022. Wisconsin delivers the highest concentration of experienced manufacturing workers in the U.S., often three to four times higher in critical industry sectors than competing states. Supply Chain Management and Mechatronics are important subsets of manufacturing in Wisconsin. As automation in operations progresses, these fields gain importance, shaping the industry's future. Supply chain management optimizes processes, cutting costs for companies. Mechatronics, on the other hand, drives efficiency and technological advancement by automating engineering systems and mechanical equipment. However, alongside innovation, there's a growing demand for high-quality training to equip the future workforce for success. Integrative learning, allowing students to directly apply classroom knowledge to real-world scenarios, is essential for their education and future endeavors. Chippewa Valley Technical College aims to meet this demand by collaborating with partners to offer comprehensive experiential learning opportunities, facilitating internships, mentorships, and pathways to students. Through curriculum updates, cutting-edge laboratories, software, and summer camps, the college ensures students are equipped with practical skills for their future careers.\r\n\r\nChippewa Valley Technical College, along with Northcentral Technical College, the University of Wisconsin \u2013 Stout, and industry partners will advance the emerging technology fields of Supply Chain Management, Electromechanical Technology, and Mechatronics through the following key activities and associated objectives: 1) Pay for internships for at least 35 students per year. 2) Provide support financial assistance to 100 students per year, which will help meet the following: a) 90% of participants will successfully complete an internship; b) 30% of participants will graduate within three years from 2024-25 to 2026-27; c) Increase the representation of underrepresented students in the program by 15% from 2024-25 to 2026-27. 3) Implement experiential learning activities to enhance engagement, meeting the following measurements: a) 100% of participants will attend at least six events and social gatherings each semester of the project (virtual or in-person); b) 100% of participants will meet at least once each term with their advisor to discuss education plans and career goals; c) 80% of participants surveyed will indicate cohort and experiential learning activities were beneficial; d) 80% of participants will interact with industry professionals in the field; e) 80% of participants will meet with an assigned peer mentor. 4) Provide 40 high school students per year STEM camp experiences. 5) Educate 100% of students on career pathway opportunities within programs. 6) Modify CVTC\u2019s Supply Chain Management curriculum to incorporate SAP University Alliance software into at least two courses, which allows students to run real-world and industry relevant simulations for managing supply chains in manufacturing. 7) Integrate at least two Supply Chain Management courses into CVTC Launch, which offers free classes designed to help adults who may have faced obstacles in education but are ready to move forward and transition to college classes. 8) Educate 100% of cohort students on cybersecurity and how it can be integrated across the supply chain and manufacturing systems.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
