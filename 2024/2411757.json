 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal seeks funding to support student and early-career participation in the  52nd Arctic Workshop (AW) at the University of Massachusetts Amherst,  scheduled for March 13-16, 2024. Over the last half-century, the AW has established itself as a prominent scientific forum, attracting  arctic researchers from diverse disciplines and career stages to share  and discuss their findings. Through presentations, posters, and discussions, the workshop offers an opportunity for students to learn from one another and from world-class arctic researchers.  Additionally, for  many of these students, the workshop will serve as a platform for developing the essential relationships necessary for launching arctic research careers of their own.\r\n\r\nThe Earth and its oceans are experiencing warming due to the rise in greenhouse gases, but polar regions have undergone warming at rates four times faster than the global average. This proposal seeks funding to support student and early career participants in the 52nd Arctic Workshop (AW) at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, scheduled for March 13-16, 2024. Established over half a century ago, the AW has evolved into a prominent scientific forum, attracting researchers from diverse disciplines and career stages  to share and discuss their findings. Originally focused on Quaternary history and paleoenvironmental research, the workshop now encompasses a broad range of topics, including contemporary climate modeling, arctic hydrology and limnology, atmospheric processes, ecology, oceanography, and glaciology. Financial assistance provided through this proposal will enable graduate students, post-doctoral researchers, and early career scientists to attend the AW by covering accommodation, registration fees, and offering a modest contribution to per diem expenses. This support will facilitate their active participation in the workshop, fostering interdisciplinary collaboration and knowledge exchange among the next generation of polar researchers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

We seek answers to the polar science of change, i.e., what happened there in the past, what is happening today, and what forecasts and models say about our future and its impact on the lower latitudes. Afterall, what happens in the Arctic, does not stay in the Arctic!</p>\r\n<p class=\"lead\">The first Arctic Workshop in 1970 was the brainchild of Prof. John T. Andrews (University of Colorado-Boulder), whose idea was that students could get experience in presenting their work, obtain positive feedback and guidance from more experienced investigators, broaden their perspectives across other disciplines, gain momentum in their research, and perhaps encounter new career opportunities. Subsequent meetings over nearly 52 years has retained this emphasis while simultaneously expanding the contributions of professional researchers. It has proven to be an excellent forum for the enhancement and improvement of scientific, engineering, and educational activities in all aspects of research in the Arctic, including indigenous perspectives. Its particular focus on graduate and early career participants is unique and distinguishes it from other, large somewhat impersonal science meetings.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The theme for the 2024 meeting was \"The Legacy of Arctic Change: Looking Back but Thinking Forward\". Afterall, the polar regions are undergoing rapid change, a transformation that can only be informed from our understanding of the climate system based on studies of the past, contemporary observations, and modeling of the future.</p>\r\n<p>This grant supported the registration and hotel accommodations for 20 graduate students to attend the 52nd Arctic Workshop at UMass-Amherst. The meeting was extremely successful with roughly 100 participants who submitted 83 abstracts on their Arctic research.&nbsp; Presentations were split over 3 days (Thursday, Friday, and half of Saturday) into 9 sessions for public oral presentations, 15 mins in length, and 2 long poster sessions. The full program with people from seven countries included 42 talks, and 41 posters presented. Visitors to the US included scientists from Poland, UK, Switzerland, Canada, Iceland, and Germany. &nbsp;The full abstract and program volume is now publicly available at the NSF Arctic Data Center.
