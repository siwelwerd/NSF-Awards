 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMP) this STEM Pathways and Research Alliance (SPRA) from the lead institution at Sacramento State, the California State University (CSU) LSAMP is a coordinated and comprehensive program dedicated to broadening participation in STEM at all 23 campuses of the CSU system. Since its inception in 1993, CSU-LSAMP has served close to 30,000 CSU students where 83% are from racial and ethnic groups historically underrepresented in STEM. By engaging approximately 2,000 participants annually, CSU-LSAMP will continue to have a significant impact on increasing overall STEM student persistence and the number of STEM degrees awarded to underrepresented students. CSU-LSAMP has already illustrated increased rates of graduation and completion of STEM graduate degrees for LSAMP students who participated in undergraduate research experiences. Moving forward, CSU-LSAMP will leverage its large size, varied institutions, and coordinated structure to produce new knowledge on the impact of inclusive mentoring practices on the academic success of undergraduate researchers.\r\n\r\nThe specific aims of the project are to: (1) increase the number of students who face economic, educational, and social barriers in careers in STEM earning undergraduate and graduate STEM degrees; (2) contribute new knowledge about the impacts of mentoring practices that emphasize cultural awareness on the academic persistence and career choices of undergraduate STEM researchers from minoritized populations; and (3) create a plan of institutionalization and sustainability that supports the academic retention and success of STEM students across the CSU system. By conducting a mixed-methods study using a purposive sampling strategy to survey LSAMP student researchers and their faculty mentors across the 23 CSU campuses, CSU-LSAMP will produce scholarly works focused on understanding the role research mentor training and practices, including attention to cultural diversity, play in influencing the academic success and career decisions of undergraduate STEM researchers. Results of the study will be broadly disseminated to the national LSAMP, and academic research communities to ensure the replication of successful undergraduate inclusive mentoring practices as an intervention model that increases student access to, and success in admissions to STEM graduate programs. The LSAMP program takes a comprehensive approach to student development and retention. Particular emphasis is placed on transforming undergraduate STEM education through innovative, evidence-based recruitment and retention strategies, and relevant educational experiences in support of racial and ethnic groups historically underrepresented in STEM disciplines. Therefore, the project will contribute significantly the broadening participation in academe and science research.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
