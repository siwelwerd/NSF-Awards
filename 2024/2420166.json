 "awd_abstract_narration": "The award will support a conference, ``The Mordell conjecture 100 years later'', at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology during the week July 8-12, 2024.  The conference website, showing the list of invited speakers, is https://mordell.org/ .  The Mordell conjecture, proved in 1983, is one of the landmarks of modern number theory.  A conference on this topic is needed now, because in recent years, there have been advances on different aspects of the conjecture, while other key questions remain unsolved.  This would be the first conference to bring together all the researchers coming from these different perspectives.  The conference will feature 16 hour-long lectures, with speakers ranging from the original experts to younger mathematicians at the forefront of current research.  Some lectures will feature surveys of the field, which have educational value especially for the next generation of researchers.  The conference will also feature a problem session and many 5-minute lightning talk slots, which will give junior participants an opportunity to showcase their own research on a wide variety of relevant topics.  The award will support the travel and lodging of a variety of mathematicians including those from underrepresented groups in mathematics and attendees from colleges and universities where other sources of funding are unavailable.  Materials from the lectures, problem session, and lightning talks will be made publicly available on the website, to reach an audience broader than just conference attendees.\r\n\r\nThe Mordell conjecture motivated much of the development of arithmetic geometry in the 20th century, both before and after its resolution by Faltings.  The conference will feature lectures covering a broad range of topics connected with the Mordell conjecture, its generalizations, and other work it has inspired.  In particular, it will build on recent advances in the following directions: 1) nonabelian analogues of Chabauty's p-adic method; 2) the recent proof via p-adic Hodge theory; 3) uniform bounds on the number of rational points; 4) generalizations to higher-dimensional varieties, studied by various methods: analytic, cohomological, and computational.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThe award supported the conference \"The Mordell conjecture 100 years later\" at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology during the week July 8-12, 2024. Specifically it provided lodging and travel support for 25 student and early-career participants and 5 speakers from who were women or from underrepresented groups.\n\nIntellectual merit: The Mordell conjecture, posed in 1922, was one of the most famous conjectures of the 20th century until it was proved by Gerd Faltings in 1983. His proof left many open questions, however. For instance, it was and is still not known whether it is possible for a computer to determine all the rational number solutions to an equation in two variables. Also, there are generalizations in several directions that have not yet been proved. Several groups of researchers made progress towards answering these questions in recent years, and the present conference was the first to bring them together to share their knowledge with each other and with the next generation of mathematicians. The lecturers included senior experts such as Gerd Faltings himself, as well as some of the strongest young number theorists worldwide in the area making current advances. They came from five continents.\n\nBroader impacts: Early during the conference, in addition to the main lectures, we had 28 young mathematicians give 5-minute \"lightning\" talks. This served several purposes: it gave them speaking practice, it enabled them to showcase their research to the entire group of participants, and it integrated them into the community by encouraging discussions between them and senior participants whom they might not otherwise have felt comfortable introducing themselves to.\n Several of the lectures, such as those by Gerd Faltings himself and by Umberto Zannier, gave historical surveys of aspects of the Mordell conjecture, which were eye-opening for many of the younger participants.\n Finally, all the lecturers who delivered slide presentations shared their slides, which are now posted at the conference website https://mordell.org so that even researchers who were unable to attend the conference can benefit from it.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/10/2025\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: BjornMPoonen\n"
