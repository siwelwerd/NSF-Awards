 "awd_abstract_narration": "Gamma ray telescopes explore the Universe at the highest energies, offering a stunning view of cosmic phenomena that occur only under extreme physical conditions.  Ground-based observatories such as VERITAS in southern Arizona and the upcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory are uniquely able to make detailed and sensitive observations of high-energy gamma-ray sources.  This project focuses on the physics of active galaxies, cosmology, the study of blazar jets, counterparts of neutrinos detected by the IceCube Neutrino Observatory, and exploring very high energy Galactic accelerators.  This award introduces undergraduate students to frontier research, trains graduate students and early-career postdoctoral scientists, and thus helps to create next-generation scientific leaders.\r\n\r\nThe Barnard group will operate, and observe with, VERITAS, an imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescope facility sensitive to gamma rays at energies above a hundred billion electron-volts.  Research topics include the nature of PeVatron candidates and pulsar wind nebulae in the Galaxy.  The group uses data from LHAASO, HAWC, VERITAS, Fermi-LAT, and X-ray satellites.  Students and other junior researchers will carry out frontier research in particle astrophysics with a state-of-the art high-energy astrophysical facility.  Group members are actively engaged in mentoring activities focused on underrepresented students\r\n\r\nThis project advances the objectives of \"Windows on the Universe: the Era of Multi-Messenger Astrophysics\", one of the 10 Big Ideas for Future NSF Investments.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
