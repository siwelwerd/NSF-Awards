 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides funding for travel expenses for a diverse group of researchers from institutions in the United States to participate in the 11th International Conference on Inverse Problems in Engineering (ICIPE) which will be held in Rio, Brazil, June 23-28, 2024. Held every three years, ICIPE is the largest gathering of experts in inverse problems in engineering from all around the world and ICIPE 2024 is a distinctive opportunity for exchanging research findings and new ideas in this interdisciplinary area of study. \r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this project is providing the opportunity to encourage a diverse group of US researchers, especially those from under-represented groups and early-career researchers, to attend this significant week-long conference. The US delegation will expand its network with leading researchers from other countries, will learn about their cutting-edge research, and explore potential collaboration opportunities in new areas including emerging approaches such as machine learning and artificial intelligence. To further disseminate knowledge gained through their experiences, representatives from the US delegation will present a panel/special session at a future ASME conference in the US.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
