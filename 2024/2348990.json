 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mote Marine Laboratory (MML) will host a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program for undergraduate students interested in Ocean Sciences. The program will take place at MML\u2019s main campus in Sarasota, FL and will provide a 10-week summer research experience to 10 undergraduate students each summer. REU participants will be housed nearby and will conduct independent research projects under the guidance of a mentor.  Research projects focus on many areas within marine science, with an emphasis on restoring ocean health for future generations. During this internship, students will gain valuable experience in developing research skillsets and in scientific communication. Students will prepare a research proposal, conduct a research project, and report their findings in a scientific poster presentation. Professional development is provided in the areas of writing grants, preparing oral and poster presentations, understanding regulations and protocols related to using vertebrate animals in research, using Excel spreadsheets, resume building, and preparing to pursue graduate studies. The MML REU program is designed to advance discovery in estuarine and coastal sciences while simultaneously promoting education and career development of future ocean science professionals. This is accomplished by providing students with direct, \u2018hands-on\u2019 research experiences in diverse ocean science topics and developing meaningful relationships between students and ocean science professionals.\r\n\r\nMote Marine Laboratory REU students are paired with MML researchers from twenty-five programs and conduct mentored research projects on one of several major threats to coastal habitats: aquatic pollution, ocean acidification, natural toxins, habitat alteration, coral reef decline, new and emerging marine diseases, deteriorating water quality, and impacts of overfishing on fisheries ecology. They also conduct research projects related to sea turtle and marine mammal biology, and novel products derived from the sea. Students are exposed to a broader range of topics in coastal and estuarine sciences by attending research seminars presented by Mote scientific staff, visiting scientists, and Mote NSF REU Program alumni. Participants are encouraged to present research findings in peer-reviewed literature and/or at professional conferences as appropriate.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
