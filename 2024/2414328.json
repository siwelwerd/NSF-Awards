 "awd_abstract_narration": "This travel grant will provide opportunities to students for attending the fifteenth Annual Power and Energy Conference at Illinois (PECI) that will take place on the campus of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in April 2024. The student program of this conference will include paper presentations, tutorial sessions, and panel discussions. Networking events between students and power system researchers from industry and government laboratories are also planned. Special efforts will be made to encourage the participation of women and minority students.\r\n\r\nPECI is the oldest annual, student-run IEEE international conference about power and energy technology. The conference is organized by the IEEE PES/PELS/IAS Joint Graduate Student Chapter at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and has become a perfect place in the Midwest for industry and academic researchers to discuss future power and energy topics such as renewable energy, electrified transportation, smart grid reliability, security of cyber-physical systems, and power electronics for emerging technologies. Attendees will get ample opportunities to present their research, and also learn about each other's work to have a broad perspective on ongoing topics in energy systems research.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
