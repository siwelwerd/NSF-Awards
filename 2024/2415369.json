 "awd_abstract_narration": "Despite the interconnected nature of the world, traditional science disciplines, such as physics and biology, are often presented in isolation. Through a partnership between Aztec dancers and Western trained scientists, this partnership project seeks to bridge multiple knowledge systems to co-design and develop a clear pathway for Western and Indigenous knowledge to inform and generate new approaches to informal science education. Partnership activities are intentionally designed to support the effective integration of varied epistemologies, lived experiences, and perspectives by using a systems science approach. The project task force will facilitate the development of the partnership through a multi-day retreat, community dinners, and community-driven place-based experiences. \r\n\r\nPartner collaboration will focus on the question, \u201cHow can multiple knowledge systems be considered to inform and transform community-driven, land-based science learning?\u201d Project evaluation will document this science learning process and its outcomes to: (1) understand how this approach can strengthen change and strengthen a sense of belonging in STEM; and (2) identify the ways in which multiple knowledge systems and interconnections between knowledges and place/land emerge. The knowledge and partnership practices developed through this initiative will lay the foundation for expanding the partnership, generating new partnerships, and developing innovative, place-based informal STEM projects. The partnership will share knowledge and resources developed by the project via a blog, publications, and conference sessions.\r\n\r\nThis Partnership Development and Planning project is funded by the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program, which seeks to advance new approaches to, and evidence-based understanding of, the design and development of STEM learning in informal environments. This includes providing multiple pathways for broadening access to and engagement in STEM learning experiences.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
