 "awd_abstract_narration": "The International Union of Forest Research Organizations (IUFRO) provides a worldwide platform for collaborative research efforts on a voluntary basis. Established in 1892, IUFRO is a global, non-profit, non-governmental organization headquartered in Vienna, Austria. With a commitment to inclusivity, IUFRO brings together approximately 630 member organizations spanning over 115 countries, collectively representing a community of more than 15,000 scientists. First convened in 1986, the IUFRO Tree Biotech conference is a biennial international gathering dedicated to showcasing cutting-edge advancements and breakthroughs in the realm of forest biotechnology. This year, the conference will be held August 5-8, 2024 (Annapolis, MD) and is expected to draw over 250 researchers, students, and industry professionals participants, representing diverse nations worldwide. \r\n\r\nThe IUFRO Tree Biotech conferences are designed to promote extensive interaction among attendees, featuring single-session programming without concurrent sessions to allow ample social and scientific networking opportunities. This year, sessions cover broad topics in relevant plant biology research and include tree genomics and genetics, multi-omics research, tree engineering and breeding, adaptation of trees to combat the challenges posed by global climate change, diverse applications of bioengineering across tree species, and considerations pertaining to the regulation and biosafety of genome-engineered trees. NSF funds will be used to support the participation of under-represented students and researchers to help foster an inclusive and supportive environment, ensuring an engaging experience for all conference participants.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
