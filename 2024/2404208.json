 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the support of the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry program in the Division of Chemistry, Professor Robert J. Gilliard of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology is developing novel synthetic protocols for the design and synthesis of boron-doped nanographenes.  Graphene is an allotrope of carbon consisting of a single sheet of atoms arranged in a hexagonal lattice nanostructure resembling that of a honeycomb.  Graphene can become conductive when external voltage is applied (like in transistors) or light shines on them (like in photovoltaic cells). As such, it is a very useful material for potential use in solar cells, LED screens and other applications that utilize the conversion of electricity to light and vice versa.  In this project, smaller aromatic compounds containing the chemical element boron will first be designed and synthesized.  These compounds will then be utilized as templates for the preparation of boron-doped nanographenes.  A strong emphasis will be placed on the characterization and studies of supramolecular assemblies in these unique materials.  The research efforts will provide valuable training to undergraduate and graduate students, particularly underrepresented minorities and first-generation students.  As a part of the broader impact component, Professor Gilliard and his team will build ChemRise program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, a program that will seek to recruit, retain, and provide professional development opportunities to scholars from groups that are traditionally underrepresented in chemistry.\r\n\r\nThis project will focus on the design, synthesis, and characterization of boron-doped nanographenes, providing advances in knowledge concerning the strategic placement of electron-deficient dopants in complex pi-extended conjugated networks.  The overall strategy centers on two research thrusts: (1) using boron-doped acenes as templates for the synthesis of boron-doped nanographenes and 2) the employment of coordination chemistry, self-assembly, and surface chemistry to control the properties of boron-doped nanographenes. Synthetic methodology will focus on using electron-rich moieties to promote the Scholl reaction or other oxidative cyclodehydrogenation methods in boron-containing polyaromatic hydrocarbon precursors.  This research has the potential to provide valuable information for the development of the next generation of boron-doped heterocycles with applications in spintronics and optoelectronics.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
