 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the strategic national interests of the United States by training a highly skilled domestic workforce to meet the current and future technological needs of the semiconductor industry. As delineated by the 2022 Chips act, building and sustaining a skilled and diverse workforce is critical to America\u2019s leadership in semiconductors. The University of Utah through a partnership between academia and industry aims therefore to develop and deploy a hands-on semiconductor training program \u201cSemiconductor Manufacturing Program\u201d breaking the accessibility barrier to expensive manufacturing training facilities for broader communities including ones with limited resources. The project ultimately will bridge the skills gap and enhance employability by providing hands-on experiences in state-of-the-art facilities.\r\n \r\nThe program emphasizes diversity and equitable access to training opportunities through a pilot partnership. Through a cohort-based training model, the program will equip participants with the knowledge and skills vital for semiconductor manufacturing, fostering employment in the industrial sector. The instructional approach incorporates three key components: a customized curriculum focused on semiconductor manufacturing and characterization, hands-on experiential learning, and interaction with industry. Theoretical learning is aided by virtual tools and complemented by hands-on experiences. Collaboration between industry and academia constitutes the backbone of the program, ensuring alignment with industry needs and trends. Continuous monitoring of student and employer outcomes will inform program adjustments, with dissemination of lessons learned enriching semiconductor education not only nationally but also globally. Ultimately, this program strives to cultivate a job-ready workforce while contributing to the collective advancement of semiconductor education.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
