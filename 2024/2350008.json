 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports two iterations of the Women+ and Mathematics (W+AM) Program at the Institute for Advanced Study (IAS). The program was created in 1994 with the support of the National Science Foundation, the Institute for Advanced Study, and Princeton University. The overarching mission of W+AM is to recruit and retain more women in mathematics in order to counter the initial imbalance in the numbers of men and women entering mathematics training as well as the higher attrition rate of female mathematicians compared to their male counterparts at every critical transition stage in mathematical careers. The most concentrated part of the W+AM program is the week-long annual program in May, which is organized around a mathematical topic of current research interest. For each of the upcoming two programs, there will be approximately 32 participants, ranging from undergraduates to postdoctoral scholars, in addition to senior mathematicians, such as lecturers and seminar speakers, who will spend a week as part of the IAS mathematical community surrounded by other mathematicians, many in nearby research areas. \r\n\r\nIn May 2024, the program will be on \"Symmetry and Arithmetic,\" and the two lecture series will be \"A glimpse into the Langlands program\" by Ana Caraiani of Imperial College London and \"Deligne-Lusztig theory: examples and applications\" by Charlotte Chan of the University of Michigan. The 2025 program will be in the area of algebraic and geometric combinatorics. In addition to the two lecture courses, the scientific program is rounded out by problem sessions for each course led by postdoctoral scholars, research seminars, and colloquia. There are also panel discussions and other meta-mathematical and social activities arranged for and by the participants. More information is available at the program webpage https://www.ias.edu/math/wam.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
