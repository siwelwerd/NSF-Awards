 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funding for three years for an annual workshop, to be held in the spring, on dynamical systems and related topics. The workshop will take place on the campus of the University of Maryland at College Park. The event provides a forum for both early career and established researchers to exchange ideas with each other and with their counterparts from around the world. Conference proceedings will be produced at the conclusion of each workshop; these publications will help early career mathematicians to gain familiarity with the presented material. Funding from the award will be prioritized for the reimbursement of travel expenses incurred by junior participants and participants without access to other sources of support.\r\n\r\nThe goals of this workshop are to promote the dissemination of mathematical results; to facilitate interaction and research progress in dynamical systems and related fields; to nurture the sense of community and common mission in these fields; to promote the participation and visibility of women and under-represented groups in the field; and to contribute to the training of graduate students and recent Ph.D. recipients and to their integration into the dynamics community. Talks at the conference come from widely varying areas of dynamical systems, as well as related areas such as analysis, geometry, and topology. At the same time, each instance of the conference incorporates a particular thematic focus within the overall field of dynamical systems. Special effort will be taken to promote the involvement of early career researchers and individuals from groups under-represented in mathematics research. For instance, graduate students and postdocs in attendance at the conference will be invited to contribute to the creation of a post-conference booklet based on notes of the lectures, which will be made available on the conference\u2019s website. (https://www-math.umd.edu/dynamics-conference.html)\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
