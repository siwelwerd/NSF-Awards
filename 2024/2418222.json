 "awd_abstract_narration": "This EArly-concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) project conceives and studies a novel chemical process for cleaning organic contaminants in Water Resource Recovery Facilities (WRRFs), while simultaneously generating methanol which can be used to remove nitrogen-containing pollutants in the same facility.  Typical organic pollutants include disinfection byproducts, pharmaceutical and personal care products, and persistent organic chemicals.  The project is a collaborative effort led by Elizabeth City State University (an HBCU institution) and Old Dominion University.   The project utilizes biocatalytic enzymes to oxidize organic contaminants to carbon dioxide (CO2) in an electrochemical environment.  The produced CO2 is further reacted electro-biocatalytically to methanol which can be used on-site for wastewater denitrification.  Electrical energy needed for the overall process can potentially be supplied by sustainable electricity, thus enabling an overall clean energy process for wastewater remediation.  The process design is conceptual at present.  In keeping with the \u201chigh risk, high reward\u201d goal of EAGER projects, the project will generate data that will be used to assess the transformational potential of the process.  Beyond the technical aspects, the project includes a broad slate of initiatives associated with building research capability across both institutions while providing educational and outreach opportunities to the large populations of underrepresented minority and economically disadvantaged high-school students in neighboring counties.\r\n   \r\nThe project targets a unique integrated stackable proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzer design that accomplishes multiple tasks: 1) using redox enzymes immobilized into carbon nanofibers (CNFs) to oxidize dissolved organic compounds of wastewater into CO2 at the anode, 2) subsequently converting the CO2 to methanol at the cathode, and 3) evaluating the electrolyzer design consisting of an activated PEM sandwiched between nanofiber-immobilized hydrogenase and carbonic anhydrase enzymes serving as the respective anode and cathode.  From a broader impact perspective, the project\u2019s rooting in electrochemistry opens the door to significant reduction in CO2 emissions associated with current wastewater treatment processes that still rely chiefly on fossil-fuel derived energy, while also avoiding CO2 emissions associated with current Advanced Oxidation Process (AOP) water treatment technologies.  Both institutions have strong outreach programs to high-school students that will be integrated into the project to engage students early-on in STEM areas related to renewable/sustainable energy and environmentally based chemical processes.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
