 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is focused on the development of an innovative 3D printed metal mold that works with industry standard concrete block production machinery to mass produce dry-cast, nature-based, concrete reef restoration substrate units. These modular units will be suitable for use for shoreline protection and ecosystem restoration along estuaries, rivers and vulnerable coastlines. Offshore, these units will provide the US offshore wind industry with the means to restore the seabed, while protecting cables, creating sanctuary reefs, increasing biodiversity, and improving water quality. Produced by existing concrete block manufacturers in coastal locations, or on-site, using the novel metal molds, the substrates, located in the inter-tidal zone attract and protect embryonic shellfish including oysters, mussels and clams, and a multitude of other aquatic organisms including crabs, fish, and submerged aquatic vegetation. In deep water, the same substrate units attract abundant cold-water corals and sponges. Working with nature, these units can help protect coastal communities from the impact of climate change, storm surge, rising water levels, and erosion \u2014 creating jobs in concrete fabrication, restoring wetlands, reviving fisheries and commercial aquaculture, and increasing revenues from tourism \u2014 with reefs teeming with life. \r\n\r\nThis SBIR Phase 1 project encompasses the design and fabrication of an intricate 3-D printed steel mold suitable for the production of dry pressed, biophilic concrete, modular shoreline protection and aquatic ecosystem restoration units. This project addresses considerations of ecological impacts, technical constraints in the concrete industry and both offshore and coastal infrastructure construction practices. Additive metal manufacturing will be used to fabricate the mold. Biomimetics, learning from the reef-building capacities of oysters, corals and other calcitic organisms, will inform the geometrically complex surfaces of the dry-cast, calcium carbonate rich, modular unit produced by the mold.  The cast will resemble the benthic topography of a reef, providing a stable substrate for larvae that supports their growth from spat to maturity, providing protection from predators. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations will be used to examine water flow within and around the larval settlement surfaces. The unit will include fissures, cavities, cracks and crevices, dimples, linear channels, and large and small holes to provide a variety of interstitial spaces at multiple scales (micro and macro) that sustain multi-species cooperation in a diverse aquatic ecosystem.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
