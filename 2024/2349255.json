 "awd_abstract_narration": "This REU Site award to the University of Colorado-Denver Anschutz Medical Campus and the Metropolitan State University of Denver, located in Denver and Aurora, CO, will support the training of 10 students for 10 weeks during the summers of 2024- 2026. It is anticipated that a total of 30 students, primarily from schools with limited research opportunities or from an under-represented group, will be trained in the program. Students will learn how research is conducted, and many will present the results of their work at scientific conferences. A multi-faceted assessment of the program will evaluate skill acquisition, longitudinal tracking of career paths, and review of faculty participants through an online tool. The NSF ETAP system will be used to recruit participants.\r\n\r\nThe REU Site in RNA and Genome Biology (REU-RGB) will provide a spectrum of research experiences across two campuses, including many departments. Research projects will include Transcriptional Regulation, Genome Replication, Post-transcriptional Regulatory Dynamics, Translational Programming, RNA Editing, Viral RNA Structure Function, and Noncoding RNA. Students will design and execute a research project, present in multiple forums, and train in research ethics/responsible conduct. Applicants will apply to the program through a national search using an online application asking for reference letters, transcripts, and statements demonstrating specific enthusiasm for the scientific enterprise. Holistic review of applications will lead to selection by faculty/senior trainee committee. All participants will be equipped with RNA/genome-specific bioscience skills training to enhance their performance in the REU Site program and beyond. REU-RGB will couple dynamic research experiences with multi-pronged career development and science communication. This holistic training approach will propel REU-RGB scholars toward career steps, including pursuing a Ph.D. in biological sciences while fostering an inclusive community.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
