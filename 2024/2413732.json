 "awd_abstract_narration": "Arctic sea ice is a key component of the global climate system and a major indicator of ongoing climate change, and consequently there is an appreciable increase in research activity related to sea ice in the Arctic regions. To understand Earth\u2019s changing climate, scientists have engaged with traditional knowledge of Arctic Indigenous peoples through various participatory methods, including co-production of knowledge (CPK). However, Indigenous knowledge has often been treated merely as data to inform environmental decision-making, with Indigenous knowledge holders excluded or not equally involved in the decision-making process. The application of the CPK approach in the context of Arctic research has emerged relatively recently. Prior studies in the Arctic may incorporate co-production principles, yet  might not have explicitly been identified as CPK. The project takes an empirical approach to understanding the underlying dimensions of CPK in practice with the goal of unveiling which factors are employed, how, and when through three different approaches and analyses. The first will be a review of existing literature on sea ice knowledge co-production to explore common themes, types of participatory research, key entities and networks. Second, the team will conduct a place-based study in Gambell, Alaska, involving interviews with community members about their experiences collaborating with scientists, the value and importance of research outputs, and how they envision more equitable CPK processes. Third, we will interview project leaders identified through community interviews to discuss their engagement with the community, the strategies implemented, and the challenges they encountered. Community research leads will actively engage in interviews, analysis, and authorship embracing a CPK approach to the project. The intellectual merit of the project includes a community-centered understanding of CPK practice on the ground, which has potential to transform CPK approaches in the Arctic and beyond.  \r\n\r\nThis project, informed by social and environmental sciences, aims to advance understanding of co-production of knowledge processes related to sea ice. The results of this study can inform policy making by providing evidence-based recommendations for inclusive and participatory research practices. The project advances an empirical approach with potential to steer future research toward ethical, anticolonial CPK methodologies. The connection to sea ice knowledge offers a unique aspect by analyzing how CPK projects advanced understanding through the integration of Western and Indigenous science. While multiple results dissemination routes are plausible, the final selection will be reached through a collaborative decision-making process with the community. This could include a diverse array of channels, including pamphlets, booklets, posters, Facebook, school presentations, and more to disseminate information. With the community\u2019s consent, the project will share the findings with academic institutions, policy makers, and other relevant organizations to promote broader understanding and application of co-production processes. Concurrently, the project will partner with community research leads to co-author publications amplifying community voice in the peer-reviewed literature. Ultimately, this project aims to contribute to a more nuanced understanding of co-production of knowledge, with implications for enhancing collaborative, equitable research and policy across various contexts.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
