 "awd_abstract_narration": "Past hybridization among closely related species can leave traces of genetic variation from endangered or even extinct species in the DNA of present-day animals. This phenomenon, known as ghost introgression, is often overlooked but is a reservoir of preserved genetic variation from endangered or extinct species found in present-day genomes of the related common species. These hidden reservoirs could be essential for conserving adaptive potential in the future. This project re-envisions the conservation value of ghost introgression and how it can be leveraged to support endangered species recovery. The project will characterize the ecology and population dynamics of Gulf Coast canids that carry varying amounts of red wolf ghost ancestry in their coyote genomes and inhabit a broad geographic range. First it will develop a non-invasive genetic tool to monitor and assess the ecological conditions that promote the persistence of red wolf ghost ancestry. Further, the tool will be used to identify individuals of high conservation value, as measured by their degree of unique red wolf ghost ancestry and thus have the greatest potential to resuscitate endangered red wolf ghost genetic variation. The conservation partner, the Endangered Wolf Center, will then implement a short-term breeding experiment to enhance ghost ancestry based on a careful pairing design in a captive breeding facility. The project integrates information and efforts across communities and organizations to pioneer new options for endangered species recovery programs in the future. The project will also involve public outreach and education, and engagement with managers with a focus on resolving human wildlife conflicts and conservation of key predators.\r\n\r\nCanids along the American Gulf Coast carry signatures of red wolf ghost introgression, yet little is known about the factors that support the persistence of such. The project will combine in- and ex-situ studies and develop a framework for evidence-based conservation in a natural landscape using population ecology and empirical genomics. First, canids will be captured, genetically sampled, and radio-monitored across a gradient of mortality risk and available resources to quantify the functional linkage between ghost introgression and ecology. Morphometrics and individual-level fitness correlates will also be considered to develop a landscape prioritization tool to identify areas for future conservation efforts. Second, a SNP panel will be developed to non-invasively monitor large landscapes for ghost introgression of red wolf DNA and behavioral ecology traits. The application of this technology will be for large-scale, cost effective, long-term, non-invasive monitoring and continued identification of conservation priority individuals. Third, an optimization framework will be developed to identify and rank individuals that maximize ghost genetic variation while prioritizing the genomic architecture of red wolf ancestry, noting that longer block lengths of endangered genetics are preferred for maintaining genome integrity. Finally, the project will attempt to revive ghost variation through an innovative short-term captive breeding experiment, challenging the existing endangered species conservation tenets to include ghost variation as a trailblazing method to protect imperiled species and diversify their genomes. This project will serve as a model, evaluating the potential of leveraging ghost introgression to preserve the genomes of endangered species that face the immediate threat of extinction.\r\n\r\nThis project is jointly funded by the Divisions of Environmental Biology and Integrative Organismal Systems through the Partnership to Advance Conservation Science and Practice Program.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
