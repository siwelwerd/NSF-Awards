 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site award to Emory University, located in Atlanta, GA, supports the training of 9 students for 10 weeks during the summers of 2024-2026. Funded by the Division of Chemistry, undergraduate students will carry out interdisciplinary research that focuses on synthetic methodology, drug discovery, biomedical imaging, renewable energy, and quantum information science. Participants will work with world-class faculty on cutting-edge science and develop skills that are transferable to other academic and industrial settings. Additionally, students will be encouraged to expand their scientific network via informational and recruitment seminars with industrial partners and develop the communication skills necessary to access and thrive in graduate school and STEM careers.\r\n\r\nThe research experience of the fellows will be supplemented with extensive professional mentoring and hands-on training. Students will participate in an end-of-summer research symposium and will have an opportunity to present their work at national and/or regional chemistry meetings. Additional activities will include curated seminars, workshops, and social events to support their professional development.  A comprehensive overview of research safety and ethics will also be provided.  This REU site will focus on the recruitment of diverse groups of undergraduate students from primarily undergraduate institutions across the US who are majoring in the chemical sciences.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
