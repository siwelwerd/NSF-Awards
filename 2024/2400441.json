 "awd_abstract_narration": "The fourth industrial revolution's technological advancements are reshaping industries and creating demand for workers with new skills. In manufacturing, Computer Numerically Controlled (CNC) machining is evolving through robotics, enabling efficient, high-quality production. As affordable robotic solutions emerge, smaller businesses can explore automation. Higher education institutions at the forefront of technology adoption can support early adopters and build knowledge for regional innovation. Manufacturing drives the economies of Wisconsin and its Northeast region, and the state has the highest concentration of CNC Tool Programmer and Operator jobs in the nation.\r\n\r\nNortheast Wisconsin Technical College aims to assist educational institutions in similar manufacturing-dense regions by providing a model to support existing programs that, in partnership with industry, have identified new instrumentation needs and require enhancements to prepare graduates and existing incumbent workers for the evolving workplace. The ROBOTIC project involves CNC robotic equipment manufacturer visits, industry externships, automation skillset assessments, instrumentation acquisition, and modernization of curriculum. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
