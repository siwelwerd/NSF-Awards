 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support the four-day conference \"Pittsburgh Links among Analysis and Number Theory (PLANT)\" that will take place March 4-7, 2024 in Pittsburgh, PA. The purpose of the conference is to bring together representatives of two disciplines with a shared interface: number theory and analysis. There is a large potential for deeper collaboration between these fields resulting in new and transformative mathematical perspectives, and this conference aims at fostering such an interchange. In particular, the conference is designed to attract PhD students and post-doctoral scholars into working on innovations at this interface. \r\n \r\nTo encourage the development of new ideas, the conference speakers, collectively, represent many subfields that have developed their own distinctive blend of analysis and number theory, such as analytic number theory, arithmetic statistics, analytic theory of modular and automorphic forms, additive combinatorics, discrete harmonic analysis, and decoupling. While there have been a wide variety of conferences featuring these subfields in relative isolation, the PIs are excited at PLANT's potential for sparking links among all of these subfields and giving early-career participants the opportunity to be part of this exchange. The conference website is https://sites.google.com/view/plant24/home.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
