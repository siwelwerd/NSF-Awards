 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research Infrastructure Improvement EPSCoR Research Fellows project will provide a fellowship to an Assistant professor and training for a student at the Alabama A&M University. This work would be conducted in collaboration with researchers at the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) and in engagement with an expert from Sandia National Laboratory. This project aims to revolutionize the understanding of uranium carbide nuclear fuels and their applications in space propulsion. The project addresses critical challenges in nuclear thermal propulsion systems, which are vital for future space exploration missions. By leveraging NASA's cutting-edge technology and expertise, this research will enhance knowledge of nuclear fuels, contributing to safer and more efficient space travel. Additionally, the project will provide invaluable hands-on experience and professional development opportunities for students, preparing them to excel in the fields of aerospace and nuclear propulsion technology. The project will directly benefit the institution, a Historically Black College and University, with new curriculum, online dissemination platforms, and educational software development.\r\n\r\nThe objective of this research is to develop state-of-the-art computational models for uranium carbide nuclear fuels and their interactions with gases at finite temperatures. This collaboration with NASA MSFC involves using advanced Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations to simulate the electronic and phonon dynamics of nuclear fuels. The project will generate new thermodynamic databases for uranium carbide materials, integrating these computational models with experimental validation data from NASA. The research includes a comprehensive risk management plan to ensure reliability and accuracy in computational predictions. Furthermore, the project emphasizes educational outreach by developing a user-friendly graphical user interface for the computational tools and providing training for students and researchers. This initiative will democratize access to advanced computational materials science tools, fostering innovation and capacity building in the field of aerospace engineering. This proposed fellowship research broadens the research scope of the PI to transform the PI's career trajectory, but also initiates collaborations between Alabama A&M University and NASA.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
