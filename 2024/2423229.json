 "awd_abstract_narration": "Primates, unlike other mammals, experience a uniquely extended juvenile period. It has been hypothesized that this period evolved to provide the time needed to develop social skills and learn how to navigate complex social lives. Studies indicate that the development of social skills during this period seems to be impacted by life adversity experienced during infancy. However, the juvenile period is understudied in primates and these hypotheses require further testing. Using a longitudinal approach, this project examines the impact of early life adversity in the development of social skills in a non-human primate. The study contributes to understanding the evolution of the juvenile period and informs research on early life adversity. This project provides research experiences for undergraduate students and promotes educational activities among local communities.  \r\n\r\nThe study assesses the intergenerational effects of early life adversity in a non-human primate species. Early life adversity is calculated with a composite index (based on ecological \u2013group size-, and demographic \u2013grassland biomass- data at birth) and fecal glucocorticoid measures (average of the first year of life glucocorticoid values). Intergenerational effects of early life adversity are estimated by factoring in the subject's mother composite index. Interindividual variation is examined using: (1) behavioral data (grooming and other affiliative interactions) to estimate social indices, (2) the timing of the adverse effects (before and/or after sexual maturity) and, (3) proximate underlying mechanisms (fecal glucocorticoids).  This research contributes to the understanding of the proximate mechanisms underlying the relationship between early life adversity and effects on adult behavior, physiology, health, and ultimately, fitness.  \r\n\r\nThis project is jointly funded by the Biological Anthropology Program, and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
