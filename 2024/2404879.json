 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMP) program assists universities and colleges in their efforts to significantly increase the numbers of students matriculating into and successfully completing high quality degree programs in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) disciplines in order to diversify the STEM workforce and supports the production of scholarly research in STEM broadening participation. Particular emphasis is placed on transforming undergraduate STEM education through innovative, evidence-based recruitment and retention strategies, and relevant educational experiences in support of racial and ethnic groups underrepresented in STEM disciplines: Blacks and African Americans, Hispanic and Latino Americans, American Indians, Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians, and Native Pacific Islanders. These strategies facilitate the production of highly competitive students motivated to pursue graduate education or careers in STEM. For the United States to remain globally competitive, it is vital that it taps into the talent of all its citizens and provides exceptional educational preparedness in STEM areas that underpin the knowledge-based economy.\r\n\r\nThe University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC) is a partnering institution with the University System of Maryland LSAMP. The UMBC Bridge to the Doctorate (BD) program will increase the participation of underrepresented groups in STEM doctoral programs addressing the national need for a more diverse and expansive STEM workforce. To ensure success of the BD Fellows, the project will provide research and mentor training, connections to graduate school organizations, peer mentorship and access to a robust alumni network. In addition, Fellows will have a unique opportunity to receive primary instructor experience, a meaningful advantage on the path to the professoriate. These activities will provide the Fellows with innovative ways to enhance their preparation for advanced level STEM careers. Program outcomes to be assessed annually include retention, GPA, credits completed, time-to-degree, completion of program milestones, number of publications and conference presentations, and number of external fellowships. Longer-term outcomes will include matriculation into Ph.D. programs for the Fellows and obtaining a position in the STEM workforce.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
