 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal supports the operation of RV Hugh Sharp, a Regional Class RV in the Academic Research Vessel operated by the University of Delaware, that will provide NSF peer reviewed science (specific marine science disciplines or support collaborative and multi-disciplinary programs) access to a variety of marine environments. The proposed funding will be used to ensure the safety of the ship used and ship\u2019s complement by active management of a shipboard maintenance program, a trained and qualified crew with experienced support staff, compliance with national and international regulatory requirements and providing necessary logistics support.\r\n\r\nR/V Hugh Sharp is a regional class research vessel Owned by the University of Delaware. The ship is a multipurpose research vessel that has been designated a University National Oceanographic Laboratory System vessel and is a member of the U.S. Academic Research Fleet (ARF). This proposal seeks renewal of its 5-year Cooperative Agreement for the period 2024 to 2028. The ship was delivered in 2006, is 146 ft long, and carries a crew of 6-8 depending on the expedition requirements with a science party totaling up to 14 scientists. Sharp is also designed to operate below the ICES 209 underwater radiated noise standard at vessel speeds up to 8 knots. Chemical emissions from the engines are to the latest EPA standards. The vessel is designed to always minimize its impact on the surrounding environment. For 2024 UDEL is planning to operate R/V Sharp for 173 days with 57 days in support of NSF/OCE funded research.  The additional cruises are supported by NOAA and ONR. An additional 66 days are pending for a State of Maine BOEM program.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
