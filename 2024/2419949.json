 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Global Problem Solvers in Sustainable Living (GPS-SL) is a co-op initiative that aims to facilitate the development of a world-class U.S. STEM workforce, equipped to address complex engineering problems of sustainable living within tropical regions. By 2050, over half of the world\u2019s population is projected to reside in the tropics. The tropics, however, face significant challenges in sustainable living \u2013 and are essential for surplus heating driving global circulation. Safeguarding and preserving these tropical areas is paramount to securing a sustainable future globally. The GPS-SL aims to uphold U.S. strategic leadership in international science and engineering by cultivating a diverse and globally competitive STEM workforce. The initiative generates invaluable knowledge, innovative practices, and profound understanding for affordable, cost-effective sustainable living in the tropics. Acquired skills enhance students' career perspectives, benefiting a global technical workforce. Collaboration with foreign students contributes to cross-cultural skills development, fostering appreciation for global engineering and diverse research perspectives. \r\n\r\nThe GPS-SL is grounded in the best practices for experiential learning effectiveness to facilitate a transformative experience. The GPS-SL facilitates this transformative experience for 24 U.S.-based students through two core pillars: (i) Engagement in semester-long virtual Research Preparation and Professional Development activities, (ii) Collaborative Advanced Research in Sustainable Living, and Educational Research on Capacity Building in the following connected research foci: (1): Soilless Fresh/Brackish Water Solar-Powered AI-controlled Aquaponics System: Develop sustainable, low-tech aquaponic that reduce overall cost, and educational workshops to empower farmers to design and maintain aquaponic. (2): Low-Cost Technique to Immobilize Heavy Metals and Recycling Plastic Waste in Coastal Communities: Develop and test innovative sustainable approaches to remediate toxic metal contamination. (3): AI-Based Agric-Product Price Monitoring Systems: Develop a low-cost AI-based system to empower farmers with market insights, enabling fair pricing for produce and fostering a more equitable agricultural ecosystem.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
