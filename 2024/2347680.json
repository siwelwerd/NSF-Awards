 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Engineering Research Initiation (ERI) award will support research that investigate the evolution of the dynamic behavior of deep structural foundations in permafrost. Pile response to vibrations from earthquakes is affected by changes in soil properties from increasing temperatures. Alaska has more earthquakes than any other region of the United States and is, in fact, one of the most seismically active areas of the world. Infrastructure is now being damaged by both thaw-related settlements and frequent seismic activity because mechanical properties of permafrost are temperature dependent and soil temperature variation significantly impacts seismic vibrations in the permafrost region. Consequently, dynamic behaviors of a soil-pile foundation system, which are critically important to the stability of a structure, cannot be predicted from measurements taken from permafrost or non-permafrost regions only. This research will characterize and assess the impact of ongoing permafrost degradation on the dynamic behaviors of pile foundations in the face of seismic hazards. The project will provide research experiences for undergraduates from Clarkson University and the University of Alaska Fairbanks; they will assist with instrumentation, soil testing, in situ tests, and data processing. In addition, an educational and outreach program for middle school science classes that demonstrates dynamic response of model piles in layers of soil will be implemented. \r\n\r\nThe goal of this ERI research project is to characterize the dynamic behaviors of pile foundations in degrading permafrost, knowledge that could be used to develop resilient, sustainable designs for piles subject to earthquakes and climate change, and increase service life while reducing maintenance and operation costs of infrastructure. To achieve this goal, two objectives will be pursued: (1) characterization of the effects of thickness and distribution of frozen and unfrozen soil layers on the dynamic stiffness and damping of soil-pile systems using laboratory-scale tests; and (2) investigation of seasonal freeze-thaw effects on the dynamic behavior of piles in Alaska permafrost using in situ vibration testing. The following fundamental questions will be answered: (1) How does the temperature distribution of the ground affect the dynamic behavior of the soil-pile system in discontinuous permafrost regions? and (2) What is the role of changes in thermomechanical properties of the soil layers caused by freeze-thaw in the dynamic response of pile foundations? By integrating experimental results from both laboratory and field tests, the research will improve the model of a dynamic beam on a nonlinear Winkler foundation for permafrost regions. This research will provide the basis for developing and investigating innovative foundation solutions for continuous and discontinuous permafrost zones, thereby increasing community resilience in the Arctic.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
