 "awd_abstract_narration": "Immersive computing blends digital information and content into physical environments through virtual, augmented, and mixed reality. As immersive computing unfolds, it presents new research challenges, such as optimizing data transfer, reducing end-to-end latency, improving system scalability, preserving user privacy, and ensuring seamless interactions in increasingly complex environments. This workshop will identify and explore the most promising frontiers for tackling networking and systems challenges in immersive computing. The objective is to further catalyze research progress in this exciting area to enable a future where immersive computing positively impacts domains ranging from healthcare and education to entertainment and beyond.\r\n\r\nThis workshop will bring together experts from diverse backgrounds, fostering interdisciplinary collaboration to delve into cutting-edge research topics and encourage knowledge exchange. The technical program revolves around four key themes: (1) network architecture and protocols, (2) sustainability and scalability of systems, (3) applications and user experience, and (4) optimizations driven by machine learning/artificial intelligence. Participants will be tasked with pinpointing obstacles and opportunities for advancing immersive computing within these themes, drawing on concrete examples from various application domains. Through interactive breakout sessions, these insights will be collected and organized. The outcomes of the workshop, including research agendas, identified challenges, and collaborative initiatives, will contribute to the intellectual landscape of the field and guide future investigations in the pursuit of transformative advancements.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
