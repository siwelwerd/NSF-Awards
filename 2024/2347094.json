 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Aerospace Student-Teacher Program for Innovation, Research, and Education (ASPIRE) is dedicated to merging Aerospace Advanced Manufacturing (AM) and Advanced Air Mobility (AAM), integrating cutting-edge aviation technologies like Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS), electric aircraft, and Air Transportation (AT) with automated air traffic management. The progress in advanced manufacturing enhances the rapid growth of Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS), enabling the creation of drones that are lighter, stronger, and more efficient. ASPIRE for high school participants and educators in advanced manufacturing is related to the above fields. Recognizing the increasing demand for skilled individuals in the evolving aerospace industry, the ASPIRE team has tailored experiential learning activities and STEM education for high school students and teachers, specifically targeting students from underrepresented and low-income backgrounds, as well as schools lacking experiential programs. ASPIRE's mission includes annually bringing subject matter experts to high schools, delivering the Aerospace Centered Career Exploration for Student Success (ACCESS) program to 100 students. Twenty percent of these students have the opportunity to engage in summer research internships through SKY-CARE (Summer Program for High School Youth in Career Aerospace, Aviation, and Research Education), alongside professional development opportunities. Furthermore, the ACCESS program expands experiential learning activities for 100 high school educators each year. The project team will develop a curriculum integrating practical experience with aeronautical manufacturing education, to foster their interests, motivations, skills, knowledge, and professional competencies in pursuing careers providing 20% of these educators with classroom supply grants to enhance student learning experiences.\r\n\r\nASPIRE also forms partnerships with relevant organizations to amplify its impact. It employs a combination of experiential learning activities, such as hands-on workshops in rocket launching, UAS drone design, additive manufacturing, flight and UAS simulations, summer research internships, and rigorous evaluation mechanisms. An annual internship showcase conference allows participants to present their learning outcomes through oral presentations. The project's objectives include fostering diversity in the aerospace industry by exposing students from diverse backgrounds to these fields and enhancing research skills among educators. It goes beyond traditional high school education by employing experiential learning pedagogies. The project aims to cultivate critical thinking and independent problem-solving skills, nurturing innovative thinkers prepared to advance progress in aerospace industries and beyond. ASPIRE adopts a holistic approach that focuses on both academic proficiency and essential professional competencies. It prepares students for future careers by imparting technical writing, oral presentation, and scientific communication skills, thereby contributing to collaborative and forward-thinking aerospace communities. By implementing ASPIRE, the project team seeks to make a significant contribution to the future workforce and sustainability of the aerospace industry. Furthermore, it aims to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion in STEM education and careers, thereby fostering a more inclusive and innovative landscape.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
