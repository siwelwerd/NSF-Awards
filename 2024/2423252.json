As in 2023, this week brings together three major programs funded through the NSF Spectrum Innovation Initiative program (SWIFT, NRDZ, and SpectrumX) to hold meetings and social events in a collaborative environment. New elements for 2024 include: co-location and coordination with IEEE DySPAN 2024 to foster publication and dissemination of peer-reviewed research results; the National Spectrum Managers Association (NSMA) industry trade group Annual Conference; and a Federal government outreach workshop for public engagement on the National Spectrum Research and Development plan.\r\n\r\nThe week of events is unique in the way it convenes a large cross-section of the spectrum research community as well as stakeholders in industry and government, and in so doing, integrate students into the forward-thinking conversations, networking, and career development opportunities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
