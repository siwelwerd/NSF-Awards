 "awd_abstract_narration": "Plant diseases caused by bacterial pathogens reduce crop yield and quality in the U.S. and around the world and, therefore, negatively affect food security, lower farmers\u2019 income, and threaten U.S. biosecurity. At the same time, beneficial bacteria are being used to control crop diseases and thus can increase farmers\u2019 income and improve food security. The 15th International Conference on Plant Pathogenic Bacteria and the 5th International Symposium of Biological Control of Bacterial Plant Diseases will be held as a combined conference, ICPPB & Biocontrol 2024, in Blacksburg, VA, from July 7-12, 2024. The goal of the conference is to communicate and share new scientific insights into the biology of plant pathogenic and beneficial bacteria, mechanisms of how they interact with each other and with plants, and technological advancements that enable translation of basic research into tools that detect, prevent, and control bacterial plant diseases in the field and increase agricultural biosecurity. \r\n\r\nICPPB & Biocontrol 2024, will provide a platform to share the latest advances in interdisciplinary research of all plant-associated bacteria, be it the molecular basis of bacterial pathogens, the ecology and evolution of plant microbiome members that contribute to plant health, or the plant immune responses to pathogens, symbionts, and commensals. Moreover, it will highlight the parallels between plant and animal immunity, microbiomes, and pathogens to leverage scientific progress in either plants or animals to the benefit of scientific excellence in both. To reach this overarching goal to share new scientific insights, the specific objectives are: I. Offer an interdisciplinary scientific program presented by domestic and international speakers, II. Support career development of early career scientists from diverse backgrounds, III. Facilitate networking to build and strengthen research collaborations, including scientists in animal biosecurity. By reaching these objectives, ICPPB & Biocontrol 2024 can be expected to significantly contribute to the improvement of plant health and biosecurity, which will positively impact not only U.S agriculture and biosecurity but food security worldwide.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
