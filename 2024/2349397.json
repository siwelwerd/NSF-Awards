 "awd_abstract_narration": "NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\n\r\nFunded by the Division of Materials Research at the National Science Foundation, the Georgetown University REU Site for Materials Physics provides undergraduates from diverse backgrounds and a broad spectrum of institutions an opportunity to engage in important and challenging research in the fundamental science of materials, while developing technical and professional skills necessary for a successful career in science.  In addition, through enrichment activities with scientists working in the policy arena in the nation\u2019s capital, students are exposed to the role of science, particularly materials research, in public policy. Recruitment efforts focus on students from schools with limited research programs, as well as members of underrepresented groups. The engagement in mentored research projects, exploration of the broader role of science and scientists in society, and development of lasting relationships with graduate-student and faculty mentors positively influences student perceptions of careers in science and helps increase the pool of future materials researchers. Furthermore, students who complete this REU are well qualified to understand and communicate the importance of materials science in technological progress and in addressing societal challenges.  \r\n\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL SUMMARY \r\n\r\nEach year, nine undergraduates from diverse backgrounds and a broad spectrum of institutions are recruited for a 10-week summer research experience in materials physics at Georgetown University. Students engage in experimental, computational, and theoretical research projects in hard and soft condensed matter physics, nanoscience, device physics, biophysics, quantum information, and materials- and quantum-related education research. The projects provide opportunities for students to formulate and test hypotheses, design and execute experiments, and analyze and interpret results. Taking advantage of Georgetown's location in the nation's capital, the program also introduces students to the role of science, particularly materials research, in public policy. These activities are designed to help students connect their research projects to broader scientific questions and to the world outside of the laboratory.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
