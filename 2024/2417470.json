 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national interest by integrating the study of software performance throughout the CS curriculum. There is a growing recognition of the importance of software performance, however, learning how to code efficiently remains a critical missing piece in CS curricula, as for decades the primary focus has been on achieving functional correctness (and this trend continues). This project intends to develop EduPerf, an education-centric software platform, to integrate software performance analysis into different levels of CS courses to help students and instructors. The project has the potential to cultivate a highly skilled cohort of software engineers adept in performance analysis and proficient in writing efficient code.\r\n\r\nThe project team plans to develop interventions and novel measurement-based techniques to enable instructors to assess student learning effectively.  The team plans to use formative and summative assessment methods to measure the student learning outcomes and answer several research questions. The project results will be disseminated at several major CS education conferences. The team will provide detailed user and developer guides to EduPerf in PDF, HTML, video, and other comparable presentation formats. The project outcomes will not only benefit the technology industry in Silicon Valley in California, the automotive industry in Michigan, and Research Triangle Park in North Carolina but also advance the nationwide scientific endeavor. The NSF IUSE: EDU Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through its Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools. This project is also supported by the NSF IUSE: HSI program, which has the goals of enhancing the quality of undergraduate STEM education, and increasing the recruitment, retention, and graduation rates of students pursuing associate\u2019s or baccalaureate degrees in STEM.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
