This grant provides partial support for US student participation in the International Phytotechnologies Scholars Program to be held in October 2024 at the University of Calicut, Kerala, India. The conference is hosted by the International Phytotechnology Society (IPS). The IPS conference has the goal of advancing knowledge in areas protecting human health and advancing sustainable solutions that can be broadly applicable, with a particular focus on increasing knowledge of the broader roles of phytotechnologies in the concurrent protection of public health, risk assessment, and the improvement of ecosystem function. Participation in the conference will provide students with professional skills and development opportunities and the chance to network with international professionals working in the field of phytotechnologies. The conference will directly support student training, international engagement, mentorship, and education in phytotechnologies and sustainable technologies as strategies for environmental remediation, management, and stewardship.\r\n\r\nThis grant will provide partial coverage of travel and lodging for an expected 10 - 12 selected scholars to attend the conference. The selected students will travel to India and will directly interact with international leaders in public health protection to learn scientifically and grow professionally. At the conference, the students will make a presentation and meet leaders of the profession. The students will be provided with mentoring and will be charged to meet specific learning objectives, which include not only scientific objectives but also cultural and professional development objectives. The students' presentations will be evaluated by a minimum of two senior scholars. The student selection process will invite applicants in groups underserved in STEM fields. The selection committee is a diverse group of accomplished scholars from multiple universities that has interacted with past conferences and student programs. All selection committee members will be invited to the conference to offer talks and engage with the students.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
