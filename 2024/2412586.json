 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 2024 Mammalian Synthetic Biology Workshop will focus on the latest advances in the fields of synthetic biology and biotechnology, bringing together key stakeholders from academia and industry who have aligned interests. The workshop\u2019s program focuses on mammalian synthetic biology research, including organoid development, tissue engineering, synthetic circuits, RNA-based regulators, and synthetic reporters and recorders. A major goal of the workshop is to create an environment where a diverse group of researchers can gather and exchange information. Additionally, the conference aims to give students and early career professionals opportunities to share their work, to network with the foremost leaders in the field, and to develop their careers.\r\n\r\nMammalian synthetic biology is a rapidly growing and highly impactful area of research with important applications in biotechnology and medicine. This workshop aims to have scientific presentations from a diverse group of researchers, to have active participation by students who represent the future of the field, to promote interactions between academic and industry researchers, to provide a collaborative atmosphere that motivates new interdisciplinary research, and to have extensive participation from a variety of groups. The conference will enable professionals and young researchers to interact and learn through organized talks, panels, question and answer discussions, and poster sessions. The conference will feature a variety areas of mammalian synthetic biology, including organoid development, tissue engineering, synthetic circuits and RNA-based regulators.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
