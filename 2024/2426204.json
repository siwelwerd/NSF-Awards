 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project serves national interest by transforming teaching and learning in the discipline of linguistics. Workshop activities linguists to improve their understanding of scholarly teaching and pedagogy and to create and disseminate innovative, peer-reviewed pedagogical resources. The peer-reviewed library created by this project provides accessible, vetted, contextualized pedagogical materials for linguistics instructors, improving the experiences of undergraduate students. Since many students enrolled in linguistics courses are in other disciplines, the artifacts produced by project participants reach audiences both within and outside of the discipline of linguistics. \r\n\r\nThis project builds on recent calls to interrogates how theories of race are operationalized in linguistics, and on recent scholarship that challenges the Western scientific tradition of the discipline, which has privileged certain languages, communities, cultures, and epistemologies over others. The project plays a critical role in the discipline by focusing on the linguistics classroom, the entry point for scholars into the discipline. To ensure that library artifacts are relevant for a variety of institutional contexts and student populations, project participants focus on issues of justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion during the development of their contributions to the pedagogical resource library.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
