 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study examines the impact of non-science isolation practices on scientific production and collaboration. The research deepens our understanding of how national scientific systems are interconnected with global economic and political dynamics, providing insights on the impact of scientific cooperation across countries and sectors. The study addresses fundamental issues at the intersection of science strategy, international relations, and research productivity including how restrictive measures and geopolitical shifts affect international scientific collaboration, researcher mobility, and resource exchange. The project serves the national interest by promoting the progress of science through a better understanding of the factors that influence global scientific cooperation. The results provide decision makers with empirical evidence to inform strategic decision-making in the governance of scientific activities. This knowledge is crucial for maintaining the United States as a leader in global scientific research and innovation. The findings from this study have broader impacts on national health, prosperity, and welfare by helping to navigate international scientific collaboration in an increasingly complex geopolitical landscape. \r\n\r\nThe researchers employ quasi-experimental designs utilizing three recent global events. These events serve as cases to examine the causal impact of disengagement from the integrated global scientific community on scientific development. The study will use causal inference techniques, specifically the synthetic control method and difference-in-differences analysis. These methods are applied to investigate changes in scientific publication production and the exchange of scientific capital, including funding resources and researcher mobility. To address potential biases in international databases, the project constructs a comprehensive dataset incorporating publication records from both international and national sources. By using causal inference frameworks, the researchers offer nuanced insights into the consequences of withdrawing from the integrated scientific community while mitigating the influence of other factors.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
