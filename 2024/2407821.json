 "awd_abstract_narration": "Galaxies transform and evolve with time depending on two key factors, the galaxy mass and the environment where the galaxy resides. As galaxies speed through galaxy clusters and groups, they often leave behind long tails of gas behind them. This project will study the stripped tails trailing behind galaxies with multi-wavelength data recently collected from world-class telescopes. The investigators will study gas at different phases, examine their connection, compare with numerical simulations, and advance our understanding of galaxy evolution and the multi-phase medium. Students will be trained in how to conduct scientific research. The team will also engage with high school students from underrepresented minorities in northern Alabama. All relevant scientific results will be shared with the public. \r\n\r\nEnergy balance and transfer in a multi-phase medium is an outstanding question in astrophysics, important for cosmic structure formation. This research team focuses on a new kind of multi-phase medium, stripped tails of cluster late-type galaxies. Ram pressure stripping is a common process in astrophysics and an important ingredient in galaxy evolution. The PI will take advantage of a large amount of multi-wavelength data, in particular new data obtained under an ALMA large program, to study the multiphase tails of late-type galaxies experiencing ram pressure stripping. The PI will also study the morphology and kinematics of these tidal tails. The key factors to govern star formation in tails will be examined. The effect of ram pressure stripping on star formation and nuclear activity of galaxies will also be studied. This research will result in an enhanced understanding of mixing and heating/cooling in multi-phase medium, star formation efficiency in stripped tails, impact of ram pressure stripping on galaxy properties. The Principal Investigator will lead workshops for under-represented minority students in local high schools and other efforts to improve astronomical and science education in the local community.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
