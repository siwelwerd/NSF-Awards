 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nontechnical description:\r\nTopological phases of matter have attracted great attention in condensed matter physics due to their rich physics and possible revolutionary technological applications. Three-dimensional topological Dirac semimetals are of great interest due to their intriguing electronic band structure and are an ideal platform to realize emergent quantum phases, dissipationless transmission of electrons, efficient generation of spin current for spintronics, and advanced quantum device concepts such as the topological field effect transistor. The goal of this research project is to explore emergent topological phenomena in a three-dimensional topological Dirac semimetal as tuned by film thickness, external electric field, and magnetic interactions. The principal investigator and research team plans to synthesize high quality epitaxial thin films of a topological Dirac semimetal candidate, Na3Bi, and its heterostructures with magnetic insulators using molecular beam epitaxy. Employing in-operando nano-focused angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, the research team plans to directly probe, with no assumptions, the complex electronic band structure that is ultimately responsible for novel phenomena in this class of quantum materials. This project plans to support the doctorate dissertation of a graduate student, through training on different experimental techniques, critical thinking and solving complex research problems. The principal investigator also plans to provide research experience for undergraduate students in her lab every summer, for multiple years from a minority serving institution. The recruitment of the undergraduate students is facilitated through the existing tie-ups with the minority serving institutions. By taking advantage of this research program, the principal investigator proposes to design and implement a new advanced lab course to provide hands-on lab experience to students on research-grade equipment. Also, the plans to develop educational initiatives for a diverse population including an outreach program targeted towards middle and high school students belonging to underrepresented minorities in southwestern Pennsylvania.  \r\n\r\nTechnical description:\r\nThe principal investigator proposes a comprehensive research project to study emergent quantum phenomena in epitaxial thin films of a topological Dirac semimetal and its heterostructures. This research is enabled by a unique home-built ultrahigh vacuum cluster system comprising of experimental capabilities of molecular beam epitaxy, in-situ thin film patterning, and in-situ cryogenic magnetotransport, which allows the research team to synthesize and measure thin films of a topological Dirac semimetal in pristine conditions. The research team plans to utilize molecular beam epitaxy to obtain high quality epitaxial thin films of Na3Bi and its heterostructures with magnetic insulators. The research team plans to employ quantum transport measurements to study thickness dependent non-trivial to trivial band gap insulator transitions, electric field controlled topological phases, and T-broken topological states in thin films of Na3Bi with integrated top and bottom electrostatic gates. In addition, the research team plans to utilize a state-of-the-art nano-focused in-operando angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy with sub-100 nm spatial resolution to measure the Fermi level dependent (using integrated electrostatic back gate) topological band structure of Na3Bi thin films and their devices.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
