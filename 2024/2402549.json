 "awd_abstract_narration": "This awards supports the speakers and participants of the 2024-2026 meetings of the Southwestern Undergraduate Mathematics Research Conference (SUnMaRC).  The funds will be used to further broaden the typical participation of University of Arizona, Arizona State University, Northern Arizona University, Mesa Community College (Arizona), U.S. Air Force Academy (Colorado), Colorado State University, University of Texas at El Paso, and University of New Mexico.  The purpose of SUnMaRC 2024, 2025, and 2026  is to bring together STEM majors throughout the Southwest who are interested or have done research that involves mathematical sciences. The 2024 SUnMaRC will take place April 5-7, 2024 at University of New Mexico.\r\n\r\nSUnMaRC is designed to provide opportunities for students to participate in a conference focused on mathematical research in a supportive and fun atmosphere.  In addition to student talks and posters, the conference features invited speakers from a variety of areas including academia, industry, and government, presenting new and exciting research. The Southwest region has a significant number of minority students in STEM fields and recruiting students in mathematics and STEM fields at our institutions will help to promote diversity  in mathematical sciences.\r\n\r\nThe conference website is at https://www.sunmarc.org/\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
