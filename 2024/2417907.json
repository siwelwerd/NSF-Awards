 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent years have seen a remarkable surge in interest and use of unmanned aerial systems (UAS), also known as drones, leading to rapid advancements in UAS technologies. Despite this progress, much remains to be explored to fully harness the potential of UAS. This underscores the critical demand for skilled researchers specializing in UAS. However, shaping the future UAS research workforce encounters multiple challenges, including system complexity, lack of open platforms, and shortage of training materials. To tackle these challenges, this project develops a new training program that will equip students with the essential skills needed for conducting and potentially transforming foundational UAS research.\r\n\r\nThis project involves a team of educators with complementary expertise in various aspects of UAS. The training program includes four modules, each focusing on a fundamental aspect of UAS: control, communication and networking, computing, and artificial intelligence (AI) applications. This modular design ensures scalability and facilitates integration into existing curricula. Additionally, by leveraging an open UAS Cyber Infrastructure (UAS-CI) developed by the project team, each training module includes numerous hands-on projects to equip trainees with practical skills in operating and advancing UAS-CI. Implemented through a month-long summer program and tutorials at relevant international conferences, this project develops at least 50 skilled UAS professionals annually, who are expected to become the future UAS-CI research workforce and drive transformative advancements in foundational UAS research.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
