 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Phase I Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is based on a new type of space vehicle propulsion (the initial product will be a reaction control system) that operates with fluctuation flow based propulsion and has a long operation lifetime with a compact and lightweight form factor. It enables orders of magnitude greater maneuver capability than current state-of-the-art electric or chemical propulsion. Space vehicles will be able to operate longer on station and will have the freedom to change inclinations and altitudes to optimize mission performance. It will significantly increase the US leadership in the space industry, speeding the deployment of space-based services that will greatly help society and the American public. Fluctuation flow propulsion supports the national defense of the United States by enabling rapid redeployment and tasking of space assets to respond to current requirements and potential threats. The breakthrough improvement in propulsion performance will also enable efficient and high-speed interplanetary travel, opening opportunities for deep space exploration missions, asteroid mining ventures, and scientific expeditions. The innovation will enhance our understanding of how quantum vacuum fluctuations interact with and can be controlled by asymmetric nanostructures and potentials.\r\n\r\nThis SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a new type of propulsion based on the motive forces predicted to be generated from the interaction between quantum vacuum fluctuations and asymmetric nanostructures and potentials such are found in Resonant Tunneling Diodes.  Asymmetric nanostructure devices will be fabricated on micron-scale cantilevers. The cantilevers will be deflected by the force generated. The amount of defection will be measured using white-light interferometry and the associated force will be determined. A parametric series of device configurations will be measured, and steps will be taken to ensure that that there are no outside factors (such as vibrational, thermal, and electromagnetic effects) influencing the results. The devices will be measured in both up and down orientations which will change the direction of the force, making it readily discernible from other factors and the influence of gravity. The proposed experiments will be the first measurements of vacuum fluctuation based motive forces. The experimental results will enhance our understanding of the quantum vacuum and will be the first-time broken symmetry has been proven to control vacuum fluctuation behavior.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
