 "awd_abstract_narration": "This collaborative project is led by the University of New Mexico in collaboration with Navajo Technical University (NTU), New Mexico Tech (NMT), Central New Mexico Community College (CNMCC), and New Mexico State University (NMSU).  The Research Infrastructure Optimization for New Mexico (RIO-NM) project seeks to create a more interconnected, inclusive, and innovative research environment. RIO-NM will link the existing research ecosystem in New Mexico with emerging research institutes (ERIs), including Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSIs) and Tribal Colleges and Universities (TCUs). The project focuses on two main areas of need at New Mexico\u2019s ERIs: developing cyberinfrastructure and creation of research pathways. By addressing these needs, RIO-NM will stimulate innovation. In turn, this has potential to lead to economic growth in key sectors resulting in high-value employment opportunities for graduates from ERIs, particularly those from underrepresented groups in science and engineering, thus improving the standard of living in New Mexico. RIO-NM is dedicated to expanding participation in the scientific community across various individuals, institutions, and sectors. \r\n\r\nThe RIO-NM team will focus on three key areas of interconnectivity between New Mexico\u2019s ERIs and its broader research ecosystem: Digital, Human, and Institutional. To achieve this interconnection, RIO-NM will establish two specialized cores: 1) Cyberinfrastructure Core: Focusing on digital and institutional interconnections for ERIs and 2) Research Pathways Core: Connecting researchers, faculty, and students from ERIs with resources and programs statewide. Additionally, an Administrative Core will support overall cohesion and provide administrative assistance. To achieve ERI integration with the state's broader ecosystem, the Cores will employ three mechanisms: 1) Pilot Programs: Initial implementations to test concepts related to cyberinfrastructure and research pathways. 2) Pilot Results Workshops: Statewide workshops to discuss pilot outcomes and encourage adoption by other ERIs and 3) Seed Awards: Funding primarily ERIs for projects in cyberinfrastructure and research pathways. RIO-NM has initially identified four pilot programs, with two topics in the Cyberinfrastructure Core at Navajo Technical University (NTU) and New Mexico Tech (NMT), and two in the Research Pathways Core at Central New Mexico Community College (CNMCC), and New Mexico State University (NMSU). This project is funded by the NSF EPSCoR Collaborations for Optimizing Research Ecosystems (E-CORE) RII Program. The E-CORE RII program supports jurisdictions in building capacity in one or more targeted research infrastructure cores that underlie the jurisdiction\u2019s research ecosystem.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
