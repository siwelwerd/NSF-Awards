 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project addresses the critical challenge of equipping foster youth aging out of the system with vital technical skills and career guidance to enhance their independence and economic stability. By integrating advanced manufacturing and microelectronics training into their education, the project aims to provide these young individuals with access to high-demand skills and career opportunities. The initiative stands to significantly impact regional and national welfare by preparing a vulnerable demographic for substantive roles in the tech-driven economy, thereby promoting societal progress and inclusivity. The effort will also foster diversity in STEM fields, aligning with national interests in building a competent, diverse workforce that mirrors the broader society.\r\n\r\nThe project will utilize a structured program at the Florida Institute of Technology's Center for Advanced Manufacturing and Innovative Design to introduce foster youth to advanced manufacturing and microelectronics. Over three years, 25 participants each year will engage in hands-on learning experiences, including workshops, mentorship programs, and career planning sessions. These activities are designed to develop hard and soft skills, preparing participants for employment or further education in STEM fields. Methodologically, the project employs a combination of experiential learning, peer mentoring, and professional networking to achieve its objectives. Expected outcomes include high rates of successful job placements and further educational pursuits among participants, directly contributing to their personal and professional empowerment and the advancement of the national workforce in STEM.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
