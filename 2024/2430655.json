 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this initiative is to enhance student participation at the Great Lakes Symposium on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) (GLSVLSI 2024) in Clearwater, Florida, USA, by providing financial support. This support aims to encourage attendance among students across diverse VLSI areas, such as circuits and systems, computer-aided design, emerging computing, hardware security, machine learning, and microelectronic education. Given the diverse expertise of GLSVLSI attendees, spanning various VLSI domains, sponsoring student participation is expected to foster interdisciplinary collaboration and cultivate a dynamic academic community. Through active involvement in GLSVLSI sessions, poster presentations, and networking opportunities, students can contribute to knowledge advancement in their fields while gaining valuable insights from fellow scholars and experts. \r\n\r\nThis travel grant for GLSVLSI 2024 seeks to provide financial assistance to 20 US-based student attendees, covering their registration fees. A portion of the grant, totaling 25%, will be allocated to support diversity,  including undergraduates, females, and people from underrepresented populations. This initiative aims to enhance institutional, geographic, and demographic diversity and inclusion within the academic community, ensuring equitable access to scholarly opportunities for students from varied backgrounds. By removing financial barriers and facilitating student participation, the grant facilitates knowledge exchange, collaboration, and the dissemination of research findings, thereby enriching the academic experience of the symposium and advancing both the field and principles of diversity, equity, and inclusion.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
