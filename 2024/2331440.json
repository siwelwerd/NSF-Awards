 "awd_abstract_narration": "Despite the high level of fundamental research productivity exhibited at the University of Delaware, the level of translational research activity remains relatively low. This Accelerating Research Translation (ART) project introduces an accelerated innovation ecosystem where unmet needs and use-defined gaps derived from relevant stakeholders and corporate partners provide inspiration. A cluster of innovators in the engineering driven health space and other applied research domains will convert use-inspired research into enabling technology with well-defined application resulting in impactful technology translation. Entrepreneurially minded individuals from across campus will benefit from training activities for education and workforce development. It is critically important that as an economic engine for Delaware state and region, the University of Delaware (UD) leverages its world-class talent for producing novel technologies with societal benefit for citizens and the nation. \r\n\r\nThis project will: (1) strengthen institutional capacity for use-inspired and translational research at UD, (2) continually educate new cohorts of trainees in translational research to become entrepreneurs or seek translational research-oriented careers in public/private sectors, and (3) create and nurture a set of ART ambassadors who are change agents in a culture of innovation. A series of capacity-building activities involving the creation of critical positions in tech transfer and corporate engagement, inclusion of PTIE.org-inspired incentives in promotion and tenure policies, and streamlined processes to promote corporate partnership will be integrated with UD Office of Economic Innovation and Partnerships operations. Training programs describing the internal mechanisms and support available to innovators who are interested in exploring the commercialization potential of their inventions will be rolled out in partnership with the Horn Entrepreneurship program to a diverse set of undergraduate and graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, staff, faculty, and visiting scholars across disciplines. This accelerated model of research translation will be demonstrated with at least two new Seed Translational Research Projects per year, with the Institute for Engineering Driven Health serving as the initial test platform. Additional hubs of entrepreneurial activity in agriculture, social sciences, or other domains  will be identified and invited to participate in all ART programs. Regular interactions with mentors at Princeton University to share expertise in translational activities will also enable rich conversations about regional innovation engines. In the short term, ART activities will drive innovation and translation in the biomedical arena, while in the long term the infrastructure developed through this process will accelerate entrepreneurship and commercialization activities across multiple units at UD. Beyond the quantitative outcomes, this project will have a profound impact on the campus culture by encouraging an entrepreneurial mindset and fostering innovation excellence. This type of environment will attract like-minded students and faculty destined to improve the human condition by bringing innovations to life. \r\n\r\nThis project is jointly funded by the Technology, Innovation, and Partnerships (TIP) Directorate and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) and the Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMP) program within the Division of Equity for Excellence in STEM (EES/EDU).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
