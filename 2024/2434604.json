 "awd_abstract_narration": "Bringing the Ocean to the Streets is a strategic approach for engaging communities. It aims to address the lack of diversity in marine sciences through immersive and educational experiences through two key events: the Essence Festival and Black in Marine Science (BIMS) Week. At the Essence Festival, the \u201cBIMS Ocean to Essence\u201d exhibit showcases marine science through interactive displays and activities with focus on inspiring interest and promoting diversity in the geosciences. BIMS Week, a professional wellness retreat supports and develops a diverse body of marine scientists with expert-led workshops, cultural excursions, and networking opportunities. These initiatives aim to foster a sense of community, enhance professional growth, and promote inclusivity in the marine sciences, ensuring diverse voices address critical ocean and coastal issues.\r\n\r\nThe primary goal of this project is to enhance diversity, representation, and equity in marine sciences by engaging communities through two key events: Essence Festival and BIMS Week. These events aim to foster a sense of community, build authentic relationships, and provide immersive educational experiences to make marine science accessible and relevant. The \u201cBIMS Ocean to Essence\u201d exhibit will seek to raise awareness and inspire action on marine issues. BIMS Week offers professional development and networking opportunities to support and nurture marine scientists. These initiatives promote interdisciplinary collaboration, enhance public understanding of marine and coastal issues, and ensure diverse voices are included in addressing critical environmental challenges, thereby creating a sustainable and inclusive future for marine science research and conservation. The PI team will utilize novel BIMS frameworks to measure and evaluate the effectiveness of these events.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
