The workshop focuses on enhancing junior statistical scientists\u2019 technical writing abilities for various professional contexts. It will cover targeting publications, grant writing intricacies, manuscript revision, collaboration, ethics, reproducibility, and addressing challenges faced by non-native English speakers. Additionally, it will explore the role of AI, including an introduction to ChatGPT, and feature a panel discussing AI\u2019s influence on writing and statistics. \r\n\r\nThe NISS Writing Workshop for Junior Researchers has been nurturing top statistical writers for over a decade, offering early-career connections with leading professionals. Recognizing the essential yet often overlooked role of writing in statistics, the workshop will be hybrid to expand its reach. It will cover technical writing, publication strategies, peer review navigation, collaborative writing, and funding insights, along with reproducibility and ethics. The JSM in-person session will delve into AI\u2019s impact on the field, featuring a ChatGPT tutorial and a panel discussion. Thirty five junior researchers from statistics and related fields will receive personalized mentorship from experienced mentors, including former journal editors and NSF and NIH directors. Submissions are due by June 30. The workshop website is available here: https://www.niss.org/events/writing-workshop-junior-researchers-2024.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
