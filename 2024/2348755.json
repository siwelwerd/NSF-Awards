 "awd_abstract_narration": "This REU Site program will provide 8-week summer online research experiences to undergraduates on how to utilize modern data science and high-performance computing (HPC) techniques to process and analyze big data in many science and engineering disciplines such as Atmospheric Science, Mechanical Engineering, and Medicine. The REU Site program will be conducted purely online to allow students to conduct research without traveling and work with experts nationwide. In recent years, astronomical growth of available datasets in many science and engineering disciplines often requires big data analytics techniques to efficiently and effectively process the large datasets and gain knowledge from them. The program will help students identify frontier research challenges when facing big data in science and engineering, and guide students to conduct research to tackle the research challenges using advanced cyberinfrastructure software technologies (e.g., big data, distributed machine/deep learning, HPC) and hardware resources such as big data clusters, CPU clusters, and GPU clusters. \r\n\r\nThe program will provide development of the national workforce in areas of critical need on \"Data + Computing + X\", where \"X\" is a variety of application areas.  By having three phases of training -- formal instruction, team-based research, and dissemination -- this REU Site program will i) encourage students' interests in how data science and high-performance computing techniques could help the scientific discovery process via interdisciplinary research projects; ii) provide interdisciplinary team-based research experiences via guidance from research mentors, graduate assistants, and interdisciplinary collaborators in the application area of each project; and iii) provide integrated training on crucial professional skills (e.g., collaboration, communication, presentation, and writing) and experiences with scientific paper preparation and presentation. This REU Site will provide a unique and comprehensive program integrating the following elements under the guidance of the faculty team who have extensive experiences in interdisciplinary research and online education: 1) frontier research connecting advanced cyberinfrastructure techniques with big data challenges in science and engineering, 2) online research experience that leverages modern communication tools, 3) team-based interdisciplinary research and communication experiences, 4) complementary professional development activities (e.g., graduate school preparation, invited talks from established researchers, and interaction with university leadership), 5) educational research on online undergraduate training experiences.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
