 "awd_abstract_narration": "Reliable and high-performing energy storage devices are essential for facilitating the transition to a fully sustainable energy economy and to achieve net-zero emission goals. While significant advancements have been made in the development of materials to enhance electrode performance, further progress relies on a comprehensive understanding of key thermodynamic and kinetic processes at the nanoscale that govern electrochemical behavior. Metal oxides have emerged as promising electrode materials and optimizing nanostructured metal oxides in terms of their composition, morphology, electroconductivity, and defect chemistry offers a significant avenue for improving the charge storage mechanisms. This Engineering Research Initiation (ERI) project aims to study the influence of hydrogen on the growth of metal oxide nanostructures, with the ultimate goal of enhancing electrode performance in energy storage devices. The project will address a significant research gap by focusing on the synthesis and fabrication of metal oxide for use in high-energy capacity electrodes. The research not only addresses key challenges in energy storage technology, but also contributes to the advancement of clean energy initiatives, supporting national efforts for a sustainable future. This ERI project will also develop educational and early research engagement activities at Kennesaw State by increasing the participation of freshmen undergraduate students in research, engaging the research group in outreach activities to mentor high-school students, and integrating the research outcomes in undergraduate and graduate curriculum.\r\n\r\nThis project aims to investigate the role of hydrogen on the growth of multiphase and single-phase metal oxide nanostructures to enhance the electrode performance in energy storage devices. This research will develop a novel approach to promote high aspect ratio nanostructures by utilizing hydrogen diffusion and oxide defects to achieve high surface area electrodes with superior performance. While preliminary findings indicate that hydrogen diffusion influences nanostructure morphology, the mechanism of hydrogen diffusion and charge transport in metal oxide remains unknown. To achieve this goal, the project will conduct fundamental research on two fronts: 1) understanding the mechanisms of hydrogen diffusion towards controlled oxide growth, and 2) evaluating the electrochemical performance of the developed electrodes to achieve superior charge storage capacity. Understanding hydrogen-assisted growth in metal oxides will enable the development of a novel method for creating ordered electrode architecture with a binder free array of electrode platform for high and fast energy storage.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
