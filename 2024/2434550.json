 "awd_abstract_narration": "Funding is requested to support the Gallery of Fluid Motion in conjunction with the American Physical Society Division of Fluid Dynamics (DFD) 77th Annual Meeting in Salt Lake City, Utah, November 24-26, 2024. In its 2nd year, the Traveling Gallery of Fluid Motion (TGFM) is a visual record of the aesthetic and science of contemporary fluid mechanics with a museum-like exhibition component. In 2024, TGFM will partner with the Leonardo Museum in Salt Lake City, Utah, aligning with the museum\u2019s upcoming exhibition on Flight, inspired by Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s fascination with fluid dynamics. This exhibit will also be available virtually to anyone interested in the fantastic images accompanying science via a global engagement platform. NSF support will enhance TGFM\u2019s public engagement initiatives, promoting education, inspiration, diversity, inclusion, and innovation in fluid dynamics. The Exhibit will be open to the public from October 2024 - February 2025.\r\n\r\nThe chief intellectual merits of this exhibit will be (1) Community Engagement and Inclusivity: Partnerships with local communities and universities aim to create inclusive exhibitions, fostering belonging and accessibility for diverse audiences; (2) Educational Outreach and STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, and Math) Informal Learning: Collaborations with scientists, educators, and community liaisons enhance STEAM learning experiences, fostering a dynamic environment for hands-on discovery and engagement; (3) Professional Development and Capacity Building: Collaboration among artists, scientists, and educators contributes to professional growth and capacity building; and (4) Broadening Science Engagement, especially for underrepresented groups: Through the online educational resources and community events, the project aims to demystify scientific concepts, fostering broader and more accessible public engagement with science among diverse audiences. To achieve this, a professional science communicator will curate the online content, comprising science articles, interviews, interactive activities, and online panel discussions involving artists and scientists from varied backgrounds.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
