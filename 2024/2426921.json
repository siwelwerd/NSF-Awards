 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nontechnical Abstract: \r\nThis ExpandQISE project at The College of Charleston and The University of South Carolina aims to advance the fundamental understanding of topological phonons in engineered quantum materials by controlling the light - matter interaction in these materials. The research advances the field of integrated quantum phononics by systematically exploring quantum materials that possess the functionalities to develop novel quantum phonoic devices. To maximize the effectiveness of the discovery process, this project combines ultrafast optical spectroscopy and microscopy, materials synthesis and characterization, and computation and modeling to explore the generation, dynamics, and control of topological phonons in quantum materials. The collaborative research will provide necessary education for preparing CofC undergraduate students for the next quantum technology revolution and the needed workforce for economic growth in South Carolina. Special efforts are made to increase the participation of underrepresented minority and female groups in this research through the CofC admissions and institutional diversity offices.\r\n\r\nTechnical Abstract:\r\nTopological phonons are lattice vibrations in crystalline solids and a type of quantum information carrier. They advance traditional information processing systems with high frequencies (terahertz), low energy consumption, and the ability to exploit surface or boundary modes that are stable against perturbation. However, their generation and manipulation remain challenging. This project leverages the complementary expertise of two scientists to identify and characterize potential new quantum information carriers in topological materials. Through ultrafast optical spectroscopy and microscopy (Gong group, CofC), materials synthesis and characterization (Jin group, USC), and computation and modeling (collaborators), the research team aims to explore the generation, dynamics, and control of topological phonons in quantum materials. Understanding the relationship between material composition, structure, and properties is essential for controlling material properties. This collaborative effort provides strategies to control topological phonon dynamics, including frequency, amplitude, and damping. The project enables the PI to establish a quantum information science (QIS) research program at CofC through collaboration with USC, utilizing shared resources available at both institutions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
