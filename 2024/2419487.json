 "awd_abstract_narration": "Rapid habitat loss affects many species including non-human primates. Although some non-human primate species are known for their ability to persist in degraded habitats, little is known about how living in degraded habitats affects their well-being, demography, and ecological role. In response to this knowledge gap, this doctoral dissertation project examines a non-human primate species' ecological context, its responses to environmental disturbances, and the cascading effects that such responses have on its interactions with other species and its ecological role. The researchers study a non-human primate species that lives in diverse environments (protected, moderately disturbed, and highly disturbed). The study collects demographic (population size), individual size (morphometric), body composition, and fecal content data. Additionally, the researchers assess this species contribution as a seed disperser in these environments. Mathematical models and computer simulations are applied to evaluate the impact of the potential extinction of this species in these ecosystems. The study promotes international collaboration and provides training and educational opportunities for students at different levels (elementary school to PhD).  \r\n\r\nThe study analyzes the combined impacts of natural and anthropogenic disturbances on the population and body mass of a non-human primate species, using a capture-mark-release technique, morphometric surveys, and fecal analyses. The study assesses the impacts of these changes on this species\u2019 mutualistic interactions with plants, using direct examinations of several aspects of their seed dispersal services. Based on the collected demographic and dietary data, the study applies mathematical models and computer simulations to identify the effects of this species extirpation from these habitats.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
