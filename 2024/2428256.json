 "awd_abstract_narration": "Photosynthesis is the engine of life on Earth, with photosynthetic organisms such as cyanobacteria, algae, and plants playing a pivotal role in harnessing solar energy for generating vital resources to sustain life on Earth. Among these organisms, a type of cyanobacteria called Anabaena 33047 stands out for its ability to produce extracellular polysaccharide (EPS), a substance that can be turned into fibers, providing a renewable alternative to synthetic fibers like nylon or polyester, commonly derived from petroleum. This project aims to deepen our understanding and improve the production of these natural fibers, which are not only environmentally friendly but also hold the potential to revolutionize the textile industry. By doing so, it addresses urgent global challenges such as pollution and resource depletion, promising significant societal benefits by offering sustainable material options and fostering international scientific collaboration. Additionally, this project will promote inclusive and equitable research by collaborating with a historically black college and university (HBCU). This project will also create broader impacts to engage people from underrepresented groups through research dissemination, social media, and workshops. \r\n\r\nCyanobacterium, Anabaena 33047, is adept at producing and secreting large amounts of extracellular polysaccharide (EPS). Our preliminary studies have shown that EPS produced by Anabaena 33047 can be processed into strong fibers, offering a sustainable alternative to petroleum-derived fibers. Despite such potential, the intricate processes of cyanobacterial EPS biosynthesis, export, and regulation remain underexplored. Using a combination of systems biology and synthetic biology approaches, this project aims to identify and manipulate the genetic and metabolic factors that control EPS production. This will enable the tuning of EPS properties to enhance fiber strength and stretchability for industrial applications. The methodology involves creating models of EPS biosynthesis, testing various genetic modifications in Anabaena 33047, and systematically analyzing the resulting changes in EPS composition and fiber properties. Through this scientific inquiry, the project aims to lay the groundwork for scalable, sustainable production methods for biodegradable fibers, aligning with environmental goals and advancing bioengineering applications. This project is supported by the Systems and Synthetic Biology Cluster of the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences.\r\n\r\nThis collaborative US/India project is supported by the US National Science Foundation (NSF) and the Indian Department of Biotechnology (DBT), where NSF funds the US investigator and DBT funds the partners in India.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
