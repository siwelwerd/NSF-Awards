 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to support the participation of early career scientists and others in the 9th Open Science Conference of the Global Energy and Water Exchanges (GEWEX) to be held in Sapporo, Japan (July 7 \u2013 12, 2024). The GEWEX project, as part of the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP), is dedicated to understanding Earth\u2019s water cycle. The International GEWEX Project Office is responsible for planning the meeting that will focus on three themes: water and climate in the Anthropocene; extremes and risks; and water, energy and carbon processes. The conference will include an Early Career Research Workshop led by the Young Earth System Scientists (YESS), the Young Hydrologic Society (YHS), the AGU Hydrology Section Student Subcommittee (H3S) and Japanese early career researchers. As part of the conference several side events will take place (e.g., three GEWEX Panel meetings and a Ground Water Workshop).\r\n\r\nThe GEWEX conference serves three objectives: 1) opportunity for the research community to exchange ideas and strengthen collaborations; 2) serve as regional focal point and help communicate and disseminate information about climate research and GEWEX activities; and 3) it provides an opportunity for side meetings and for early career researchers to become involved with GEWEX and WCRP activities. The technical sessions will cover topics like: i) understanding, modeling and predicting all aspects of the water, energy and carbon cycles and the climate system as a whole; (ii) land surface feedbacks, including effects of land and water management; (iii) hydrological impacts and prediction; (iv) process studies involving clouds, precipitation, water vapor, aerosols, atmospheric dynamics, radiation, carbon, and land-atmosphere interactions; (v) observations and global data sets, including satellite observations; (vi) phenomena such as monsoons, storms, organized convection, the Madden-Julian Oscillation, surface fluxes, atmospheric boundary layer; vii) cascading and compound extreme events, disaster risk reduction; and vii) societal impact and the human dimension.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
