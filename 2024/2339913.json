 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-Technical abstract: Quantum mechanics determines the properties of all materials at the finest length scales. There exist some materials, however, where the quantum nature transcends from the microscopic to the macroscopic and in doing so produces incredible phenomena. These so-called quantum materials have the potential to revolutionize a number of fields, in applications ranging from low-energy computing to dissipationless current flow. Further advances in this field require the design and discovery of novel quantum materials with enhanced functionality. The research team will synthesize a new family of quantum materials that have not been made previously and probe the atomic structure of these compounds.  The team will also develop an elementary science curriculum for a dual language program and support first-generation and low-income undergraduate researchers.\r\n\r\nTechnical Abstract: Complex oxides display some of the most exotic physical states known, with phenomena as diverse as high-temperature superconductivity and ferromagnetism. To date, however, much of the work on complex oxides thin films and heterostructures has focused on the perovskite oxides. Here the research team seeks to develop the synthesis and characterization of a distinct set of oxide materials which could display additional emergent phenomena not present in the perovskite oxides.  The materials will be synthesized with reactive oxide molecular-beam epitaxy, allowing exquisite control over the deposited structures.  The project will study emergent superconductivity in LiTi2O4 as well as heavy fermion, spin-polarized and possible topological compounds.  The materials will be investigated by bulk and proximal probes to map out the atomic lattice structure, band structure and spin fluctuations to correlate with macroscopic properties. Combined this activity will provide rich insight into a fascinating class of emergent materials.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
