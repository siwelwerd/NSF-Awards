 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact of this I-Corps project is based on the development of innovative fused filament fabrication (FFF) systems that can print high-performance thermoplastics with superior interlayer adhesion at high rates. A thermoplastic any plastic that becomes pliable or moldable at elevated temperatures and solidifies upon cooling. This technology has the potential to improve the additive manufacturing industry, valued at approximately $20 billion, by addressing critical market gaps and setting new standards for manufacturing robust and reliable components. The innovation will particularly benefit industries such as aerospace, automotive, and medical devices, which require stringent performance requirements.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. The solution is based on the development of new filament materials and heating methods that addresses the limitations of existing fused filament fabrication (FFF) technologies that can print high-performance thermoplastics with superior interlayer adhesion at high rates. The project aims to validate the market need for improved FFF systems through extensive customer discovery and analysis. The project's outcomes will guide subsequent stages of product development and inform a go-to-market strategy, ultimately driving broader adoption of FFF systems and capturing a larger share of the additive manufacturing market.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
