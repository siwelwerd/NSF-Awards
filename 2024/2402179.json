 "awd_abstract_narration": "Whistler-mode waves, commonly observed electromagnetic emissions, have a significant influence on the movement of energetic electrons within our solar system\u2019s plasma. This project aims to address a crucial knowledge gap in our understanding by evaluating how whistler-mode waves scatter energetic electrons into the atmospheres of Earth and Jupiter. The scientific findings will be critical for understanding the fundamental science questions about wave-particle interactions and the resulting electron precipitation driven by whistler-mode waves, not only on Earth but also on Jupiter and potentially in other space plasma environments throughout the solar system. This project has the potential to significantly improve future models of energetic electron dynamics, marking a pivotal step toward improved space weather prediction, which becomes increasingly important for our technologically reliant society. The project involves researchers at various career stages, including a female faculty member, three early-career Co-PIs, a postdoc, graduate students, and undergraduate students. Moreover, the team plans to develop educational materials specifically designed for K-12 students and actively engage in various outreach activities. The active participation of the diverse team in robust research endeavors, along with effective mentorship and outreach initiatives, will play an important role in fostering the growth of a diverse and globally competitive STEM workforce.\r\n\r\nThe overarching science objective of this project is to conduct a comparative assessment of energetic electron precipitation driven by whistler-mode waves on Earth and Jupiter. Specifically, this project aims to achieve the following objectives at Earth and Jupiter: (1) systematically characterize the typical properties of whistler-mode waves (both chorus and hiss) and analyze the occurrence of large-amplitude whistler-mode waves; (2) evaluate the properties of energetic electron precipitation with the focus on intense precipitation; (3) examine the importance of nonlinear effects on energetic electron precipitation due to whistler-mode waves; and (4) quantify the effects of whistler-mode waves on electron precipitation across various energies in different regions. To attain the research objectives, the project team will leverage unprecedented multi-satellite observations, including data from missions such as Van Allen Probes, THEMIS, and ELFIN for Earth, along with Juno\u2019s observations of Jupiter, as well as theory and modeling. The scientific findings of this project will contribute to a more profound comprehension of the fundamental physical processes governing plasma wave and particle dynamics throughout the universe.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
