 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) is committed to enhancing the quality of undergraduate STEM education and research at Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) to broaden participation in the nation's STEM workforce. HBCU-UP works toward this goal by providing awards to develop, implement, and study innovative approaches for making dramatic improvements in the preparation and success of HBCU undergraduate students so that they may participate successfully in graduate programs and/or careers in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) disciplines. This conference advances HBCU-UP goals by convening faculty and students to explore the influence of faculty on undergraduate student success at HBCUs. The conference convenes 25-40 thought leaders to discuss the type and rationale for academic interventions used at HBCUs. Participatory, facilitated conversations explore STEM-US Center research findings and generate insights to support effective, impactful academic interventions for undergraduate student success.\r\n\r\nThe conference complements the research agenda of the HBCU STEM Undergraduate Success (STEM-US) Research Center. The STEM-US Center uses the Phenomenological Variant of Ecological Systems Theory as a theoretical framework to explore the disproportionate success of HBCUs in conferring STEM degrees to African American students. Center research has considered faculty-student interpersonal interactions and other protective factors for HBCU STEM students. The role of STEM faculty remains largely unexplored in HBCU contexts. The conference focuses on the role and influence of HBCU STEM faculty. Conference outcomes are expected to inform the STEM-US Center research agenda, future educational innovation, and a co-authored paper that documents faculty experiences and elevates the voices and contributions of those who deliver STEM education at HBCUs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
