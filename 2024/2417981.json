 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project  supports  travel of the US-based mathematicians to the international conference New Trends in Geometry, Combinatorics and Mathematical Physics, that  will be take place October 21-25, 2024 at the CNRS center la Vieille Perrotine - Oleron, France. The goal of the  project is to provide opportunities for early-career, US-based researchers and to boost the visibility and impact of US-based research. Early-career participants will benefit by acquiring new scientific knowledge from international experts and building long-term professional connections. Ultimately, participation of US-based researchers in the conference will have a positive impact on research projects conducted in the United States.\r\n\r\nThe scientific foci of the conference are differential geometry and algebraic combinatorics, with applications to mathematical physics. More specifically, applications of cluster algebras in integrable systems and mathematical physics. These applications will be a main topic of the conference, along with interactions between cluster algebras and complex geometry. Further applications of cluster algebras in physics will also be highlighted. Participants from a wide variety of backgrounds will serve to boost the exchange of methods, applications and new ideas, and will form foundations for continuing collaborations. This project is jointly funded by the Algebra and Number Theory and the Combinatorics programs. The conference website is https://indico.math.cnrs.fr/event/11259/.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
