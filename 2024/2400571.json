 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national interests by addressing the impacts of climate change on industries, focusing on energy and transportation sectors. Its impact lies in addressing a national gap in technology education related to climate change. Recent government reports underscore the urgency, citing extreme weather events, rising sea levels, increased storms, and operational disruptions. Industry will need to adapt to these challenges, and this initiative seeks to play a pivotal role in preparing professionals with the essential technical expertise and skills necessary for effective adaptation and sustainable development in the face of a changing climate. Collaborating with industry leaders, the project will identify crucial student learning objectives tailored to these challenges. The resulting analysis will be used to develop ten modules that will seamlessly integrate into existing technology programs. Workshops will educate faculty and high school teachers on module integration, while subsequent collaboration with a select group will implement the modules in a classroom setting and assess student learning outcomes. The project's commitment to evidence-based education, coupled with an educational symposium, underscores its potential to influence climate change education for technicians. This initiative not only enhances student awareness of climate change but also empowers them with the technical skills crucial for industry adaptation, meeting the needs of industry in the face of evolving climate challenges.\r\n\r\nThe project's primary goal will be to graduate students from mechanical and electrical technology programs equipped to address industry challenges related to climate change. Collaborating with industry partners, the project will employ a Knowledge, Skills, and Abilities (KSA) approach for a comprehensive analysis, pinpointing essential skills crucial for successful employment in climate change-affected industries. These insights will guide the development of ten modules aimed at educating mechanical and electrical engineering technology students on climate change, and effective preventive and mitigative technologies. Project team members will actively collaborate with industry and ATE centers to identify and integrate proven teaching practices. The modules will be introduced to technology teachers through workshops and undergo classroom testing, with assessments focusing on both understanding climate change and proficiency in associated prevention and mitigation technologies. Additionally, the project will host an educational symposium dedicated to climate change education for technicians. Findings and insights from workshops, classroom implementation, assessments, and the symposium will be disseminated to educators and industry professionals through dedicated workshops, conferences, and publications. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the Nation's economy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
