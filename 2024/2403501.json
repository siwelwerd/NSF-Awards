 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the participation of researchers based at institutions in the United States to the 21st International Congress on Mathematical Physics (ICMP) and its satellite events. The ICMP conferences are held every three years, sponsored by the International Association of Mathematical Physics. They are the most important conferences in the field, covering all areas of mathematical physics and demonstrating its richness and vitality. The 21st ICMP takes place July 1-6, 2024, in Strasbourg, France. Similarly to all the congresses since 2000, it is preceded by a Young Researchers Symposium on June 28-29, 2024, at University of Strasbourg. \r\n\r\nCombined, these events in mathematical physics make the second half of 2024 a peak time for mathematical physics and attract a large number of international researchers including many of the leading experts in a broad range of mathematical disciplines and their applications in physics. In particular, the conference focuses on recent developments in Analysis that are related to and motivated by mathematical physics. This award provides U.S. graduate students, postdoctoral scholars, early career researchers, members of underrepresented groups, and researchers with limited external funding an opportunity to attend and participate in the Congress. More information is available at https://icmp2024.org. Applications for funding supported by this award are collected through the website https://sites.google.com/msu.edu/icmp-2024-for-us.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
