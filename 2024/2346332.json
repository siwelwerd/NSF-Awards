 "awd_abstract_narration": "In an increasingly connected world, the security and privacy of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices --commonly known as \"smart devices\"-- in our homes have never been more crucial. This project aims to develop a global smart home testbed to enable empirical research in this field. By utilizing actual smart home devices and networks, this infrastructure will provide a unique environment where researchers can study IoT security and privacy under real-world conditions, as the infrastructure will be supported by actual smart home users who volunteer to share their network data. The planning effort supported through this award focuses on (1) engaging the research community to discuss their research needs, (2) iteratively test-driving various prototypes, and (3) gathering community feedback to improve the prototypes. The objective is to position the infrastructure to satisfy the diverse needs of the research community. \r\n\r\nBy moving research out of the lab and into actual homes, this project captures a wide array of devices and human behaviors that are difficult to observe in controlled environments. It will democratize access to high-quality research infrastructure, enabling institutions that lack the resources to conduct sophisticated studies on their own. This open approach not only enhances our understanding of IoT security and privacy risks but also fosters a community of interdisciplinary researchers equipped to tackle these issues. Ultimately, the insights gained from this testbed could lead to more secure and privacy-respecting smart home technologies.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
