 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial impacts of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project are to revolutionize pathology diagnostics through the development of an advanced imaging technology. This project aims to introduce a silicon chip based system that will provide fast, accurate, cellular-level resolution imaging. By improving diagnostic accuracy and reducing diagnosis times, this technology will enhance patient care, reduce the workload in pathology labs, and lower diagnostic costs. The project supports the NSF's mission to promote scientific progress and improve national health, prosperity, and welfare by providing a technological solution with substantial commercial and societal impact. The innovation will enhance scientific and technological understanding, address a significant market opportunity, and provide a durable competitive advantage. The proposed business model targets pathology laboratories as the initial market segment, with projected substantial annual revenues by the third year of production.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project focuses on developing a silicon photonic optical coherence tomography (OCT) imager for pathology diagnostics. The primary objective is to create a high-performance, portable, and cost-effective imaging solution by integrating all optical components onto a single silicon chip. The research will address key technical challenges, such as achieving high resolution and speed while maintaining a compact size. The project involves designing, prototyping, and testing the OCT imager to ensure its effectiveness in accurately identifying diagnostic tissues. The anticipated technical results include demonstrating the imager's capability to provide real-time, 3D cellular-level visualization of tissues, thereby significantly improving the pathology grossing process. This technology is expected to set a new standard in pathology diagnostics and enable broader applications in medical imaging.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
