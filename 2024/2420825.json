 "awd_abstract_narration": "The intensity of globalization processes has made Western societies more transnational. Diaspora communities \u2013 people who reside in one country but maintain attachments to their real or imagined \u201chomeland\u201d \u2013 have been increasingly mobilized for or against their country of origin. What shapes diasporic individuals\u2019 attitudes toward the homeland and their tendency to mobilize politically on this basis? This research answers this question using a survey experiment that randomly exposes individuals to one of three narratives: (1) a narrative that emphasizes contemporary danger for one\u2019s kin in the homeland; (2) a narrative that emphasizes shared trauma and common suffering; and (3) a narrative that emphasizes discrimination and rejection in the diaspora\u2019s country of residence. Doing so allows us to assess the persuasive impact of these narratives and identify whether they resonate across different sociodemographic subgroups within the diaspora.\r\n\r\nThe burgeoning literature on diaspora mobilization highlights three ideational factors that shape the attitudes of diaspora communities toward their \u201chomeland\u201d: (1) perceptions of contemporary danger for one\u2019s kin in the homeland; (2) narratives about shared trauma and common suffering; and (3) a sense of discrimination and rejection in the diaspora\u2019s country of residence. However, there is little rigorous empirical evidence assessing the impact of these factors at the individual level. This research asks whether references to danger in the homeland, shared historical trauma, or current discrimination move the diaspora\u2019s attachment to its purported \u201chomeland,\u201d the diaspora\u2019s tendency to mobilize, and the diaspora\u2019s support of their country of residence\u2019s policies toward the \u201chomeland.\u201d Using experimental methods, this research also examines whether these factors operate uniformly across different sociodemographic subgroups within the diaspora. Investigating how different narratives shape homeland attachment across subgroups will further researchers\u2019 understanding about the preservation and reproduction of diasporic identity, particularly among younger generations who did not directly experience the historic trauma, dislocation, and discrimination. Moreover, our project will also contribute to better understanding of how references to shared trauma affect group attitudes and behavior.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

I was able to survey 1,200 Jewish-Americans from across the United States who were asked to answer questions regarding their attachment to the state of Israel, their support for various policies relating to Israel, and their likelihood of engaging in various political acts (writing to a representative, participating in a rally, signing a petition etc.) in support of or against Israel. Combined with a survey I had conducted previously in 2022 (which collected information on the same questions), these data allowed me to compare changes in pubic opinion among Jewish-Americans. Importantly, I was able to re-survey several of the individuals who were surveyed back in 2022, allowing me to examine whether the same individuals had changed their opinions on Israel and American foreign policy priorities between 2022 and 2024. Surprisingly, despite the significantly changed geopolitical environment, I found no noticeable change in public opinion between the two periods.
