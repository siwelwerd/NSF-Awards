 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Improving Undergraduate STEM Education: Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSI Program), this Track 2 project aims to improve the retention and graduation of mechanical and aerospace engineering students by developing their engineering identity in their freshman/sophomore years. Past studies on engineering identity primarily focus on a single course with design components. This project will study implementing collaborative learning and design thinking in three freshman and sophomore courses to foster engineering identity. This project will generate new knowledge on how to produce a more diverse and innovative engineering workforce, which are critical for maintaining the US position as a global leader in science, technology, mathematics, and engineering (STEM).\r\n\r\nThe three objectives of this project, i.e., 1) bridge math gap, 2) build communities of practice, and 3) instill design thinking, contribute directly to the three constructs of engineering identity, i.e., performance/competence, recognition, and interests. To achieve these three objectives, the first strategy is to leverage collaborative learning by implementing in-class peer led team learning (iPLTL) in two freshman courses and collaborative learning in a sophomore gatekeeper course. The second strategy is to introduce \u201cdesign thinking\u201d as a creative, iterative, human-centric process that guides decision-making and problem solving. Students will learn and practice how to apply design thinking to solve complex math, engineering, and life problems. The principal investigators will collaborate with students participating in a summer fellows program to create course contents, including videos. The student summer fellows will also participate in undergraduate research, accelerating their transition from engineering students to engineering practitioners. Leveraging student-faculty collaborations, this project will promote teaching/learning effectiveness, culture awareness, and community supports for both students and faculty. The outcomes and findings of this project will be disseminated via conference presentations, journal publications, seminars, and social media. The HSI Program aims to enhance undergraduate STEM education and build capacity at HSIs. Projects supported by the HSI Program will also generate new knowledge on how to achieve these aims.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
