 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 2024 Protein Folding Dynamics Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) will be held January 6-7, 2024in Galveston, Texas. This seminar is primarily attended by a diverse group of graduate students and postdocs and brings together trainees from a wide range of disciplines to discuss current topics in the field of protein folding dynamics, including protein misfolding and aggregation, functional protein and enzyme dynamics, and the dynamics of intrinsically disordered proteins. The GRS provides an ideal setting to facilitate international and interdisciplinary collaborations.  It also provides key networking opportunities, as well as allowing a range of different perspectives to be discussed and compared. A special mentorship session will provide an informal venue for the trainees to learn about the intricacies of the academic job search from a panel of early-career faculty.\r\n\r\nThe 2024 Protein Folding Dynamics GRS will comprise of three formal sessions, which include talks selected from submitted abstracts, poster sessions, and a mentorship panel followed by breakout discussions with panelists. To reflect the current state-of-the-art in the field, selected talks are divided into three main scientific topics: Protein Folding Dynamics Toolkit, Protein Evolution and Design and Protein Interactions and Dynamics. To craft a fruitful, trainee-focused meeting, this two-day seminar brings together a group of more than 30 trainee scientists from various disciplines whose research focuses on understanding the molecular level details of protein folding and dynamics. A panel of pre-tenured faculty mentors will be assembled to serve as a resource for trainees considering options for the next phase of their careers. These faculty will also attend the other GRS sessions and can offer further mentorship therein. The GRS will further the field of protein folding by addressing several central topics, while highlighting how combined experimental and computational research can lead to breakthroughs in scientific understanding.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
