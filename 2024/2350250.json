 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will provide financial support for a conference on Quantum Topology, Quantum Information, and Mathematical Physics, to be held from May 27 to 31, 2024, at Texas A&M University.    The conference will bring together students and researchers interested in recent advances and new connections between the fields of quantum topology and quantum information theory and their applications to several branches of mathematics and physics, including low-dimensional topology, non-commutative geometry, operator algebra, representation theory, complexity theory, and quantum statistical physics.   Participants will be split evenly between early career and established mathematicians, and the former group will receive priority for funding from this grant.  Leading experts in the various topics will present the state of art in the subject in a way that is accessible to researchers at various career stages and emphasize new research directions and collaborations. \r\n\r\nQuantum topology deals with interactions between low-dimensional topology, the theory of quantum groups, category theory, C*-algebra theory, gauge theory, conformal and topological field theory and statistical mechanics, while quantum information and computation theory brings together ideas from classical information theory, quantum mechanics and computer science and explores how the quantum mechanical properties of physical systems can be harnessed to achieve efficient data storage and transmission, and rapid computations.  The interplay between these ideas and potential new advances and applications will be the main focus of the conference.   More information can be found at the conference website: https://sites.google.com/tamu.edu/qtqimp/home.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
