 "awd_abstract_narration": "As raising the energy of particle accelerators for new physics becomes increasingly challenging, precision measurements emerge as a promising alternative to address fundamental physics questions. This research project aims to develop an extraordinarily sensitive spin-optomechanical system for studying fundamental questions in physics, such as the limits of quantum mechanics and the nature of quantum gravity. The research team will levitate rapidly rotating nanodiamonds with nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in high vacuum, and use them to investigate coherent dynamics and geometric phases, which are accumulated during rotation along a trajectory. This may potentially lead to the development of a nanodiamond matter-wave interferometer. This breakthrough could significantly advance precision measurements and topological physics. The project also includes a strong commitment to education and outreach, involving collaboration with industry in practical applications of quantum sensing, and integrating findings into academic curricula for training undergraduate and graduate students. Additionally, the PI and graduate students will engage the public through outreach events such as the \"Quantum Open House\" at Purdue University. \r\n\r\nIn this project, the research team will directly load and trap nanodiamonds in high vacuum using an integrated surface ion trap, and explore quantum spin-optomechanical interactions between the motion of a levitated nanodiamond and its internal NV electron spin qubits for creating a nanodiamond matter-wave interferometer. The research team will systematically investigate the coherent dynamics and geometric phases of electron spin qubits in rapidly rotating nanodiamonds and using single electron spins to control the motion of these levitated nanodiamonds. Additionally, the research team will enhance spin coherence through rapid rotation and dynamical decoupling, which will contribute to the development of a nanodiamond matter-wave interferometer. This research also promises significant advancements in quantum sensing technologies using spin defects for potential practical applications in various fields.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
