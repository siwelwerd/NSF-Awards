 "awd_abstract_narration": "The HUMANS MOVE project at the University of Wyoming is a 10-week interdisciplinary summer Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site program to design, create, and innovate 3- Dimensional User Interfaces (3D UIs) to improve human sensory and motor performances in Virtual Environments. Students will be recruited from diverse backgrounds, disciplines, and underrepresented populations, especially in rural areas or where STEM opportunities are limited. The HUMANS MOVE REU Site will host ten students and provide positive research experiences, training, mentorship, state-of-the-art facilities and equipment, experiential learning activities, tailored resources, and networking connections that will continue to foster the participants\u2019 growth and success in research, graduate studies, and career development. \r\n\r\nThe activities of this REU Site broaden the participation of underrepresented populations in computing, increase enrollment and retention of those students in graduate studies, and further enhance innovation through increased diverse thinking, creativity, and innovation. The selected projects for the HUMANS MOVE REU Site focus on conducting state-of-the-art computing research in 3-Dimensional User Interfaces for Immersive Environments, such as Virtual/Augmented/Mixed/Extended Reality (VR/AR/MR/XR) or Immersive Visualizations. REU students will work on projects with and mentored by multidisciplinary teams of faculty, students, and staff in areas of computer science, electrical and computer engineering, kinesiology, visualization, art, and design. Student researchers will evaluate human physical, cognitive, or sensory challenges to inform the design and development of new interaction techniques, input devices, methods of training, system improvement, or user tools. In addition to collaborating with the research team, students will work together with users to evaluate their solutions. REU students will complete projects that have the potential to improve 3D tasks, scientific workflow, cyber safety and security, distributed environments, health, and community improvement.\r\n\r\nThis project is jointly funded by CISE/IIS and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
