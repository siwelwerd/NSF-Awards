 "awd_abstract_narration": "Agriculture in New York State faces increasing challenges from climate change, with rising temperatures and frequent flooding that threaten traditional farming practices. The Community-driven Innovations in Rice for Climate Adaptation in New York State (CIRCA-NYS) project addresses these challenges through the integration of rice farming into the local agricultural economy and landscape. This initiative aims to establish rice as a sustainable crop alternative, enhancing environmental sustainability and economic development in rural areas. By engaging local farmers, academic experts, and extension services, CIRCA-NYS promotes a community-centric, interdisciplinary approach to develop and implement environmentally sound and economically viable farming strategies. The project aims to adapt to immediate climatic challenges and foster long-term agricultural resilience and sustainability. \r\n\r\nCIRCA-NYS seeks to transform agricultural practices by integrating advanced spatial data analysis, field-based assessments, and active community involvement to develop a scalable model of sustainable rice cultivation adapted to changing biophysical and socioeconomic conditions in New York State. The project explores optimal conditions for rice farming by assessing soil types, water availability, and topographical features, alongside socio-economic factors like land use trends and changes in flood insurance risks. Methods include spatial analysis to map suitable farming areas, participatory research to identify barriers to adopting alternative practices, and pilot farms to test rice cultivation techniques. This integrative approach advances climate-smart agricultural practices and builds a robust community of practice among farmers, researchers, and policymakers. By focusing on co-developed solutions and practical experiments, CIRCA-NYS provides critical insights into sustainable farming adaptations necessary for combating the impacts of climate change on agriculture.\r\n\r\nThis project is in response to the Civic Innovation Challenge program\u2019s Track A. Climate and Environmental Instability - Building Resilient Communities through Co-Design, Adaption, and Mitigation and is a collaboration between NSF, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Department of Energy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
