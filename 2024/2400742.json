 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national interest by providing STEM curricula with Geospatial Technology (GST) modules to an underserved population (primarily Native students), to improve their mindset and persistence in science courses, so that students will recognize their potential to be successful in science and technological related courses. As a tribally based institution, the College of the Muscogee Nation is uniquely positioned to help students involved in this project find their place in high-technology fields that provide needed skills for employment that will contribute to the tribal economy. Project evaluation will investigate conditions under which improved student learning occurs.\r\n\r\nProject goals are to: 1) Create a GST-related curriculum in the STEM program, 2) Recruit Indigenous and underrepresented students, and 3) Provide professional development and training for instructors and staff. The project\u2019s broader impact involves: generating geospatial technology curricula, creating on ramps to recruit students for the project, instructor training and professional development, and securing partnerships with corporate and tribal entities. Through the tribal college mission, the College of the Muscogee Nation will become a leader in the American Indian Higher Education Consortium and promote applied technology learning opportunities through the project curricula and outreach to tribal communities. Primarily, the end result is to address workforce needs on the Reservation. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced technology fields that drive the nation's economy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
