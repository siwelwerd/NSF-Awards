 "awd_abstract_narration": "The UDare Cyber Scholarships For Service (SFS) program at the University of Delaware (UD) will advance cybersecurity education and cultivate a skilled workforce by preparing highly qualified cybersecurity professionals for service in crucial roles across federal, state, local, and tribal security sectors. This SFS project will prepare twenty undergraduate and Master's students from UD\u2019s broad cybersecurity degree programs, employing a multifaceted approach to professional development. SFS scholars will be immersed in rigorous academic training and practical, hands-on experiences through research, diverse enrichment activities, and internships. Furthermore, the UDare program will foster a diverse and globally competitive STEM workforce by actively recruiting and involving members of underrepresented groups, including women, individuals with disabilities, and minorities. This comprehensive training model addresses a critical national need for skilled cybersecurity professionals, contributing to safeguarding U.S. cyberspace against various threats. In addition, the project enhances public cybersecurity literacy, contributing significantly to societal well-being and national security.\r\n\r\nThe UDare program is designed to advance both the theoretical and practical aspects of cybersecurity. The program will provide scholarships to students from UD\u2019s undergraduate Cybersecurity Engineering and the graduate Cybersecurity degree programs. These students are guided by two faculty advisors each, ensuring a well-rounded and diverse perspective in their field of study. The curriculum covers various concentrations within cybersecurity, including Secure Software, Secure Systems, Security Analytics, and Security Management, providing a comprehensive knowledge base. A key component of the UDare SFS program is students' engagement in cutting-edge research, documented through thesis or senior projects, and their participation in cybersecurity-focused conferences and workshops. The program also includes enrichment activities like the Cybersecurity Scholars Program, Distinguished Lecture series, and Capture the Flag competitions to enhance practical skills and industry readiness. A specialized Professional Development course will prepare students for internship experiences and eventual job placements within the federal government. Finally, an independent evaluator will assess the program's effectiveness and impact, ensuring continuous improvement and accountability. \r\n\r\nThis project is supported by the CyberCorps\u00ae Scholarship for Service (SFS) program, which funds proposals establishing or continuing scholarship programs in cybersecurity and aligns with the U.S. National Cyber Strategy to develop a superior cybersecurity workforce. Following graduation, scholarship recipients are required to work in cybersecurity for a federal, state, local, or tribal Government organization for the same duration as their scholarship support.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
