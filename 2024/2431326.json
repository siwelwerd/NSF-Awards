 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this Civic Innovation Challenge (CIVIC) Disaster Response Metaverse (DRM) project is to support research on developing an innovative, immersive virtual reality platform for disaster response training. The research intends to bridge the gap between fundamental knowledge and practical experience in emergencies, particularly for communities at risk of tornadoes or flooding. The DRM works to enable first responders, local officials, and community members to engage in more realistic disaster simulations to improve preparedness, decision-making, and collaboration. By leveraging cutting-edge technology to create accessible, scalable solutions, the DRM will align with broader public safety and sustainable development goals. The research advances the understanding of effective disaster response strategies and explore how immersive technologies could transform education and training across multiple fields and applications.\r\n\r\nThe DRM research project employs a multidisciplinary approach, combining expertise in engineering, computer science, emergency management, and social sciences. The research has two key dimensions: technical development and social impact analysis. Technical development centers on optimization of immersive features to replicate real-world disaster scenarios and ensure equitable access across diverse user groups. Social impact analysis examines how participation in the metaverse influences community cohesion, trust-building, and engagement in disaster preparedness. Stage 1 activities focus on refining the DRM platform, forming interdisciplinary teams, and developing detailed research protocols. In Stage 2, the DRM is deployed in community settings, conducting pilot studies, and analyzing user interactions and learning outcomes. The project team co-creates DRM centers where civic member freely accesses the virtual platform.\r\n\r\nThis project is in response to the Civic Innovation Challenge program\u2019s Track A. Climate and Environmental Instability - Building Resilient Communities through Co-Design, Adaption, and Mitigation and is a collaboration between NSF, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Department of Energy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
