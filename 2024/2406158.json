 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) through Research on Broadening Participation in STEM projects supports the development, implementation, and study of new theory-driven models and innovations related to the participation and success of underrepresented groups in STEM undergraduate education. It is expected that the award will further the faculty member's research capability, as well as improve the recruitment, retention, and success of underrepresented groups in STEM education and the workforce. This project at Clark Atlanta University seeks to evaluate the effectiveness of the concurrent integration of scientific literacy curricula, peer mentoring, and supplemental instruction in the First Year Seminar course, as well as the gateway STEM courses for all first-year biology majors. \r\n\r\nThe project aims to enhance retention, graduation rates, and gatekeeper course pass rates for freshman biology majors at Clark Atlanta University. Employing a randomized controlled trial design, students will be randomly assigned to treatment and control groups to rigorously evaluate the impact of these interventions. Data collection will encompass pre- and post-intervention surveys, academic performance metrics, and qualitative feedback through focus groups and interviews. The project will leverage regression analysis to identify high-risk students and apply longitudinal tracking to monitor academic outcomes. The anticipated contribution includes generating new knowledge on effective strategies to support underrepresented minority students in STEM, providing evidence-based practices for educational institutions, and informing policy recommendations to enhance STEM education equity and success.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
