 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project supports the acquisition of a cutting-edge lithography system called NanoFrazor Explore for Texas State University's Nanofabrication Research Service Center. This tool enables precise fabrication of micro and nanometer scale devices without the need for traditional photomasks, using a heated nanometer-size probe tip for direct patterning. This system will enhance rapid prototyping of various experimental devices, significantly benefiting research in nano/microelectronics, photonics, and microfluidic devices. The system's capabilities will support numerous current and future research projects, improve hands-on training for students, and increase participation of underrepresented minorities in STEM fields. The status of Texas State University as a Hispanic Serving Institution ensures participation of underrepresented minorities in the research activities. The unique capabilities of the lithography system are also available for users at nearby institutions such as the University of Texas (Austin, Arlington and San Antonio) and industry through the established PREM-MRSEC partnership and collaborations.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis Major Research Instrumentation grant supports the acquisition of a state-of-the-art lithography system NanoFrazor Explore (NanoFrazor), for expanding micro/nanometer scale device fabrication capabilities in the Nanofabrication Research Service Center at Texas State University. This acquisition significantly enhances the institution's capabilities in micro/nanometer scale device fabrication. The NanoFrazor employs a heated ultra-sharp scanning probe tip for direct polymer resist removal and achieves a minimum lateral feature size of 10 nm, rivaling high-end electron beam lithography systems. Additionally, it features a direct laser sublimation module for rapid micrometer scale patterning. This system will streamline prototyping and eliminate alignment errors across different lithography steps, advancing research in areas such as photovoltaic materials, 2D materials, quantum dots, microfluidic devices and plasmonic biosensors. This acquisition removes current research barriers and complements extensive materials growth and device fabrication facilities at Texas State University.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
