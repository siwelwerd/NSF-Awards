 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at the University of Texas at Dallas focuses on how to produce dependable software that is not only reliable but also safe and secure. This site offers innovative research opportunities, especially to students from underrepresented groups or universities with limited resources. By enhancing skills through workshops and lectures in critical thinking, oral and written communication, problem solving, and research methods, students will be well equipped for graduate education and research careers in science and technology. Interactions with mentors and fellow participants will provide avenues to exchange ideas and stimulate discussions. Research connections will be established with students\u2019 home institutions to continue collaboration among multiple institutions in different geographical regions. A website will be used to publicize research articles, videos and slides of lectures and project presentations, as well as announcements for effective community outreach.\r\n\r\nThe focus of this research is on examining and improving existing methodologies and current practices for safety and security assurance, and reliability prediction; investigating issues such as how software dependability may affect the software lifecycle; and studying how software processes, methods and tool support should be evolved for dependable software. Special emphasis will be on usability studies to evaluate AI-enhanced techniques for automated code and test case generation, vulnerability detection and explanations, etc. Software for blockchain-based smart contracts and autonomous systems like self-driving vehicles will be addressed. The findings will be compiled to provide a comprehensive guideline of how software safety, security, and reliability can be achieved effectively and efficiently. A key aspect of this site is the close collaboration with industry. REU students will take field trips to industry sponsors, allowing them to speak directly with practitioners to better understand how dependable software is applied to real-life applications. Workshops on technical writing and oral presentation will be held to improve proficiency in preparing and delivering technical reports. Seminars on ethics and professional responsibility will also be given to ensure REU students behave properly and respectfully. `\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
