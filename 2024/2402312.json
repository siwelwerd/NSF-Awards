 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Aleyah Dawkins is awarded a National Science Foundation Mathematical and Physical Sciences Ascending Postdoctoral Research Fellowship (NSF MPS-Ascend) to conduct a program of research, education, and activities related to broadening participation by groups underrepresented in STEM. This fellowship supports the research project entitled \"MPS-Ascend: Determining Network Properties Using Graph Theory\". The project activities will be conducted at the host institution, Carnegie Mellon University, under the mentorship of Dr. Michael Young.\r\n \r\n\r\nDawkins will research various topics in graph theory, addressing extremal problems with relations to post-exascale supercomputing and networks more generally as well as anti-Ramsey problems. Dawkins will work to broaden participation in mathematics by creating and implementing a program in Western Pennsylvania to teach and review the mathematical skills needed for the trade school entry exams, advancing mathematical understanding and enabling underrepresented groups, particularly those members outside of high school, to take part in apprenticeships and trade opportunities. To better support those currently in the mathematics community, Dawkins will lead undergraduate research as part of the Summer Undergraduate Applied Mathematics Institute and mentor students as part of the Mellon College of Science Summer Scholars Program at Carnegie Mellon University.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
