 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-technical summary\r\n\r\nFunded by the Division of Materials Research at the National Science Foundation, this Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site enables 10 undergraduate students per year to engage in a 10-week intensive research project revolving around semiconductor materials or technologies.  This experience aims to prepare students for the rapidly evolving semiconductor industry by immersing participants in research spanning novel materials, first principles computation, device fabrication, and sustainability, while simultaneously fostering students\u2019 sense of identity as scientists. The site is designed to (i) attract and retain STEM students early in their academic careers, specifically targeting those less likely to thrive in traditional STEM settings, (ii) to increase diversity in STEM by partnering with various diversity-focused programs for recruiting as well as for on-going support during the program, and (iii) to foster robust, enduring mentoring relationships, extending beyond immediate REU experiences, and fortifying the students\u2019 sense of belonging and commitment to STEM fields.   The program also places emphasis on STEM communication to help undergraduates convey specialized lab knowledge in accessible language through workshops, practical experiences, and a range of media.\r\n \r\nTechnical Summary\r\n\r\nThis REU site takes a multidisciplinary approach to addressing critical needs within the semiconductor industry, spanning from fundamental to applied research.  The research projects selected for this program highlight the vast and interdisciplinary nature of semiconductor research.  Projects span optical nanomaterials, novel materials for thermoelectrics and quantum computing, computational materials science, wide bandgap semiconductors, device fabrication and characterization, microsystems, and sustainability and recyclability.  Accordingly, the faculty mentors in the proposed site have diverse backgrounds and appointments spanning five different degree programs (Electrical Engineering, Environmental Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Materials Science and Engineering, and Chemistry).   This site marries the expertise of MSU faculty with the on-campus capabilities of the Fraunhofer USA Center Midwest for Coatings and Diamond Technologies, a non-profit that bridges the gap between academic research and industrial needs. The diversity of research projects and mentors promotes an interdisciplinary learning experience, fosters communication skills, and provides a solid foundation for students joining the evolving semiconductor landscape. The knowledge generated through this program holds substantial promise to drive innovation and cater to the emergent needs of the semiconductor industry, thereby contributing meaningfully to both academic research and industrial development.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
