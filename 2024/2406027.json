 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) through Targeted Infusion Projects supports the development, implementation, and study of evidence-based, innovative models and approaches for improving the preparation and success of HBCU undergraduate students so that they may pursue science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) graduate programs and/or careers. The goal of this project is to enhance the educational framework of the Biology and Forensic Science programs at Albany State University by infusing data science competencies into existing courses and developing new upper-level courses.\r\n\r\nDuring the project, faculty will be trained in data science techniques, enabling them to implement infused data science modules and teach new courses. Students will engage in both course-based and mentored research projects that leverage their newly acquired data science knowledge, fostering critical thinking and problem-solving skills. In addition, a summer camp will introduce pre-college students to data science. By equipping underrepresented minority students with in-demand data science skills, the project will enhance their career prospects and earning potential, contributing to economic development and social mobility. Furthermore, this initiative will produce graduates capable of addressing complex societal challenges through data-driven approaches, advancing national health, prosperity, and scientific progress in the rapidly evolving fields of biology and forensic science.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
