 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national interest through enhancing students\u2019 scientific literacy by helping them develop a more complex understanding of scientific uncertainty. Science inherently involves a level of uncertainty \u2013 new information and data can change theories, predictions often come up short, and measurements can be imprecise. Introducing students to scientific uncertainty in science classes is expected to enhance students\u2019 scientific literacy and ability to understand the uncertainties associated with scientific research and knowledge. The project will be an important opportunity to develop insights about how to teach scientific uncertainty at the undergraduate level\u2013for which there is not yet any established research. The project will culminate in a guide designed to help faculty members at institutions across the country implement similar concepts in their own courses. Not only will enhanced understanding of scientific uncertainty help students to better understand the nature of science, but it will also help them communicate scientific findings more effectively with the broader public. The project thereby supports the NSF\u2019s mission to promote the progress of science.\r\n\r\nThere are two research goals of the project: exploring how the integration of scientific uncertainty within the context of existing STEM courses impacts (1) understanding of scientific uncertainty and (2) students\u2019 ability to communicate about scientific uncertainty. It is expected that the integration of scientific uncertainty in STEM courses will positively impact both measures. The project will begin with a workshop offered to current faculty members at Morningside University which trains them in methods in teaching scientific uncertainty. Participating faculty members will design an uncertainty module to integrate into their courses which highlights scientific uncertainty in the context of the course material. The project team will conduct pre- and post-module implementation surveys and interviews (based on established measures of scientific literacy and uncertainty) to assess the changes in student perception and understanding of uncertainty as well as their ability to communicate what they have learned. The effectiveness of the modules will be evaluated by comparing the experimental group to control classes, where there is no added module about scientific uncertainty. Both within-group and between-group effects will be considered while controlling for outside factors, including instructor, major, rurality, and student gender. The NSF IUSE:EDU Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through the Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
