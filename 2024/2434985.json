 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ensuring Indigenous Data Sovereignty principles are embedded in the research ecosystem is an important step to ensure that the move towards findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable (FAIR) and open data also supports equity and justice for Indigenous communities. These CARE publishing guidelines (Collective benefit, Authority to control, Responsibility and Ethics) must cover a variety of topics ranging across the publishing workflow, from submission and initial evaluation to peer review, production, and post-publication operations, and must have buy-in from all participants to be successful. The team, consisting of authors of the CARE Principles and leaders from the National Information Standards Organization (NISO) and the American Geophysical Union (AGU) Publications and Open Science Leadership teams, will convene an in-person/hybrid workshop to develop these guidelines and push towards adoption and implementation. This workshop, which has been preceded by a series of online workshops and meetings to develop draft guidelines, will bring together Indigenous researchers, editors, publishers, and boundary spanners around adoption of the CARE principles, discussion on implementation solutions and concerns, and feedback on the draft guidelines and will push towards implementation of the CARE Principles in the research publication ecosystem, helping embed greater justice and equity in research.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
