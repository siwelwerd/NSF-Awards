 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the 21st annual Graduate Student Topology and Geometry Conference, to \r\nbe held at Michigan State University from April 12-14, 2024.  This conference is specifically \r\naimed at graduate students, with many of the talks delivered by student participants. The \r\nconference will bring together students in different stages of their graduate studies, and will \r\nprovide a venue for students from a diverse collection of institutions and geographic regions to \r\ncome together and interact. It aims to create a highly collaborative and inclusive environment \r\nthat will stimulate research and foster lasting connections between researchers at particularly \r\ncrucial moments early in their careers. The conference will also provide a venue for students to \r\nhear about cutting edge research from established senior leaders and early-career faculty. \r\n\r\nA principal goal for this conference is to give graduate students the opportunity to present their \r\nresearch. The majority of the talks at the conference will be given by students, and there will \r\nalso be a poster session where students can present their work. Graduate students will learn \r\nabout the current frontiers of research in geometry and topology, within an inclusive and \r\nwelcoming community of scholars. Talks will range across many active subfields of topology \r\nand geometry. There will be plenary talks by Julie Bergner (University of Virginia), Ciprian \r\nManolescu (Stanford University), and Gabor Szekelyhidi (Northwestern University), as well as \r\ntalks by early-career faculty members Carolyn Abbott (Brandeis University), Anthony Conway \r\n(University of Texas at Austin), Colleen Delaney (University of California, Berkeley),  Antoine \r\nSong (California Institute of Technology),  Iris Yoon (Wesleyan University), and  Allen Yuan \r\n(Institute for Advanced Study/Northwestern University). These faculty talks will also provide the \r\nopportunity for early-career researchers to engage with experts outside of their home institution, \r\nexpanding their network of mathematical scientists. The conference URL is \r\nhttps://sites.google.com/view/gstgc2024msu/home\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
