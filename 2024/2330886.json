 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research investigates how climate change and adaptation affect reproductive decision-making by Kalaallit, the Inuit of Greenland. Decisions about reproduction and family size are influenced by availability of social, economic, and natural resources, while climate change is increasingly affecting Inuit ways of life and local economies, including hunting and fishing. Additionally, this work will identify how policymakers consider fertility and reproductive health in climate adaptation planning. In the broader context of global challenges related to fertility and climate change, this research promotes an equitable approach to solving complex problems of natural resource availability and population health. Findings will inform climate adaptation planning in other Arctic contexts, particularly among circumpolar Indigenous communities. This project promotes the National Science Foundation mission to advance historically underrepresented groups in science by engaging women and Kalaallit knowledge holders as partners in research.\r\n\r\nThis research is based in ecological systems theory and grounded in the principles of community-based participatory research. Semi-structured interviews will be conducted with 40 reproductive-aged (18\u201349 years old) men and women living in two communities in Greenland. Interviews will explore their perspectives on climate change and identify factors that influence their fertility decisions. In-depth interviews will be conducted with 25 key stakeholders and policymakers who work in hunting and fishing industries, ecotourism, government, and healthcare. Interviews will be analyzed with input from a Kalaallit community research partner. Results will be disseminated to community members, scientists, and policymakers in a culturally relevant format, including through a community gathering. Feedback will be collected to contextualize the findings and to identify opportunities for implementation. Research results have implications for Arctic social science research and policy arenas, including healthcare, natural resource economics, and sustainable development.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
