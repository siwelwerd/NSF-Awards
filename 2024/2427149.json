 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-technical Abstract:\r\nEmbarking on the frontier of quantum information science and engineering, this project seeks to pioneer new quantum devices by merging two-dimensional (2D) quantum materials with single molecules. The overarching goal of this project to create controllable, repeatable, and miniaturized quantum devices that promise enhanced sensitivity, precision, and scalability for applications in quantum sensing, and beyond. Beyond scientific advancement, this endeavor promises significant societal impact through educational outreach and workforce development. Establishing a cutting-edge nanolithography facility at the University of Missouri-St. Louis will empower researchers while inspiring local high school and undergraduate\r\nstudents through a new quantum device technology course and research experience. This initiative aims to ignite passion and prepare future leaders for the transformative opportunities arising from quantum science and engineering.\r\n\r\nTechnical Abstract:\r\nThis project aims to address the challenges of developing scalable and controllable single-molecule field effect transistors using advanced techniques in 2D materials and atomic force microscopy (AFM) nanolithography. Leveraging the unique properties of 2D van der Waals materials, we will fabricate nanoelectrodes and gates with unprecedented precision to create composite structures with single molecules. By synthesizing functional molecules designed for ultrafast switching and tuning of quantum properties, our objective is to establish foundational technologies for optical quantum switches and modulators. Our research will strategically manipulate electronic, optical, and quantum states within the integrated single molecules-2D materials devices, endeavoring to advance quantum computing and optoelectronics. Key initiatives include 1) establishing an advanced AFM facility, 2) synthesizing functional molecules for seamless integration with 2D nanoelectrodes, 3) exploring light-molecule interactions at the singlemolecule and single-photon level, and 4) extending applications into biomedical research for enhanced understanding and detection of biological processes. Through interdisciplinary collaboration and innovative methodologies, this project is poised to uncover significant discoveries at the intersection of quantum physics and nanotechnology.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
