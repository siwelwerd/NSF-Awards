 "awd_abstract_narration": "Spinal cord injury (SCI) is one of the leading causes of paralysis in the US. Over 1.4 million people live with SCI-related disabilities, which leads to lower participation and gives rise to substantial individual and societal costs. Most of the current neurotechnology for the spinal cord system relies on directly injecting electricity into the tissues. However, this type of electrical approach is inadequate to find out which type of cells contributes to injury recovery because electricity affects all the neurons in certain areas without selection. To overcome such limitations, this CAREER project seeks to develop a new soft device technology to study the spinal cord system using light, electricity, drug, and virus gene carriers. The development of this neurotechnology requires knowledge from multiple disciplines. Therefore, this project opens various educational opportunities for students with a broad interest in STEM. The investigator aims to launch an interdisciplinary neuroengineering program across the engineering and neuroscience departments at UMass Amherst. This program will combine research and educational activities through the development of a curriculum inclusively designed for students with disabilities, an interactive online hub, and a series of student-centered neurotechnology-themed outreach activities for K-12 students.  \r\n\r\nThe investigator\u2019s long-term career goal is to establish engineering platform methodologies to investigate the nervous system and ultimately develop therapeutics for nervous system dysfunction. Using the knowledge of materials engineering and neuroscience, the investigator hypothesizes that the development of a new multifunctional soft neural probe technology can advance a holistic understanding of neural pathophysiology in SCI. The research goals will be accomplished through four specific tasks: (1) Developing a new multifunctional soft neural probe technology with polymer engineering approaches. The optical and mechanical properties of hydrogel materials can be fine-tuned by tweaking their underlying nano- and micro-scale structures. Optimizing the material properties of the hydrogel component allows the probe to transmit light to the spinal cord target areas for optical neural modulation and recording, and to adapt to the spinal cord tissue movement in vivo. (2) Testing the multifunctionality and long-term viability of the soft neural probes in vivo. The soft neural probes are designed to allow optical stimulation and photometric recording, electrical recording, drug infusion, and virus delivery within miniaturized devices without constraining natural movement.(3) Investigating spinal locomotor circuits with soft neural probes using a series of locomotor behavioral tests to assess SCI functional recovery. (4) Applying the soft neural probes for genetic and pharmacological interventions to promote functional recovery in SCI mouse models.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
