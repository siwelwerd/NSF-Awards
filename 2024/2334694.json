 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research plan of this project is to study the formation and function of structures called Cajal Bodies (CBs) within the nucleus of plant cells.  These structures bind RNA inside the nucleus and appear to respond to stressful conditions such as heat or dehydration.  The research will examine how CBs change during these stressful conditions.  The educational plan of this project will allow high school and undergraduate students to pursue research projects towards understanding basic aspects of fundamental concepts in cell biology, using plants as model systems.  The students will learn and acquire essential skills to perform a variety of meaningful experiments in the laboratory.  In parallel, the investigator has created an innovative educational program \u201cPEER\u201d (Plant Educational Experience in Research) run by students with the goal to elevate interest in the STEM field and to engage students from underrepresented backgrounds in relevant and stimulating laboratory experiences to develop curiosity and understanding about science, biology, and biotechnology.  This outreach and the research program will train students in the laboratory, give them exposure to innovative research in the fields of nuclear dynamics and quantitative cell biology of plants, and encourage them to pursue careers in the biology.  The research project will bring a unique perspective to the classroom that will enhance the development, recruitment, and retention of minority students in the region, while creating an innovative training environment for students from the surrounding Hispanic and Native American population in Southern Colorado.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to use land plants to study the biological function of biomolecular condensates using the Cajal body (CB) as an experimental system.  CBs are evolutionary conserved, fluid, biomolecular assemblies within the nuclei of a wide variety of organisms. These dynamic, biopolymer-rich structures contain phase-separated intrinsically disordered proteins and nucleic acids and have been implicated in the assembly and metabolism of several kinds of non-coding RNAs such as the telomerase RNA component, small nuclear ribonucleoproteins, and small interfering RNAs.  In this project we will be using a robust molecular genetic approach combined with genomics and fluorescent in vivo microscopy techniques to investigate the structure and function of CBs in an undergraduate setting.  This project will be focused on studying a collection of mutant plants with the main goal of understanding two basic questions in cell biology: \u201cHow does a nuclear biomolecular condensate shape development and cell architecture in plant cells?\u201d and \u201cHow is CB composition, assembly and dynamics controlled during stress?\u201d  The effectiveness of this research will be significant, as it will investigate a new link between this nuclear structure and biotic stress response.  Furthermore, the project will increase our understanding of the basic mechanism of RNA biogenesis and nuclear body formation, as well as learning. how the nuclear environment and homeostasis of the CB is affected over time.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
