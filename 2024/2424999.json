 "awd_abstract_narration": "Coastal margins along the Atlantic seaboard are experiencing significant changes due to sea level rise, causing the intrusion of saltwater into freshwater systems. This inundation and groundwater salinization has led to the emergence of \u201cghost forests,\u201d characterized by stressed and dead trees, which are altering the ecology and hydrology of coastal ecosystems. This research will study the impact of sea level rise on the health of coastal forests through changes in hydrological processes, with a particular emphasis on stemflow (precipitation intercepted by trees and channeled down the trunks to the soil). Stemflow plays a crucial role in transporting nutrients and organic matter to the forest floor, as well as soil moisture recharge in near-trunk soils. The research will provide new insights into coastal forest resilience and inform strategies for mitigating the effects of sea level rise. Further, the project will develop publicly available training modules to disseminate knowledge about the flow and dynamics of water in coastal forests and provide interdisciplinary training to undergraduate and graduate students. \r\n\r\nThe project will investigate the impacts of sea level rise on stemflow dynamics and associated hydrological and biogeochemical processes in coastal forests along a transect from healthy to ghost forests. Field measurements, laboratory analyses, and statistical modeling approaches will be used to understand stemflow's role in the ecohydrological responses of coastal ecosystems to changing environmental conditions. Results will inform efforts to enhance ecosystem resilience and adaptation to sea level rise by elucidating how coastal forests respond to stressors such as soil salinity, vegetation changes, and hydrological dynamics.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
