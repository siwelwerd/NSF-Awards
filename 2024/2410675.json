 "awd_abstract_narration": "Scientific computing touches all modern technology from the design of batteries and photovoltaics to understanding properties of nanomaterials and pharmaceuticals.  Quantum computers promise to speed up a broad range of scientific computations, but current quantum computers lack the scale or precision to outperform standard computers. The Quantum Advantage Class Trapped Ion (QACTI) project is designing and constructing an ion trap quantum computer to demonstrate a scientific computation beyond the capabilities of a standard computer. The QACTI project is a collaboration between scientists, computer scientists, and engineers working towards the common goal of achieving scientific quantum advantage. Prototype devices and methods are being tested to determine the best path forward. The collaborative effort combines advanced engineering solutions for trapped atomic ions with forward-looking integrated control technologies that allow for exploration and optimization of quantum algorithms by domain specialists. The project is also building a quantum workforce with a focus on training undergraduate students. The effort in the Pilot phase of the program focuses on working with the broader community to clarify promising directions in both hardware and applications. \r\n\r\nThe project involves the co-design of an ion trap quantum computer tailored to the most promising scientific applications.  Research directions include the exploration of new quantum algorithms for scientific computing, the development of an open-source and flexible control system, and the scalable implementation of parallel operations on multiple ion chains. The research program concentrates on four intertwined activities to develop the quantum computer. First, the project formulates the specific ion trap hardware architecture for the device, driven by aggressive performance metrics needed to execute the desired application space. Second, the project innovates on the component technologies of the QACTI system, such as optical control systems including integrated optical devices and ion trap and vacuum packaging solutions.  Third, the project identifies a particular class of quantum algorithms to be pursued, likely involving a hybrid compute model that takes full advantage of standard computers. Fourth, the project creates improved software expressions that map high level applications to native architectural elements such as gate protocols, connectivity, and qubit modularity. The project is creating and implementing a workforce development program to train future researchers in quantum information science and engineering.\r\n\r\nThis project advances the objectives of Quantum Information Science and Engineering at NSF in response to the National Quantum Initiative Act for the continued leadership of the United States in QIS and its technology applications.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
