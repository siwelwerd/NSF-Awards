 "awd_abstract_narration": "Atomically thin semiconductors and quantum materials hold promise for revolutionizing electronic devices, quantum computing, and advanced sensing technologies. However, scientific studies show that these materials can be easily damaged during the manufacturing process for applications. In this project, the PI will investigate the underlying reasons why these ultrathin semiconductors and quantum materials degrade when exposed to commonly found manufacturing environments (air and other gases). Building on this, this research project aims to find effective ways to protect these surfaces from the environment by decorating various organic chemicals on their surfaces. In addition, the project will explore how the electronic and chemical behavior of the surface changes after being engineered with these chemicals. The educational portion of the research will engage high school students through the 'World of Quantum Materials' program.  Also, the PI will provide research opportunities designed to inspire and empower the next generation of scientists and engineers.\r\n\r\nThe research project will focus on the degradation kinetics of emerging halide and telluride-containing quantum materials and effective ways to improve their stability using innovative surface chemistry techniques. The testbed material systems will include technologically relevant yet environmentally sensitive halide and telluride-based quantum materials, including recently discovered two-dimensional magnets. The primary scientific problem will center around understanding the kinetics and rate-determining steps of degradation processes within these materials. To achieve this, advanced in-situ spectroscopy and microscopy techniques will be employed, ranging from bulk to monolayer levels, and under various light exposure and gaseous/liquid environments. With the knowledge gained from the degradation mechanisms, the project will establish aryl salt, maleimide click-chemistry, and carboxyl acid chemical functionalization methods to improve material stability. Comprehensive adsorption isotherm and kinetics studies will aim to refine surface chemical reactions and chemical processes to achieve designer functionalization with minute consistency and repeatability. Lastly, comprehensive in-situ and ex-situ characterization studies will be carried out to assess the quantum properties of the functionalized materials within the 3D to 2D limit, and to understand the impact of the amount of functionalization (areal coverage) and thickness. The successful outcome of this project will introduce novel chemical approaches to enhance material stability without compromising the unique properties and possibly discovering new ones. The educational activities will emphasize K9-12 education through the 'World of Quantum Materials' program, and undergraduate, master\u2019s and Ph.D. level higher education with a focus on diversity and inclusivity.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
