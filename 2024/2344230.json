 "awd_abstract_narration": "Water exists in many forms in our communities: as drinking water, sewage, stormwater, groundwater, lakes, and rivers. This water is managed to reduce pollution or flooding and to provide safe water for human consumption. While the water systems that support communities have served us well over time, they have historically been designed around a linear \u201cuse, then dispose\u201d approach. Water that is used to convey wastes generated by human activities in buildings (e.g., from toilets, laundry, showers, garbage disposals, and others) often contains materials that, if captured, have value but, if not captured, can cause pollution. Therefore, some of the components in this used water (typically called \u201cwastewater\u201d) are not waste. This project is focused on moving away from the traditional linear approach to \u201cwastewater\u201d management and to, instead, create a circular approach where valuable materials are captured, processed, and reused for beneficial purposes. This circular approach is called \u201csource separation.\u201d This project focuses on one kind of source separation that captures nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) from used water to create fertilizers. \r\n\r\nFor this project, the type of source separation used as a demonstration of what is possible is based on urine separation, where most of the NPK nutrients are found. The research approach includes four thrusts during the Phase 1 project. Thrust 1 applies user-centered design and public engagement methods to understand perceptions of urine separation and to guide both system design and future engagement activities. Thrust 2 focuses on policy and rule-making, primarily in Michigan but with preliminary work in the large states of Arizona, Illinois, and New York so as to provide a strong foundation for the development of a national regulatory framework by Phase 2. Thrust 3 involves system design where research outcomes will be translated into the preliminary design of a Source Separation Demonstration Facility. Thrust 4 will initiate the development of a commercialization plan and advance a workforce plan to support the source separation industry. This project includes workshops, stakeholder engagement, and other activities to fill gaps that allow the team to develop a scalable plan in support of Phase 2 goals.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
