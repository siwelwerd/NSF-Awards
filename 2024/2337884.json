 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research funded by this Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER) award intends to formalize bidirectional exchange between humans and robots as a closed-loop dynamical system. The research is inspired by the need for assistive robots that help elderly and disabled adults perform everyday tasks. The crucial challenge lies in fostering seamless and safe interaction between humans and robots. When people rely on assistive robots, they need robots that learn what the user wants (i.e., the robot understands the human) and clearly communicate their intent (i.e., the human understands the robot). The investigator's team will develop hardware and software tools to facilitate communication between robots and humans through visual, auditory, and haptic interfaces. This project will also support robotics education by i) teaching deaf and blind high school students to build interfaces that communicate with assistive robot arms; ii) mentoring college seniors as they program \"learn & share\" robots that test the limits of the unified framework; and by iii) bringing engineering faculty outside of traditional inclusion groups into a safe space to discuss their journeys. \r\n\r\nThe insight driving this research is that effective communication informs learning and vice versa. Users with knowledge about their robot's learning enhance their ability to operate it, while the robot's learning dictates what it should communicate. With this insight in mind, research performed in association with this CAREER award has three main objectives: (from human to robot) learning to assist the human robustly and intuitively, (from robot to human) communicating robot learning with personalized and interpretable feedback, and (co-adaptation) unifying learning and communication under a single, interconnected dynamical system that allows the robot and the human to interact and adapt. User studies will evaluate these contributions, involving participants controlling a robot arm in daily living activities. A unified formalism where learning and communication are two components of the same mathematical framework is the main scientific contribution. By combining these elements, the project transcends the limitations of separate development tracks for learning and communication, advancing knowledge in previously unattainable ways. The project's educational and outreach plan complements these research objectives and teaches the next generation of engineers to deeply consider how users understand and co-adapt to new autonomous technologies.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
