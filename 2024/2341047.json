 "awd_abstract_narration": "Prior to the global pandemic, mental and neurological health conditions such as anxiety and depression were already increasing at alarming rates. Now, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), post pandemic incidence of such conditions has increased by 25-35% worldwide and the WHO is calling for all countries to step up mental health services and support. This highlights the need for more accessible and less invasive treatment options for neurological disorders. Electrical neurostimulation methodologies, such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), have proven effective in treating various neurological disorders. TMS stimulates the brain using short-duration pulses of electrical current induced by a magnetic field. However, TMS requires stable high-power systems typically found in hospital settings. TMS treatment plans involve daily hospital visits for three weeks, or sometimes multiple treatments in a single day, which limits accessibility to patients who are already managing depression or anxiety symptoms such as social withdrawal and sleep irregularities that disrupt their everyday routines. Moreover, attending regular in-person treatment sessions may not be feasible for those in rural or low-income demographics. However, nanosecond electrical pulses (NEPs), distinguished by their high intensity and extremely narrow pulse width, have emerged as a promising therapeutic approach for various neurological disorders. NEP has demonstrated remarkable efficacy in stimulating cells and nerves without causing harm and has potential for portable devices that would help reduce the need for hospital visits and greatly increase accessibility. This project seeks to understand the limitations of traditional NEPs and find solutions to adapt them to smaller devices. The project will produce a medical device prototype incorporating the research findings, broadening the range of non-invasive, accessible neurological treatment options for patients. The project's K-12 outreach, in collaboration with Sierra Nevada Journeys and employing biosensors in Family Science Nights and adult programs, will enhance STEM education through their feedback expertise.\r\n\r\nNEPs offer substantial neuromodulation potential, capable of replicating physiological stimuli for non-invasive treatment of neurological disorders. Despite their potential, NEPs encounter obstacles in non-invasive in-vivo applications due to constraints in penetration depth and signal distortion through human or animal body. The objectives of this study are to (1) understand the limitations of traditional NEPs and find solutions to adapt them to smaller devices, (2) address the issue of signal distortions caused by varying anatomical differences, and (3) develop a medical device prototype that incorporates solutions to the aforementioned challenges. Leveraging the potential of NEPs, the research will employ RF signals for enhanced penetration, utilize deep-learning techniques for anatomical compensation, and incorporate wider pulse widths and MHz pulse repetition rates to lower the threshold voltage. The use of digitally generated RF-NEP could represent a significant innovative shift in neurostimulation methodology. This non-invasive approach allows for deeper penetration into animal bodies while including specific waveforms that satisfy specific needs. The integration of these innovative solutions into the design of a new medical device speaks to the translational potential of this research. This project anticipates advancing theoretical knowledge and a concrete, tangible improvement in neurostimulation treatment methods, contributing significantly to the broader neuroscience and neurological therapeutics field.\r\n\r\nThis project is jointly funded by the Communications, Circuits and Sensing Systems (CCSS) Program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
