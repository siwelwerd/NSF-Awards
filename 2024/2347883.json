 "awd_abstract_narration": "Compounds that contain a transition metal connected to a hydrogen atom, referred to as transition metal hydrides, are critical for the synthesis of fine and commodity chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and precursors to plastics. In this project, Professor Nilay Hazari from Yale University is developing a fundamental understanding of how transition metal hydrides transfer their hydrogen atom to organic compounds, which is a key step in many catalytic cycles. This knowledge is crucial for designing improved and new transition metal hydrides, which will transfer their hydrides faster and with more selectivity to organic compounds. Both experimental and theoretical methods are used to understand the reactivity of transition metal hydrides and one hypothesis being tested is that a model currently used to explain electron transfer reactions can also be used to explain hydride transfer reactions. The research is complemented by Professor Hazari\u2019s involvement in a series of outreach activities related to chemistry generally and catalysis specifically, which cater to students from underrepresented minorities in science. These activities include educating the general public about chemistry through demonstrations, organizing a five-lecture summer program on catalysis for high school students in the New Haven area, and hosting undergraduates to perform research in Professor Hazari\u2019s laboratory.\r\n\r\nWith funding from the Chemical Structure, Dynamics & Mechanisms-B of the Chemistry Division, Professor Nilay Hazari of the Department of Chemistry at Yale University is developing understanding of hydride transfer reactions involving transition metal hydrides. This knowledge provides guidance about the design of catalysts and optimization of reaction conditions for the plethora of reactions that involve hydride transfer, such as carbon dioxide reduction to methanol. Specifically, by measuring the rate of hydride transfer from a metal hydride to an organic acceptor, the kinetic hydricity of a metal hydride is determined. Independently, the thermodynamic hydricity of the same metal hydride is measured using equilibrium exchange reactions or electrochemistry. By correlating thermodynamic and kinetic hydricity, linear free energy relationships are developed. These relationships enable the evaluation of hypotheses relating to whether secondary coordination sphere effects such as hydrogen bonding or electrostatic effects stabilize the transition state for hydride transfer and whether hydride transfer reactions can be modelled using Marcus theory. Density Functional Theory calculations are carried out in parallel with the experimental work and probe the structure and energy of transition states and intermediates. Professor Hazari is actively engaged in outreach programs focused on increasing the representation of students from underrepresented minorities in chemistry. He hosts a public lecture that explains fundamental principles of chemistry through demonstrations, runs a short course on catalysis for high school students, and enables undergraduates from diverse backgrounds to perform research in his laboratory.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
