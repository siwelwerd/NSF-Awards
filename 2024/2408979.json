 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMP) program assists universities and colleges in their efforts to significantly increase the numbers of students matriculating into and successfully completing high quality degree programs in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) disciplines in order to diversify the STEM workforce and supports the production of scholarly research in STEM broadening participation. Particular emphasis is placed on transforming undergraduate STEM education through innovative, evidence-based recruitment and retention strategies, and relevant educational experiences in support of racial and ethnic groups historically underrepresented in STEM disciplines: Blacks and African Americans, Hispanic and Latino Americans, American Indians, Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians, and Native Pacific Islanders. These strategies facilitate the production of highly competitive students motivated to pursue graduate education or careers in STEM. For the United States (U.S.) to remain globally competitive, it is vital that it taps into the talent of all its citizens and provides exceptional educational preparedness in STEM areas that underpin the knowledge-based economy.\r\n\r\nThe Tampa Bay Bridge to the Baccalaureate Alliance (hereafter the \u201cAlliance\u201d) is a partnership led by St. Petersburg College in collaboration with the State College of Florida Manatee-Sarasota and Hillsborough Community College, that seeks to increase the number of students transferring to baccalaureate programs in STEM by increasing participants\u2019 math literacy and outcomes using evidence-based supports and increasing persistence, retention, and success of participants. The Alliance facilitates this by providing advising, foundational math support, peer engagement, faculty mentorship, and experiential learning across the Tampa Bay area under the paradigm of evidence-based best practices which emphasizes helping these students gain a stronger academic foundation and increasing their own sense of scientific identity and places emphasis on mentorship opportunities. Partnering with a network of community and state colleges on the West Coast of Florida, along with industry, K-12 education, and 4-year college and university partners, the Alliance has built a collaborative set of activities and research initiatives based on shared academic priorities and support to strengthen the region\u2019s STEM ecosystem. In continuing these efforts, the Alliance will sustain impact in serving an estimated 450 students over the three-year grant period.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
