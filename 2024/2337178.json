 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports participation in the \u201cFairfax Algebra Days 2024\u201d (FAD 2024), a commutative algebra conference which is to take place at George Mason University on the weekend of March 9-10, 2024. FAD is a continuation of Morgantown Algebra Days (MAD), which started running in 2019 to promote interaction among faculty, postdoctoral researchers, and graduate students in commutative algebra in the Eastern US region. The first two meetings united faculty and students from a variety of institutions for inspiring talks and poster presentations. As in 2019 and 2023, the primary objective of the conference is to give participants at all career stages a chance to share their research with others, learn about recent developments in the field, develop new collaborations, and strengthen their ties to the mathematical community.\r\n \r\nFAD 2024 will feature seven research talks from a diverse group of speakers and a poster session allowing for junior mathematicians to present their research.  All talks will be concerned with commutative algebra and will involve subjects such as minimal free resolutions, homological invariants of rings, and complete intersections. In addition, the talks will cover connections between commutative algebra and other areas of mathematics such as representation theory, combinatorics, topology and graph theory\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
