 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader/commercial impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the development of a new class of high-performance lithium-ion batteries that enables the decarbonization of diesel-powered vehicles in construction and heavy-duty industries. Current battery technologies being used in passenger cars do not have the combination of power, life, and operating window needed to fully electrify construction and heavy-duty vehicles. Just like gasoline engines are not used in these workhorse applications, a new kind of battery technology is required to decarbonize these diesel-powered vehicles. The construction and heavy-duty vehicle industries are responsible for >15% of worldwide carbon emissions. Importantly, diesel emissions contain high levels of toxic air contaminants such as sulfur and nitrous oxides that are acute health hazards. Elimination of these emissions will not only improve workforce health, but also improve job safety and lower noise pollution. Further, this technology development will reduce the United States\u2019 dependency on fossil fuels and shift energy utilization to renewable sources supporting energy independence and national security. The diesel-powered vehicle industry is over a decade behind in vehicle electrification and the development of this technology can help accelerate its transition.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the development of a >3 Ah lithium-ion battery that enables a full charge in 6 mins, cycle life over 10,000 cycles, and charge or discharge capability down to -40 \uf0b0C using a novel anode material called lithium vanadium oxide or LVO. The main problem with lithium batteries today is they either provide high energy density with very low cycle life or high power with very low energy density. The operating conditions of diesel-powered construction and heavy-duty vehicles require a combination of high power, high energy, and long cycle life that LVO aims to deliver. The research objective for this project is to deliver a scaled LVO-based Li-ion cell based on the technical innovations demonstrated during the Phase I project. The proposed research will scale the LVO anode fabrication starting with larger batch powder preparation then roll-to-roll electrode coating and eventually full >3Ah Li-ion cell assembly. These Li-ion cells will then undergo performance and safety testing to validate meeting the combined power, life, and energy targets needed to decarbonize diesel-powered heavy-duty and construction vehicles. Successful demonstration of this high-performance cell will enable strong commercialization prospects.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
