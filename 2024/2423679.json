 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact and commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project extend to several key areas. Firstly, it aims to enhance the quality of healthcare and improve the health outcomes of the American public by offering cutting-edge diagnostic tools for the detection and assessment of various diseases. These advanced diagnostics will provide clinicians with precise and reliable information, thereby improving disease management and patient care. Secondly, the project will create valuable opportunities to train a skilled STEM workforce in the United States. By hiring individuals with expertise in chemistry and biology, it will contribute to the advancement of scientific frontiers and support participation in the technology-driven economy. Thirdly, the project fosters the integration of research through collaboration between industry and academia. By leveraging the expertise of non-profit research institutions, it will expand the practical applications of scientific discoveries to industry settings. Lastly, the development of a globally demanded product is expected to enhance the economic competitiveness of the United States on the international stage.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research SBIR Phase I project focuses on harnessing recent advancements in the basic sciences, particularly in chemistry and biology, to design innovative diagnostic products. These products have applications in both preclinical research and clinical diagnostics, particularly in the field of disease detection and treatment. The proposed diagnostic agents, designed for use with Positron Emission Tomography (PET), will assist researchers and physicians specializing in oncology. These tools will enable more precise selection of appropriate therapies for cancer patients, providing critical data on the early assessment of immunotherapy, which is considered a breakthrough treatment in oncology. The project not only advances scientific knowledge and techniques but also addresses technical challenges in developing novel PET diagnostic agents. A multidisciplinary team, renowned for their expertise in nuclear chemistry, medical imaging, and immunology, is collaborating to ensure the successful completion of the project\u2019s objectives. Their combined efforts will propel the development of these innovative products and technologies, ultimately facilitating their use in human healthcare.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
