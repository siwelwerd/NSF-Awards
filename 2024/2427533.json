 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will pilot a model for developing more ethical and equitable use of genetic tools through active engagements between scientists and society to guide the design, development, and deployment of genetic technologies. Genetic technologies, from genome sequencing to CRISPR gene editing, have far-reaching applications and implications for humanity and the planet. These intricate questions go beyond the immediate interests and influence of individual scientists and companies. Given the rapid pace of research and market dynamics, multidisciplinary community expertise is needed to examine the ethics of genetic technology innovations, considering both the intended and the unintended consequences. This project uses participatory design, actively involving stakeholders in the research design process, to provide scientists and technologists with new tools for working collaboratively with those impacted by the technology, to engage diverse perspectives, improve outcomes, and ensure maximum beneficial impact. By facilitating cross-sector and cross-perspective collaboration, the project will have the broader impact of producing novel insights and solutions to shape these rapidly evolving technologies, and to address societal challenges they may bring up early on. The project will examine whether a social impact accelerator model, that brings genetics scientists together with community leaders, communications experts and policymakers that have not typically been part of the scientific design process, can enhance understanding and yield unique insights to cultivate an ethical genetics future. \r\n\r\nThis project will build an interdisciplinary team of experts in cross-sector genetics engagement (Personal Genetics Education & Dialogue program based in the Department of Genetics at Harvard Medical School) and social impact designers who lead participatory design accelerators nationally. Together, the team aims to (a) pilot and externally evaluate an early-stage participatory design accelerator model to mobilize cross-sector leaders\u2014policymakers, funders, genetics innovators, filmmakers and community leaders who have historically been marginalized in scientific research and discourse\u2014to emerge with recommendations on how to advance responsible design, development, and deployment of CRISPR-based innovations; (b) co-create a strategic plan to scale the genetics accelerator model nationally; and (c) disseminate early-stage findings through publications and a scientific conference presentation. A rigorous third-party evaluation will produce a process and recommendations for scaling and disseminating the accelerator model that will inform a potential Phase 2 project.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
