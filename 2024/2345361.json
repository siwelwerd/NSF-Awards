 "awd_abstract_narration": "HSI Implementation and Evaluation Project: Undergraduate Research Experiences in Machine Learning for First Generation Students \r\n\r\nWith support from the Improving Undergraduate STEM Education: Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSI Program), this Track 2 project aims to develop, implement, and evaluate a year-long program to provide machine learning-related research opportunities to first generation (FG) undergraduate STEM students. Relatively few undergraduate research programs have specifically targeted FG students. Participants will work on a research project with a faculty mentor, and participate in workshops focusing on research skills, current research topics, and how to apply for graduate school and jobs. Additionally, the program experience will also include participation in a learning community where program participants can work together, exchange ideas, and use shared resources. Participants will be strongly encouraged to present their research findings and experiences at regional and national level conferences. They will also attend a hands-on workshop to learn about machine learning and design/build a working model of an automated system. It is expected that these experiences will prepare FG students for success in graduate school and/or in careers related to problem-solving and machine learning.\r\n\r\nThis project will provide an opportunity to conduct research on intersectional identities and needs of first-generation students who engage in undergraduate research. Although much work has been published on STEM research programs for undergraduate students, as well as on programs to help first generation students be successful in college and in STEM subjects, relatively little work has focused specifically on the needs of FG undergraduate participants in STEM research programs. However, first generation undergraduates who choose to participate in a STEM research program may have different needs and strengths than FG students who do not choose to engage in research. They are also likely different from continuing generation (CG) students who participate in undergraduate research. As a result, the types of support that FG researchers need to be successful may be different from the support needed by FG non-researchers or CG researchers. Expected outcomes include 1) a better understanding of the specific needs of FG undergraduate researchers and how to help them be successful; 2) increases in participants\u2019 research and problem-solving skills, knowledge of machine learning as related to research, awareness of research-related careers and how to prepare for them, and increased self-efficacy; 3) acceptance into graduate programs or offers for research-related jobs; 4) publications in research-related journals and conference proceedings; 5) retention and graduation rates for program participants that exceed the average for other first generation students in STEM at their institution. The HSI Program aims to enhance undergraduate STEM education and build capacity at HSIs. Projects supported by the HSI Program will also generate new knowledge on how to achieve these aims.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
