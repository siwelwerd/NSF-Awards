 "awd_abstract_narration": "Present-day human diets and activity levels are mismatched with human physiology, which has been adapted for the comparatively higher activity levels and fluctuating food availability likely experienced by hominins in the evolutionary past. This mismatch has contributed to increasing levels of obesity and chronic health conditions in contemporary society. Interestingly, some zoo-housed gorillas show comparable rates of cardiovascular and metabolic disease to humans. This doctoral dissertation research project investigates the diet, nutrition, activity profiles, and energy expenditure of male gorillas, across age groups and health statuses. Understanding the repercussions associated with the altered diet and activity patterns that they experience in zoological settings can inform our knowledge of human health issues associated with sedentary lifestyles and diets consisting of processed, modified, and cultivated foods. The project also informs primate husbandry practices to more accurately emulate gorilla food sources found in natural habitats and improve primate health and welfare. This research facilitates the professional and scientific training of a doctoral student pursuing a career in STEM and supports advanced skill development opportunities for multiple undergraduate students interested in animal behavior and conservation.  \r\n\r\nThis study assesses how diet and environment affect the nutrition, activity patterns and cardiovascular health of male gorillas that live in zoological institutions. Data obtained in this study can inform anthropological theory as well as animal welfare practices and management strategies for this critically endangered ape species. The study employs a combination of behavioral observations to establish daily activity patterns and feeding behavior among gorilla males. Additionally, food items consumed by these gorillas are analyzed to determine their nutritional value. Total energy expenditure is measured using doubly labeled water and urine collection.  These data are used to design models that identify discrepancies between target nutrition and actual nutrient ingestion. Diet and nutrition data are paired with physical activity budgets and total energy expenditure measures, to identify and assess the cardiac and metabolic disease risk factors that affect apes that live in managed care.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
