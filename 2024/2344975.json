 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Improving Undergraduate STEM Education: Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSI) Program this project aims to increase retention and success of Latine students in pursuing life science degrees at Regis University.  Specifically, the project will create a paid, faculty-mentored summer research program for undergraduate students early in their collegiate experience. The transition between the first and second year of college is a crucial time for students deciding whether to pursue further study in STEM. Summer research experiences are widely available at multiple institutions but may not be accessible to students early in their course of study, especially before they have foundational laboratory and research experience, and at a time when they have high potential to leave the sciences. Additionally, students at Regis University are increasingly first-generation, Latine, working, and may have additional demands on their time such as family commitments. Creating paid opportunities for students to participate in research through a faculty-mentored summer research experience has the potential to remove barriers for students to explore scientific research.  Students who need summer employment will be able to support themselves financially while building important career-relevant skills that may be difficult to achieve during a regular semester.\r\n\r\nThis program aims to increase retention and success of undergraduates in the life sciences by: 1) decreasing barriers to participation in an authentic research experience with faculty; 2) guiding students through mentored research at a critical transition point between the first and second year of undergraduate study; 3) providing professional development and a cohort model to better prepare students for further education or careers in STEM and strengthen their feelings of belonging in STEM; 4) building an educational environment in which faculty mentors learn from students about their needs and how best to support them. The project will use previously validated tools to measure changes in scientific skills, self-confidence, and well-being. These assessments will allow for an assessment of which project interventions impacted student retention and will capture how students were most impacted. The project\u2019s components and outcomes will be shared internally and externally with a breadth of institutions and educators across STEM disciplines.  This project is funded by the HSI Program, which aims to enhance undergraduate STEM education, broaden participation in STEM, and build capacity at HSIs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
