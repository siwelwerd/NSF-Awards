 "awd_abstract_narration": "Carbon has played a crucial role in the development of human civilization. Despite the vast potential of various carbon forms, including different existing and emerging 0D, 1D, and 2D carbon nanostructures, to advance applications such as quantum computing, terahertz communications, energy storage systems, and carbon capture, the knowledge gap between carbon allotropes and device fabrication communities continues to hinder progress in scaling and integrating carbon devices into carbon systems. The Broadening Carbon Ring Network of Networks (N-o-N) is a strategic alliance that aims to advance the state of the art in carbon materials and devices by bringing together researchers from different research communities. The goal is to fill the knowledge gap in carbon materials, accelerate new carbon materials discovery, create and share fabrication and manufacturing toolboxes, explore frontier carbon device and new applications, and train highly diverse researchers and technical leaders with skillsets to conduct complex projects requiring international coordination.\r\n\r\nThis Accelerating Research through International Network-to-Network Collaborations (AccelNet) project will connect 18 networks including interdisciplinary research networks, regional clusters and user facilities across 10 countries. The specific aim of this N-o-N is to fill in the knowledge gaps in the areas of modeling the pyrolysis from polymer precursor to final carbon microstructure, tuning carbon shapes and carbon interfaces through self-assembly and controllable functionalization, hybrid carbon materials enabling high performance energy, sensing, and electronic devices, and scalable manufacturing through the creation of an International Roadmap on Carbon Systems (IRCS) and building a global database for best practices, sustainability, and life-cycle analysis. The training and exchange activities will impact diverse workforce development and STEM education.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
