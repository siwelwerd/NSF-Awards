 "awd_abstract_narration": "The conference Tensor Invariants in Geometry and Complexity Theory will take place May 13-17, 2024 at Auburn University. This conference aims to bring together early-career researchers and experts to study tensor invariants, their appearance in pure algebraic and differential geometry, and their application in Algebraic Complexity Theory and Quantum Information. The workshop will feature talks from both seasoned experts and promising young researchers. The event is designed to facilitate new research connections and to initiate new collaborations. The  conference will expose the participants to state-of-the-art research results that touch a variety of scientific disciplines. The activities will support further development of both pure mathematics and the \"down-stream\" applications in each area of scientific focus (Algebraic and Differential Geometry, Algebraic Complexity, Quantum Information). \r\n\r\nThe conference is centered on invariants in geometry, divided into three themes: Algebraic and Differential Geometry, Tensors and Complexity, and Quantum Computing and Quantum Information. Geometry has long been a cornerstone of mathematics, and invariants are the linchpins. Regarding Algebraic and Differential Geometry, the organizers are inviting expert speakers on topics such as the connections between projective and differential geometry. Considerations in these areas, such as questions about dimensions and defining equations of secant varieties, have led to powerful tools both within geometry and applications in areas such as computational complexity and quantum information. Likewise, the organizers are inviting application-area experts in Algebraic Complexity and Quantum Information. This natural juxtaposition of pure and applied mathematics will lead to new and interesting connections and help initiate new research collaborations. In addition to daily talks by seasoned experts, the conference will include young researchers in a Poster Session and provide networking opportunities, including working group activities, to help early career researchers meet others in the field, which will provide opportunities for new (and ongoing) research collaborations. It is anticipated that these collaborations will continue long after the meeting is over. The conference webpage is: https://webhome.auburn.edu/~lao0004/jmlConference.html.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
