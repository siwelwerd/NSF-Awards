 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site award to Vanderbilt University, located in Nashville, TN, supports the training of 10 students for 10 weeks during the summers of 2024-2026.  In this program, funded by the Division of Chemistry, participants will conduct interdisciplinary research in chemical biology in the laboratories of seasoned Vanderbilt faculty mentors of all ranks. The team, led by Professors David Cliffel and Jeff Johnston, designed the program to provide research opportunities to students in ongoing projects in chemical biology, as well as exposure to new areas of research through interdisciplinary scientific seminars.  Through mentored, authentic research experiences, this program will evolve the student\u2019s understanding of the research process and the interdisciplinary nature of contemporary chemical biology research while learning to work in a team environment. This program will additionally create a uniquely trained and highly diverse student pool that meets the needs of the 21st century scientific workforce.\r\n\r\nIn an effort to prepare and support the students for their future scientific careers, a complementary professional development seminar series will cover essential topics such as research ethics, safety training, abstract writing, and poster presentation techniques.  Sessions on applying to graduate school and seeking out funding opportunities will also be available to participants to help prepare them for post-secondary education opportunities.  Additional focus of the program will be to recruit a diverse group of undergraduate students who are majoring in chemistry, biochemistry, and biology for careers in trans-disciplinary chemical or biochemical research.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
