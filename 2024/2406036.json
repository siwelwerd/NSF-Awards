 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project involves the development of a novel sugar polymer designed specifically to improve chromatography, a technique used by scientists to separate and analyze mixtures. This project focuses on chiral chromatography, which is crucial for distinguishing between molecules that are mirror images of each other but behave differently in the body. This capability is especially important in pharmaceutical manufacturing, where the safety and effectiveness of drugs often depend on these molecular distinctions. By creating a stable, synthetic sugar polymer through a microbial process, this project aims to provide a more reliable and efficient alternative for chiral chromatography. This innovation will not only enhance the precision of drug manufacturing but also contribute to safer and more effective medications, aligning with broader public health goals.\r\n\r\nThe proposed project will focus on engineering a microbial process to produce a novel sugar polymer that meets the specific demands of chiral chromatography. By optimizing the production of this polymer in microorganisms, the project seeks to enhance the properties of chromatography materials, such as increased durability and improved ability to separate molecular mirror images. The research will involve refining genetic pathways for maximum yield, scaling up fermentation processes, and establishing purification protocols to ensure that the polymer adheres to high industry standards.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
