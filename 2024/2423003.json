 "awd_abstract_narration": "Freshwater aquifers in coastal areas are important resources because they supply drinking water to millions of people and support extensive farming and industrial operations. When saltwater enters freshwater systems (a process known as saltwater intrusion), the landscape can experience quick and ground-breaking shifts that result in the degradation of wetlands, loss of agricultural and timber lands, and abandonment of groundwater wells. Unfortunately, overuse of coastal aquifers, rising sea-levels, and changing climatic conditions have worsened these issues along the US Atlantic coast. This research aims to provide important insights into the factors that control how soil salinization changes over time and space in coastal landscapes that are impacted by saltwater intrusion. This project extends its impact beyond scientific inquiry through the Fresh Solutions to Salty Struggles (FS3) immersive educational program. The FS3 initiative emphasizes practical skill development and aims to cultivate a skilled and motivated group of undergraduate researchers capable of contributing significantly to society by addressing saltwater intrusion and soil salinization challenges in coastal areas. \r\n\r\nThe FS3 program addresses the challenges of working out the mechanisms and effects of saltwater intrusion and soil salinization processes in the coastal critical zone. This work focuses on the Albemarle-Pamlico Estuarine System and the Chesapeake/Delaware Bay Watersheds, areas which are experiencing quick and transformative ecosystem shifts because of saltwater intrusion and soil salinization. By focusing on these regions, the research will capture differences inherent to these coastal landscapes and shed light on the particulars of saltwater intrusion pathways, ultimately helping to sort out the underlying processes. The program combines hydrogeophysical methods (e.g., electrical resistivity tomography; electromagnetic induction) with other hydrogeological techniques (e.g., monitoring water quality and quantity) to address the research question: What factors determine where and when soil may become salty in coastal areas that are affected by saltwater intrusion? The project\u2019s commitment to using shared data sets and facilitating collaborative efforts with the Coastal Thematic Cluster will ensure a broad regional perspective towards understanding the central research question. The FS3 program also empowers undergraduate researchers to become skilled contributors to geoscience and environmental science. Through a comprehensive curriculum, field experiences, and collaborative projects, the program seeks to make lasting impacts on education and career paths, fostering a network of professionals capable of addressing saltwater intrusion and soil salinization challenges. The project outcomes will advance scientific knowledge and cultivate a group of critical zone scientists equipped to tackle current and future coastal challenges.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
