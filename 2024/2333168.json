 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader/commercial impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to test the benefits of artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance a platform which aids justice-involved youth to develop protective factors for positive change. The project uses advanced machine learning and large language model technologies to optimize the platform's effectiveness and support this vulnerable group, many of whom have adverse childhood experiences, so that they can break the cycle of re-offending. These enhancements empower youth by creating more relevant growth recommendations offering tailored, strengths-based feedback to break the cycle of recidivism and support the transition into productive societal roles. The platform has commercial potential with opportunities for deployment across 3,143 U.S. counties, which collectively serve 800,000 justice-involved youth annually. Successful implementation may alter the life trajectories of these youth, such that they can make positive life changes. This transformation would lessen the economic burden on our already stretched penal systems, while unlocking the potential of these youth to contribute positively to society. \r\n\r\nThis project integrates state-of-the-art machine learning and large language models to fortify an innovative social growth platform, enabling justice-involved youth to make positive life changes. The platform is underpinned by a research-validated growth cycle, and features a dynamic feed governed by intelligent algorithms, specialized protective factor journeys, and a narrative-centric approach that leverages strength-based, social connectivity. The project will facilitate the refinement of the algorithmic architecture behind the dynamic feed to enhance user engagement, thereby promoting protective factors. Large language models will be integrated to serve as an intelligence-augmented mechanism to bolster the strength-based feedback loop within life integration stories.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
