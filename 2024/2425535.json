 "awd_abstract_narration": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been successfully applied in many domains, including image classification, language models, speech analysis, autonomous vehicles, wireless communications, bioinformatics, and others. Their success stems from their ability to handle vast amounts of data and infer patterns without making assumptions on the underlying dynamics that produced the data. Cloud providers operate large data centers with high-speed computers that continuously perform DNN computations, with huge energy consumption that rivals that of some industries and nations.  In addition to being used in solving large-scale problems, DNNs are now being considered for recognition and inference applications in battery-operated systems such as smartphones and embedded devices. Thus, there is a critical need to improve the energy efficiency of DNNs. The main objective of this project is twofold: (1) Design and evaluate a radically innovative energy-efficient hardware/software framework for on-chip implementation of DNNs, and (2) customize this framework for new DNNs that enable real-time signal classification in next-generation wireless systems. By integrating processing elements within memory chips, the energy consumption of a DNN can be significantly reduced, and more computations can be done faster. The hardware-accelerated DNN designs provided by this project will facilitate rapid identification of wireless transmissions (e.g. radar, 5G, LTE, Wi-Fi, microwave, satellite, and others) in a shared-spectrum scenario, enabling better use of the spectrum and facilitating accurate detection of adversarial and rogue signals. \r\n\r\nTo achieve 10x-100x reduction in DNN energy consumption, a holistic approach is pursued, which encompasses: (1) new circuit designs that leverage emerging CMOS+X technologies; (2) a novel near-memory architecture in which processing elements are seamlessly integrated with traditional Dynamic RAM (DRAM); (3) novel 3D-matrix-based per-layer DNN computations and data-layout optimizations for kernel weights; and (4) algorithms and hardware/software co-design tailored for near-real-time DNN-based signal classification in next-generation wireless systems. In addition to its research goals, the project has a comprehensive educational and outreach agenda, which includes graduate and undergraduate curriculum development, an internship program, and engagement of students from under-represented groups. Technology transition is streamlined through interactions with industry affiliates of two existing centers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
