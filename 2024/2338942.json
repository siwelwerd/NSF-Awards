 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project concerns the study of Shimura varieties. These are geometric objects that are defined as solutions to polynomial equations with coefficients that are rational numbers. Shimura varieties have played a crucial role in settling several long standing conjectures, including the Mordel Conjecture.  The PI and his collaborators propose to work on the question of finding polynomial equations with integer coefficients which define Shimura varieties. This question is fundamental to the study of Number Theory and Arithmetic Geometry and has broad applications to several important and well-known conjectures. The educational component of the project includes a workshop targeted at early-stage graduate students looking to work in Arithmetic Geometry, aimed at helping these students acquire background to start working on research problems in this field. The project also provides opportunities for undergraduate students to work on research problems, as well as thesis-problems for graduate students.\r\n \r\nThe PI will work on the fundamental problems of studying integral models and the p-adic geometry of Shimura varieties. Specifically, the PI and his collaborators will work on studying integral models of exceptional Shimura varieties, and studying questions pertaining to p-adic transcendence on Shimura varieties (including a p-adic analogue of Borel's algebraicity theorem, and questions pertaining to p-adic bi-algebraicity on Shimura varieties).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
