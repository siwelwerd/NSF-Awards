 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project presents urgently needed improvements to cybersecurity in space to enable a larger scale, higher throughput, and a more securely interconnected ecosystem.  This includes enabling high-throughput on-orbit manufacturing for the next ten years and is aimed squarely at small and medium manufacturers (SMM), large manufacturers, and original equipment manufacturers (OEM) that will supply large-scale space production industries.  The ability to use Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML) to remotely modify, optimize, and enhance the resiliency of Cube Satellites to cyberattacks is crucial to this evolving industry. The solution extends to the high growth commercial space industry-related Earth Observation (EO), and Direct Satellite to Device/Smartphone markets. The development of small satellites has notably increased the interest of private companies and government agencies in investing in this field, as it allows for more affordable access to new business models in space, including satellite constellations. Space applications, ranging from machine to machine (M2M), the Internet of Things, and Earth observation use cases, are expected to reach more than $22 billion in service revenue by 2031. The market is rapidly moving from an infrastructure-heavy investment cycle towards an as-a-service-focused recurring revenue business model.\r\n\r\nThis SBIR Phase I project will develop the technology needed to accelerate the commercial development of the hybrid space and terrestrial communications architectures, in-space manufacturing, and industrial infrastructure. ML algorithms that can differentiate between anomalies triggered by natural phenomena and cyber-attacks represent a significant advancement. This can be applied at increasingly larger scales, higher-throughputs, and speeds for robust security and acceleration of this sector. Through adaptability and precision, ML can significantly reduce the occurrence of false alarms but also excel at predicting the source of the anomaly and attributing the anomaly to its origin. Applying the ML predictive capabilities enhances early warning systems, fortifies cybersecurity measures, and ensures continuous monitoring in an ever-evolving threat landscape. The project would accelerate the integration of terrestrial telecommunications networks and satellite communications technologies, decrease costs, increase service coverage, and provide added resilience and multi-level security compatibility to the nation\u2019s communication infrastructure. Mimicking the operational capabilities of the human immune system will allow for the long-term and evolving effectiveness of a space platform's cyberattack detection and response capabilities.  This decentralized approach will be able to leverage decentralized autonomous organizations and strategic defense capabilities to accelerate human endeavors in space.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
