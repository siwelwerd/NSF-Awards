 "awd_abstract_narration": "NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\n\r\nFunded by the Division of Materials Research at the National Science Foundation, the REU Site in Physics at Howard University focuses on providing hands on research experience to undergraduate participants in state-of-the art projects in theoretical, computational, and experimental physics at the nanoscale. As the nation\u2019s premier HBCU, Howard University is renowned for offering opportunities especially to women and students of color, and the Physics REU will enable these participants to gain valuable research experience in contemporary areas of nanophysics and material science. As a result, the REU participants will acquire sought after technical skills and be better prepared for graduate studies and entering the STEM workforce.\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThe Howard University Physics REU will introduce undergraduate participants to engaging physics research projects in computational and experimental nanophysics, condensed matter physics, materials physics, optics, and laser spectroscopy. The REU students will acquire skills in methodology, data analysis and interpretation, via hands-on mentoring and exposure to state-of-the-art research tools and techniques, while at the same time developing a keen awareness of the applications in a broad range of cutting-edge research areas of contemporary physics at the nanoscale. The REU will offer professional development, enrichment, and integrative activities, through regular educational workshops and physics colloquia. Our recruitment efforts will target diverse undergraduate students who are underrepresented in physics and material science, and especially those from institutions with limited STEM research programs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
