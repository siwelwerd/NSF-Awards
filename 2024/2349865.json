 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports research at the interface of several complex variables, differential geometry, and dynamical systems. Complex analysis studies the behavior and regularity of functions defined on and taking values in spaces of complex numbers. It remains an indispensable tool across many domains in the sciences, engineering, and economics. This project considers the smoothness of transformations on a domain defined by complex valued functions when the domain is deformed. Using integral formulas, the PI will study how invariants of a domain vary when the underlying structure of the domain changes. Another component of the project involves the study of resonance. The PI will use small divisors that measure non-resonance to classify singularities of the complex structure arising in linear approximations of curved manifolds. The project will involve collaboration with researchers in an early career stage and will support the training of graduate students.\r\n\r\nMotivated by recent counterexamples showing that smooth families of domains may be equivalent by a discontinuous family of biholomorphisms, the PI will study the existence of families of biholomorphisms between families of domains using biholomorphism groups and other analytic tools such as Bergman metrics. The PI will construct a global homotopy formula with good estimates for suitable domains in a complex manifold. One of the goals is to construct a global formula in cases when a local homotopy formula fails to exist. The PI will use such global homotopy formulas to investigate the stability of holomorphic embeddings of domains with strongly pseudoconvex or concave boundary in a complex manifold, when the complex structure on the domains is deformed. The PI will use this approach to investigate stability of global Cauchy-Riemann structures on Cauchy-Riemann manifolds of higher codimension. The project seeks a holomorphic classification of neighborhoods of embeddings of a compact complex manifold in complex manifolds via the Levi-form and curvature of the normal bundle. In addition, the PI will study the classification of Cauchy-Riemann singularities for real manifolds using methods from several complex variables and small-divisor conditions in dynamical systems.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
