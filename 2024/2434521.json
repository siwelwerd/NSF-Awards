 "awd_abstract_narration": "The funds will partially cover travel expenses of graduate students, post-doctoral researchers, and junior faculty members from institutions in the United States to participate travel to the American Physical Society Division of Fluid Dynamics (DFD) 77th Annual Meeting in Salt Lake City, Utah, November 24-26, 2024. This is the largest international annual meeting of fluid dynamics experts in the world, with approximately 3000 anticipated attendees. The meeting has been successfully run for over seventy years.\r\n\r\nThe chief intellectual merit of this conference lies in the exchange of scientific ideas, presentations of cutting-edge research, and exposure to a richly diverse array of topics in virtually every sub-discipline of fluid dynamics. The conference will be attended by both prominent and young scientists in fluid dynamics from around the world, who will be discussing present and future directions of research and research challenges. The conference will foster cross-fertilization of ideas among researchers in cutting edge areas of fluid dynamics and will address challenges involved in advancing the field.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
