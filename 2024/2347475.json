 "awd_abstract_narration": "The transition to clean energy is primarily focused on research related to renewable energy sources (such as biomass) and sustainable sources (primarily solar, wind, nuclear, and hydroelectric generated electricity).  Those sources alone, however, are insufficient to provide enough energy during the transition period to meet the burgeoning demands for energy.  Thus, fossil resources, such as abundant natural gas, will continue to provide a significant fraction of total energy and feedstocks for chemical manufacturing and fuel production.  To that end, this Engineering Research Initiation (ERI) project explores novel catalyst technology for converting methane (the chief component of natural gas) to ethane and hydrogen.  Those products are primary precursors for energy-efficient manufacture of a broad range of chemicals and fuels.  Specifically, the project focuses on a class of catalysts known as MXenes, which show promising properties and stability at the high temperatures required to non-oxidatively couple two methane molecules together to produce ethane and hydrogen.  From the broader impact perspective, the project will provide resources for the early-career investigator to expand research capacity in their laboratory, while providing research experiences to a diverse group of undergraduate students.\r\n \r\nThe overarching research goal of the ERI project is to establish research capability directed toward the fundamental understanding of catalytic methane conversion over Pt/Mo2TiC2 MXene catalysts.  Specific thrusts include: 1) quantifying reaction-diffusion phenomena in the interlayer pores containing the Pt clusters; 2) identifying the active sites for methane bond activation; 3) obtaining insights regarding the C-C coupling mechanism as related to the Pt nanolayer structures and interactions with the MXene metals (specifically Mo); and 4) exploring in detail the factors responsible for the coke-resistant properties of the MXene catalyst observed in preliminary studies.  To achieve those goals, the project will employ a suite of catalyst characterization and kinetic analysis tools, highlighted by the combination of steady-state isotopic transient kinetic analysis (SSITKA) and operando transmission FTIR, i.e., SSITKA-FTIR, in a single flow reactor to investigate catalytic mechanisms under working conditions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
