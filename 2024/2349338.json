 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the support of the Chemical Catalysis program in the Division of Chemistry, Kara Stowers of Brigham Young University is studying how to improve the synthesis and composition of copper catalysts for reducing carbon dioxide, an important sustainable chemistry goal. Methanol produced from carbon dioxide could be used as a fuel and material feedstock, rendering this chemistry useful for rebalancing the carbon cycle (i.e. cycling the greenhouse gas CO2 to this reduced building block form). Currently copper-based catalysts are sluggish when reacting with carbon dioxide and unstable when converting it to methanol. To improve these copper-based catalysts, an templating method will be used to rapidly create and test new nanoparticle compositions and structures for catalysis. This research aims to establish a flexible and tunable method for catalyst development, including understanding the fundamental molecular interactions of the catalyst with industrially relevant materials, with the goal of increasing catalyst stability and activity. More efficient catalysts would facilitate the transition to a sustainable closed-loop fuel economy and reduce our reliance on non-renewable fossil fuels. Additionally, this research will include student training at both the graduate and undergraduate level to help prepare the next generation of scientists and engineers dedicated to addressing pressing environmental challenges. The project also provides targeted opportunities for female freshman undergraduates to begin early engagement in research and to be provided with mentors.\r\n\r\nUnder this award, Kara Stowers and her research team at Brigham Young University are studying the template-mediated synthesis of copper-based nanoparticle catalysts for the conversion of carbon dioxide to methanol. This project addresses existing catalyst weaknesses in order to improve carbon dioxide conversion and further facilitate methanol as a renewable energy carrier.  The scientific goals are to (i) optimize the interface active sites of Cu-based nanoparticles to increase catalytic activity, (ii) identify synthesis conditions that provide stability against nanoparticle aggregation, and (iii) optimize bimetallic compositions of Cu-based nanoparticles to increase reaction selectivity. The experimental approach uses spin-coating to synthesize a metal organic framework (MOF) as a thin film template at ambient pressure and temperature, which should allows for the rapid and reproducible generation of arrays of nanoparticles onto industrially relevant supports after template removal. Using MOFs as a template affords extreme flexibility in tuning of metal cluster centers and bimetallic combinations, and is expected to allow for the reproducible modification of Cu-oxide nanoparticle composition.  The team also aims to control spatial and size distributions and oxidation states within these nanoparticulate frameworks. The projected outcomes of the work are to facilitate rational design of Cu-based nanoparticle catalysts with improved catalytic activity, and with improved catalytic stability from reduced aggregation and bimetallic compositions optimized for improved catalytic efficiency. Synthesis of copper metal nanoparticles via thin films on industrially relevant supports should offer an expeditious and scalable strategy for catalyst synthesis and testing. The impact of this research on the field is expected to be in improved technologies for carbon dioxide conversion as well as in a new strategy to carry out nanoparticle assays for rapid, scalable catalyst development.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
