 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cybersecurity continuously faces challenges arising from evolving infrastructures, emerging vulnerabilities, and human factors. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is poised to emerge as a crucial tool in this scenario, significantly enhancing threat detection, refining the precision of attack identification, and expediting incident response. The University of Missouri-Kansas City will establish a new Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site that orchestrates a summer program to engage undergraduate students in comprehensive AI and cybersecurity research. In this program, students will collaborate closely with faculty mentors on in-depth projects, participate in interactive labs and workshops, and present innovative research findings. Aiming to reach underrepresented groups and institutions with limited research resources, the program promotes diversity and inclusivity in cybersecurity.\r\n\r\nThis project will investigate the forefront of AI technologies like Generative AI, Large Language Models, and Graph Neural Networks. These technologies will be applied to a spectrum of cybersecurity challenges, such as intrusion detection, advanced phishing detection, code vulnerability analysis, and the development of robust authentication systems. Under the guidance of expert mentors, REU students will significantly contribute to advancing AI-driven cybersecurity solutions. Furthermore, the project will collaborate with GenCyber summer camps, introducing high school students to these critical subjects. REU participants will share their research findings and experiences with camp attendees through panel discussions and presentations, fostering an environment of knowledge transfer and active community engagement.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
