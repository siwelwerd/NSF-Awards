The conference is expected to draw approximately 80 participants with high attendance from junior (student and postdoc) researchers, 22-24 invited talks, a poster session, and a midday break for informal interactions. The topics covered include strange metals, high Tc superconductivity, quantum phase transitions, localized strongly interacting states of matter, disorder in topological phases, which are all at the forefront of condensed matter physics. The conference will facilitate the exchange of ideas between junior and senior researchers and serve as an opportunity for creating new collaborations.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
