 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national interest by improving curricula in mathematics education for preservice K-8 teachers leveraging advances in visual computing technology and the engineering design process. K-8 teachers need to prepare future students for careers that require engineering, artificial intelligence (AI), mathematics and reasoning skills. This project falls under the IUSE: EDU Level 2 track in Engaged Student Learning by significantly advancing preservice teachers\u2019 interdisciplinary mathematics skills by integrating visual computing and the engineering design process in lessons, activities, and assessments for an upper division mathematics methods course at Arizona State University. By incorporating these disciplines into the mathematics classroom, the project will engage both preservice teachers and their future students in applied learning of abstract mathematics concepts and demonstrate the real-world interdisciplinary applications of such knowledge. Research will study the effectiveness of the proposed intervention in supporting the contextualization of mathematics in the K-8 classroom. The project will feature broad dissemination of new curriculum through scientific publications and conference presentations as well as an online platform for sharing videos, lesson plans and activities, and teacher resources with the public. \r\n\r\nThis project focuses on generating and advancing knowledge regarding the use of both the engineering design process and visual computing to contextualize mathematics. These goals will be accomplished through 10-week curricular integration into Arizona State University\u2019s upper-division Mathematics Teacher Education (MTE) 311 course entitled \u201cGeometry, Algebra, Statistics, and Probability for K-8 Teaching\u201d, a course which will serve approximately 180 preservice teachers per year. The project team will investigate preservice teachers\u2019 engagement, motivation, attitudes, and self-efficacy through a novel mixed-methods study design. Research findings will help advance understanding of instructor challenges and solutions regarding the integration of visual computing in teacher preparation programs. The developed curriculum will be taught to students in grades K-8 by preservice teachers in the program as part of their placements in schools in greater Phoenix, Arizona. Public dissemination of both the curriculum and the research findings will serve as a national model for improved interdisciplinary mathematics education through presentations, publications, workshops, and development of an online resource hub. The NSF IUSE: EDU Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through the Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools.\r\n\r\nPartial funding for the project is from the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship program.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
