 "awd_abstract_narration": "The R/V Atlantic Explorer is a 168\u2019 general-purpose research vessel owned and operated by Bermuda Institute of Ocean Science (BIOS) as part of the U.S. Academic Research Fleet (ARF). The R/V Atlantic Explorer is used for innovative research in the fields of oceanography, marine biology, geology, and atmospheric science. Funds are requested for the purchase of oceanographic instrumentation (i.e., Seapoint Fluorometers, spare meteorological sensors) and refrigeration and freezer equipment in support of the various multidisciplinary NSF-supported and University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) scheduled projects to be undertaken on the vessel in 2024 and beyond.\r\n\t\r\nThe principal impact of the present proposal is under Merit Review Criterion 2 of the Proposal Guidelines (NSF 23-525). It provides infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF). The acquisition, maintenance, and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or other organization access to well-maintained, high-quality, calibrated instruments for their research. It ensures the collection of high-quality oceanographic data in support of science, reduces the cost of that research, and expands the base of potential researchers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
