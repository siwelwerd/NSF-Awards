 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to advance Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) as a novel form of digital collaboration and governance systems that can be utilized to advance new commercial value propositions. DAOs, which leverage distributed ledger technologies, allow for democratic decision-making and coordination without a centralized authority, something that enables new business collaborations amongst trusted and untrusted entities alike. This innovative structure can potentially enhance various sectors of society, paving the way for novel commercial applications. DAOs offer a dynamic and adaptable approach that can benefit various sectors, including finance, healthcare, environmental sustainability, and more. This project aims to investigate the application of DAOs initially in the high-value field of voluntary carbon credits, which is anticipated to reach up to $40B in 2030, to enable enhanced environmental sustainability and accountability. It will rely on commercial transactions across a wide range of diverse participants of varying levels of trust who need to be able to verify the credits and their chain of custody and sustainability, integrated from a wide range of external data sources. Moreover, the DAO platform, a core product of this initiative, will be a versatile commercial \"sandbox\" adaptable to developing commercial products for various markets that demand decentralized participation. This will include input and transactability across varying DAO participants, including commercial partners, expert networks, customers, regulators, and broader stakeholders, such as water rights allocation, healthcare, carbon credit marketplaces, and more. By leveraging the power of DAOs, it may be possible to enhance operational efficiency, drive the growth of new technologies, and create more democratic and inclusive systems.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis SBIR Phase I project aims to pioneer the development of a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) as a platform for value creation in various sectors, starting with carbon credits. The research will investigate the innovative integration of off-chain data consensus protocols within DAOs, a largely unexplored and complex area. The proposed R&D involves deploying smart contracts for trustless verification of off-chain data via on-chain incentives, a process that demands a sophisticated blend of cryptographic techniques, game-theoretic mechanisms, and decentralized network design. This design has to be robust against malicious actors, ensuring fairness, incentive compatibility, and resilience to Sybil attacks. Crafting a decentralized smart contract for off-chain consensus requires balancing fairness, compensation, sufficient voting thresholds, and ground truth comparisons. This equilibrium mitigates malicious influences and encourages truth in adversarial environments. Despite these significant technical challenges, this work represents an innovative stride toward understanding the future potential of DAO technology across diverse sectors. In addition to exploring the benefits and successes of DAOs, it will also enable the identification of key risks and potential failure modes across various use cases to allow exploration and development of improved future alternatives and DAO designs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
