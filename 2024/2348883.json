 "awd_abstract_narration": "This REU Site award to North Dakota State University (NDSU), located in Fargo, North Dakota, will support the training of ten students for ten weeks during the summers of 2025-2027. Students will be engaged in undergraduate research in the area of discipline-based education research in an environment that emphasizes the importance of collaborative, inclusive, and equitable research practices. This project includes a professional development series designed to focus on career development, methodologies in discipline-based education research, and diverse forms of science communication.\r\n \r\nThrough mentoring, authentic research experiences, professional development seminars, and social activities, this project creates an interdisciplinary learning community to foster the recruitment and retention of talented students to graduate programs. This project will help students build a broad skill set appropriate for a variety of career paths and facilitate the development of students' sense of belonging as a discipline-based education research scholar. This project also highlights to students how research is used to inform teaching practices, with dissemination of students' research findings contributing to our understanding of effective teaching and learning in STEM. Recruitment activities involve maintaining an active website, social networking, targeted emailing, and partnering with the NDSU TRIO Office and the Director of Tribal Partnerships. Based on application materials, research team objectives, and interviews, the goal is to recruit a diverse cohort of students, with preference given to early-college career STEM students. The deadline to apply is the third Friday of January in each respective year. Project evaluation involves a diverse mix of qualitative and quantitative measures that will be collected from students and mentors throughout the summer, which provides the opportunity to obtain both formative and summative feedback when assessing goals. Students will be tracked after the program in order to determine student career paths. Students will be asked to respond to an automatic email sent via the NSF reporting system. More information is available by visiting https://www.ndsu.edu/dber/reu_program/ or by contacting Dr. Katie Wissman (kathryn.wissman@ndsu.edu). This project is funded by NSF's Improving Undergraduate STEM Education program, which supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
