 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project centers on improving wound closure methods in minimally invasive procedures, such as endoscopy and robotic surgery. By harnessing innovative hydrogel technology based on biocompatible, biodegradable polymers, this project aims to establish a resilient barrier over surgical wounds and perforations. This transformative approach, devoid of cumbersome metal clips, promises to avert delayed bleeding, perforations, infections, and post-procedural complications. Initially designed for the gastrointestinal tract, the technology caters to unmet clinical needs, extending to applications in cardiovascular and lung sealing. The societal impact is evident in improved patient outcomes and reduced healthcare costs, while the commercial potential includes widespread adoption of a superior wound closure solution.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project focuses on the development of a versatile, sprayable sealant kit that delivers prolonged protection for gastrointestinal wounds. Employing multiple adhesion mechanisms, the technology ensures sustained adhesion across biological surfaces. Delivered via a catheter, it seamlessly integrates with commercial endoscopes and minimally invasive devices, optimizing surgical workflow. The project objectives involve the refinement of the adhesive formulation to meet gastrointestinal requirements and rigorous comparative testing. Anticipated technical outcomes encompass enhanced procedure efficiency, reduced complication rates, and improved wound healing, positioning this innovation as a transformative force in minimally invasive surgery.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
