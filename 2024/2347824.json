 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the Junior Workshop in Several Complex Variables, to take place June 24-28, 2024 at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. The workshop will include mini-courses by four international experts and approximately ten research talks by junior researchers. The award specifically supports the participation of graduate students and hence helps to train the next generation of researchers in the field of several complex variables.\r\n\r\nThe subject of several complex variables uses tools from diverse areas of mathematics including partial differential equations, functional analysis, differential geometry, and algebraic geometry. This wide range of techniques makes it difficult for junior researchers to get started in the field and in recent years it has become more difficult as the sophistication of the methods has increased. This workshop will help junior researchers overcome these obstacles. The first half of the workshop consists of mini-courses aimed at graduate students and the second half consists of research talks by early career researchers. More information about the event is available at https://jwiscv.math.wisc.edu.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
