 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is based on the development of a concussion-care technology, providing users with a solution for post-injury and rehabilitative care. This technology signifies a shift in societal perception and approach towards concussion management, encapsulating both preventative and rehabilitative care in one portable system that is easy to use. This technology ensures a more accurate user assessment by removing subjectivity in current concussion assessments. By offering objective measurements and a tailored approach to user needs, this system engages unique athletic and occupational sectors, like the Thoroughbred horse racing industry, where current concussion protocols often fall short or are nonexistent. Similarly, this technology can extend to other activities that utilize unique positions and have high risk for injury such as mountain biking and downhill skiing.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. The solution is based on the prior development of a system encompassing light and movement sensors designed to precisely evaluate balance and reaction time of a user during various positional conditions. Developed through direct community feedback in the equestrian sports sector, this system mitigates the confusion often associated with existing subjective concussion assessments which may have barriers of language or understanding. The technology integrates an application and physical device to give users immediate feedback on their ability to respond to light stimuli and maintain their position. By providing customizable field equipment, this technology empowers individuals with the ability to self-activate and take their health and rehabilitation back into their hands.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
