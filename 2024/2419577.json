 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national interest by helping to prepare students to enter the biodesign workforce of the future. Biodesign centers recently have sprung up at a variety of institutions across the country. These centers focus on creative approaches to human healthcare and basic science, incorporating the viewpoints of fields as diverse as biology, engineering, art, and computer science. The multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary nature of the field suggests an openness to individuals with a variety of backgrounds, not just those versed in traditional STEM fields. The Biodesign Symposium is poised to address how to educate undergraduate students to enter this complex, challenging, and exciting new field. Today's undergraduate students will contribute to the workforce of tomorrow, so defining the entry points and training needed to contribute to the future biodesign workforce is a timely endeavor.  \r\n\r\nThe Biodesign Symposium will be held at The New School in New York City on June 12, 2024. The symposium will convene formal and informal educators, community members, artists and designers, researchers, students, and industry representatives. Symposium topics include shaping lab-based and/or experimental activities to provide biotechnology instruction for undergraduate students without formal science backgrounds, strategies for incorporating place-based and identity-based models in biotechnology instruction, case studies on grounding biodesign learning in community engagement, strategies for aligning classroom instruction with industry needs, and methods for cross-disciplinary instruction in highly siloed institutional environments. The symposium intends to formalize academic practices and standardize learning outcomes for biodesign education. The NSF IUSE: EDU Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
