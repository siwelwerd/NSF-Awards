 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research Infrastructure Improvement Track-4 EPSCoR Research Fellows project will provide a fellowship to a Senior Research Associate and training for a graduate student at Brown University. This work would be conducted in collaboration with researchers at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR).  The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC 2021) predicts that atmospheric pCO2 will likely reach 940-1490 ppm by the end of the century. Consequently, global temperature is expected to increase by 1.5-4.5\u00b0C. This relationship between pCO2 levels and the magnitude of warming estimated from climate models is known as climate sensitivity. Models, however, are built upon an incomplete understanding of Earth\u2019s climate system and, to some extent, upon simplifications of biogeochemical- and physical processes that drive climatic feedback due to our limited computational capability to fully grasp the vast complexity of the system. On the other hand, reconstructions of past climate change using deep-time archives, although sparse in time and space, offer ground truths of equilibrium climatic responses to elevated pCO2, allowing climatologists to benchmark the performance of climate models. In this proposed study, the PI and researchers at NCAR will collaborate to integrate paleoclimate reconstructions of 15 million years ago (aka. the Middle Miocene) with climate model simulations. Current studies suggest that the Middle Miocene was ~6-10\u00b0C warmer than today while estimated pCO2 was only 200-300 ppm higher. This suggests a climate sensitivity of 6-10\u00b0C warming per doubling of pCO2, much higher than the 1.5-4.5\u00b0C suggested by IPCC 2021. The new study aims to explore possible explanations for this model-data discrepancy, with the hope that insights we gain from studying climatic processes under past warm conditions can improve our knowledge about future climate changes.\r\n\r\nProjections of future global warming depend critically on our knowledge of climate sensitivity, which is continually refined by emerging reconstructions of past warm climates. The mid-Miocene Climate Optimum (MMCO, ~17.5-13.9 Ma) is one such period that has recently inspired the development of paleoclimate simulations, aimed at improving our understanding of climatic dynamics when estimated pCO2 was higher than today. Paleoclimate records, however, pose several challenges to climate models, including high climate sensitivities and flat meridional temperature gradients, both of which are difficult to reproduce in models. This proposal puts forth a hypothesis that a possibly overlooked contributing factor to MMCO warming and model-data disagreement is the equilibrium responses of the deep ocean under elevated CO2 forcing. Unlike SST, Miocene deep-ocean temperature and circulation have not received much attention. Yet increasing evidence suggests that the equilibrium responses of the deep ocean differ from transient responses, and significantly affect the spatial and temporal patterns of surface warming. Evolving feedback with changing SST patterns and the degree of equilibration in turn influences equilibrium climate sensitivity. This proposed study seeks to address this gap by (1) performing long-running MMCO simulations (>6000 years) in collaboration with Jiang Zhu at NCAR (host institution) to produce equilibrium responses of the deep ocean; (2) comparing simulated MMCO oceans with paleo-proxies including benthic \u03b413C and Neodymium isotopes (\u025bNd) to explore patterns of Miocene ocean circulation; and (3) examining whether modeled equilibrium responses of the deep ocean reduce model-data mismatches in deep-water temperatures as well as the spatial patterns of SST, with focuses on the warming anomalies in the North Atlantic and the flat meridional temperature gradients during the MMCO.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
