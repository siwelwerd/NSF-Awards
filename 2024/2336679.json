 "awd_abstract_narration": "In response to the social reality of an increasingly diverse workplace, one critical challenge facing most contemporary organizations is to navigate the tension between diversity and unity. While most studies pursue only one aspect at a time, focusing on either diversity or unity, this project moves beyond a single-edged approach to study the diversity-unity paradox in a systematic, integrative manner. By introducing the concept of \u201cunified diversity\u201d to capture an organization\u2019s capacity to elicit diverse viewpoints and perspectives while simultaneously sustaining its oneness, this project aims to clarify the construct space of unified diversity, develop an integrative research model, and identify possible management practices for enhancing unified diversity. By doing so, this project sheds light on how to harmonize diversity and unity in organizations. The outcomes of this research hold significant promise for guiding individuals, organizations, and broader societal entities in harnessing unified diversity to enhance learning and performance.\r\n\r\nThe primary goal of this project is to investigate how organizations can leverage \u201cunified diversity\u201d to enhance learning and performance through human resource management. The project is structured in three key phases. The first phase involves conducting qualitative interviews and surveys to establish a clear conceptualization of unified diversity. In the second phase, the project employs computational modeling and quantitative surveys to examine the antecedents and outcomes of unified diversity, seeking to clarify organizational dynamics that lead to and result from unified diversity. The third phase integrates qualitative interviews, computational modeling, and quantitative survey studies to pinpoint effective management practices and organizational designs that promote unified diversity. By adopting a mixed-methods approach, this project enriches current knowledge about the nature of the diversity-unity paradox and the micro-foundations of unified diversity, which is essential for advancing organizational learning and maintaining a competitive edge in the contemporary business landscape.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
