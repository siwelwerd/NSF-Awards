 "awd_abstract_narration": "Our workshop aims to explore how the emerging quantum systems enable and expand novel Computer Systems Research (CSR) opportunities and promoting cross-disciplinary collaborations. Computer systems researchers possess expertise in building efficient programming environments, modeling and optimizing large-scale systems, and designing architectures for fault tolerance and performance. The workshop will highlight the necessity of rethinking the Quantum Computing (QC) software stack to efficiently process and respond to real-time events and data from quantum hardware. As quantum hardware scales up and becomes more heterogeneous and distributed, the quantum OS will be essential for executing error-correcting kernels, allocating system resources, managing shared quantum memory, and scheduling batch and concurrent programs. The quantum Operating System (OS) is a critical tool for maintaining precision control of large quantum systems and managing quantum resources for practical QC applications.\r\n\r\nRecent advancements in QC platforms have not only improved the quantity and quality of qubits but also introduced new capabilities such as mid-circuit measurements and real-time error detection. These advancements open new opportunities for exploring algorithms and quantum error correction protocols, but they also add significant complexity to the control systems and the programming/compilation toolchain. For example, significant improvements are needed in integrating classical high-performance computing resources with QC, developing software for optimizing and executing dynamic quantum circuits, benchmarking and verifying real-time control systems.\r\n\r\nAs a result, this workshop will inform the CSR community emerging trends of QC technologies and introduce research recommendations to address scalable and reliable software systems to achieve practical QC applications. This workshop will bring together researchers with expert knowledge across algorithms, software, architecture and physical devices to stimulate discussion and foster collaborations.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
