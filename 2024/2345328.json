 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Improving Undergraduate STEM Education: Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSI Program), this Track 1: Planning Project aims to conduct an institutional study of the needs of Southern Adventist University\u2019s STEM student population, identify and learn about strategies to improve specific issues related to retention, and train faculty to implement these strategies as appropriate in the classroom. Hispanic students at Southern Adventist University have higher attrition in STEM than other racial/ethnic groups, but the university currently lacks an understanding of the attrition points and causes and the knowledge and skills needed to plan evidence-based solutions. To gain this understanding and knowledge, this project will (1) document STEM student attrition related to campus climate; academic, social, and financial supports; curriculum and pedagogical strategies; and career awareness; (2) identify evidence-based practices to improve retention of students in STEM; and (3) train faculty and staff to implement identified strategies in a future Track 2 Implementation and Evaluation Project. These activities will contribute to improved outcomes for retention and success and lead to better outcomes for all students. As STEM careers pay well and are in high demand, retaining and graduating more STEM majors helps the communities and industries in need and supports young professionals aspiring to increase their social mobility. The results will be relevant to other institutions and will contribute to the body of knowledge, with special relevance to religious-based institutions and small southeastern universities. Faculty training will have lasting benefits at the university as faculty apply their learnings in future classrooms and contribute to a more inclusive campus climate and strong STEM culture.\r\n\r\nThe Planning Project will result in a comprehensive needs assessment and identification of evidence-based strategies to improve student retention in STEM programs at a small university that is the only HSI in Tennessee. The specific aims of the project are to (1) collect and analyze institutional and student data to identify causes of attrition and perceived needs related to sense of belonging, self-efficacy, cultural inclusion, campus climate, financial or mental health support, social support, and knowledge of career pathways; (2) identify a ranked list of strategies from a literature review to address the identified needs and learn about these strategies from the literature and peer institutions; and (3) identify faculty training needs based on literature review, discussions with other institutions, and collected data and implement faculty training for at least 75% of the STEM faculty. The internal study and evaluation will generate an analysis of factors that impede or promote success in students and will identify causes of attrition or success for students in STEM, perceived student needs, institutional strategies for working with students in STEM, other institutions\u2019 use of strategies, and the training needs of STEM faculty. Results will generate the knowledge needed to develop a future Track 2 proposal and contribute to the body of knowledge related to student success in STEM. The HSI Program aims to enhance undergraduate STEM education and build capacity at HSIs. Projects supported by the HSI Program will also generate new knowledge on how to achieve these aims.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
