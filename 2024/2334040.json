 "awd_abstract_narration": "PART 1: NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\n\r\nAlthough lithium-ion batteries (LIB) can be found everywhere and are widely used, scientific challenges still exist. For example, electric cars are still not as practical as gasoline cars because, among other issues, they are difficult to recharge in short times. To improve this, new materials need to be developed since the currently used materials in LIB are already close to their maximum capabilities. This research, supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program in NSF\u2019s Division of Materials Research, focuses on designing and synthesizing materials and elucidating structure-property trends that may lead to insights on how to improve the capacity of batteries. The project combines computational approaches with modern materials chemistry experiments to develop nanoscale materials, one hundred times smaller than the thickness of a human hair, with increased electron transport capabilities. The principal investigators make use of computational fundamental science to guide experiments and therefore virtual testing of a wide variety of materials, reducing the cost of testing and trial-and-error to reasonable budgets. Since batteries are used in all areas of human activities, it is difficult to imagine any activity in our society where remote electricity would not be beneficial. Additionally, the projects supports efforts to increase diversity and train the next generation of scientists and engineers.\r\n\r\nPART 2: TECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\n\r\nWith this project, supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program in NSF\u2019s Division of Materials Research, researchers at the University of Cincinnati and Texas A&M, investigate the design and synthesis of hybrid electrode materials that combine carbon nanomaterials and copper metallic surfaces to create an efficient and robust pathway for electron transport. To facilitate the understanding and quantification of electron transport at the interface, the team employs open-ended carbon nanotubes (CNTs) attached to a bulk copper substrate using stable linker molecules. The CNTs are oriented vertically compared to the Cu substrate, and only the ends of the CNTs are connected to Cu atoms. The research combines ab initio analysis, synthesis, and characterization studies. With the aim of impedance matching at the interface the team studies the materials as anodes for Li batteries, investigates energy storage performance and dendrite formation in the context of computational and experimental structure-property correlations. The results of this research could pave the way for more efficient batteries, new sensors, new catalysts, and new biodevices. Additionally, the multidisciplinary project provides experiential opportunities for the next generation of scientists. The principal investigators encourage diversity and actively motivate more minorities to pursue college and specialize in fields of science and technology.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
