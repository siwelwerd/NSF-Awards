 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is jointly supported by the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the Division of Chemistry Research Instrumentation program, and the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate Office of Strategic Initiatives. Clemson University is acquiring a 500 MHz NMR Spectrometer equipped with two solid-state probes to support the research of Professors Leah Casabianca, Ana Alba-Rubio, Kyle Brinkman, Mark Thies along with other researchers in the College of Science and the College of Engineering and Applied Sciences. This instrument facilitates research in the areas of materials science and environmental chemistry. In general, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution or in the solid state. This instrument enhances the educational, research, and teaching efforts of students at all levels in many departments at Clemson University and in the broader Western Carolinas region.\r\n\r\nResearch enabled by this instrument is focused on the study of understanding how small molecule toxins absorb to plastic nanoparticles in the environment; establishing structure-properties in layered perovskites for use in fuel cells; rational design of heterogeneous catalysts; creating high-value materials from lignin; understanding exciton transport in conjugated polymer nanoparticles; designing next-generation materials to alleviate mechanical failure; understanding structure and dynamics in charge-transporting metal organic frameworks and covalent organic frameworks; characterizing novel fluoropolymers; and understanding the formation and stability of natural deep eutectic solvents. As part of this proposal, the PI will teach a graduate course on solid-state NMR and develop lectures on solid-state NMR for undergraduates in Clemson\u2019s Programs for Educational Enrichment and Retention (PEER), Women in Science and Engineering (WISE), and the College of Science Mentoring and Inclusion Collaborative (COSMIC). Senior personnel on this project are affiliated with Clemson\u2019s Chemical Engineering Outreach Team and the Faculty ADVANCEment office. In response to global helium supply challenges, the acquisition of this instrument includes a superconducting magnet with a low loss cryostat reducing the institution\u2019s consumption of helium.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
