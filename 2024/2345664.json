 "awd_abstract_narration": "This EArly-concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) project seeks to measure and understand how recent corporate, private, and federal investments help to support and strengthen economic growth in a specific region of the country, in specific technology areas. The project will pursue novel approaches for critical assessment around two key areas viz., Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Electric Batteries in the State of Ohio, where there have been significant recent investments in research, development and job creation funding exceeding $3B since 2018. This EAGER project will focus on these two two areas by: (1) developing a better understanding of how significant investments in the growth of specific industries (AI and Electric Batteries) in a given region (Ohio) could help reduce the fundamental skills and the geographic gaps that can hinder full participation in the STEM workforce, and (2) exploring if AI methods are useful as tools for exploring career connections across emerging technologies and industries and in identifying emerging trends and future workforce needs. The project will develop a 2023 baseline for current and emerging career opportunities across the AI and Electric Battery industries throughout Ohio and continue adding data to this dataset over time. \r\n\r\nThis pilot project will help evaluate a new critical technology assessment tool and evaluate its ability to measure the effectiveness of past and ongoing workforce development efforts in these industries. In particular, the project will explore the efficacy of such investment in closing the fundamental skills and geographic gaps that currently exist not only in the state of Ohio but throughout multiple midwestern and southern states in the US. Once developed and evaluated, this platform could be applied and scaled across multiple emerging technology industries in different regions of the country. The project will employ AI methods to assist in creating a taxonomy of careers and credentials for AI and electric battery technology and create comprehensive mappings between credentials and jobs. The platform will analyze data related to job trends and patterns to forecast growth industries and to predict which credentials will be in demand, to help guide educational institutions, students, and professionals in making informed decisions about career paths. With a robust taxonomy in place the platform will be able to suggest educational and career paths tailored to individual aspirations, backgrounds, and strengths. The system will continuously update the taxonomy as new credentials emerge and old ones decline with changes in industry and job requirements.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
