 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national interest by enhancing conceptual learning in quantum and semiconductor physics using interactive visualizations and simulations. This Engaged Student Learning, Level 3 project will conduct the first large-scale investigation into the design of educational tools and design features that can significantly improve conceptual understanding in quantum and semiconductor physics in particular, and STEM in general. The project will develop more inclusive tools for a diversity of use cases and assess their utility and effectiveness across different educational environments.\r\n\r\nWhile interactive visualization and simulation tools have made progress in mitigating certain student misconceptions, there is a lack of comprehensive studies examining the design efficacy of these tools. Existing research in this area is constrained by both limited size and scope. This project will expand and refine the interactive visualizations and simulation tools previously developed by the team with a focus on aiding the conceptual understanding of quantum mechanics and semiconductor principles among undergraduate students. Additionally, the project will carry out extensive studies on the effectiveness of these tools across diverse educational environments. As a consortium of researchers spanning five diverse universities and colleges, the team will investigate the following research questions: 1) To what extent can such tools change undergraduate students' conceptions of Quantum Mechanics and Semiconductor Physics and 2) How does the design of such tools affect students\u2019 conceptions of these topics? The team will conduct two large-scale mixed-methods controlled studies using a concurrent triangulation design. Both quantitative and qualitative data will be collected and analyzed. Analysis methods include multilevel modeling, repeated measures multivariate analysis of covariance, and qualitative content analysis. The NSF IUSE: EDU Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through the Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
