 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to enable on-orbit manufacturing by providing raw materials recycled or sourced in space, directly on-orbit. Manufacturing hardware on-orbit can potentially relieve the costs and qualification lead times of space operations by significantly reducing launch costs. However, on-orbit manufacturing will still require inexpensive feedstock. This project\u2019s business approach which is space production from in-space materials addresses this core problem of orbital manufacturing. This project will bring significant transformations to a wide range of space activities, promoting a circular space economy, lowering the cost of orbital power, and simultaneously providing an economic incentive for satellite/debris reclamation, thus mitigating orbital debris and congestion. Providing raw materials sourced in space for on-demand, on-orbit manufacturing holds the potential to increase the economic competitiveness of the US through financially feasible space operations by reducing launch mass, costs, development time, and current payload and size limitations, supporting the US national defense by improving military power projection and logistics resilience, supporting future scientific studies of the solar system and deep space, expanding the limits of long-term exploration missions, and reducing dependence on cargo missions through in situ manufacturing and recycling capability.\r\n\r\nThis SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a novel approach for recycling photovoltaics in an orbital environment. The vacuum environment of space will be optimal for many steps in semiconductor manufacturing and can be considered a high-potential application for orbital manufacturing, enabling silicon production to scale well beyond the current constraints of terrestrial vacuum chamber bottlenecks. However, while the vacuum will be beneficial overall to silicon production, nearly every process in modern chemical manufacturing is reliant on gravity and needs to be adapted to function in a microgravity environment. This project focuses on the development of a fluidized bed reactor (FBR) for microgravity analog production of monosilane gas from end-of-life silicon photovoltaics and various hydrogen sources, as it constitutes the most critical step in the silicon production line. Within the scope of this project, particulates produced from PV cells will be characterized, a basic model of the thermochemical reactions will be developed to determine design parameter nominals and a benchtop prototype to characterize the mechanics of particle and gas flows in an analog to microgravity will be developed, establishing its feasibility for in-space processing for the envisioned applications.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
