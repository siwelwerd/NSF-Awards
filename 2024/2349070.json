 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at the University of Minnesota Department of Computer Science and Engineering aims to support a diverse group of undergraduate students in human-centered research projects that leverage computer science to advance social good. The objectives of this project are to: (1) provide support for undergraduate research, especially for students that are underrepresented or have limited access at their home institutions; (2) facilitate mentorship from leading researchers in virtual reality, visualization, human-computer interaction, and human-robot interaction; (3) explicitly train students in research methods and immerse them in the culture of science, and (4) provide professional development opportunities to prepare students for graduate school and scientific careers. REU student projects will produce novel technologies, algorithms, and interaction techniques that can enrich and empower human experiences with computing systems. \r\n\r\nTo achieve these goals, the REU site will recruit at least 50% of the cohort from institutions with limited research opportunities, with a particular emphasis on supporting women, underrepresented minorities, and first generation college students.  Participants will be immersed in highly collaborative research labs supervised by faculty with longstanding commitments to mentoring undergraduate researchers. To help students make the connection between computer science and advancing social good, all REU projects will be aligned with one or more of the Sustainable Development Goals established by the United Nations Foundation.  Students will apply their computer science knowledge to address important societal problems such as implicit bias mitigation, addiction recovery, locating underwater trash, sorting recyclables, and motivating climate action. At the cohort level, students will participate in a program of social events, research training seminars, invited research talks, and professional development workshops scheduled throughout the summer to support their scholarly and professional growth.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
