 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support students from institutions of higher learning in the United States to participate in the 8th IFAC Conference Series on Analysis and Design of Hybrid Systems (ADHS), to be held at the University of Colorado, Boulder during July 1-3, 2024. The field of hybrid systems explores the intricate interplay between discrete-event and continuous dynamics, an issue which arises frequently in modern technological systems. The award targets providing travel support for up to 20 students to attend this flagship conference. . The conference's overarching mission is to cultivate collaboration and facilitate the exchange of insights among researchers hailing from disciplines such as control engineering, computer science, and applied mathematics. Moreover, it extends its embrace to practitioners across a wide spectrum of application domains, spanning process industries, automotive, avionics, communication networks, energy systems, transportation networks, embedded systems, biology, manufacturing, and robotics. By bringing together these diverse perspectives and expertise, ADHS catalyzes innovation and fosters the cross-pollination of ideas to address complex challenges in the realm of hybrid systems.\r\n\r\nThe conference will provide students with the unique opportunity to engage with field experts through attending session talks, immersing themselves in enlightening keynote presentations, and fostering valuable connections during social events. The diverse array of session talks will span numerous categories, encompassing the latest developments in areas such as specification, verification, control synthesis, machine learning, and more. These sessions serve as a conduit for students to be exposed to the forefront of cutting-edge research and advancements in hybrid systems. Moreover, the social events are conducive to interaction between students and both seasoned and emerging leaders across various domains. These interactions not only broaden students' perspectives but also nurture relationships that can prove instrumental in their academic and professional journeys. The conference will offer undergraduate and graduate students a chance to connect with senior peers, enriching conference interactions. The award places priority on funding travel expenses for students from underrepresented groups.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
