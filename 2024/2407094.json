 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 2024 Workshop on \"Challenges and Opportunities in Neutrons in Structural Biology\" will focus on the use of neutrons to gain structural information across length scales in biological molecules: from the atomic level of individual hydrogen/deuterium atoms to the molecular level, where large biological assemblies can be mapped using small angle neutron scattering. The workshop will be structured to introduce graduate students and postdoctoral researchers with knowledge of protein structure and function but no or limited experience of neutron sciences to neutron macro-molecular crystallography and small angle neutron scattering. The workshop will facilitate networking among the next generation of neutron-scattering scientists in structural biology. The attendees will attend lectures focusing exclusively on neutron techniques applied in structural biology. The workshop will offer a unique program that is designed to challenge the participants to become leaders in neutron biological sciences.\r\nThe workshop will target graduate students from diverse backgrounds new to or with limited experience in neutron scattering. The aim is to increase participation from scientists from underrepresented groups in academia to broaden and diversify the neutron-scattering user US community by engaging collaborators at HBCUs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
