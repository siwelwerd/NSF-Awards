 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funding support for students to attend the Second EAI International Conference on Security and Privacy in Cyber-Physical Systems and Smart Vehicles (SmartSP 2024), to be held in New Orleans, Louisiana. Recent decades have witnessed an extraordinary growth in cyber-physical systems (CPS) such as self-driving vehicles, robotic devices, and drones. SmartSP is a global forum for researchers and developers from academia, industry, and government to present and discuss emerging ideas and trends in security and privacy issues in this exciting area with a particular focus on smart vehicles, smart transportation, and corresponding security challenges. The conference is particularly relevant for students and early-career researchers seeking to expand their knowledge, develop essential career skills, and engage with leading experts in the field. Together, the funding will help the intellectual and professional development of the students who attend and the SmartSP community as a whole.\r\n\r\nThe funding will help cover travel expenses for up to 8 U.S.-based student attendees. Selection of student attendees will be based on a range of criteria, including academic achievement, research experience, and interest in CPS, smart vehicles, and security challenges. Preference will be given to students who have conducted research in these areas and who have demonstrated a commitment to advancing the field through their academic and professional activities. Students attending the EAI SmartSP 2024 conference will be involved in a range of activities, including attending technical sessions, presenting their research, and participating in panel discussions and networking events.  These activities will provide opportunities for students to meet with leading experts in the field, engage in discussions about emerging trends and technologies, and explore potential career opportunities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
