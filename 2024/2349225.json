 "awd_abstract_narration": "The three-year renewal REU Site: Cellular Bioengineering: From Biomaterials to STEM Cells is hosted by Rutgers University-New Brunswick and provides opportunities to perform cutting-edge, cross-disciplinary research in the field of Cellular Bioengineering.  The REU site focuses on recruiting students who traditionally do not have these research opportunities, including first generation students and students who attend small schools that do not have extensive research enterprises. Ten students will engage in an immersive, 10-week research experience that also facilitates the development of technical and professional skills. Student research project areas include engineering cell therapies, drug delivery, regenerative medicine, cellular imaging, and systems biology. Students will participate in weekly professional development seminars and workshops that build on and complement the research activities and promote a deeper understanding about research (the big picture problem to solve, why it is important that we solve that problem, and how research contributes to solving that problem in a new and innovative ways). Participants will complete exercises in Health Disparities and in Innovation & Entrepreneurship to inspire them to recognize the disparate impact of biomedical research and eventual treatments on different U.S. communities. All of these opportunities for students can help them identify new opportunities and challenges for future research and technology and reveal career path options following graduate level training.\r\n\r\nThe three-year renewal REU Site: Cellular Bioengineering: From Biomaterials to STEM Cells is hosted by Rutgers University-New Brunswick and provides opportunities to perform cutting-edge, cross-disciplinary research in the field of Cellular Bioengineering.  The REU site focuses on recruiting students who traditionally do not have these research opportunities, including first generation students and students who attend small schools that do not have extensive research enterprises. Ten students will engage in an immersive, 10-week research experience that also facilitates the development of technical and professional skills. Student research project areas include engineering cell therapies, drug delivery, regenerative medicine, cellular imaging, and systems biology. Strategic and impactful formal programming, active mentoring, collaboration, and careful monitoring of the student experience are essential goals of the project. The Cellular Bioengineering Boot Camp introduces Scholars to laboratory, imaging, and statistical testing skills that accelerate their integration into their research labs. Students will participate in weekly professional development seminars and workshops that build on and complement the research activities and promote a deeper understanding about research (the big picture problem to solve, why it is important that we solve that problem, and how research contributes to solving that problem in a new and innovative ways). Participants will complete exercises in Health Disparities and in Innovation & Entrepreneurship to inspire them to recognize the disparate impact of biomedical research and eventual treatments on different U.S. communities. A parallel focus on Innovation and Entrepreneurship parallels the NSF I-Corps initiative for translational research to capitalize on the potential for new technology that emanates from the research and is related to a health disparity. New to this project is interfacing with program alumni to  provide training in \u201cWhat to do with a Phd\u201d to increase the career preparedness of the Scholars.  These opportunities for students can help them identify new opportunities and challenges for future research and technology and reveal career path options following graduate level training.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
