 "awd_abstract_narration": "IT Support Specialists analyze, troubleshoot, and evaluate technology issues, while Cybersecurity Technicians are responsible for protecting a business or organization from cyberattacks. The demand for these employees, especially cybersecurity technicians, far exceeds the number of graduates who have the credentials required to fill these positions. The goal of this project is to increase the number of IT job-ready graduates by developing course content designed to meet the needs of the IT industry in rural southwest Wyoming. This will be accomplished by developing a stackable credential program that supports industry-recognized certifications and embeds cooperative work-based learning experiences in the program. The program will be designed to support the learning needs of post-traditional students, women, and dual enrollment high school students.\r\n\r\nThe program will feature the use of the HyFlex learning environment that gives students a choice in how they participate in a course and engage with material. HyFlex removes the barriers faced by post-traditional learners, high school students, and individuals caring for families who want to pursue a college education and obtain marketable workplace skills. An industry advisement team will play a crucial role in guiding the development of course content. Instructors will actively solicit feedback from this advisory team, tailoring program content to address specific industry needs. The project evaluation plan will make use of both formative and summative components to assess the fidelity and effectiveness of the program. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the Nation's economy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
