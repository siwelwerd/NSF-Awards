 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award  funds participation of  junior US mathematicians in the 31st edition of Gael (G\u00e9om\u00e9trie Alg\u00e9brique en Libert\u00e9) from June 17-21, 2024 at Turin, Italy, held jointly by Politecnico di Torino and Universit\u00e0 di Torino. G\u00e9om\u00e9trie Alg\u00e9brique en Libert\u00e9 is a series of annual meetings organized for and by junior researchers in algebraic geometry with a long tradition, drawing in 70-90 participants each year. There are both casual and structured career opportunities for junior mathematicians to interact with speakers and other attendees. \r\n\r\nGAeL XXXI will bring together leading experts on a range of topics within Algebraic Geometry, providing an excellent opportunity for junior mathematicians to learn about major new developments. There will be three senior speakers giving mini-courses covering cutting edge results from a wide variety of topics so that GAeL appeals to all PhD students and junior postdocs in algebraic geometry. The rest of the talks are chosen from among the junior participants, often providing the first opportunity for many of these individuals to speak in front of an international audience. More information about GAeL XXXI may be found on the event website: https://sites.google.com/view/gaelxxxi\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
