 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from this CC* Planning award, Central Michigan University (CMU) is investigating its cyberinfrastructure (CI) capabilities to identify areas of strength, weakness, and opportunity. The rapid evolution of technology and the increasing complexity of research questions necessitate proactively anticipating future needs and planning. A modern CI is essential for CMU to support innovative faculty research and enhance student learning experiences that are otherwise unattainable with the existing infrastructure. With CMU\u2019s active 5-year strategic plan as a guide, this project aligns with institutional priorities to inspire students, foster scholarly success, and engage communities. This project enables CMU to provide increased contributions to broader scientific advancements and expand interdisciplinary collaborations. Sharing experiences and supporting institutions embarking on similar initiatives are critical aspects of the project\u2019s aspirations.\r\n\r\nThis project is structured around a series of CI planning activities aligned with four strategic aims: (1) Evaluate existing CI capabilities through a comprehensive needs assessment. (2) Forge trust-based partnerships with CI professionals and regional leaders such as Michigan State University and Merit Network, Inc. (3) Develop a forward-thinking Campus CI Plan aligned with institutional goals and key science drivers. (4) Operationalize the newly developed plan by seeking future National Science Foundation (NSF) Campus Cyberinfrastructure (CC*) support. These four aims are the blueprint for enhancing CMU\u2019s ability to drive scientific knowledge forward through a comprehensive CI.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
