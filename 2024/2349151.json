 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi (TAMUCC) Physical and Environmental Sciences Department will host a Summer Undergraduate Research Focus (SURF): Anthropogenic Impacts on Coastal and Marine Systems. This REU site is committed to exploring the effects of human activities on coastal and marine environments. The program is committed to recruiting students from groups historically underrepresented in ocean sciences, including females, first-generation college students and minorities. Recruiting will focus on students from South Texas community colleges and incoming first-year students to juniors. The program aims to provide diverse research opportunities and professional development to participating students. Every year from 2024 to 2026, up to ten students from across the nation will be selected to conduct individual research with the guidance of experienced mentors from diverse fields of study. SURF REU students will engage in multidisciplinary research that addresses contemporary societal challenges such as climate change, coastal and oceanographic environmental issues, water resource management, biodiversity loss, and sustainable development. Activities will include field sample collection, analytical instrumentation theory and application, laboratory training, modeling, ethics in science, professional development, and a culminating SURF research symposium at the end of the summer. \r\n \r\nIn parallel with individual projects, REU students will participate in a cohort research experience named \"Critical Zone Science at the Island University.\" This initiative introduces students to critical zone science, offering a holistic perspective on Earth's spheres. It provides firsthand insight into the adaptive capacities of coastal critical zones facing anthropogenic pressures like hurricanes and rising sea levels. This experience lays the foundation for nurturing a cohort of scientists equipped to develop integrated strategies for more resilient coastlines. The broader impact of the SURF REU Site will contribute to the NSF goal of increasing the scientific workforce diversity and to the Division of Ocean Sciences' goal of developing a future workforce in ocean sciences.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
