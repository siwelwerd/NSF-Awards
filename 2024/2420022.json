 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research completed in association with this RAPID award examines household and emergency managers\u2019 responses to a 2024 Earthquake and subsequent tsunami, with a specific focus on the under-explored phenomenon of nighttime disaster response. By studying how social and environmental dynamics, past experiences, and the challenges posed by COVID-19 shaped tsunami response, this project generates insights necessary to improve planning efforts for future tsunamis. The knowledge gained through this study provides important information for improving nighttime earthquake and tsunami preparedness, response, and recovery in the United States and worldwide. Specifically, the findings directly inform emergency managers about effective strategies for nighttime disaster responses and preferences regarding shelters, thereby enhancing the resilience of communities facing similar risks.\r\n\r\nTo advance theory, this research project builds on and enhances the Protective Action Decision Model (PADM) by investigating the impact of social and physical environmental contexts on individuals' risk perceptions and decisions regarding tsunami evacuation, utilizing a Structural Equation Modeling approach. Using a convergent mixed methods design employing a combination of surveys and interviews, data collected for this project provides a comprehensive understanding of decision making from both affected households and emergency management professionals. Reliance on validated instruments allows for comparing research findings to existing studies and expanding the PADM to encompass nighttime disaster responses. The incorporation of local partners and a variety of dissemination methods ensures that this project bridges the gap between research insights and practical applications, ultimately fostering safer and more resilient communities facing nighttime hazards.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
