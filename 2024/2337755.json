 "awd_abstract_narration": "Examining Servingness: The Experiences of Latino Engineering Graduate Students in\r\nHispanic- Serving Institutions\r\n\r\nLatinos are projected to soon become the largest demographic group in the U.S. Our representation in\r\nengineering higher education is critical for the country\u2019s competitiveness and will broaden our engagement in the field. To that effect, Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSIs) play a crucial role in serving the Latino community\u2014 yet the concept of \u201cserving\u201d in doctoral education at HSIs remains largely unclear. Federal designation requires only that an institution\u2019s enrollment consists of \u2265 25% Latino full-time students, so\u2014as Latino population demographics increase\u2014more institutions will become HSIs. HSIs\u2019 high graduation rates of Latinos with engineering doctorates indicate a degree of success in how these institutions support their Latino students. However, how HSIs promote doctoral students\u2019 success in achieving degree completion has not been studied. Therefore, to better understand the role of HSIs on Latino Ph.D. success, understanding how \u201cserving\u201d\u2014that is, how to support Latino graduate students beyond enrollment\u2014is crucial. This CAREER project will lay the foundation for HSIs to effectively empower Latino students to lead research and innovation through their doctoral engineering programs. Specifically, this project will explore how Engineering HSIs directly impact the experiences of Latino graduate students in engineering.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis project addresses the research question: How do HSIs\u2019 servingness support Latino engineering doctoral students? To do so, this project will employ a multi-case study methodology using institutions as the unit of analysis to longitudinally study the experiences of Latino engineering doctoral students at two different types of engineering HSIs: the University of Puerto Rico at Mayag\u00fcez, a research-emerging engineering HSI, and Arizona State University, an R1 recently designated as an HSI. This project will leverage trusted site coordinators in each institution\u2019s College of Engineering to recruit Latino engineering students in the first year of their engineering Ph.D. and follow them over a four-year period via monthly prompts to understand their Ph.D. experiences. This project will also involve graduate education stakeholders at these institutions via periodic interviews to understand the institutional factors that impact doctoral students\u2019 experiences at their institutions. The collected data will be analyzed alongside institutional data and documents relating to the servingness efforts at each university to contextualize the participants\u2019 perspectives. By triangulating these data sources, this work will uncover the connection between doctoral student experiences as a function of the structures for \u201cserving.\u201d The methods will be guided via two frameworks: (1) Garcia, N\u00fa\u00f1ez, and Sansone\u2019s framework for servingness and (2) the Graduate Student Socialization framework. Combining these two frameworks will address two vantage points in the analyses\u2014one from the students\u2019 development in HSIs and a second from the HSIs\u2019 impact on students. The education plan focuses on doctoral education leaders from both institutions. Using a community of practice model, graduate associate deans, program leads, and staff will learn how institutions can serve Latino doctoral students in engineering through collaborative workshops showcasing research findings. Outcomes include a list characterizing high-impact practices articulating insights across both institutions and an established network of HSI practice-sharing. Finally, this project will develop a scoresheet to be used as a rubric by HSI leaders at other institutions to evaluate institutional structures for servingness and their impact on doctoral students. As a result, this work will help identify and disseminate best practices that HSIs and other institutions can implement to better serve Latino doctoral students.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
