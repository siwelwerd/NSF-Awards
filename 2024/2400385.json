 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-technical Abstract: Achieving carbon neutrality is essential for the sustainability of society as carbon dioxide emission becomes an increasingly urgent issue. The conversion of carbon dioxide using electricity presents a promising solution. This project at Clark Atlanta University aims to advance clean energy solutions by developing next-generation nanostructured materials to make electricity-driven carbon dioxide conversion more efficient and economically viable. The expected outcomes have the potential to significantly reduce greenhouse gas levels and contribute to a greener future with sustainable energy and chemical industries. Additionally, this project enriches the education of students from underrepresented backgrounds by offering interdisciplinary programs that integrate electrochemistry, material science, catalysis and engineering. The principal investigator\u2019s (PI) research will be closely integrated with education plans and outreach activities to improve accessibility of clean energy and advanced materials education to students and communities. This will expand the pipeline of underrepresented students into careers in clean energy and advanced materials by equipping them with the necessary knowledge and practical skills.\r\n\r\nTechnical Abstract: The project focuses on advancing the field of electrochemical carbon dioxide conversion. Current catalyst materials for this process face several challenges: (1) low energy efficiency to drive the reaction, (2) production of a mixture of various products that complicates product separation, and (3) fast degradation. To address those challenges, the PI aims to achieve precise control over the intermetallic phase, nanostructures, surface composition and local environment of the catalyst materials, thus improving the catalytic efficiency and stability. These atomically precise materials also serve as a platform to study the fundamental structure-catalysis relationship, further providing guidelines to advance the development of electrochemical carbon dioxide conversion devices for wide applications. Leveraging the PI\u2019s expertise in the chemical synthesis of nanomaterials, material characterization, electrochemistry and spectroscopy, the project will implement comprehensive methods including colloidal synthesis, surface modification, electrochemical techniques, X-ray study, electron microscopic study, and in-operando spectroscopic study. The objectives are: (1) developing novel synthetic approaches of nano-intermetallics based on earth-abundant metals via controllable solution-based synthesis and post-treatment; (2) harnessing the electronic and strain effects for efficient carbon dioxide conversion by controlling the surface composition, core/shell structure and facets of nano-intermetallics; (3) unraveling the reaction pathways and mechanisms for producing valuable chemicals and fuels by studying the catalyst structures and intermediates under the reaction conditions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
