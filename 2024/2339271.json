 "awd_abstract_narration": "Photonics is a powerful technology that enables ever-growing data transfer and inspires novel energy-efficient and reconfigurable architectures that will empower the computers of the future. However, the present diversity of colors in photonic chips calls for a universal approach to transfer signals from one light frequency to another. Currently, chips carry near-infrared signals for communication, visible signals for imaging, and mid-infrared for thermal radiation and sensing applications. Conversion between these chips through electronics-driven detection and emission limits efficiency and operation speed. This research effort addresses the problem of efficient frequency conversion on a chip. It connects signals across five octaves of light through nonlinear and quantum light-matter interactions in designer nanostructures called photonic-phononic metasurfaces. Photonic-phononic metasurfaces will be conceived using modern tools of nanotechnology, as well as rigorous numerical design approaches and state-of-the-art optical testing tools, including femtosecond lasers and single-photon correlation techniques. The results of this research will pave the way to better, more efficient signaling on a chip, which will allow seamless integration of heterogeneous photonic platforms and chiplets. An essential component of this project is an integrated educational effort to train a diverse group of future semiconductor microelectronics and quantum information specialists. Through clean room training, hands-on experience with quantum communication protocols, and public talks, the project\u2019s team will play an important role in shaping the landscape of high-tech research and education of tomorrow.\r\n\r\nThis CAREER project aims to bridge the gap between mid-, near-infrared, and visible photonics at the nanoscale by exploring nonlinear and quantum light-matter interactions. Over five years, the foundation for connecting light frequencies across five octaves between the visible and mid-infrared in nanoscale devices will be developed. The three main objectives include unraveling the fundamental properties of co-designed photonic-phononic metasurfaces based on a combination of phonon-polaritonic materials (hBN, MoO3) and resonant dielectric nanostructures; facilitating wave-mixing of photons across different frequencies; and employing mid-infrared drive for single-photon emission in strained two-dimensional materials. To achieve these objectives, full-wave analysis, nanomechanical co-design, nanoscale fabrication and characterization tools, near-field microscopy, femtosecond spectroscopy, and correlation measurements will be used. The project holds intellectual merit in exploring the nonlinear and quantum properties of phonon-polaritonic materials, offering a framework for on-chip light management with unprecedented bandwidth, footprint, and efficiency. The broader impacts extend to influencing society through advancements in on-chip photonics, impacting computing, signal processing, telecommunication, quantum information, and biophotonics. The project integrates research and education through semiconductor- and quantum-ready education and workforce development activities. Clean room training for a diverse body of participants, hands-on experience with quantum communication protocols, and public talks will provide training opportunities and inclusion efforts in collaboration with academic and regional organizations.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
