 "awd_abstract_narration": "The conference \u201cStatistics in the Age of AI\u201d will be held at George Washington University, Washington, DC on May 9-11, 2024. With the boom of artificial intelligence (AI), partly accelerated by the launching of large language models (e.g., ChatGPT), AI tools have reached every corner of our society. In this era where many business and scientific problems are being tackled via AI systems, statistics has become more critical than ever since it can offer uncertainty quantification, causal analysis, and interpretability among others, which most AI systems are lacking. This conference will bring together researchers and practitioners in academics and industries to explore the impact of AI on statistical research, education, and practice and also to brainstorm how statistics can contribute to AI. The conference organizers encourage participation and attendance by students, post-doctoral scholars, early-career researchers, and individuals from underrepresented groups. \r\n\r\nThe conference features short courses, poster and oral presentations, and panel discussions. The two short courses will focus on causal inference and conformal inference respectively. The presentations and panel discussions will address efficient handling of data for AI models and architectures, uncertainty quantification, and responsible decision-making among other topics. Further information will become available on the conference website: https://statistics.columbian.gwu.edu/statistics-age-ai.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
