 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project, funded by the MPS-LEAPS (Launching Early-Career Academic Pathways) Program and managed by the Broadening Participation Program in the Division of Chemistry (CHE-BP), Professor Michael Enright and his students at San Francisco State University will perform studies focused on the design and development of efficient nanoscale catalysts capable of driving new photoredox processes. Most existing photocatalytic processes are limited by high catalyst loading, reliance upon precious metals, or poor efficiency resulting from radiative recombination on the nanosecond timescale. Professor Enright and his students will use CuAlS2/ZnS nanoparticles as model systems to understand the role of nanoparticle structure on photocatalytic performance. The proposed experiments will quantify competitive rates of exciton separation, hole quenching, and back electron transfer across heterostructure nanomaterials to understand specific materials and structural attributes that lead to improved photocatalysis. Their studies could lead to the development of improved nanoscale catalysts to drive new photoredox processes, and could contribute to the development of new nanomaterial-driven photocatalytic reactions. This project is designed to provide research experiences for a diverse cohort of student investigators and to promote the inclusion of students from minority groups underrepresented in STEM and first-generation college students.\r\n\r\nThis work seeks to make significant contributions to the development of nanoscale photocatalysts. In addition to developing heavy-metal-free heterostructures using CuAlS2/ZnS, this investigation will give insights into the impacts of nanocrystal morphology on the catalytic viability of type II heterostructures. The proposed investigation seeks to become one of the first non-oxide-based examples of sustained photocatalysis with nanocrystals using an applied bias. Furthermore, future development of new, previously inaccessible photoredox reactions for nanocrystals and even multielectron/multiproton reactions with molecular co-catalysts could become possible because of this work. Significant components of this work will be investigated in Course-based Undergraduate Research Experiences, where students will learn the same skills as a traditional laboratory but also learn the advanced laboratory techniques and how to use instrumentation using the proposed nanoparticles and photocatalysis instead of pre-stocked laboratory samples.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
