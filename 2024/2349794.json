 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to develop new methods for the mathematical theory in several problems of interest involving partial differential equations (PDE). The problems share some common features and are motivated by various physical phenomena such as the interaction of elastic membranes in contact with one another, jet flows of fluids, surfaces of minimal area, and optimal transportation between the elements of two regions. Advancement in the theoretical knowledge about these problems would be beneficial to the scientific community in general and possibly have applications to more concrete computational aspects of solving these equations numerically. The outcomes of the project will be disseminated at a variety of seminars and conferences.  \r\n\r\nThe project focuses on the regularity theory of some specific free boundary problems and nonlinear PDE. The first part is concerned with singularity formation in the Special Lagrangian equation. The equation appears in the context of calibrated geometries and minimal submanifolds. The Principal Investigator (PI) studies the stability of singular solutions under small perturbations together with certain degenerate Bellman equations that are relevant to their study. The second part of the project is devoted to free boundary problems. The PI investigates regularity questions that arise in the study of the two-phase Alt-Phillips family of free boundary problems. Some related questions concern rigidity of global solutions in low dimensions in the spirit of the De Giorgi conjecture. A second problem of interest involves coupled systems of interacting free boundaries. They arise in physical models that describe the configuration of multiple elastic membranes that are interacting with each other according to some specific potential. Another part of the project is concerned with the regularity of nonlocal minimal graphs and some related questions about the boundary Harnack principle for nonlocal operators.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
