 "awd_abstract_narration": "Uncovering fundamental mechanisms of organelle and cell dynamics is required for a comprehensive model of plant growth and development as well as for understanding how plants adapt to their environment. Such knowledge is critical for fundamental advances in basic plant cell biology and to promote translation of research knowledge into agricultural applications. The 2024 Plant Cell Dynamics conference, to be held June 4-7, 2024 at the University of Wisconsin, Madison campus will focus on providing opportunities for plant cell biologists to learn quantitative approaches to analyze cellular dynamics and function, including live cell imaging and computational tools. It will also provide a venue for students, postdoctoral scientists, and new investigators to interact with established leaders in the field of plant cell biology, thus providing positive impacts on career development for students and trainees at all levels. By encouraging and supporting attendance of trainees from underrepresented groups, the conference will broaden participation in this developing field, which employs techniques of quantitative, predictive, and theory-driven biology, and encourages multidisciplinary approaches. \r\nThe conference will include a keynote speaker who will discuss current methodology that is appropriate for studying protein interactions. In addition, keynote speakers from biotechnology companies will discuss career opportunities in industry. In addition, there will be opportunities for oral and poster presentations by trainees.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
