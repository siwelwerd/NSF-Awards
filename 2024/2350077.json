 "awd_abstract_narration": "The AGU Chapman Conference on Remote Sensing of the Water Cycle: Sensors to Science to Society will be held in Honolulu, Hawaii, from February 13 to 16, 2024. The purpose of this Chapman Conference is to harness the power of satellite remote sensing observations of the terrestrial water cycle and hydrological models to benefit society. The conference will bring together international and diverse expertise to explore relationships between science and societal applications. The Chapman Conference will include about 200 participants, of which more than half will be early career, including graduate students, postdocs, and pre-tenure faculty. The goal of participant support is to broaden participation by demographic groups underrepresented in the Earth and space sciences, applicants with financial needs, and those who have not previously studied outside of their home country. \r\n\r\nIn the past decade there have been significant advances in the fields of sensor technology, satellite missions, modeling and applications to benefit society.\u202fSatellite observations are made more frequently and at higher resolutions, commercial satellites now number in the hundreds, and private businesses are now focused on remote sensing applications to water science. Big data coupled with AI/ML methods increases capacity for data assimilation to inform complex modeling systems. This conference will convene a broad intersection of the research community to explore the most pressing research questions related to remote sensing of the water cycle and to foster new ideas on how these efforts can benefit society.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
