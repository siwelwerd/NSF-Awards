 "awd_abstract_narration": "Southern Regional Number Theory Conferences (SRNTCs) are planned to be held in the Gulf Coast region March 9\u201311, 2024, and in Spring 2025, at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge. The 2024 conference will be the 10th anniversary of the conference series. The SRNTC series serves as an annual number theory event for the Gulf Coast region. It brings together researchers from the region and beyond to disseminate and discuss fundamental research in various branches of number theory, in turn fostering communication and collaboration between researchers. Local students and early-career researchers attending the conferences are exposed to a wide array of problems and techniques, including specialized topics that may have no local experts at their home institutions. Students and early-career researchers are given opportunities to present their research through contributed talks and to expand their professional network.\r\n\r\nSRNTC 2024 will feature about ten invited talks by established experts from four countries, speaking on topics in algebraic number theory, analytic number theory, and automorphic forms. It will also feature about twenty-five contributed talks, mostly by regional graduate students and early-career researchers. Information about SRNTC 2024 and SRNTC 2025, including a registration form and the schedule for each conference, is available at the conference website (https://www.math.lsu.edu/srntc).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
