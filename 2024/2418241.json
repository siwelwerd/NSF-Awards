 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact of this I-Corps project is the development of a lithium battery cathode technology free from critical raw materials such as cobalt and nickel.  This innovation may impact on the lithium battery industry, fostering a sustainable supply chain and responsible sourcing for clean energy manufacturing. The cathode is the positive end of a battery and represents the bulk of its cost. Current state-of-the-art lithium-ion batteries are reaching their theoretical limit due to the limited lithium storage capacity of cathodes. The surge in electric vehicles and demand for lithium-ion batteries will escalate critical raw materials demand, with the extraction of metals linked to environmental and geopolitical concerns. Global energy demand for electrifying 1.3 billion light-duty vehicles using current cobalt-based cathodes requires tens of megatons of cobalt. Conversely, this nickel- and cobalt-free cathode technology brings substantial value by introducing cathodes based on the raw materials available in the U.S. This technology alleviates the strain on nickel- and cobalt-based cathodes, de-risking the battery materials supply chain in terms of cost and sustainability.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. This solution is based on the development of a new cathode materials through unique molecular tuning of chemical structures free using critical raw materials such as nickel and cobalt. The technology introduces cathode materials using abundant metals available in the U.S. The successful development of these new cathodes will enhance fast charging, safety and lithium storage capacity and, more importantly, strengthen domestic manufacturing of sustainable battery materials. The innovative cathode will improve into both conventional and advanced lithium batteries (lithium metal and solid-state batteries). This technology translation aims to achieve a low cost/kilowatt-hour and establish a sustainable battery material supply chain through domestic manufacturing.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
