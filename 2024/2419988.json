 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports participation in the conference \u201cGroups, Logic, and Computation: Interactions between group theory, model theory, and computer science\" that will be held at the Stevens Institute of Technology (New Jersey), June 12-14, 2024. The event will bring researchers from various branches of group theory, model theory, and computer science together to work on some of the many open questions in the field that are now being studied from fresh and promising perspectives; it will further strengthen the connections the field has to other branches of mathematics. This exchange of ideas among experts, students, and postdocs aims to disseminate current knowledge and identify promising directions for further progress.\r\n\r\nThe conference will be devoted to developments in group theory focusing on groups and group actions as well as other areas of mathematics in which groups or group actions are used as a main tool. The program covers many branches of modern group theory with preference given to geometric, asymptotic, and combinatorial group theory, dynamics of group actions, probabilistic and analytic methods, first-order rigidity, first-order classification, and Diophantine problems in groups and rings. More information can be found at \r\nhttps://web.stevens.edu/algebraic/Stevens2024/\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
