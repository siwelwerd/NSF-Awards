 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Improving Undergraduate STEM Education: Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSI Program), this Educational Instrumentation project at California State University San Marcos (CSUSM) will strengthen undergraduate learning in quantum information science and technology (QIST). Specifically, this project will secure two types of instruments: (1) quantum optic single-photon setups, and (2) electronic measurement equipment, which will allow students to conduct cutting edge experiments in advanced undergraduate physics courses and laboratory sections. An estimated 80 students will utilize the project-funded equipment each year. In addition to providing improved experiences in courses including Modern Physics, Quantum Physics, and Quantum Mechanics, the new equipment will also be used by student researchers in CSUSM\u2019s Summer Scholars program and engaged in independent research projects with faculty mentors. \r\n\r\nThe goals of this project are to enrich the learning and experiences of undergraduate students by providing state-of-the-art instrumentation to conduct experiments and support student learning in QIST. Specifically, faculty will be able to facilitate both single-photon experiments, which will allow students to engage with and better understand complex quantum properties and concepts. The project will also secure low-noise electronics that, together with available nanofabricated devices and existing cryogenic systems at CSUSM, will allow students to take multiple silicon qubit measurements in physics laboratory courses.  The project will assess the impact of the project funded equipment through usage data and modified course evaluations designed to explore students\u2019 attitudes and awareness of QIST. This project is funded by the HSI Program, which aims to enhance undergraduate STEM education, broaden participation in STEM, and increase capacity to engage in the development and implementation of innovations to improve STEM teaching and learning at HSIs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
