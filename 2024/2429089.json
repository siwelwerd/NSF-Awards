 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Lean Research Administration Model of Practice (RAMP) planning grant is a one-year award to prepare for a larger-scale Lean RAMP Implementation project. RAMP implementation is poised to establish a scalable model for research enterprises, irrespective of their type and size, with the aim of overcoming institutional and systemic obstacles, augmenting infrastructure, increasing efficiency, fostering relationships, bolstering the workforce, and improving research infrastructure through the application of Lean methodology to research administration. Improving the operational business of how research is done at myriad institutions promotes the progress of science and supports a robust national research enterprise.\r\n \r\n\r\nThe Lean Research Administration Model of Practice (RAMP) planning grant has three key objectives: to identify and establish meaningful collaborations with several academic organizations that represent diverse research administrative needs for participation in planning and implementation;  to assess the state of RA regionally by designing and deploying a survey to RA broadly throughout the region, generating new knowledge and collecting baseline data; and, to develop a detailed RAMP implementation plan, inclusive of logistics, roles and responsibilities, and curriculum and change management plans. This planning work will create a solid foundation and partnership network for the implementation of RAMP, allowing for the streamlining of research administration processes across diverse academic research institutions through the adoption of Lean methodology.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
