 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national interest by implementing and establishing practices to improve student motivation in organic chemistry; a critical STEM discipline often fraught with challenges. By focusing on the concept of perceived costs \u2014 sacrifices and losses students associate with academic tasks \u2014 the study endeavors to develop targeted interventions to empower students and enhance their engagement with the subject matter. Through innovative approaches integrating Situated Expectancy-Value Theory (SEVT) and Self-Determination Theory (SDT), this research seeks to deepen understanding of student motivation and learning processes within the realm of organic chemistry education. This initiative aligns seamlessly with NSF's mission to support transformative projects that advance knowledge and foster educational equity. Moreover, by addressing the multifaceted challenges students encounter in organic chemistry, this project has the potential to yield significant breakthroughs in STEM education, contributing to NSF's broader goal of enhancing diversity and inclusion within the scientific community.\r\n\r\nThe primary goals of this research project are to investigate the impact of perceived costs on student achievement and retention in organic chemistry courses, particularly focusing on historically marginalized student populations. The study will employ a mixed-methods approach, combining qualitative and quantitative analyses to explore the relationship between perceived costs, student motivation, and course outcomes. Additionally, targeted interventions, such as Writing-to-Learn activities, will be implemented and evaluated to assess their effectiveness in mitigating the negative effects of perceived costs and enhancing student engagement and achievement. By leveraging SEVT and SDT frameworks, the research aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms underlying student motivation and learning in organic chemistry education. The findings from this study are expected to inform evidence-based strategies for supporting student success in high-stakes STEM courses and may pave the way for similar interventions in other disciplines. The NSF IUSE: EDU Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through the Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
