 "awd_abstract_narration": "The National AI Research Resource (NAIRR) workshop aims to establish an accessible AI software stack that democratizes AI capabilities and empowers diverse users. By bringing together academics, researchers, and industry experts, the workshop will address immediate and long-term objectives for the NAIRR pilot, pinpointing critical components for various scientific research domains. Focus areas will include real-time data analysis, AI-based decision-making, privacy, security, and software portability across emerging AI hardware platforms. This collaborative effort is designed to ensure that the resulting AI software stack meets the needs of a broad spectrum of users, from beginners to experts, fostering an inclusive AI ecosystem.\r\n\r\nThe workshop's outcomes will emphasize the creation of ethical, transparent, and trustworthy AI software tailored for scientific research. The workshop aims to foster innovation, enhance diversity, and ensure equitable access to AI resources by leveraging existing software stacks from academia, national laboratories, and industry. Discussions will address user-support needs, funding requirements, and procedures for incorporating new software developments into the NAIRR stack. The workshop will culminate in the production of a comprehensive report detailing the necessary AI software stack to serve users ranging from beginners to experts, thereby fostering an inclusive AI ecosystem. This effort will lay the foundation for a robust, democratized AI research infrastructure, driving innovation across the U.S. AI landscape.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
