 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 42nd Southeastern-Atlantic Regional Conference on Differential Equations (SEARCDE) will be held at West Virginia University, Morgantown, WV, on November 9-10, 2024. SEARCDE has devoted itself to bringing together the region\u2019s leading experts and young researchers for over forty years. The meeting provides a valuable venue for researchers to exchange ideas and foster collaborations on questions arising from differential equations and applications. Moreover, it provides an excellent mentorship platform for students, postdoctoral researchers, and junior faculty. It has become a tradition for SEARCDE to include a significant proportion of talks by advanced undergraduates, graduate students, and postdocs, who are encouraged to present their research. Additionally, application-oriented talks that focus on numerical or experimental aspects will interest engineers, software developers, and other professionals in the region. \r\n\r\nThe 42nd SEARCDE is committed to inclusion and diversity. This year, the conference will be held \"in cooperation with the Association for Women in Mathematics (AWM)\" to boost visibility and awareness and further encourage the participation of women and underrepresented groups. The conference, which consists of four plenary speakers and parallel sessions with invited and contributed presentations, will focus on the following themes:  (1) Analytical approaches to solving differential equations with physical, life, and material sciences applications, (2) Numerical and computational methods in solving differential equations, (3) Optimization and applications in control and data sciences. More information about the conference can be found at https://mathanddata.wvu.edu/searcde-2024.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
