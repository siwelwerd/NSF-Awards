 "awd_abstract_narration": "Over the past decade there has been an exponential growth in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) applications that are moving out of the lab into the world and impacting everyday lives. Consequently, there has also been increased attention to harmful algorithmic biases in AI/ML applications. As such, it is critical to prepare K\u201312 students and teachers to go beyond using AI/ML applications and be able to comprehend, design, implement, and evaluate AI applications. This conference project will convene workshop meetings and panel presentations with researchers and practitioners to better understand how learners can engage with AI/ML creatively. Creative AI refers to the use of AI tools and methods for creative expression, that is, involving students not just in using AI productively but also as creators who can design and build projects with AI/ML. This workshop focuses on impact areas of tool design, ethics, learning, teaching and assessment to examine the role of creative AI in K-12 education. The interdisciplinary project team with expertise in computing education, tool development, learning sciences, culturally relevant pedagogy, and developmental psychology will convene workshop meetings in Fall 2024 and Spring 2025 to share main approaches, identify critical issues, and outline promising directions. The workshop will involve educators and include mentoring meetings with advanced graduate students and early career researchers.\r\n\r\nWorkshop meetings will investigate the role of creative AI in K-12 education and carry out the following activities: (1) identifying potential connections (as well as differences) to computational thinking; (2) examining grade-appropriate pedagogical designs that can promote understanding and discussions of ethical concerns; and (3) developing an outline that articulates directions for learning AI/ML and teaching of creative AI. This workshop will contribute to research on the design of toolkits and applications, on how to support students learning AI/ML, and discussion points around algorithmic justice and fairness. Outcomes of the workshop will include (a) an online report that will identify guidelines for promising educational tools, pedagogies, activities and research directions and (b) public panels at educators\u2019 conferences to share findings with educational practitioners. Dissemination efforts will target K-12 researchers, designers and policy makers concerned with computing and STEM education. This conference project is funded by the Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program, which supports projects that build understandings of practices, program elements, contexts, and processes contributing to increasing students' knowledge and interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and information and communication technology (ICT) careers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
