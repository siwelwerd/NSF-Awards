EpiBio explores fundamental research and cutting-edge technologies and applications related to the epigenome. The conference brings together interdisciplinary expertise in the field \u2014 allying biology, chemistry, physics, data science, and engineering to foster the development of novel methodologies and tools to answer biological questions in epigenetics. Attendees, including graduate students, post-docs, academic faculty, and industry professionals will have the opportunity to engage with peers and established international leaders in the field through keynote talks, oral and poster presentations, and networking activities.\r\n\r\nThe conference will focus on diverse areas of epigenetics and bioengineering. The main themes are organized around computational epigenetics, clinical epigenetics engineering, emerging technologies, perturbing chromatin and epigenetic engineering, sensing epigenetic modifications and single cell epigenetics. Support will be provided for a diverse group of graduate students, post-docs and early career faculty to attend the conference. These groups of people often do not have the financial resources to travel and participate in events that are important sources of ideas and feedback on research, and provide professional networking, collaboration and career development opportunities. Attendance at EpiBio 2024 will have substantive benefits for U.S.-based researchers starting their career because research in this field has historically been centered in Europe.\r\n\r\nThis award is co-funded by the Genetic Mechanisms and Systems and Synthetic Biology programs in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences of the Directorate for Biological Sciences, and the Cellular and Biochemical Engineering program in the Directorate for Engineering.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
