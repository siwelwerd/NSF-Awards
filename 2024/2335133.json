 "awd_abstract_narration": "Organoids are 3D, miniature versions of human organs, that help us learn about how organs grow and work. Organoids are useful for understanding human organ development, how cells talk to each other, and how our bodies fix themselves. This project focuses on making better organoids that act more like real organs. Organoids are usually made from special cells that can become many different cell types. With guidance, these cells organize themselves into a 3D shape that look like the real organ. Many organoids are not yet as good as they could be. First, researchers have made organoids for brains, kidneys, and lungs, but not all organs are represented as organoids yet.  For example, adrenal gland organoids do not exist. Adrenal glands are critical for producing hormones that help us regulate stress, how much water to drink, and sexual development. Here, the aim is to make adrenal gland organoids. Second, most organoids are spheres, but most organs have different shapes; these shapes matter and adrenal gland organoids in the shape of real adrenal glands will be made. Third, big organoids sometimes have dead parts inside, because food and oxygen cannot reach the inside without blood vessels. Here, plant roots will be used to make straw-like tunnels into the organoids so that food can reach the inside. In a give-and-take approach, what is learned will be shared with others. In collaboration with artists, a room-size organoid sculpture will be created, and dances inspired by the science will be made. In return, the artists approach to the scientific problems will inspire the scientific paths. Additionally, middle and high school students will be taught through ceramic art infused science classes to model their own imaginary cells; and graduate students will create their own art-science liaison project. \r\n\r\nThe overall goal of this project is to generate miniature engineered adrenal gland organoids in the native shape of the organ and to provide a vasculature-like structure that will allow them to mature. Goal 1: Make organoids that look like and function as adrenal glands. Since the shape or organs is important, it will be copied. The plan is to use 3D printing to make molds in the correct organ shape. Then, the cells will be added into these molds to grow the organoids. The engineered new organoids will be compared to spherical organoids to see if they work better. Goal 2: Make organoids that can grow bigger and live longer. Most organoids stop growing or die when they get too big. Here, plant roots will be stuck into the organoids to create straw-like structures that will allow food and oxygen to get to the inside of the organoids and keep the cells there alive, even if the organoids get big and old. In the end, this project will help researchers learn more about how to make better organoids. This project will culminate in an organoid symposium, where everyone can see what is learned about organoids through science, education and art.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
