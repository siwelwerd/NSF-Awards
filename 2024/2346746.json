 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Chicago's Secure Hub for Access, Reliability, and Exchange of Data, (SHARED), serves as a resource for data-driven research and nucleus of an integrated data management platform. It provides federated data storage for projects across disciplines to facilitate collaboration and best practice in data management. It is integrated with UChicago's institutional repository for data sharing according to FAIR principles. SHARED is led by the University Library and Research Computing Center, with collaboration from University Information Technology Services, the Data Sciences Institute, and the Physical Sciences Division. Aligned with the university's data lifecycle strategy for collection, analysis, publication, distribution, and long-term archiving, it ensures access to data and their integration into broader ecosystems. \r\n\r\nSHARED caters to diverse scientific applications spanning cosmology, particle physics, linguistics, and psychology. Through SHARED\u2019s 3.9PB ceph-based storage platform, the project supports projects focused on dark matter searches, physics beyond the Standard Model, simulations of cosmic reionization, surveys of cosmic microwave background radiation, and kinetic simulations of astrophysical plasmas. Additionally, it preserves valuable neural and linguistic data, contributing to understanding cognitive processes and language diversity. The SHARED project promotes interdisciplinary research and provides educational opportunities in data science through collaborations with minority-serving institutions and K-12 student engagement. Leveraging partnerships like the University of Chicago and Chicago City Colleges Data Science Preceptorship program, it enhances workforce diversity and fosters data-related education.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
