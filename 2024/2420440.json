 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Division of Nuclear Physics annual meeting brings together the country\u2019s nuclear physicists to share the newest scientific discoveries. Among them are hundreds of undergraduate and graduate students, who are considering a career in nuclear science. These students will create the future workforce and contribute to a variety of fields from basic science to nuclear medicine and national security.  This award will  aid in the retention of both groups of students by supporting a near-peer mentoring network. Graduate students and postdoctoral researchers (near-peers) will be recruited to mentor the undergraduate students in attendance.  The mentors will participate in an 8-hour mentoring workshop the day before the conference begins, and then practice these skills during the conference with their assigned undergraduate mentees. Research has shown this type of model increases a participant\u2019s scientific identity and sense of belonging, allowing them to make well informed decisions on their future career choices.\r\n\r\nEffective mentorship plays a critical role in developing a young scientist\u2019s identity including the ability to see themselves reflected in others in the field. The use of near-peer mentors allows the field to recruit young researchers from a variety of backgrounds. To prepare mentors to understand mentees, an evidence-based mentoring workshop will be provided which was recently highlighted in the \u201cScience of Effective Mentoring in STEMM\u2019\u2019 report by the National Academies.  The goal of this mentoring program is to encourage students from all areas of society to see themselves as scientists and continue into nuclear science careers as emphasized in the 2023 Long Range Plan for Nuclear Science.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
