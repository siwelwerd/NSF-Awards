 "awd_abstract_narration": "Formal Methods in Computer-Aided Design (FMCAD) 2024 is the twenty-fourth in a series of conferences on the theory and applications of formal methods in hardware and system verification. It provides a leading forum for researchers in academia and industry to present and discuss ground-breaking methods, technologies, theoretical results, and tools for reasoning formally about computing systems. This grant will help support conference travel for up to 8 students enrolled in US institutions to attend FMCAD, which will be in Prague, Czech Republic. The students will get the opportunity to present at the Student Forum, which is a platform for graduate students at any career stage to introduce their research to the wider formal methods research community and solicit feedback. \r\n\r\nThe field of formal methods is being rapidly deployed in a variety of areas both in academic research, as well as, in industrial systems. Thus, the broader significance and importance include fostering the next generation of researchers in this research area, as well as providing international experiences to build a globally aware workforce. In particular, students will have the opportunity to present at the Student Forum, learn state-of-the-art methodologies, be exposed to novel techniques, and interact with senior researchers in their areas of expertise. The organizers will give priority to students from under-represented groups and from universities without a formal methods program.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
