 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will support the planning, organization, participation, and evaluation of the 2024 and 2025 National Science Foundation (NSF) Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE) Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Principal Investigator (PI) Workshops. The workshops have four main goals: (1) provide opportunities for new and existing NSF CISE REU PIs and Co-PIs to share experiences directing undergraduate research programs and offer suggestions for improving all sites; (2) discuss best practices and challenges associated with the administration of an undergraduate research program; (3) develop and sustain a community of REU program directors; (4) provide networking and community-building opportunities for REU PIs, recognizing individual and group dedication to the importance of undergraduate research beyond home institutions. A publicly available website will be developed for the workshops. Findings and resources from the workshops will be summarized in a report and shared with all participants and the NSF community via the workshop website.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
