 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader/commercial impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project enables engineers to identify the root cause and weak spots of noise within a structure and apply local fixes rather than global treatments to mitigate noise emission. Employing the proposed AI and laser-assisted targeted noise control technology will enable the design and implementation of quieter and lighter metal structures. Studies have exhibited a direct correlation between weight reduction and CO2 emission. Statistics have revealed that for every 1 kg of steel used, 2.75 kg of CO2 will be emitted, and every 1 kg of aluminum used, 8.25 kg of CO2 will be released. In general, reducing 1% material weight in an automobile will decrease 1.25% CO2 emission. Our preliminary test results showed that using the proposed technology, sound transmission loss through a steel panel was increased, but its overall weight reduced by 38%. Therefore, this technology is not only cost-effective in mitigating noise issues, but also ideal for sustainability by simultaneously reducing structural weight and CO2 emissions.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is expected to produce a disruptive tool for engineers to perform targeted suppression of structure-borne sound radiation and transmission with higher precision, flexibility, and control than conventional sound characterization techniques. Specifically, the proposed technologies will enable engineers to see and determine: 1) where and how much acoustic energy is radiating from a complex vibrating machine; 2) where and how much sound is transmitting through a panel structure; and 3) where and how much to suppress acoustic radiation or sound transmission to meet noise mitigation requirements. Most importantly, it enables engineer to reveal the most critical components of structural vibrations that are responsible for sound radiation and uncover the root causes of noise issues. Accordingly, engineers will be able to enhance local stiffness, viscous damping, and mass without re-engineering the entire structure or increasing its weight. These targeted treatments can greatly shorten production cycle, cut production costs, enhance competitiveness, and increase profitability for U.S. manufacturing industries.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
