 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 10th IEEE International Conference on Smart Computing (SMARTCOMP 2024) will be held in Osaka, Japan on 29 June \u2013 2 July 2024 . IEEE SMARTCOMP 2024 conference offers a valuable opportunity to present cutting-edge computing and engineering research results, to learn about the state-of-the-art in smart and connected computing and communities, and to train US-based undergraduate, master\u2019s, doctoral, and post-doctoral students (from computer science and engineering disciplines) through the main conference and other associated events (e.g., student forum, workshops, demo, posters, and industry sessions). SMARTCOMP 24  will include multiple subconferences and workshops spanning a variety of domains that depend upon smart computing.  \r\n\r\nThis grant will support the travel of 12 US-based students to attend the IEEE SMARTCOMP 2024 conference in-person in Osaka, Japan.\r\nSMARTCOMP is the premier conference on smart computing that is emerging as an important multidisciplinary area. Smart Computing can be broadly classified into two major topics: (1) how to design and build smart computing and service systems, and (2) how to use computing and engineering technology for resource sustainability to improve the human experience. Applications of smart computing span trans-disciplinary boundaries such as transportation, energy, sustainability, structural health, environmental protection, healthcare, security, and so on.  The conference also will feature a student forum which includes presentations, poster sessions, individual mentoring with academia and industry, and student networking opportunities.  Research in the SmartComp 24 area is central to many important application spaces that are critical to today\u2019s society.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
