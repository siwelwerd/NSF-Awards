This conference will be held in conjunction with the annual Clifford Lectures, hosted every year by the Tulane Math Department. In 2024, the Clifford Lectures will be given by Ken Ono. The goal of the conference is to bring together researchers working with modular forms in a variety of contexts, emphasizing the diverse applications of the classical theory of modular forms and bringing together researchers working on different but related problems in the areas of modular forms and number theory. \r\n\r\nIn recent years, modular forms of various types have played an important role in diverse and active research areas in mathematics, including Gaussian hypergeometric functions over finite fields, integer partitions, mock modular forms, knot theory, and the modularity of functions arising in differential equations and mathematical physics. By uniting experts who have made significant contributions to these areas, this conference will explore novel perspectives at the forefront of modular forms research.\r\n\r\n\r\nConference website: https://sites.google.com/view/clifford-lectures-24/home\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
