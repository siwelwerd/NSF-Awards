 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to deploy a commercial space platform in cislunar and deep space to provide fast connectivity, navigation, and positioning to space users. This cislunar network will include nodes in low-Earth Orbit, Geosynchronous orbit and Lunar orbit to create a secure and covert gigabit network for scientific, commercial, and military applications. This project will develop a revolutionary spacecraft that will be the heart of the new network. This product will be a small yet nimble spacecraft that uses lasers, a novel architecture, and machine learning software to provide high-data-rate omnidirectional coverage of its surroundings. The company plans to place clusters of this satellite as network nodes. It is envisioned that space users can use these interplanetary small satellites (and their network) for gigabit connectivity as well as accurate navigation and positioning in cislunar and deep space.\r\n\r\nThis project will develop a novel small satellite with embedded optical communications systems. It will be equipped with two distinct optical communications terminals, one for long-range connectivity and the second one for short-range, swarm connectivity. The small satellite\u2019s long-range terminal consists of six optical transceivers evenly distributed around the body of the spacecraft to provide omnidirectional coverage. The transceivers will be fully integrated into and commanded by a fast processor. The small satellite will have a coherent modulation architecture operating at around 1550 nanometers. The transmitter design to be pursued during this project includes a distributed feedback laser diode, a phase modulator, an optical amplifier, a circulator, and a collimator. All these components will be connected by optical fibers. The seed laser will produce a 10-milliwatt laser beam, which is passed through the phase modulator where it is modulated at high speeds (10-100 gigabit per second). After the modulator, the modulated beam is boosted via an optical amplifier and passed through a collimator to generate a collimated, high-power beam. The collimator launches the beam into free space and directs it to a steering mirror for coverage of its field of regard. It is envisioned that the system could achieve transmission speeds as high as 100 gigabit per second.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

It is furnished with two distinct and very capable optical communications systems (see Fig. 1), for short- and long-range connectivity, respectively. The main goal of this SBIR effort is to develop SpheroSat as a &ldquo;flying modem&rdquo; that will enable Chascii&rsquo;s commercial INterplanetary SPace InteRnEt (INSPIRE) network and that could be commercialized as a connectivity satellite. Figure 2 shows an image of the INSPIRE network we seek deploying along the solar system using SpheroSats in a LEGO-like approach. We envision SpheroSats could be seamlessly arranged into clusters, swarms and/or constellations to create advanced space networks for connectivity, navigation and positioning.</p>\r\n<p>We want to make SpheroSat affordable, easy to deploy, and operate it in a plug-and-play mode, where it can seamlessly connect to a network. The inter-spacecraft optical communicator (ISOC) will allow SpheroSat to seamlessly connect to other SpheroSats and thus form very capable swarms. SpheroSat is equipped with large optical apertures for long-range connectivity. It also uses fully proven avionics and solar panels. We want SpheroSat to be modular and use it in a LEGO-like approach to build swarms and constellations to create our space network. A swarm of SpheroSats (such as the one shown in Fig. 3) can be autonomous, perform like a larger satellite counterpart at a fraction of the cost and offer graceful degradation. Our main goal is to develop modular, affordable, swarm-ready SpheroSats and build the space internet around them.</p>\r\n<p>The major outcomes of the Phase I project were:</p>\r\n<h2>TASK 1</h2>\r\n<p>Develop a CAD model of SpheroSat. For the CAD model development, we worked with a bus developer to produce a structural body for SpheroSat. The spacecraft is a 12U bus that includes flight proven avionics. The main bus structure is made out of aluminum with a ruggedized architecture. The CAD model we have developed includes means for easily adding conventional avionics plus the Long range optical terminal (LROT) and ISOC components. We also optimized the dimensions of the model's various components to maximize heat conduction while maintaining the proper bus mechanical rigidity and soundness. We used this model to verify that all the components fit properly inside and that the alignment of the optical mirrors and gimbals are correct.</p>\r\n<h2>&nbsp;</h2>\r\n<h2>TASK 2</h2>\r\n<p>Perform a design of SpheroSat's long-range optical terminal. We also carried out a complete design study of SpheroSats&rsquo;s long-range optical terminal in order to determine the technical specifications of its various components. We evaluated each component of the transmitter and receiver channels and verified that the necessary output power is achieved on transmit, and that a highly sensitivity receiver is implemented. We also explored the use of photonic integrated circuits to reduce SWaP-C. A key requirement is that SpheroSat provides fast connectivity from any point in cislunar space.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2>TASK 3</h2>\r\n<p>Pursue a thorough link budget analysis. We pursued a thorough link budget analysis in order to determine the maximum data rates attainable as well as to determine the size, weight and power of the long- and short-range omnidirectional optical terminals. This link budget includes connectivity analysis between SpheroSats and between SpheroSats and ground stations as well. We performed link budget calculations for various scenarios using pulse-position modulation. The results of this task informed the size, weight and power of the optical terminals that will be needed for SpheroSat implementation.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2>TASK 4</h2>\r\n<p>Carry out a conceptual design of SpheroSat. We carried out a conceptual design of SpheroSat for connectivity, navigation and positioning along cislunar space. The results of the previous tasks were used as inputs for this task. We developed a CAD design of SpheroSat, including the selection of its various components and its expected connectivity performance in cislunar space. This conceptual design will inform the design and testing of a SpheroSat prototype to be carried out during Phase II.</p>\r\n<p>Figure 4 shows an image of the SpheroSat concept we developed in this Phase I effort. This smallsat includes two optical terminals for fast connectivity. The ISOC is used for seamless connectivity of the SpheroSat into a swarm whereas the LROT is used for long range communications.</p>\r\n<p>Our mid- and long-term goals are to implement a SpheroSat-based cislunar INSPIRE network as shown in Fig. 5.</p>\r\n<p>For the initial cislunar network architecture we are considering a set of 24 nodes which includes 8 ground stations, 8 GEO nodes, 4 nodes in Moon-Earth Lagrange point 1 (L1) and 4 nodes in L2. Each INSPIRE node will include a swarm of 5 SpheroSats (as shown in Fig. 3).</p>\r\n<p>SpheroSat is a novel spacecraft designed specifically for connectivity applications. It is basically a \"space modem\". It is our vision that the massive deployment of SpheroSats will enable the space internet. SpheroSats could be gradually deployed into LEO and cislunar space.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 02/24/2025<br>\nModified by: Jose&nbsp;Velazco</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2322390/2322390_10911660_1740455682271_Figure_1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2322390/2322390_10911660_1740455682271_Figure_1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1.\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2322390/2322390_10911660_1740455682271_Figure_1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1.\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Image of SpheroSat showing its main components.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Jose Velazco</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Jose&nbsp;Velazco\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 1.</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2322390/2322390_10911660_1740456297754_Figure_4--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2322390/2322390_10911660_1740456297754_Figure_4--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 4.\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2322390/2322390_10911660_1740456297754_Figure_4--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 4.\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Image of the latest version of SpheroSat designed during this SBIR effort.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Jose Velazco</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Jose&nbsp;Velazco\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 4.</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2322390/2322390_10911660_1740455738773_Figure_2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2322390/2322390_10911660_1740455738773_Figure_2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 2.\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2322390/2322390_10911660_1740455738773_Figure_2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 2.\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">INSPIRE network to be deployed by Chascii along the solar system using SpheroSats.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Jose Velazco</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Jose&nbsp;Velazco\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 2.</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2322390/2322390_10911660_1740456066809_Figure_3--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2322390/2322390_10911660_1740456066809_Figure_3--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 3.\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2322390/2322390_10911660_1740456066809_Figure_3--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 3.\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Swarm of SpheroSats interconnected via their ISOCs.
