 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant supports student travel for students participating in the Doctoral Mentoring Consortium (DMC) at the Twenty-Third International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS), Auckland, New Zealand, May 6-10, 2023. This is the premier international conference for researchers in agents and multi-agent systems (MAS) across a fully international research community. This consortium is oriented on research and career development for students who have identified their doctoral topics and are just embarking on that independent research. As Artificial Intelligence and the multiagent systems topics become more prevalent, it is clear that exposing students to the latest advances in intelligent agent technology will have significant impact on their career trajectory over a wide range of domains, including such national priorities as health and wellbeing, e-commerce, and national defense.\r\n \r\nThe central activities for the Doctoral Mentoring Consortium (DMC) include opportunities for students to present and discuss their work with their peers; interaction with an identified group of senior researchers for advice on Ph.D. research, a career panel to discuss career choices in industry and academia, small group activities led by assigned mentors, and opportunities for interactions with the international research community in AAMAS, which might lead to future collaborative activity. In addition, the DMC includes a tutorial program with full-day and half-day tutorials that will provide detailed overviews of specific subfields by leading researchers in the field. Sponsoring student travel to AAMAS conveys many benefits beyond the DMC program.  The sponsored students will have full access to a well-developed AAMAS workshop and conference program covering a diverse range of research areas in this community. This is an opportunity for students to engage in discussions with scientists from around the world and to explore new research directions and topics. Students also have the opportunity to attend a demonstrations track. Such demonstrations of AI and multiagent systems technology are a significant source of motivation and inspiration to researchers. AAMAS is the major international conference that will have an impact in the research careers of students who remain involved in agents and MAS. Students will gain valuable research insights from the exchange of technical ideas in this broader venue. In the process, they will make valuable connections with potential collaborators from around the world.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
