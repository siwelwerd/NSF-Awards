 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Midwest Numerical Analysis Day 2024 from April 13-14, 2024 is held on the campus of the University of Iowa in Iowa City, Iowa. This conference brings together researchers of all career stages and graduate students, mainly from the Midwestern area, who work on or are interested in numerical analysis and applications. The conference features invited presentations by world-class experts and contributed presentations by regional researchers, educators, and students on new developments in numerical analysis and interdisciplinary applications. The conference promotes the exchange of ideas and knowledge and will catalyze new collaborations on important research topics. Special efforts are made to ensure a broadened participation in the research and teaching activities from students, junior researchers, college faculty, especially women, underrepresented minorities and persons with disabilities. The conference helps to enlarge the workforce base of the nation for the next generation numerical analysts and computational scientists.\r\n\r\nModern computing systems are increasingly widespread, and they are now used to solve increasingly complicated problems in many fields of sciences and engineering, such as solid mechanics, fluid mechanics, biomechanics, ecosystems, environment, sustainability, climate, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and geophysics. Designing numerical algorithms that are suitable for these computing systems, and providing theoretical support for them, is crucial in scientific computation. In order to design efficient algorithms for particular applications, collaborations between different disciplines are required. The conference will not only play a central role in advancing the area of numerical analysis, but also provide strong motivation for interdisciplinary collaboration between researchers in numerical analysis and various scientific disciplines at the universities in the Midwestern region. The conference serves the purposes (1) to provide a forum to exchange new ideas and results related to research and teaching on numerical analysis, algorithm developments, computer simulation, and their applications in engineering and sciences, and to motivate interdisciplinary collaborations; (2) to provide an opportunity for numerical analysts in regional colleges to remain involved in research activities; (3) to expose exciting research topics to graduate students and recent doctoral recipients; (4) to encourage members of under-represented groups to participate in the research areas. The conference website is https://homepage.divms.uiowa.edu/~whan/mwnaday2024.html\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
