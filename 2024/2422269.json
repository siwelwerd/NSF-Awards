 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact of this I-Corps project is based on the development of an improved method for depositing materials, such as graphene, on other substrates to create advanced electronic devices. This method improves the deposition of these materials, increasing the quality and performance of the device, and is highly promising for a range of emerging device applications such as spintronics, optoelectronics, and energy storage. This advance is significant because the spintronic device market is projected to reach $10 billion by 2030, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 38%. Furthermore, complex graphene structures are needed in supercapacitors for energy storage, which is expected to grow to $912 million by 2027, with a CAGR of 14%. Overall, the broad applicability of this proprietary 3-in-1 process for depositing two-dimensional materials, such as graphene, on other substrates has the potential to significantly improve the performance of a variety of electronic devices used for data and energy storage.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. The solution is based on the development of a proprietary 3-in-1 process that combines the capabilities of exfoliating, reducing, and depositing high-quality graphene through a bipolar electrochemistry (BPE) approach. The transfer of graphene on different substrates is one of the key challenges for graphene-based devices, where the resulting quality of graphene can greatly impact device performance. The constraints include controllable and reproducible deposition and reliable deposition that prevents graphene aggregation. To address these challenges, this innovative process utilizes an electrochemical cell featuring two graphite electrodes that regulate the current flowing through the bipolar electrode. By applying a direct current (DC) voltage across the feeding electrodes, the process facilitates in-situ exfoliation, reduction, and deposition, all within a single step. This solution addresses the constraints associated with the uniform application of graphene onto complex substrates, while preserving the substrate\u2019s inherent properties.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
