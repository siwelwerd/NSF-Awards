 "awd_abstract_narration": "In recent years, the PI has developed a new tool called decoupling that measures the extent to which waves traveling in different directions interact with each other. While this tool was initially intended to analyze differential equations that describe wave cancellations, it has also led to important breakthroughs in number theory. For example, Diophantine equations are potentially complicated systems of equations involving whole numbers. They are used to generate scrambling and diffusion keys, which are instrumental in encrypting data. Mathematicians are interested in counting the number of solutions to such systems. Unlike waves, numbers do not oscillate, at least not in an obvious manner. But we can think of numbers as frequencies and thus associate them with waves.  In this way, problems related to counting the number of solutions to Diophantine systems can be rephrased in the language of quantifying wave interferences. This was the case with PI's breakthrough resolution of the Main Conjecture in Vinogradov's Mean Value Theorem. The PI plans to further extend the scope of decoupling toward the resolution of fundamental problems in harmonic analysis, geometric measure theory, and number theory.  He will seek to make the new tools accessible and useful to a large part of the mathematical community. This project provides research training opportunities for graduate students.\r\n\r\n\r\nPart of this project is aimed at developing the methodology to analyze the Schr\u00f6dinger maximal function in the periodic setting. Building on his recent progress, the PI aims to incorporate Fourier analysis and more delicate number theory into the existing combinatorial framework. Decouplings have proved successful in addressing a wide range of problems in such diverse areas as number theory, partial differential equations, and harmonic analysis. The current project seeks to further expand the applicability of this method in new directions. One of them is concerned with finding sharp estimates for the Fourier transforms of fractal measures supported on curved manifolds. The PI seeks to combine decoupling with sharp estimates for incidences between balls and tubes. In yet another direction, he plans to further investigate the newly introduced tight decoupling phenomenon. This has deep connections to both number theory and the Lambda(p) estimates.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
