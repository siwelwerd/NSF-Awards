 "awd_abstract_narration": "Technicians in the area of uncrewed aircraft systems are in high demand. This project focuses on small uncrewed aircraft systems (sUAS) and advancements in miniaturized sensors, development of specialized data processing software, and the use of machine learning for analysis. This industry is poised to see another round of significant growth, driven by the impending additions to regulatory frameworks that will increase the opportunities for sUAS operations. Atlantic Cape Community College recognizes the industry-driven demand to expand its existing sUAS technician curricula. The goal is to develop an Associate in Applied Science (AAS) degree option and a series of short-term stackable certificate programs focused on equipping students with the skills to collect, process, and securely manage sUAS data. \r\n\r\nThe project emphasizes instrument training for advanced sensors, including light detection ranging (lidar), laser methane detector, ground penetrating radar, real-time kinetic global positioning systems, infrared, and hyperspectral imagers. By integrating these technologies into the curriculum, Atlantic Cape aims to prepare students for the demands of the industry and provide them with practical skills in data collection, management, and analysis using sUAS. The anticipated outcomes of the project include an increased number of faculty trained to deliver new curricula, a diverse student population benefiting from the programs, and measurable results in terms of enrollment, retention, and graduation/credentials earned. By aligning the education provided with industry needs, the project strives to meet the workforce demand for skilled sUAS data technicians and contribute to the growth and advancement of the field. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the Nation's economy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
