 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) award supports the acquisition of an X-ray diffractometer to support ongoing research efforts in materials engineering and biomaterials at Arkansas State University. X-ray diffraction is a nondestructive measurement technique that is useful in characterizing the crystal structure of both inorganic and organic materials, which is intrinsically linked to the electronic, mechanical, and chemical properties of these substances. This tool will enable structural characterization of a wide array of materials impacting several scientific disciplines, including advanced semiconductor devices, cementitious soils, engineered proteins, advanced asphalt paving materials, and biologically active small molecules. Research activities supported by this instrument also address critical issues affecting the US, such as the development of state-of-the-art space communication technologies, improving the efficiency of solar photovoltaic power generation, and the synthesis of novel proteins for therapeutic purposes and antimicrobial agents against antibioticresistant bacteria. Additionally, the instrument will provide unique experiential learning opportunities for both graduate and undergraduate students at A-State, enabling them to engage more effectively with cutting-edge STEM concepts and better prepare them for future careers. Finally, targeted educational outreach activities will allow K-12 students and teachers to participate in hands-on experiments and explore STEM careers, impacting low socioeconomic status communities in the Arkansas Delta.\r\n\r\nThe instrument is a comprehensive research platform for characterizing the structure of crystalline materials and small molecules. The available measurement techniques include powder diffraction, single-crystal crystallography, protein crystallography, X-ray reflectivity, and both conventional and grazing-incidence small-angle X-ray scattering. Together, the capabilities of the tool will positively impact the following research projects: 1) optimizing the composition of distributed Bragg reflectors used in vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers; 2) investigation of cementation of particulate soils on anti-soiling coatings used in solar photovoltaic applications; 3) understanding the relationship between microstructure intercalation and the nanomechanistic properties of polymeric asphalt binders to improve stripping resistance; 4) characterizing biologically active small molecules with antimicrobial and antitumor properties; and 5) development of novel engineering proteins for improved therapeutic properties.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
