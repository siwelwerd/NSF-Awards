 "awd_abstract_narration": "The need for cybersecurity professionals is a well-documented issue. It is also well-known that while women make up more than 50 percent of the population, less than 10 percent of cybersecurity professionals are women and less than 5 percent are minorities. This project seeks to increase the number of women seeking degrees in cybersecurity and strengthen Hudson County Community College\u2019s (HCCC) cybersecurity program by adding experiential learning and certifications. The underrepresentation of women in HCCC\u2019s cybersecurity program will be addressed using a multifaceted approach emphasizing recruitment and retention strategies. The addition of a dedicated Cybersecurity Lab will provide experiential learning opportunities, ensuring that graduates are ready to pursue advanced cybersecurity degrees or enter the cyber workforce.\r\n\r\nA newly formed Cybersecurity Advisory Board will enhance program responsiveness and dynamism. The project's broader impact will extend beyond Jersey City, NJ, positioning HCCC as a model for community college cybersecurity education, addressing the urgent need for skilled cyber-workers nationwide. Key components of the program include recruitment and retention initiatives, establishment of a dedicated Cybersecurity Lab, and expansion of the Cybersecurity Advisory Board. Continuous evaluation will ensure program responsiveness, and outcomes will be measured to enhance faculty, student, and employer needs. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the Nation's economy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
