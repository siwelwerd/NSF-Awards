 "awd_abstract_narration": "An award is made to Portland State University to acquire a flow cytometer to enable the quantification of individual cells in the context of their complex systems. Enabled research includes quantifying water activity in cells towards improved cell imaging technology, measuring the impacts of environmental stress and gradients on coastal organisms, and detection of novel viruses and DNA replication mechanisms. This instrument will be used by students, faculty, and researchers to transform and modernize training for the workforce and the impact of research from this urban, public university that serves the a diverse student population. The project will engage hundreds of students over five years through undergraduate research, graduate research, and integration into three hands-on lab-based courses, overall enhancing student skills in cutting edge experimental design and technology for the workforce. \r\n \r\nThe project will enable research and training on the cell as a fundamental unit of biological systems. This insight is key to research and training as the ability to quantify the properties of individual cells, in the context of their biological, chemical, and physical environment, has been a major driver of biological discovery in recent years. This project will enable new research endeavors that uncover fundamental properties of environmental and organismal systems, advancing a wide range of research using organisms from bacteria to fish. The implications of this work advance fundamental research into the organization of biological systems, their tolerance to stress, and support innovation in ecosystem management, cellular imaging technology, vaccine packaging, and bioinspired design of stress tolerant systems.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
