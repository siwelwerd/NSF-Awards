 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project, funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamic & Mechanism B Program of the Chemistry Division, is to demonstrate the storage and/or processing of quantum information in a single goblet-shaped magnetic molecule deposited on a surface and controlled electrically.  Quantum information processing could lead to quantum computers, which could be more powerful than the current computers.  Quantum information processing is also important in secure communication and precision measurement.  Samples resulting from this research will be widely distributed to the spintronics community to support the expansion of the fields of molecular spintronics and molecule-based quantum computing.  Students from diverse backgrounds, from high-school to PhD candidate level, will be involved in the project, giving them the opportunity to acquire competences not only in chemistry but also in material science and physics.  They will be well prepared to enter the workforce on quantum computing.  \r\n\r\nSpecifically, f-block elements, with their strong magnetic anisotropy, are excellent spin quantum bit candidates. The molecules designed for this project take the shape of a goblet, with a tricyclopentadienyl bowl holding a lanthanoid ion, a stem of tunable length and rigidity and an aromatic foot ensuring a strong interaction with a metallic surface. Taking advantage of this modular architecture, an extensive investigation of the structure-properties relationship will be conducted from the bulk state down to the single molecule level. The decoupling of the magnetic center from the underlying surface is expected to protect its magnetic characteristics and make them accessible to a top electrode or the tip of a scanning tunneling microscope. This type of setup opens the door to the realization of a single molecule spin filter or, on a ferromagnetic surface, a molecular spin valve, which paves the way to the construction of electrically addressable single molecule spin quantum bits.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

We planned on synthesizing a series of goblet ligands incorporating a flat aromatic center of three-fold symmetry (the base of the goblet), linked via hydrocarbon chains (the stem) to three cyclopentadiene rings (the bowl). We would have then introduced the lanthanoid ion to form triscyclopentadienyl complexes. Deposition of those species on a metallic surface, to which they would adhere due to the large surface of the goblet&rsquo;s base would allow the creation of a molecular spin valve. Such a device allows to control the spin of an electron transiting through the molecule based on the spin of the lanthanoid center, or vice-versa, and is an important component in molecular spintronics.</p>\r\n<p>The project provided an opportunity to train two graduate student and two undergraduate students, who performed all the experimental work under the supervision and mentoring of the PI. The students were trained in research planning, theoretical and experimental skills, data analysis and data management as well as scientific communication, both formal (presentation at local and national conferences) and informal (group meetings). The results of the graduate student primarily involved in the project were the basis for her PhD thesis (Lanthanoid (III) Diphthalocyanines and Goblet-Shaped Complexes: Old and New Architectures for Molecular Qubit Candidates, Megan Dailey, PhD thesis, 2022, The George Washington University), which was made available in open-source format (<a href=\"https://www.proquest.com/docview/2622778931/D75EAD1254E74123PQ/1\">https://www.proquest.com/docview/2622778931/D75EAD1254E74123PQ/1</a>).</p>\r\n<p>Over the course of the project, we investigated a range of possibilities for the flat aromatic goblet foot, and selected nucleophilic derivatives, including triazatruxene and 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (Figures 2 and 3), as the best candidates. We determined that a 2-carbon chain was the suitable length of the arm. The installation of those arms proved to be the crucial bottleneck for the targeted syntheses (Figure 2). After much effort, we developed a workable technique based on the reaction of ethylene carbonate. The target ligand was then obtained in reasonable yield over 3 more steps (Figure 3), but could not achieve synthesis of the targeted species in the time available.</p>\r\n<p>In parallel to pursuing a goblet base with 3-fold symmetry, we started [LnPc<sub>2</sub>] derivatives (H<sub>2</sub>Pc = phthalocyanine, Figure 4) investigating similar molecules with a 4-fold symmetry. We discovered and refined a reliable method to prepare those species in 4 different crystalline forms across all lanthanoid ions. Those results were published in CrystEngComm &ldquo;HOT paper&rdquo; (Selective crystallization of four bis(phthalocyaninato)lanthanoid(III) polymorphs Maegan Dailey and Claire Besson, <em>CrystEngComm</em>, 2021, 23, 7151-7161, DOI: 10.1039/d1ce00936b), and are also freely available as a preprint or ChemRxiv (<a href=\"https://chemrxiv.org/engage/chemrxiv/article-details/60f3483930f1af27b0824258\">https://chemrxiv.org/engage/chemrxiv/article-details/60f3483930f1af27b0824258</a>).
