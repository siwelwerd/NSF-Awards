 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Pathways to Enable Open-Source Ecosystems (POSE) program seeks to harness the power of open-source development for the creation of new technology solutions to problems of national and societal importance. This project scopes an open-source ecosystem of advanced web technologies for hydrological education, research, and operations (OSE-HERO), that improves water resource management. This open-source ecosystem can empower researchers, educators, and decision-makers with advanced tools for managing, analyzing, and visualizing hydrological data. By leveraging advanced web technologies, OSE-HERO can enhance collaboration, increase data transparency, and promote innovation for hydrological tools, ultimately leading to improved research outcomes, educational resources, and operational practices in water resource management. This initiative addresses critical water-related challenges, fostering a collaborative and open community, and delivering substantial societal benefits.\r\n \r\nOSE-HERO leverages client-side web technologies to develop a comprehensive suite of web-based libraries and tools to support integration of existing open-source solutions. The project focuses on overcoming the limitations of traditional centralized data management systems by distributing computational load across client devices, enhancing efficiency and scalability. The project team, which possesses extensive expertise in hydrological computing and web-based analytics, conducts community analysis and workshops, and develops training materials to ensure the ecosystem meets the needs of a diverse user base. By promoting the widespread adoption and continuous improvement of these tools, OSE-HERO aims to democratize hydrological research and education, facilitating data-driven decision-making and advancing the field of water resources management.\r\n\r\nThis project is jointly funded by Pathways to Enable Open-Source Ecosystems (POSE) and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
