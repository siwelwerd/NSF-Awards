 "awd_abstract_narration": "This NSF CAREER award provides support for a research program at the interface of algebraic geometry and topology, as well as outreach efforts aimed at improving the quality of mathematics education in the United States. Algebraic geometry can be described as the study of systems of polynomial equations and their solutions, whereas topology is the mathematical discipline that studies notions such as \u201cshape\u201d and \u201cspace\" and develops mathematical techniques to distinguish and classify such objects. A notion of central importance in these areas is that of a \u201cmoduli space\u201d - this is a mathematical \u201cworld map\u201d that gives a complete inventory and classification of all instances of a particular mathematical object. The main research objective of the project is to better understand the structure of these spaces and to explore new phenomena, by importing techniques from neighboring areas of mathematics. While the primary aim is to advance knowledge in pure mathematics, developments from these areas have also had a long track record of successful applications in physics, data science, computer vision, and robotics. The educational component includes an outreach initiative consisting of a \u201cMath Circles Institute\u201d (MCI). The purpose of the MCI is to train K-12 teachers from around the country in running the mathematical enrichment activities known as Math Circles. This annual 1-week program will pair teachers with experienced instructors to collaboratively develop new materials and methods to be brought back to their home communities. In addition, a research conference will be organized with the aim of attracting an international community of researchers and students and disseminating developments related to the research objectives of the proposal.\r\n\r\nThe overall goal of the research component is to develop new methods via topology and geometric group theory to study various moduli spaces, specifically, (1) strata of Abelian differentials and (2) families of polynomials. A major objective is to establish \u201casphericality\" (vanishing of higher homotopy) of these spaces. A second objective is to develop the geometric theory of their fundamental groups. Asphericality occurs with surprising frequency in spaces coming from algebraic geometry, and often has profound consequences. Decades on, asphericality conjectures of Arnol\u2019d, Thom, and Kontsevich\u2013Zorich remain largely unsolved, and it has come to be regarded as a significantly challenging topic. This project\u2019s goal is to identify promising-looking inroads. The PI has developed a method called \"Abel-Jacobi flow\" that he proposes to use to establish asphericality of some special strata of Abelian differentials. A successful resolution of this program would constitute a major advance on the Kontsevich\u2013Zorich conjecture; other potential applications are also described. The second main focus is on families of polynomials. This includes linear systems on algebraic surfaces; a program to better understand the fundamental groups is outlined. Two families of univariate polynomials are also discussed, with an eye towards asphericality conjectures: (1) the equicritical stratification and (2) spaces of fewnomials. These are simple enough to be understood concretely, while being complex enough to require new techniques. In addition to topology, the work proposed here promises to inject new examples into geometric group theory. Many of the central objects of interest in the field (braid groups, mapping class groups, Artin groups) are intimately related to algebraic geometry. The fundamental groups of the spaces the PI studies here should be just as rich, and a major goal of the project is to bring this to fruition.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
