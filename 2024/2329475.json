 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is increasingly recognized that species in the ocean host a diverse set of microbes and that these microbes can determine the functioning of the host. Yet, the discovery of microbial taxa in nature far outpaces our understanding of their functions. Primary producers in the ocean show rich microbial communities and may contribute to the significant role that macrophytes play in coastal communities. This project focuses on a species of canopy kelp that is a foundational species along the shores of the northeast Pacific Ocean, the bull kelp Nereocystis luetkeana. The research explores the role of a diverse set of microbes in association with bull kelp. Using experimental manipulations of newly isolated microbial taxa from kelp, tests of whether interactions are positive, negative, or neutral are performed. Specific assays of whether microbes provision vitamins and enhance access to nutrients are carried out, as well as tests of whether kelp exudates benefit microbial metabolism and growth. Working directly with Tribal youth through an internship program, as well as with undergraduate, post-baccalaureate, and graduate students, helps train the next generation of ocean scientists. Communication channels with Tribal and State governments inform efforts to understand kelp declines. Host-microbe interactions are a component of the persistence of ocean species and this research informs the factors that underly these relationships. \r\n\r\nThe advent of DNA sequencing, imaging, and other molecular approaches have revealed that many key species in the ocean are a \u2018holobiome\u2019, and their fate is entwined with the microbes they host. Yet, this discovery of microbial taxa in nature far outpaces our understanding of microbial function. Nereocystis luetkeana, or bull kelp, and the bacteria the investigators have isolated from the kelp surface, present an opportunity to quantify host-microbe interactions, including how stressors of host health, such as ocean warming, alter these interactions. Experiments tracing stable nitrogen isotopes and manipulations with hosts and bacterial isolates are used to investigate possible exchanges and the currencies underlying interactions. Metabolomic, proteomic, and genomic analyses are used to quantify host-microbe interactions and linkage between taxa and their functions. Key microbial metabolisms being investigated include nutrient provisioning, vitamin synthesis, and the response to reactive oxygen species, among others. The demonstrated alteration of host-microbe interactions in the ocean when hosts are stressed suggest the findings of this study have application to understanding the factors that promote persistence of eukaryote-prokaryote partnerships.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
