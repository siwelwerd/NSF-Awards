 "awd_abstract_narration": "In today's technologically advanced world, the challenges of energy sustainability and electronics efficiency are more pressing than ever. The advent of 6G+ mobile platforms, the bottlenecks that may end Moore\u2019s law, and the significant waste heat generated during computation processes represent significant hurdles in computing. Topological materials, recognized by the 2016 Nobel Prize in Physics, have emerged as a groundbreaking solution. This project, led by a team of dedicated researchers and industrial partners, delves into the innovative realm of topological materials to address these widespread industrial challenges. By enhancing our understanding and building related devices, the project seeks not only to push the boundaries of scientific knowledge but also to develop technologies and intellectual property that are consistent with economic development and national security for next-generation computing needs. The project also serves as a catalyst for educational and workforce development, providing opportunities for all students to engage in pioneering research. Ultimately, this initiative signifies a commitment to a future where technological advancement and sustainability are interwoven and converged, addressing economic development and national security needs in an accelerated manner. \r\n\r\nThis project will leverage the groundbreaking potential of topological materials in quantum research, building upon the Phase I success in creating a comprehensive database of over 16,000 environmentally sustainable topological materials. Phase II aims to develop topological prototype devices for advanced applications in microelectronics and energy harvesting. The project's multifaceted approach involves integrating THz rectification, constructing topological interconnects for microchips, and developing efficient thermoelectric materials for wearable energy devices. Key deliverables include refined database capabilities, THz wave detection and wireless energy harvesting technologies, interconnects for microelectronics, as well as innovative solutions for chip heat management and sustainable microelectronics. The project is underpinned by a robust IP management plan compliant with federal laws, ensuring cooperative ownership and licensing of joint innovations. The collaboration among PIs from academia and industry leaders from three major corporations aims to transition topological materials from lab-scale marvels to mass-produced, industry-viable solutions. By combining intellectual merit with broader impacts, the project seeks to pave the way for a sustainable materials future in next-generation microelectronics and energy devices, while providing opportunities in this growing field for everyone.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
