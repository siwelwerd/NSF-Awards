 "awd_abstract_narration": "The persistent underrepresentation of Black, Hispanic, and female workers in the engineering workforce threatens the United States' global economic and technological competitiveness. Many factors contribute to this problem, including educational and socioeconomic equity gaps that fail to support aspiring but underprepared students entering college. Statistical analysis has identified engineering majors whose first mathematics course is college algebra at greatest risk of non-retention and seeks to understand and mitigate the challenges faced in foundational math courses. By conducting qualitative research through focus groups with first-year engineering students, the project aims to uncover the social and cultural factors influencing their experiences and attitudes towards continuation in the major. The data collected will inform the design of interventions aimed at improving early mathematics success for underrepresented engineering and STEM students, complementing existing academic support initiatives. This research not only benefits underrepresented students at SDSU but also contributes to broader efforts in STEM education nationwide and aligns with the NSF Broadening Participation in Engineering goals to foster a more diverse and inclusive engineering workforce essential for innovation in the global economy.\r\n\r\nThe project aims to investigate and address the challenges encountered by students from traditionally underrepresented backgrounds including Black, Hispanic, female and indigenous peoples in the engineering workforce, focusing on foundational mathematics courses, particularly college algebra, at San Diego State University (SDSU). Research questions will probe into the factors influencing the success and retention of underrepresented students including Black, Hispanic, female and Pell grant recipients in engineering majors, emphasizing academic, professional, and social strategies to bolster their performance. Utilizing qualitative data collection methods such as surveys and focus groups, the project will delve into the experiences and attitudes of students towards college algebra, thereby informing evidence-based interventions geared towards improving retention rates. Longitudinal data analysis and predictive modeling will deepen insights and facilitate the customization of interventions for diverse student cohorts. Through collaborative partnerships with SDSU, the California State University (CSU) system, and engagement with the NSF INCLUDES Coordination Hub, the project aims to disseminate findings, foster collaboration, and contribute to a more diverse and inclusive engineering workforce by enhancing the retention and graduation rates of underrepresented students in engineering and STEM disciplines. An interdisciplinary team, comprising faculty from mathematics, engineering, sociology, and student success domains, will collaborate to design, implement, and assess these interventions. The outcomes will result in tailored programs and strategies to meet the needs of underrepresented students, ultimately aiming to promote diversity and inclusivity in engineering education and cultivate a more representative engineering workforce. Furthermore, the research findings are anticipated to enrich broader conversations and initiatives in STEM education and diversity efforts nationally, advancing understanding and practices for supporting underrepresented minority students in engineering and other STEM fields.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
