 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of a more sustainable electrical energy storage technology. The proposed technology is designed to replace expensive and rare inorganic materials used in lithium-ion battery (LIB) cathodes with low-cost organic polymers.  The proposed technology may offer a domestically sourced, sustainable material solution that enhances charging speed and charge storage capacity of LIBs. This technology may benefit multiple industries by reducing raw materials and manufacturing costs while maintaining battery performance. Reducing the cost and improving the performance of LIBs may impact a range of industries including electric vehicles, consumer electronics, and renewable energy storage. In addition, using domestic feedstocks for LIBs may benefit national security by preventing supply chain disruptions from impacting these sectors.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on the development of a molecular layer deposition (MLD) method for synthesizing polymer cathode materials for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). The proposed technology is focused on displacing traditional transition metal oxide (TMO) cathodes by leveraging MLD to produce polymer-based cathodes with controlled structure and morphology. Results demonstrate controlled growth of high-capacity, fast-charging polymer thin films using MLD. These polymer films exhibit improved charge storage properties over materials formed using traditional polymer synthesis. These beneficial properties are achieved by controlling the thickness, composition, and interchain crosslinking of polymer thin films with molecular-level precision. In addition, the MLD polymer materials nay be easily integrated into existing battery architectures, providing a pathway for market transition.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
