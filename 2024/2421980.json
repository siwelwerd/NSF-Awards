 "awd_abstract_narration": "This I-Corps project focusses on the development of software tools that enable small-scale farms to mitigate and adapt to changing weather patterns. The goal of this project is to enhance farm resilience and improve agricultural productivity. The approach combines the use of software with local expert agents to foster technology adoption among small-scale farmers. The technology may help to contribute to sustainable agricultural practices and adaptation efforts.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. The solution is based on the development of software applications designed to address climate challenges in smallholder (small-scale) farming communities worldwide. The climate change mitigation software utilizes a streamlined solution for recording biochar production and records the production and application of biochar to soil, which functions to durably remove the carbon dioxide from the atmosphere for >1,000 years and contributes to atmospheric carbon dioxide removal and climate change mitigation efforts. In addition, a second application serves as an adaptation tool, providing access to essential services such as tree seedlings, biochar fertilizer, and irrigation systems, which may enhance farm resilience. The aim of this technology is to advance agricultural knowledge and mitigate the impacts of climate change on global food security.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
