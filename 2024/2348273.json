 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ``Geometric Flows and Relativity\u201d summer school and workshop will take place during March 11\u2014March 20, 2024 in Uruguay; the summer school will be held in Montevideo and the workshop in Punta del Este.  The first part of the meeting, the summer school, will consist of three lecture series whose topics will be on mean curvature flow, Ricci flow and applications of geometric flows to mathematical relativity, respectively. The second part of the meeting, a 3-day workshop, will consist of several talks aiming to discuss recent exciting progress in geometric flows and related fields. The goals of this meeting are: (1) Introduce graduate students and early career researchers from the USA, South America and other regions of the world to the field of geometric flows and applications, allowing them to learn about new exciting developments and to have direct contact with more senior researchers; (2) Promote research, by bringing together active leading specialists; and (3) Support the international environment and network by strengthening the collaborations within different institutions, particularly from the USA and South America.\r\n\r\nGeometric analysis is one of the most active and exciting areas in pure mathematics today and geometric flows, in particular, have proven to be a powerful tool in the analysis of a large number of important problems in differential geometry, image processing and mathematical physics, leading to a profound impact on each of these fields. They also arise naturally in various physical contexts such as thermomechanics, annealing metals, crystal growth, flame propagation, wearing processes and conformal field theory. Geometric flows are therefore of interest to a diverse group of scientists outside of pure mathematical fields, including applied mathematicians, materials scientists and theoretical physicists. For all these reasons, the area has gained a large international interest to an extent that by now a large network of specialists are present all over the world. This meeting will be an international gathering on this active topic in an area where such events are sparse. \r\n\r\nMeeting\u2019s webpage: http://www.cmat.edu.uy/~mreiris/ssw/SSW.html\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
