 "awd_abstract_narration": "The increasing need for efficient heat dissipation in modern technologies necessitates materials that are not only excellent thermal conductors but also cost-effective, easy to manufacture, lightweight, and corrosion-resistant. Polymers, often the material of choice due to their versatility, meet most of these criteria. However, their inherently low thermal conductivity limits their application in advanced thermal management systems. This challenge has led to extensive research efforts aimed at enhancing the thermal conductivity of polymers. Despite these efforts, a comprehensive understanding of the heat transfer mechanisms within polymers remains elusive. This knowledge gap poses a significant barrier to the development of polymers with high thermal conductivity, which are critically needed in various advanced technological applications. To address this challenge, this CAREER project seeks to develop an innovative experimental technique and provide a deeper understanding of thermal transport in polymer nanofibers. This research is integrated with educational and outreach activities, including a summer workshop on thermal engineering, extensive undergraduate research opportunities, and targeted outreach programs for underrepresented Native Hawaiian students. These initiatives are designed to foster interest in scientific research and nurture the next generation of scientists and engineers.\r\n\r\nThe primary objective of this research is to deeply understand the mechanisms of thermal transport in polymer nanofibers. Due to the complex interplay between thermal transport, internal structure, and chemical composition, many facets of polymer thermal transport remain unclear. This project proposes several research goals: 1) the development of an experimental platform to measure thermal transport properties in response to strain modulation, 2) the investigation of thermal transport and internal structure variations under different strain conditions, and 3) the exploration of fundamental scientific principles governing thermal transport in polymers. The successful completion of this project will elucidate the relationship between microstructure and thermal transport in polymer nanofibers, revealing the mechanisms that could enhance thermal transport under strain. These findings will be pivotal in establishing principles for designing and synthesizing high thermal conductivity polymers, crucial for a wide range of technological applications.  \r\n\r\nThis project is jointly funded by the Thermal Transport Processes (TTP) program of the Chemical, Biochemical, Environmental and Transport (CBET) Systems Division in the Engineering (ENG) Directorate, and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) at NSF.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
