 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Fall 2024 meeting of the Texas Geometry and Topology Conference will be at Texas A&M  on  November 8-10, 2024. To date the Texas Geometry and Topology Conference has been held spring and fall since its founding in 1989, a total of 67 times. The conference has become an extremely successful semiannual event in the Southwest. The next series of conferences will have seven primary host universities: Rice University, Texas A&M University, The University of Texas at Dallas, University of Houston, Texas Tech University, and (jointly) Texas Christian University and The University of Texas at Arlington.\r\n\r\nBy design, the Texas Geometry and Topology Conference has two high-impact foci. First, the conference makes it possible for the community of geometers and topologists from Texas and surrounding states (a huge geographic region) to meet and share mathematics on a regular basis. In so doing, the conference is committed to bring researchers of national and international stature to discuss their research as well as offering a venue for regional scholars and early career researchers. This stimulates individual research and generates productive cooperative efforts between schools. Second, the conference is committed to the strengthening and enrichment of the mathematics personnel base. In order that there be no barrier to participation, the conference is widely advertised, participation is open, and there are no registration fees. Graduate students, junior faculty, women, minorities, and persons with disabilities are especially encouraged to participate and to apply for support. Furthermore the conference is partnering with two historically black universities (Fayetteville State University and Prairie View A&M University) on a project to foster research opportunities for select junior faculty at these institutions.\r\n\r\nThe permanent web page for the Texas Geometry and Topology Conference: http://www.math.tamu.edu/~tgtc/archive/.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
