 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 41st International Symposium on Computer Performance, Modeling, Measurements and Evaluation (IFIP WG 7.3 Performance 2023) brings together researchers at the intersection of computer science and applied probability, with the aim to understand and improve the performance of computing and communication systems by means of state-of-the-art quantitative models and solution techniques. Attracting scholars from around the world, this selective, single-track conference series features cutting-edge research on the performance evaluation of computing systems. The conference also includes several half- and full-day workshops for in-depth coverage of topics such as mathematical modelling and performance analysis, learning and optimization in networks, blockchain, cloud computing, and applications in transport, energy and service systems.\r\n\r\nThis student travel grant will fully support approximately 25 students\u2019 attendance (airfare/ground transportation, lodging, and registration) to participate in the conference, potentially share their own research, and interact with leading researchers in the field. Mentoring is a core tenet of the Performance conference, and attendees will have several dedicated opportunities to meet and interact with senior members of the community. In the goal to broaden participation in computing, student attendees will be recruited from under-represented groups both locally and across the country, and there are portions of the funding dedicated to this initiative. Furthermore, this funding support also offers student attendees of Performance 2023 the opportunity to meet one another, fostering a peer group at an early stage that can benefit them throughout their careers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
