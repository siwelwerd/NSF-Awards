 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project includes early detection of skin cancers, resulting in better outcomes and a reduction in mortality and healthcare expenditures. Each year in the United States, nearly 5 million people are treated for skin cancer, with an annual cost estimated at $8.1 billion. Annual productivity losses are estimated to cost an additional $4.5 billion. There is a considerable health disparity in the diagnosis of skin cancer within the U.S.; The average wait time to see a dermatologist is currently 32.3 days but it varies greatly by location. Early detection reduces disfigurement by reducing the size and extent of surgical removal and reducing the side effects that late-stage patients experience from systemic therapies. Furthermore, the project increases the economic competitiveness of the U.S. \r\n\r\nThis Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project is to productize a novel, pigmented, lesion analysis system for wide field-of-view images. The product will be built on a previously developed total body photography system and proof of concept lesion classification software as a medical device that was developed in Phase I. The dermatoscope-like resolution provides a solid foundation for a system that can automatically (without the involvement of a dermatologist) detect and classify various skin conditions in a clinical setting and/or a radiology center (similar to how mammograms are done). Skin cancers, including both melanomas and non-melanomas, are the most common types of cancer in the United States. Early-stage identification of suspicious pigmented lesions in primary care settings can lead to improved melanoma prognosis and a possible 20-fold reductions in treatment cost. This technology provides the healthcare system with a highly sensitive, specific, and economical means of providing annual skin cancer screening to all at risk individuals.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
