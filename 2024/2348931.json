 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of networked autonomous-humanoid security robots. The proposed technology is a complex system of hardware, software, and firmware for 24/7 humanoid, networked and autonomous robots for the security of mission critical, hazardous plants, factories, sites, and systems. The problem is that human security guards, technicians and managers cannot audit, act, and react 24/7, real-time, meaning down to the second in a 100% reliable fashion in any plant or hazardous site. The humanoid security robot system can continuously learn and become increasingly more machine intelligent during deployment. This novel combination of technology features, methods, and solutions support mission critical operations needed by plant managers, security managers, and technicians working under hazardous conditions. In addition, robots can help military site managers, and other mission critical system managers to audit, detect, act, and eliminate risky processes before systems implementation, which can potentially result in loss of life and/or loss of major assets. \r\n\r\nThis NSF I-Corps project is based on the development of several new integrated methods, tools, and technologies to provide 24/7 security in hazardous plants. The proposed technology is a system of hardware, software, and firmware for 24/7 humanoid, networked and autonomous security robots. The system provides real-time security for mission critical, hazardous plants, factories, construction sites, military facilities, and other systems. The technology is based on deploying autonomous mobile robots with integrated real-time processed risk analysis and artificial intelligence algorithms. The solution uses feedback-controlled sensory systems, artificial intelligence and machine learning to mimic human learning capabilities for such robots. The security robots constantly assess various types of risks and communicate this information within the network. Risk analysis and mitigation planning is developed using an artificial intelligence / rule-based expert system engine.  In addition, the system includes real-time reconfiguration, and humanoid robot scheduling and control. Collaboration with human security technicians / engineers and management is also considered. The system works as a reconfigurable, real-time controlled autonomous network of humanoid robots, that do not just detect hazards, security challenges, or faulty machines, but can also act and fix most of the issues before anything goes wrong.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
