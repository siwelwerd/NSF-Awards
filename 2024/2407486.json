 "awd_abstract_narration": "Large, sensitive laser systems are common in research laboratories, but they are traditionally owned and operated by a single investigator and used to support 1 or 2 experiments. In this project, the investigators plan to propel a new regime in the sharing of large, alignment-sensitive instrumentation, including lasers and other equipment. They will acquire, assemble, and ruggedize a state-of-the-art laser system with truly unique capabilities. First, few other systems worldwide will rival its spectral coverage (92% of the 210\u20134300 nm wave length range), enabling the system to serve comprehensive research spanning fundamental understanding and practical applications in a wide range of disciplines. Second, it will be assembled onto a custom-built wheeled optical table, allowing for widespread sharing across laboratories and buildings: the laser will be transportable to any lab at UW-Madison. The design, integration approach, and test results of the transportable laser system will be disseminated broadly, so that the approach can be adopted by many others. The investigators believe this project will help spark a revolution: institutions worldwide are expected to copy the approach and thereby increase equipment access dramatically. Importantly, many of the users who will gain access to the shared equipment in the envisioned paradigm will be researchers who are disadvantaged in some way (e.g., working on a topic or in a region where funding is lower), thereby promoting a more equitable and inclusive research ecosystem. Furthermore, from the perspective of the national and global research enterprise, fewer pieces of equipment will be needed to satisfy research efforts, ultimately enabling sponsors to fund a more diverse equipment pool to accelerate scientific discovery.\r\n\r\nThe laser will enliven the pursuit of transformative research topics among over 20 faculty at UW-Madison and at least 4 local companies in topics including quantum computing, quantum spectroscopy, biological sensing/imaging, optoelectronic device development, advanced manufacturing, and energy solutions. The ability of the system to produce 2 independent laser outputs will be particularly enabling for many emerging research topics. Beyond advancing academic and industrial research, the proposed work will generate new knowledge and techniques in the assembly, ruggedization, and testing of alignment-sensitive optical equipment. Advanced vibration management strategies will ensure minimal optical misalignment during transport. The laser will also be used for outreach. For example, the investigators will provide educators with access to the laser to enhance their classroom experience by incorporating it in activities in a graduate-level Biophotonics Lab course and the TeachQuantum program for high school teachers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
