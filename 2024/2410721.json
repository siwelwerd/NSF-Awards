 "awd_abstract_narration": "Neutrino Physics at Oregon State\r\n \r\nThe DUNE experiment that will begin taking data late in this decade consists of three major components, a powerful neutrino beam, near detectors located at Fermilab to monitor the beam and enormous Liquid Argon detectors now being assembled in the Homestake mine in South Dakota. The combination of the near and far detectors will allow precision measurements of CP violation in the neutrino sector starting early in the next decade. \r\n \r\nThis award will develop a prototype open data access systems for DUNE data in preparation for first astrophysical data near the end of this decade. The emphasis of this system will be on atmospheric and solar neutrinos and potential supernova candidates.  DUNE is sensitive to electron neutrinos from supernovae through the interaction of electron neutrinos in Liquid Argon. These interactions will be of immediate interest to the broad scientific community and the general public. This award will develop a prototype data access system that will allow public distribution of data from DUNE supernova and solar neutrino candidates.  The prototype will have real data from the ProtoDUNE experiment and simulated supernova interactions to test the delivery system and allow non-collaborators to perform simple analysis of real data. The award will also allow further work on data analysis for the ProtoDUNE test runs at the CERN laboratory in Geneva, Switzerland. \r\n \r\nThe prototype access system will allow DUNE collaborators, other scientists, students, and the general public to learn about neutrino physics and astrophysics using real data and test methods for analyzing data.  The prototype will lead to a full-scale system that will make these valuable data accessible to the public for reanalysis and for use in education.  For example, the raw data arrives as digitized waveforms, finding neutrino signals in those data can introduce students to modern signal-processing and statistical techniques.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
