 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ENVR 2024 Workshop: Spatial Data Science for the Environment is the biannual meeting of the Section on Statistics and the Environment (ENVR) of the American Statistical Association (ASA). It will be held in Boulder, Colorado, on October 3-5, 2024. The purpose of the ENVR workshop is to encourage the exchange and mutual understanding of current research ideas in environmental statistics and to provide motivation and direction for further research progress. The goals of the workshop are to (i) facilitate interdisciplinary research, (ii) present state-of-the-art methods, and (iii) develop the next generation workforce by hosting a poster presentation and a short course. This workshop offers new researchers an opportunity to participate in the meeting and interact closely with leaders in the field, in a manner not possible at larger conferences.\r\n\r\nThe program of the forthcoming Workshop on Spatial Data Science for the Environment features the following topics: (i) Advances in statistical computing for massive spatial data; (ii) Novel applications in environmental science; (iii) Recent developments in statistical methodologies in modeling complex space-time data. This award supports the participation of graduate students, early-career researchers, and members of groups underrepresented in statistics and environmental sciences. The ENVR website can be found here:  https://community.amstat.org/envr/home; the dedicated workshop website can be found here: https://community.amstat.org/envr/events/workshops/envr2024workshop\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
