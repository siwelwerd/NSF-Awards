 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of a software tool for a non-invasive risk assessment of cerebral aneurysms.  Currently, there is a growing trend in the medical industry towards less invasive assessment methods that streamline the tasks of medical professionals and augment their comprehension of cerebral aneurysms.  This technology may save patients from unnecessary risky procedures and streamline diagnostic and treatment analysis workflow, enhancing pre-surgical planning and post-treatment monitoring.  In addition, the technology is designed to provide critical information early in the healthcare process. Healthcare providers will benefit as the system aids in accurately maintaining claims, treatment records, and associated risks for each patient. This data, in turn, enables healthcare providers to engage in predictive planning for individual patients, contributing to better overall patient care and resource management in the healthcare industry.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on the development of a non-invasive software tool designed to enhance risk analysis of intracranial aneurysms. The technology integrates advanced imaging techniques with computational dynamics and artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) analysis to provide a comprehensive assessment of intracranial aneurysm risks. By reconstructing blood vessels and simulating blood flow using Navier-Stokes equations, the tool improves imaging modalities. The AI/ML algorithms analyze this data, offering valuable insights for personalized treatment planning. The technology is designed to provide dynamic risk assessments tailored to each patient, ensuring more accurate and effective results. The AI/ML insights are grounded in patient-specific biomarkers related to aneurysm growth and progression, enabling a thorough analysis of individual cases.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
