 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the modern era of heightened connectivity, addressing cyber threats is paramount. Norwich University aligns with the national goal of cultivating top-tier scholars and leaders in cybersecurity in government organizations. This project plans to (1) increase participation of underrepresented populations in cybersecurity, (2) equip scholars with artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) through an integrated BS/MS program, and (3) expand undergraduate research opportunities that establish a science of cybersecurity. \r\n\r\nThe project aims to recruit scholars committed to defending cyberspace for the collective benefit of the nation. It will offer various contributions: (1) pathways for students to join the executive branch of the Federal workforce in cybersecurity roles, (2) enhanced education through new AI and ML classes, (3) faculty development to enrich classroom experiences, (4) integration of cutting-edge AI and ML into the curriculum, and (5) facilitation of student research publication to contribute to the establishment of cybersecurity as a science. These contributions could ultimately enhance cybersecurity, making cyberspace safer and more trusted. Additionally, the project targets specific recruitment goals, including increasing participation from women, underrepresented groups, and veterans while also engaging the public through outreach activities such as Cyber camps and research presentations, thereby improving public scientific literacy and advancing AI research and education integration.\r\n\r\nThis project is supported by the CyberCorps\u00ae Scholarship for Service (SFS) program, which funds proposals establishing or continuing scholarship programs in cybersecurity and aligns with the U.S. National Cyber Strategy to develop a superior cybersecurity workforce. Following graduation, scholarship recipients are required to work in cybersecurity for a federal, state, local, or tribal Government organization for the same duration as their scholarship support.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
