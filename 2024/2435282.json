 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded by NSF Global Centers program, an innovative program that supports use-inspired research addressing global challenges through the bioeconomy. It supports U.S.-based researchers developing global international partnerships and building multi-stakeholder engagement to advance use-inspired research, in the aim to develop their project toward a large-scale international effort. \r\n\r\nEarth's limited resources, notably freshwater, arable land, and the atmosphere, must be safeguarded. Yet, as the human population increases so does global protein demand.  This project, INsects for a Sustainable Environment and Circular bioeconomy (INSECt), aims at developing sustainable solutions for feed and food rooted in biomanufacturing practices. Insect farming is scalable, requires minimal land and water, and produces low carbon emissions. Its byproducts can be used as feedstocks. This scalability allows building an economy based on the diverse life-histories of insects. Here, the team focuses on food security and climate responsiveness. They develop innovative approaches in collaboration with global academic and industrial partners. Leveraging the infrastructure developed by NSF IUCRC Center for Environmental Sustainability through Insect Farming (CEIF), they develop value-added products from insects harnessing. These products include novel small molecules to combat resistant bacteria, micronutrients for resilient plant growth, and methods for rehabilitating nutrient-poor and contaminated soils. The interdisciplinary approach brings together biologists, earth scientists, social scientists, economists, and humanists.  Their overarching goal is to shift traditional agriculture towards a bio-based model including insect. This three-year proof-of-concept grant unites US-based investigators and international collaborators. Together, they explore extreme climate stressors and One Health challenges, and assess insects\u2019 potential to produce valuable materials from waste.  Another focus is on the ethical and sociocultural dimensions of the human-insect nexus in agriculture. The project also provides support and training to undergraduate and graduate students, as well as outreach to K-12 students and the public. \r\n\r\nHere, the researchers investigate the knowledge gaps in insects as efficient bio-converters.  These gaps include: (1) insects\u2019 capability of transforming diverse organic substrates into valuable biomass and biochemical compounds; (2) their effectiveness in reducing the ecological impact of food waste while generating valuable bioeconomic resources; (3) whether insects can be utilized to mitigate environmental contaminants - and concentrate certain ones such as heavy metals - into economic products. Through interdisciplinary research and partnerships, the project advances scientific knowledge as well as the ethical, practical, and culturally aware implementation of insect-based bioeconomic models. The researchers investigate the fundamental principles of insect physiology, behavior, welfare, and ecology. They generate ethical and evidence-based approaches for incorporating insects into sustainable agriculture. They develop novel insect-derived products and processes. The project also supports the development of a diverse workforce in a global international and multidisciplinary framework, with the aim to cultivate culturally and contextually aware STEM students.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
