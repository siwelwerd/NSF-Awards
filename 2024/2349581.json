 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the renewal of the Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site in physics at Oklahoma State University. This project will allow eight to ten undergraduate students to perform summer research at Oklahoma State University for ten weeks. The primary objective is to immerse students in a stimulating multidisciplinary research atmosphere that will allow the participants to pursue a personalized research project in physics. This REU program will develop human resources into the STEM workforce that enhance the nation's technology base and are critical for the well-being of society at large while improving STEM education.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nResearch projects are available in several areas, including Atomic Physics, Computational Physics, Experimental and Theoretical High-Energy Physics, Optical Physics, Optoelectronics, and Quantum Information Sciences. Participants will also attend seminars on a variety of topics, including professional development and careers in physics, receive ethics and safety training, and engage in cohort activities with other students.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
