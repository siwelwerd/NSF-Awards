 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is dedicated to developing a novel high-brightness X-ray source that will have a significant impact on industries like semiconductor manufacturing, battery production, and non-destructive testing. This technology aims to substantially enhance the throughput, resolution, and sensitivity of X-ray metrology systems, promising dramatic improvements in both industrial and scientific applications. The broader impacts of this initiative are significant, enhancing the economic competitiveness of the United States by promoting technological leadership in essential high-tech sectors. This project is expected to open new economic avenues within an addressable market for X-ray analytical equipment valued at approximately $1 billion. The successful execution of this project will enable breakthroughs in applications ranging from improved battery safety in electric vehicles to innovations in advanced semiconductor packaging that will power the next generation of Moore's law scaling.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this project lies in its development of a novel high-brightness X-ray source, which represents a significant leap forward for X-ray metrology technology. This innovation addresses the critical need for enhanced resolution, sensitivity, and throughput in X-ray imaging systems, particularly in the fields of semiconductor manufacturing and battery safety. The research objectives include optimizing the X-ray source to achieve unprecedented levels of spectral brightness and flux density, thereby enabling more high-resolution imaging at reduced length- and timescales. The research will employ rigorous computational modeling and experimental validation to refine the design and functionality of the X-ray source. Key innovations include the use of a rotating anode and advanced electron optics to distribute heat effectively, thus preventing damage during high-power operation and maintaining image clarity. Anticipated technical results include achieving a 200-fold increase in spectral brightness, an outcome that could revolutionize the capabilities of lab-based X-ray systems.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
