 "awd_abstract_narration": "Magnetospheric accretion, where mass from surrounding disks is channeled onto the central objects by their magnetic fields, plays a key role in the formation and evolution of a wide range of astrophysical objects \u2013 including neutron stars, young stars, and even planets. The investigators will use advanced supercomputing resources to conduct first-principle numerical simulations of magnetospheric accretion. They will study how neutron stars produce X-ray pulsars and Ultraluminous X-ray Sources (PULXs), and how young stars and planets evolve within their environments. The investigators will collaborate with planetariums and supercomputer centers for visualization efforts, develop a computational physics course with a focus on AI, and organize workshops to enhance computational skills among students. They will annually recruit minority students to participate in their research, harnessing the diverse talent at the University of Nevada Las Vegas.\r\n\r\nThe research will include four key simulation areas: 1) the impact of stellar spin on accretion and outflow structures, 2) interactions between large-scale disk magnetic fields and stellar fields during accretion, 3) effects of tilted stellar magnetic fields on disk warping and asymmetric accretion, and 4) how complex stellar magnetic fields influence hot spot distributions. These simulations are expected to offer a comprehensive physical framework for interpreting observations across various wavelengths, from X-ray to radio.  Additionally, the project will foster public engagement through innovative visualizations and promote diversity in astrophysics by involving minority students in research activities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
