 "awd_abstract_narration": "The IEEE International Conference on Cluster Computing (Cluster) serves as a major international forum for presenting and sharing recent accomplishments and technological developments in the field of cluster computing, as well as the use of cluster systems for scientific and commercial applications. Cluster 2024 involves participants (researchers, developers, and users) from academia, industry, laboratories, and commerce, coming together to discuss recent advances and trends. 2024 Cluster conference takes place on September 24-27, 2024 in Kobe, Japan. \r\n\r\nThe Student Program at Cluster provides a comprehensive means for students to improve their overall research skills. The attending students will participate in the regular conferences activities and a student program comprised of special sessions that target research presentation training, research experience and career guidance, and industry interaction. Funding provided through this grant will support the travel of eligible US students. Recipients will be able to attend the main conference, workshops, and tutorials. Travel grants will encourage the research interests and the involvement of students in the field who are not well funded and those who are just beginning their participation in the field or are interested in entering it. A special effort will be made to reach out to students from underrepresented groups. This grant will offer up to 15 \u2013 20  NSF-sponsored student travel grants.  The funding opportunity will be broadly announced, giving students ample notice and time to apply. An ad-hoc committee will review applications, and the support provided will cover student registration, travel and/or lodging expenses.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
