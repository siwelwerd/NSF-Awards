 "awd_abstract_narration": "Wayfinding and navigation within unfamiliar indoor built environments are challenging propositions for many persons with disabilities. Blind or low-vision users struggle due to the lack of accessible signage and their inability to create a mental map of the space. Individuals with mobility impairments find it difficult to identify accessible routes and know upfront about potential challenges they may encounter. Individuals with cognitive impairments struggle to create or recollect mental maps they may have made. Such challenges in navigating unfamiliar spaces are a source of constant anxiety for persons with disabilities (PWDs) and a barrier to equal participation in social and economic life. Accessible spaces reduce barriers for PWDs to using services and amenities, increasing the range of regular activities conducted independently, integrating into the workforce, and increasing productivity. The proposed project has the long-term goal of improving accessibility for PWDs within and around indoor built environments through the creation of MABLE (Mapping for Accessibility in BuiLt Environments). MABLE will provide digital accessibility maps of indoor environments with an interface for assessing, planning, and navigating within them based on the affordances and capabilities of the user. It will also permit map augmentation by users based on their experiences and observations. Envisioned users include persons with visual or mobility impairments (blind, low vision, wheelchair users, cane users, etc.) as well as other categories of disabilities, and persons without disabilities who desire planning and navigation assistance. \r\n\r\nAchieving both scalability and accessibility with indoor maps is a challenging proposition. Companies focused on accessibility mapping that can scale tend to prioritize features or offerings that do not cover the richness needed for navigation. Companies that focus on mapping without accessibility emphasize scalable offerings with reduced labor demands and deep learning enabled image processing. Others that rely on user contributions for scalability cannot guarantee richness and completeness of information, and do not integrate localization tools that can enable real-time turn-by-turn navigation and exploration using contextual information. To achieve both scalability and accessibility, MABLE proposes to leverage advances in AI, building modeling, robotics, AR/VR visual scene reasoning, and low-power consumer electronics. MABLE will extract most accessibility-related information directly from floor plans using deep-learning augmented image-processing algorithms, and any missing information can be augmented through robot mapping and surveying, and stakeholder and user contributions. Further, by quantifying the localization performance and costs of an array of indoor localization technologies, the MABLE product will create custom localization deployments that work best for a stakeholder, encouraging greater adoption. The project will create new knowledge in the areas of collection, processing, and evaluation of accessibility information from built environments. In addition to a sustainability model, the project will also create new frameworks for quantifying economic benefits from accessible built environments encompassing perspectives of future economic growth potential, cost savings, and return on investments.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
