 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national interest by strengthening aerial computing education to meet the national workforce demands for cybersecurity experts. Specifically, this project has the potential to addresses privacy and security concerns associated with drones by developing a drone-centric aerial computing curriculum. Using the flipped project-based learning (FPBL) model, students will engage in out-of-class activities. These activities are strategically designed to develop computer science (CS) knowledge and secure time for in-class project-based learning activities to fly drones.  With ethical considerations infused into the curriculum, this project intends to prepare the future CS workforce with ethical awareness regarding responsible technology use. The proposed FPBL model for aerial computing could be adopted and adapted in other science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) courses to help bring more hands-on, real-world experiences to improve undergraduate STEM education.\r\n\r\nThe project's goal is to provide effective FPBL curricular materials and activities to engage students in the programming of autonomous drones for privacy protection and security enhancement at the individual and societal levels. This project will: (1) develop online modules to help students learn CS concepts, ethics, and laws related to flying drones and simulate their codes iteratively before class, (2) engage students in authentic, hands-on, and augmented projects in class to fly drones using advanced algorithms, such as path planning and randomization, and (3) assess the impact of the curriculum in cultivating students' advanced CS knowledge in aerial computing, programming and implementation skills, and ethical awareness pertinent to drone operations for protecting privacy and enhancing security. The NSF IUSE: EDU Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through its Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
