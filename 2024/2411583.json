 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-Technical Paragraph:\r\nThis project investigates collective quantum behavior of electrons at extremely low density, a regime that is rare in condensed matter physics. By varying the density, this system crosses over in behavior from metallic and superconducting to insulating and non-superconducting. Studying this transition is expected to produce important insights into the quantum physics of electrons in this unusual regime. A search for new materials is another part of this project; it aims to fuel advances in knowledge and technology. Undergraduate and graduate students engaged in this work will receive training in design and planning of experiments, materials synthesis, single-crystal growth, materials characterization, electrical, thermal and magnetic properties measurements, the development of new tools for the study of materials, and fundamental physics surrounding novel materials. Upon graduation, these students will be well prepared for advanced study or careers in science and technology. Educational efforts pursued in this project will introduce the general populace to quantum physics through new courses.\r\n \r\nTechnical Paragraph:\r\nThis project investigates a quasi-one-dimensional condensed matter system as a platform for the investigation of collective quantum electron behavior at extremely low charge-carrier density. By varying the charge-carrier density, this system crosses over in behavior from metallic and superconducting to insulating and non-superconducting. The latter state could represent Bose-Einstein condensation of electrons. The possible existence of a spin-density wave in the crossover regime will be investigated with neutron diffraction. New knowledge regarding the quantum behavior of electrons in low-dimensional and low-density environments are expected to arise from this work. The project also includes exploratory work on transition-metal oxides and chalcogenides aimed at the discovery of new materials, new physical behaviors, and a better understanding of the quantum states they exhibit. New materials offer the possibility to invigorate physics through discoveries that can fuel advances in knowledge, technology, and lead to unforeseen applications. The methods used in this project include materials synthesis, single-crystal growth, materials characterization, neutron diffraction, electrical, thermal and magnetic properties, and thermal expansion measurements. Educational efforts target training young scientists and introducing the general populace to quantum physics through new courses.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
