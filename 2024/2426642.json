 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-technical Abstract: \r\nHybrid quantum system that combines magnetic materials with engineering-tailored microwave signals has been one of the most promising contenders in producing highly efficient platforms  for quantum information transduction, processing and computing. This project aims at developing such frontier quantum research activities and expanding the quantum education and talent training capacity at North Carolina triad and triangle regions through close collaboration between North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University (NCAT) and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC-CH). The project investigates optimized high-frequency signals produced collectively from microwave and magnetic samples, and efficient ways to process and interconvert them for electronic applications. The project includes a research and education plan to involve graduate and undergraduate researchers at both institutions, especially students from minority groups. The research activities are also complemented by rich outreach activities to engage with students from local high schools and community colleges, and dissemination plans to share the research findings with the public research community. \r\n\r\nTechnical Abstract: \r\nSpin wave(magnon)-based hybrid quantum systems manifest several advantages including low energy loss,  novel quantum states, small wavelength, and compatibility with memory architectures. In the past decade, different hybrid magnon-photon coupling systems have been proposed by interacting microwave cavities and transmission line resonators with ferrimagnetic materials to achieve quantum logics, sensing and signal transduction. In this project, an applied physics and engineering approach is taken to develop novel microwave photon-magnon coupling systems based on engineered subwavelength photon resonators and mode-tailored magnon cavities. The project addresses several intellectual challenges: 1) developing novel sub-wavelength microwave photon resonators and periodic waveguiding structures through photon mode engineering for hybrid magnonics systems and their characterization at ambient temperatures; 2) down-scaling of magnon wavelength through research of novel magnonic resonant cavity architectures and excitation of short wavelength magnon modes; 3) developing on-chip, non-reciprocal photon-magnon coupling systems for unidirectional signal transduction through both selectively polarized photon engineering and non-reciprocal properties of magnon-magnon coupling. The project strides a multi-disciplinary research path for quantum system development, and the insights gained from the research have the potential to catalyze advancements in various applications, including spin-based logic and memory devices, magnon-based signal processing, and quantum sensing and information processing. The project involves training, outreach, and educational activities that broadly engage students at the levels of graduates, undergraduates, and high schools.\r\n\r\nThis project is co-funded by the Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP), which provides awards to strengthen STEM undergraduate education and research at HBCUs, and by the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences, Office of Strategic Initiatives.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
