 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant is intended to increase student and early career researcher participation at the Model Reduction and Surrogate Modeling Conference 2024 (MORe24) in La Jolla, California, 9-13 September 2024. The funds will cover conference registration and accommodation at the conference hotel. This award will be particularly beneficial for students with financial needs. The 5-day conference will bring together computational scientists, engineers, mathematicians, and domain experts from industry, national laboratories, and academia to discuss model reduction and surrogate modeling for high-dimensional complex systems. The event will feature over 125 presentations, including plenaries, regular talks, and poster presentations.  \r\n\r\nGiven the conference's location and financial constraints, the grant aims to promote access within the engineering community. By prioritizing students who lack sufficient financial support from other sources, such as their advisors or departments, the grant ensures broader access to valuable learning, professional development, and networking opportunities. The grant will also facilitate networking with academics, researchers from national laboratories, and industry. This opportunity will improve career prospects of scientists and engineers working in model reduction and surrogate modeling who otherwise would not have been exposed to this professional development experience.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
