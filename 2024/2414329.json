 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader/commercial impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project lies in its potential to revolutionize the textile manufacturing industry by capturing industrial carbon dioxide emissions and transforming them into sustainable, high-quality cellulosic fibers. This innovation not only mitigates the environmental impact of greenhouse gases but also provides a renewable, forest-free source of raw materials for textile production. This technology is estimated, even at its pilot scale, to lead to ~50% lower CO2e emissions, 60% less water, and 98% less land usage compared with tree-derived wood pulp. In the long-term, this vision would enable reforestation and preservation to promote rewilding and return of biodiverse ecosystems. The successful development and commercialization of this technology align with NSF's mission to promote scientific progress and environmental sustainability. This technology is anticipated to create new job opportunities and bolster the U.S. economy by participating in an estimated $2B serviceable obtainable market.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis Phase II project advances a pioneering innovation in biocatalysis by refining and scaling a CO2-to-cellulose conversion process utilizing enzymatic pathways inside an industrial bioreactor. The primary technical innovation involves optimizing the stabilization and activity of enzymes involved in carbon conversion and cellulose synthesis to effectively convert carbon dioxide into cellulose under industrial conditions. The project will focus on enhancing pathway efficiency, optimizing process parameters, and transitioning from pilot-scale to commercial-scale production. Methods include development of a continuous biocatalytic process, enzyme stability optimization, materials validation, and process scaling studies. The goal is to establish a robust, efficient, and commercially viable method for producing sustainable cellulose from industrial CO2 emissions, significantly advancing sustainable manufacturing of textiles and offering a scalable solution to reduce industrial carbon footprint.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
