 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is an ExpandAI Capacity Building Pilot (CAP), which focuses on the establishment of a robust Artificial Intelligence (AI) infrastructure at California State University, Fullerton (CSUF). The project enhances the research capacity of the institution and facilitating AI-focused educational curriculum development and training. Towards this goal, the INSPIRE project aims to build a comprehensive framework for AI collaboration, implement culturally responsive and cross-college AI curricula, and foster partnerships with industry and research organizations. Ultimately, this will promote inclusive and ethical practices associated with AI research and education and preparing students and faculty for success in the AI field.\r\n\r\nCAP:INSPIRE will organize these efforts under a new AI Hub to be established at CSUF. This campus-wide hub will facilitate engagement with appropriate communities and build partnerships with industry, resulting in a supportive ecosystem that nurtures the growth and development of underrepresented students and faculty in AI fields. Within this framework, a range of activities will be initiated, all centered on promotion of inclusive AI research and education, empowering underrepresented students and faculty, and driving positive social outcomes. In curriculum development, culturally-responsive course modules will support both student and faculty development, encouraging more underrepresented students and faculty to pursue careers in AI fields. Through these curricular improvements, new modes such as an AI Career Pathways program will provide an interdisciplinary approach through which key courses in various disciplines, including computer science, engineering, business, and biology, will expose students to multiple aspects of AI applications and prepare them for a wide range of AI-driven career trajectories. The ExpandAI Program supports AI-powered education and workforce development, infrastructure, and research at Minority Serving Institutions to strengthen and diversify U.S. research and education pathways and provide historically marginalized communities with new opportunities in STEM careers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
