 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project replaces an older, shared, liquid helium dependent, Fourier transform mass spectrometer supporting science, engineering, and technology users, with a modern system based on adequate resolution and cost-effective advanced technology at the Arkansas Statewide Mass Spectrometry Facility. Measurements will be conducted based on more accepted or tandem processes and without further reliance on liquid helium. For newly created materials, or anthropological artifacts, accurate measurement of individual molecules' masses will be used to confirm material composition, allowing enhanced identification. For researchers studying membranes and filters, substances fouling, clogging, or passing through the filters will also be characterized, but with the addition of separation techniques that simplify analysis and add diagnostic retention times. For investigators studying toxin remediation, such as \u201cforever chemicals\u201d, high sensitivity will allow them to confirm the efficacy of remediation and identify degradants, helping ensure that toxins are destroyed rather than inadvertently converted from one toxic form to another. Other Arkansas and regional researchers, startups, small businesses, or educational users, including students, will benefit from the use of these capabilities and the newly acquired ability to differentiate materials based on their shape/size, not just the mass.\r\n \r\nThe research team proposes to acquire a state-of-the-art quadrupole/time-of-flight liquid chromatography-based mass spectrometer to replace a 17-year-old Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance system with a low duty cycle. The older system was not compatible with on-line chromatography or modern data driven scanning, collecting only one spectrum per analysis. The replacement instrument provides many capabilities concurrent with adequate resolution (75K) and accurate mass measurement. These include high performance liquid chromatography, electrospray, and atmospheric pressure ionization, low picogram sensitivity, data dependent and data independent analysis, matrix assisted laser desorption ionization, fragmentation by collision induced dissociation or electron transfer dissociation and ion mobility spectrometry. The proposed instrument will end the need for liquid helium use in mass spectrometry. Research groups in academia and industry and users across departments, colleges, and the state will benefit from access to continued or enhanced high resolution accurate mass analysis, whereas the ability to support research by engineers and chemists and in support of the NSF funded Membrane Science Engineering and Technology Center at the University of Arkansas will be more transformative. Overall, all STEM users of the Arkansas Statewide Mass Spectrometry Facility will benefit from the acquisition of this instrument.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
