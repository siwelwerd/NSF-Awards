 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to advance our understanding of hydroclimate, water cycling, and ecosystem interactions by precisely measuring natural variations in the mass of water molecules caused by different isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen. It brings a cutting-edge isotopic water analyzer to Grand Valley State University. The instrument enables researchers and students to investigate climate change impacts on water cycles, the health of freshwater ecosystems like wetlands, and groundwater resource contamination. The ability to track isotopic \"fingerprints\" in water will allow the research team to study where ground- and surface waters are sourced from, as well as track geochemical processes occurring in those waters. This project will provide hands-on training for the next generation of water scientists while directly benefiting West Michigan communities through educational outreach. \r\n\r\nThe project brings a Picarro L2140-i Isotopic Water Analyzer to Grand Valley State University (GVSU), a primarily undergraduate institution, for use in geoscience, ecology, and climate research. This device will primarily be used to facilitate novel investigations into water movement between freshwater and coastal systems, including analysis of precipitation, ocean, lake, and aquifer waters to understand their hydrology, geochemistry, and climate. Initial investigations will specifically focus on: 1) Water oxygen-18 isotopic variability in lacustrine and coastal marine carbonate forming environments, with an eye towards paleoclimate applications; 2) High-resolution oxygen-17 and hydrogen isotope monitoring in precipitation and surface waters to better estimate Great Lakes basin moisture recycling; 3) Oxygen isotopes as an ecosystem metabolism proxy in monitored wetlands; and 4) Pilot exploration of nitrate contamination sourcing via water isotopes. Each study has been designed to advance scientific understanding by leveraging the interdisciplinary expertise at GVSU. The project will build pioneering and publicly available water stable isotope datasets that can be utilized in related research globally. These efforts will also result in high-impact publications that will raise the profile of this primarily undergraduate institution, while simultaneously providing hands-on experiences for students.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
