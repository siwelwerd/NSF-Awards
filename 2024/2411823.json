 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research studies ultra-high energy cosmic rays, which are elementary particles and atomic nuclei from outside of our Galaxy which interact in the Earth's atmosphere and produce a cascade of particles called an air shower. The study uses the Pierre Auger Observatory (PAO) in the Mendoza province of Argentina, the world's largest operating cosmic ray observatory. PAO has 1,660 surface detector stations spread over 3,000 square kilometers, with four fluorescence telescopes. PAO is currently completing a significant upgrade, called AugerPrime, which will simultaneously measure both muonic and electromagnetic (photon, electron, and positron) components of extensive air showers. PAO detection of ultra-high energy photons or neutrinos traveling from their source without decay or deflection will elucidate the nature of the acceleration sites and improve our understanding of the extreme universe. This work is a key component of a broad multi-messenger approach for understanding the very high energy universe.  The project involves students extensively and hosts public outreach both at the home institution and at the Visitor Center in Argentina.\r\n\r\nThe present work uses the enhancements of AugerPrime to increase sensitivity for detecting ultra-high energy neutrino and photon-induced air showers.  This makes detection more likely, and furthers PAO\u2019s contributions to multi-messenger astrophysics. The research builds on previous accomplishments, moving from characterizing promising trigger algorithms to implementing those algorithms in the AugerPrime surface detector electronics, installing those systems in the field, and integrating with higher-level offline analysis software.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
