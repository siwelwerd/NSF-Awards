 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact of this Partnerships for Innovation \u2013 Research Partnership (PFI-RP) project is in enhancing the understanding of drug interactions within the body by providing detailed spatial information on how chiral drugs behave in different tissue environments. Chiral drugs are medications where the molecules have a specific three-dimensional arrangement of atoms that affects their biological activity. The imaging technology goes beyond traditional methods by allowing scientists to see exactly where and how drugs interact with tissues, which is crucial for developing safer and more effective medications. The integration of novel detection schemes will enable quicker and more sensitive assessments of drug candidates, speeding up the development process. This technology will help ensure that drugs are effective and minimize harmful side effects, ultimately contributing to the advance of personalized medicine. Furthermore, this project will foster innovation and entrepreneurship among students.\r\n\r\nThe project aims to address a critical need in pharmaceutical research by developing an advanced imaging instrument that operates in the mid-infrared spectrum. This instrument will allow for non-destructive, spatial analysis of complex chiral drug interactions within biological tissues. Understanding chirality, or the geometric property of molecules that results in non-superimposable mirror images, is essential because the enantiomers of chiral drugs can have vastly different effects. Some enantiomers can cause unintended and harmful side effects, so it is vital to study these interactions in detail. By leveraging recent advancements in single-element detection schemes and metamaterial assemblies, this project will transform traditional chiroptical spectrometers into imaging systems. This innovation will provide new insights into drug behavior, enhancing the safety and efficacy of drug development.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
