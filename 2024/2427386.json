 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of North Carolina at Wilmington (UNCW) will undertake an institutional self-assessment to identify potential organizational inequities in culture and policy that result in differential professional outcomes for some STEM faculty. The ADVANCE Catalyst project will result in a five-year STEM faculty equity plan tailored to the UNCW context and institutional data that will guide institutional actions to address any issues identified during the grant. This project will examine how culture, policy, and other factors interact across levels of an institution and affect different faculty in STEM.\r\n\r\nThe institutional self-assessment and five-year strategic plan will set a foundation to improve equity for STEM faculty at the institution. This work will benefit STEM disciplines as well as non-STEM disciplines due to the interconnected nature of institutional policy. Results of the Catalyst project will be regularly communicated with the UNCW community and other institutions. The project is expected to add to our understanding of STEM faculty equity issues at regional, medium-sized, Carnegie R2 universities.\r\n\r\nThe NSF ADVANCE program is designed to foster gender equity through a focus on the identification and elimination of organizational barriers that impede the full participation and advancement of diverse faculty in academic institutions. Organizational barriers that inhibit equity may exist in policies, processes, practices, and the organizational culture and climate. ADVANCE \"Catalyst\" awards provide support for institutional equity assessments and the development of five-year faculty equity strategic plans at academic, non-profit institutions of higher education.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
