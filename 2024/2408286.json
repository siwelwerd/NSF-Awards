 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) project is jointly funded with the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) program. The objective of this MRI project is to acquire a state-of-the-art integrated atomic force microscope/confocal microscope (AFMC) system for bioengineering and materials science research. The system simultaneously acquires microscopy images and structural and mechanical information.  This AFMC will be the first-of-its-kind in the Mountain West and Pacific Northwest regions. In this way, bioengineering research capabilities at Boise State University and in the region will substantially increase, leading to cutting-edge multidisciplinary research. The research initiatives enabled by the AFMC will provide student researchers with access to state-of-the-art training, job preparation, and research endeavors. These opportunities will inspire students to pursue education in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). Ultimately, acquisition of the AFMC will contribute to developing a highly skilled STEM workforce and attracting the biotechnology industry to Boise and the region.\r\n\r\nThe proposed instrument is an interfaced Bruker NanoWizardV Bio AFM and Zeiss LSM 900 confocal microscope with Airyscan. This AFMC has specialized capabilities for scanning and imaging live and fixed cells, tissues, bioscaffolds, and biomolecular constructs, enabling optical, morphological, and mechanobiological characterization of samples in real-time. The system is high resolution with nanoscale spatial precision based on locations of fluorescently labeled biomolecules (e.g., proteins, DNA, etc.) of interest. A major challenge has been characterizing and quantifying the relationship between intra- and extra-cellular mechanical characteristics in relation to subsequent desirable or undesirable cell behavior. In this regard, AFM is a powerful tool; however, the surface topography and micro- and nanomechanical data provided by AFM is significantly more useful when combined with real-time live cell tracking and quantifiable imaging modalities to guide the data collection, which can only be accomplished through the simultaneous use of confocal imaging. Acquiring a state-of-the-art AFMC addresses a growing need in the Colleges of Engineering and Arts and Sciences at Boise State University, while also meeting regional demand from other institutions within Idaho and across the broader region to support ongoing mechanobiology, engineering, materials science, and DNA-enabled quantum information science (QIS) research. The instrument addresses these needs, enables scanning and imaging in physiological conditions, and is optimally configured for shared use.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
