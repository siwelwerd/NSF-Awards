 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant will support travel of students and post-doctoral researchers who are US citizens or US permanent residents to attend the Hilton Head Workshop 2024 (HH2024): A Solid-State Sensors, Actuators, and Microsystems Workshop. Specifically, this grant enables the HH2024 organizing committee to support participation of diverse attendees with a focus on those underrepresented. The committee will select the awardees from the pool of high school, undergraduate and graduate students, and postdoctoral researchers who are the first or second authors of the accepted papers. HH2024 organizing committee will target awarding approximately 50 percent of the awards to women or underrepresented minorities. \r\n\r\nThe 21st in the series of Hilton Head Workshops (HH2024) on the science and technology of Solid-State Sensors, Actuators, and Microsystems will take place 2-6 June 2024 at the Sonesta Resort on Hilton Head Island, South Carolina. This exciting multidisciplinary event has occurred biennially since 1984, and this year the Hilton Head Workshop\u2019s 40th anniversary will celebrate Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) and microsystems successes over the past four decades. Additionally, participants will look ahead to the challenges and opportunities for the field to contribute to addressing national and global grand challenges in the next 40 years. The HH2024 Workshop is the prominent and top-tier conference in the field of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) and Microsystems and related fields, and is expected to draw 350-500 academic, industry, and government participants from diverse engineering and scientific backgrounds, including chemistry, materials science, chemical engineering, electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, physics, biology, and bioengineering. This year\u2019s workshop will have a focus on design, fabrication and manufacturing of emerging nano/microscale device and systems for sensing, actuation, and computing with broad impact on biomedical, energy, information processing and quantum technologies.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
