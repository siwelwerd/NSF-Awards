 "awd_abstract_narration": "NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\n\r\nExtending the use of Al alloys is one the many avenues to reduce global CO2 emissions. Global sustainability concerns demand greater alloy versatility, longer part durability, greater reduction of the amounts of energy used during Al processing, and higher material recycling rate. To this end, addressing current alloy limitations is a priority. Here, the project will focus on model Al-Mg-Si(-Cu) alloys whose commercial counterparts are widely used in the transportation industry with the objective to understand the fundamental mechanisms controlling the development of strength and formability during processing. The combination of these main properties is required for the fabrication and durability of Al components. Such understanding will help make Al alloys both stronger and more formable, improve alloy versatility by tailoring thermo-mechanical treatments to alloy compositions to achieve desired mechanical properties, and contribute to the development of physics-based models in support of accelerated material development, manufacturability, and deployment. The proposed GOALI project will benefit from the expertise of the industrial partner, a leader in aluminum transformation. This university / industry collaboration will provide unique interactions, professional development, and internship opportunities for the undergraduate and graduate students working on the project.\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\n\r\nAluminum alloys are used in structural components in many sectors to promote light-weighting and reduce global CO2 emissions. However, global sustainability concerns also demand larger alloy versatility, longer part durability, and higher material recycling rate. To this end, addressing property limitations is a priority. This program will focus on model Al-Mg-Si(-Cu) alloys whose commercial counterparts are widely used in the transportation industry with the objective to understand the fundamental mechanisms controlling the development of strength and formability. Through a systematic approach combining state-of-the-art characterization techniques, this program will elucidate synergies between nanoscale solute clusters that result from heat treatments and/or inevitable natural aging and deformation. Such understanding will also improve alloy versatility and possibly recyclability by enabling the tailoring of thermo-mechanical treatments to alloy compositions to achieve desired mechanical properties. While the proposed program is largely experimental, the findings will support on-going theoretical efforts focused on integrating physics-based knowledge within deformation modeling, from the atomistic to the continuum. Furthermore, the program will contribute to the recruitment, retention, and training in advanced research methods and techniques of a diverse student body and workforce through the proposed research activities, educational and collaborative research interactions and synergies with the industrial partner, opportunities for industrial internships, and activities focusing on increasing diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility awareness and practice in the classroom, laboratories, and campus wide.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
