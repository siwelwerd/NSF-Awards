 "awd_abstract_narration": "This funding will support participation of US-based mathematicians and statisticians in the Fields Institute's collaborative programs, strengthening their contributions to knowledge frontiers, innovation and cutting-edge mathematics research. This program embodies NSF's objective of fostering integration of research and education through programs that recruit, train, and prepare a diverse science, technology, engineering, and mathematics workforce to advance the frontiers of science and participate in the knowledge economy.\r\n\r\nFields Institute programs include conferences and workshops span fundamental and applied mathematics research, industrial partnerships, mathematics education, and outreach to the broader public. Thematic and focus programs, along with other activities, bring together leading experts, researchers from different career stages, postdocs, and students for sustained periods of communication and collaboration on important mathematical problems of current significance. Program participants gain advanced training and development opportunities through their interactions with the institute's visitors and participants. Fields Institute programs connect mathematicians with experts and industry practitioners in related disciplines, exposing trainees to real-world challenges. NSF funding will enable US-based participants who have no other federal support and participants who are students, post-doctoral scholars, or members of groups that are under-represented in the mathematical sciences to participate in Fields Institute programs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
