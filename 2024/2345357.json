 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Improving Undergraduate STEM Education: Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSI\r\nProgram), this Track 2 project aims to enhance student engagement in office hours within STEM courses,\r\nparticularly focusing on biology courses at multiple HSIs and emerging HSIs within Southern California.\r\nOffice hours are a common resource for student learning and represent a space where students can\r\nengage with other students and instructors. However, office hours remain underutilized in STEM,\r\nparticularly among historically marginalized students. The \u201chidden curriculum\u201d, a set of unspoken norms,\r\npractices and values that influence academic success, compounds disparities in office hours attendance\r\nand engagement, exacerbating retention and graduation gaps among Hispanic, first generation, and\r\nstudents holding one or more minoritized identities. Thus, this project will examine office hours practices\r\nand develop evidence-based interventions that can reduce disparities in office hours engagement. Such\r\nefforts will positively impact retention and persistence within STEM by creating structural changes to\r\nbetter support student engagement and success, particularly for historically underrepresented students.\r\n\r\nThe project unites a diverse network of seven Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSIs) and emerging HSIs,\r\nincluding both 2-year and 4-year colleges within Southern California. The specific aims of the project are:\r\n1) characterize student and faculty perceptions of office hours; 2) investigate the impact of different\r\noffice hours practices on student behavioral, cognitive, and affective engagement; 3) identify factors that\r\npromote office hours engagement in the context of intersectional student identities; and 4) design and\r\nassess evidence-based interventions aimed at increasing student engagement in office hours. We will conduct\r\nsurveys and focus groups for students (including students who have and have not attended office hours)\r\nand instructors to gather insight into student perceptions, motivations, and barriers as\r\nwell as instructor perceptions and practices. We will form a collaborative learning community across our\r\nnetwork that will use data gathered to design evidence-based interventions to foster office hours\r\nengagement. Through application of our findings, we will create and disseminate evidence-based\r\npractices for faculty that support student engagement in office hours, with an emphasis on increasing\r\ninclusion of Hispanic and other minoritized students. Because of the ubiquitous nature of office hours,\r\nour interventions will be applicable to instructors across institutions and STEM fields, and we will lead\r\nworkshops and develop evidence-based teaching guides to share our work. Thus, our project will\r\npromote student success and belonging in STEM for all students, particularly among Hispanic, first\r\ngeneration, and historically minoritized students across higher education through structural changes that\r\nsupport student engagement. The HSI Program aims to enhance undergraduate STEM education and\r\nbuild capacity at HSIs. Projects supported by the HSI Program will also generate new knowledge on how\r\nto achieve these aims.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
