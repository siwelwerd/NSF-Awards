 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 2024 Yamabe Memorial Symposium will be held at the School of Mathematics of the University of Minnesota - Twin Cities, from Friday, October 4th to Sunday, October 6th, 2024. The Yamabe Memorial Symposium is a prestigious biennial conference in geometry and topology, established in 1962. It is renowned among geometers and topologists for its high-level, cutting-edge talks, strong support for U.S. graduate students, and its ability to connect leading experts with junior researchers through well-organized events. This year, the symposium will uphold this tradition, offering a comprehensive exploration of various aspects of symplectic and contact geometry in light of recent breakthroughs in these fields.\r\n\r\nRecent major breakthroughs include advancements in the foundations of Floer theory, such as the development of stable homotopy theory for Floer theory, the introduction of global Kuranishi charts, and their applications to the Arnold conjecture over integers. Additionally, Floer theory has been applied to symplectic topology, including the refutation of the simplicity conjecture. Complementary to Floer theory, significant progress has been made in the study of Hamiltonian torus actions and topological methods in higher-dimensional contact structures. Eight confirmed speakers, comprising leading experts from around the world, will ensure comprehensive coverage of these areas. The webpage for the Yamabe Symposium is https://cse.umn.edu/math/yamabe-memorial-symposium\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
