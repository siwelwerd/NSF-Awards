 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this Civic Innovation Challenge Planning Grant (CIVIC-PG) is to support research on using drones and robots powered by Artificial Intelligence (AI), combined with effective communication methods and strategic decision-making, to provide real-time information on flooding conditions, and evacuation routes. It aims to empower small, underprivileged communities and their first responders to handle flood-triggered evacuation events more effectively. By equipping citizens and professionals with cutting-edge technology, the project improves situational awareness, evacuation efficiency, and resource allocation. The project team works with community members, local charities, and government agencies in coastal South Louisiana to refine the research method and advance disaster resilience. The expected outcome is scalable and adaptable models that can support multiple functions (e.g., emergency response, urban planning, and public safety) for various regions and disaster scenarios.\r\n\r\nThe project integrates advanced AI-driven Autonomous Vehicle (AV) technology, effective communication strategies, and community collaboration, with an emphasis on meeting the needs of underprivileged communities. AVs are deployed to gather and disseminate real-time information on flood conditions, evacuation routes, and resource needs, while game theory informs incentive schemes to encourage broad community participation. Communication strategies are tailored to cultural and individual differences within communities, enhancing clarity and trustworthiness of emergency messages. This innovative approach provides valuable insights into the use of AI and AVs in disaster management. By fostering collaboration between first responders and community members and aligning technological developments with community needs, this project contributes to disaster preparedness in piloting communities and provides generalizable solutions for other flood-prone regions.\r\n\r\nThis project is in response to the Civic Innovation Challenge program\u2019s Track A. Climate and Environmental Instability - Building Resilient Communities through Co-Design, Adaption, and Mitigation and is a collaboration between NSF, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Department of Energy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
