 "awd_abstract_narration": "Oakland University (OU) will renew their Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site that has been hosted in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering for over two decades. Each summer, undergraduate students from across the nation will work on challenging research problems related to cybersecurity and artificial intelligence (AI), an area of national priority for our nation.  These undergraduate students will spend 10 summer weeks on campus where they are immersed in a research environment with all its facets: participating actively in shaping the research project and in defining its solution; communicating to peers and other audiences about their progress and their findings; visiting research laboratories and attending presentations about all aspects of research and research careers.  The team will continue to use successful strategies employed in past REU Sites to recruit undergraduate students from groups traditionally under-represented in computer science. A particular focus will be on recruiting women, and students from groups that are under-represented in computing, as well as students from institutions where there are limited research opportunities. The goal is to contribute to the development of a diverse scientific workforce with expertise in areas critical to national security in the evolving global society of the future.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis REU (UnCoRe-CyberAI) site will allow students to work with researchers and contribute to the evolving landscape of cybersecurity and modern AI in transportation technology, medicine and data science, the interdisciplinary nature of human-AI interaction, the convergence of cutting-edge AI and national security for DoD bases, and core software security.  Ultimately, the goal is to contribute to developing a diverse, internationally competitive, and globally engaged science and engineering workforce, which is one of the NSF priorities. The project will engage 30 participants (many of them are women or URMs and from institutions with limited research activity in STEM) in research experiences that will motivate them to pursue careers in science and engineering, particularly Cybersecurity and AI. The REU students will be better prepared for graduate studies and engineering. Further, research and programmatic results will be disseminated in conferences and through peer-reviewed articles.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
