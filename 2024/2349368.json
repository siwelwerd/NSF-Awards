 "awd_abstract_narration": "This REU Site award to Clemson University, located in Clemson, SC, will support the training of 10 students for 10 weeks during the summers of 2024-2026. Program participants work with faculty, postdocs, graduate students, and other undergraduates on collaborative research exploring biology through the prism of physics, biology, chemistry, and engineering. The scientific focus is to train a diverse pool of future leaders who can connect physical, biological, and engineering sciences to deepen our understanding of nature\u2019s machinery. An additional focus is cross-disciplinary training; thus, each participant has a specific project with their mentor, and then the team is paired to work in a more extensive collaboration. The program will train approximately 30 students, predominantly from schools with limited research opportunities or from an underrepresented group. Students will learn how research is conducted, and many will present the results of their work at scientific conferences. Assessment of this program will be done through an online tool. \r\n\r\nThe program encompasses a range of activities, including mentoring in interdisciplinary research, workshops on research skills, participation in journal clubs, attendance at the summer symposium, engagement in professional development workshops, exploration of career paths, field trips, outreach initiatives, and event outings. Participants will gain insights into the research process, with many having the opportunity to present their findings at scientific conferences. As part of their professional development, participants will also receive training in Responsible Conduct for Research and Research Safety. Students should apply to the REU site using NSF ETAP (Education and Training Application: https://etap.nsf.gov), where they must submit a copy of their transcript, CV, two letters of recommendation, a statement of purpose, and a statement summarizing prior research experience. Note that no research experience is necessary to apply. This site is supported by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
