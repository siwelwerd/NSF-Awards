 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is a novel anti-infective coating to mitigate catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs). These infections often lead to severe complications, resulting in an estimated 13,000 annual deaths while incurring nearly $6.2 billion in direct and indirect U.S. healthcare system costs. The hybrid catheter technology aims to provide continuous protection against infections caused by biofilms, offering chronic antimicrobial and biofilm-repelling properties through a synergistic combination of biofilm-repelling and static antimicrobial surface moieties. The proposed catheter technology aims to demonstrate significant decreases in infection rates, improved catheter longevity, and broad-spectrum protection against pathogens to reduce the risks of infection associated with long-term catheter use, reducing the reliance of patients on antibiotics. The scope of this technology's application has broader potential beyond urinary catheters to include other catheter-based applications and acute in-hospital use medical devices. The overall technological objectives are to improve infection control practices and risk reduction for many common U.S. in-hospital procedures.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop a novel device surface coating with enhanced anti-pathogen and biofilm resistance. The objective is to develop and validate in vitro an innovative catheter design that offers prolonged resistance to biofilm formation, superior to current single modality approaches. During this Phase 1 project, the anti-biofilm properties of zwitterionic moieties will be combined with the durable static microbicidal action of a Gemini-dicationic moieties into a single coating. Initial bench tests at the materials level demonstrate a significant reduction in biofilm formation superior to currently available methods. Invitro testing will be completed on the novel combined mode material to demonstrate reduced infection risks relative to existing antimicrobial Foley catheters. The proprietary material will then be integrated into manufacturing processes to prevent infection in catheter-use medical settings.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
