 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nontechnical: In the quest to bring quantum technologies to the forefront, the challenge of scaling up quantum systems for practical applications looms large. Photons, serving as quantum interconnects, offer a solution by weaving together smaller quantum systems to enhance the overall quantum computational power, akin to classical cluster computers. However, the realization of practical photonic quantum interconnects hinges on the availability of entangled multiphoton sources with the required brightness, quality, and number of entangled particles. This project's core objective is to transform quantum light sources, specifically aiming to create efficient and high-quality multiphoton entangled states. The research leverages the advances made by the lead researchers in chip-scale single-photon sources that employ semiconductor quantum dots embedded in nanofabricated photonic structures to achieve robustness and scalability. To translate this performance of single-photon sources to multiphoton entanglement, innovations in material and device level modeling will be coupled with precise spectroscopy and qubit control to characterize and suppress noise in qubits. This comprehensive approach seeks to establish the practicality and resilience of photonic quantum interconnects in the near term. Complementing these scientific pursuits, the project places a strong emphasis on education, seeking to foster a robust science identity and a sense of belonging within the scientific community among students. Through an interdisciplinary forum and a quantum outreach program, the project aims to enhance the recruitment and retention of underrepresented communities in STEM by providing unique opportunities for student interaction and collaboration in the captivating field of quantum technologies.\r\n\r\n\r\nTechnical: The central objective of this proposal is to design and implement an on-chip source of multiphoton entangled states that satisfy the steep demands on efficiency, fidelity, and scalability for realizing practical quantum interconnects. To achieve this, we will control and harness spin-photon interactions in optically active single quantum dots and tunnel-coupled quantum dots coupled to photonic crystal waveguides to achieve high collection efficiency, while leveraging low-noise properties of local-droplet etched quantum dots. Accomplishing the research tasks of this proposal will advance the understanding and lay the foundation for robust and efficient quantum interconnects by (1) establishing the fundamental limits on photon purity and entanglement fidelity through novel theoretical models and experiments, (2) addressing the knowledge gaps in the fundamental physics of spin-photon interactions in nanostructures, and (3) demonstrating 1D and 2D multiphoton entanglement generation in a chip-integrated quantum light source.\r\n\r\nThis project is jointly funded by Electronic, Photonic, and Magnetic Devices (EPMD) Program of the Division of Electrical, Communications and Cyber Systems (ECCS) and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
