 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Track 2 ATE project aims to develop multiple educational pathways leading to careers in the semiconductor manufacturing industry in the five-county Central New York region. Project activities seek to make a significant contribution to statewide and national efforts to strengthen the U.S. semiconductor ecosystem. Building upon existing Electromechanical Technology and Engineering Science associate degree programs, this project plans to integrate semiconductor competencies, learning outcomes, course content and labs into an industry recognized micro-credential. Additional on- and off-ramps to degree and certificates in the semiconductor industry are also part of the development plan.  These new pathways intend to provide individuals with prior technical engineering experience increased access to specialized training and ultimately to well-paid jobs. Collaborations with high schools and other two-year colleges are likely to expand upon this project to provide concurrent enrollment pathways and co-delivery options. Ultimately, the results should provide numerous opportunities for students to develop the specialized knowledge and skills needed to obtain employment in a rapidly expanding industry.\r\n\r\nThe overall goal of this project is to create multiple educational pathways for individuals to earn industry-validated credentials that provide the critical skills and knowledge needed to enter and advance in technician and engineering positions in the semiconductor industry. This project seeks to incorporate the evidence-based Business Industry Leadership Team (BILT) model and Developing a Curriculum (DACUM) process to systematically engage employers and expert educators to validate new curriculum, resulting in alignment of the skills needed with the needs of industry. Ultimately, this project aims to result in industry-validated, semiconductor-focused content that can be integrated as a stackable credential within an associate of applied science and associate of science degree. Collaborations with high school partners and baccalaureate degree institutions will provide additional pathways for expanding access to these new technical education opportunities in the semiconductor field. Project evaluation aims to generate findings to support formative feedback to improve execution of proposed activities as well as contribute to the knowledge of effective semiconductor training programs. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program and is supported in part by funds from Intel Corporation under the ETSTE DCL.  The program focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
