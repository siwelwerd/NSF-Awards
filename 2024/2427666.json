 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will host a three-day workshop, with both online and in-person participants, focused on teaching STEM educators about the ethics of generative AI (genAI). This project aims to serve the national interest by enhancing the ethical literacy of STEM educators and their ability to teach genAI ethics. As genAI becomes more common in schools and workplaces, it's important for educators to understand and address the ethical implications of these technologies. STEM educators help students learn to critically assess the information generated by genAI systems and to navigate the responsible design, development, and deployment of these technologies throughout their academic and professional careers. The project will bring together an inclusive community of STEM educators to create and share teaching materials on genAI ethics for undergraduate courses. By addressing critical issues such as data privacy, bias, and academic integrity, the project aligns with NSF's mission to advance scientific knowledge and education. The broader significance lies in fostering a generation of STEM professionals equipped to make responsible and ethical decisions in their careers, thereby contributing to more equitable and conscientious technological advancements. Additionally, asynchronous materials from the live workshop, including recordings and slide shows, will be available online for interested educators to experience the workshop on their own.\r\n\r\nThe workshop has two primary goals: (1) To equip STEM educators with knowledge and tools to teach genAI ethics effectively; and (2) to create and share adaptable teaching modules on genAI ethics for undergraduate STEM courses. The workshop will follow a \"One Week, One Course\" design sprint model, with live sessions on data privacy, bias, and academic integrity, with additional asynchronous work and feedback for participants to refine their teaching materials. Guided by the United Nations' Principles for the Ethical Use of Artificial Intelligence, the workshop will ensure a comprehensive exploration of ethical issues. By leveraging backward design principles, the project aims to create robust modules that can be implemented across various STEM disciplines, enhancing the ethical understanding of future STEM professionals. The workshop's will allow for both in-person and online participation, ensuring accessibility and broad dissemination.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
