 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nitrous oxide (N2O) is a trace component of Earth\u2019s atmosphere. It is a strong greenhouse gas, whose concentration has been increasing since the industrial revolution, and contributes about 6% to the total greenhouse effect.  N2O is also implicated in ozone depletion in the stratosphere.  The ocean is a net source of N2O to the atmosphere.  N2O is produced and consumed in the ocean by microbes as part of the nitrogen cycle. The conversion of N2O to N2 (dinitrogen gas) is the only known biological sink for N2O and is catalyzed by an enzyme that is strongly inhibited by oxygen, so N2O consumption has been thought to be confined to oxygen-free environments.  Thus, it was surprising to find that the genetic capability for N2O consumption was both present and active in the surface ocean, where oxygen is abundant. Experiments showed that surface ocean microbes rapidly consume N2O when oxygen is removed.  It appears that the microbes can use N2O as an alternative to oxygen for respiration.  Why would it be advantageous to retain this capacity in fully oxygenated surface water?  Does this potential N2O consumption constitute an actual sink for N2O, which might reduce the net transfer of N2O from the ocean to the atmosphere? \r\n\r\nThe reduction of nitrous oxide (N2O) to N2 is considered to be an obligately anaerobic process, usually restricted to anoxic environments in water and sediments.  Previous work showed that the genes (nosZ) encoding the N2O reductase enzyme were both present and expressed in the surface ocean, and that surface ocean samples rapidly reduce N2O to N2 when oxygen is removed.  The nosZ genes in surface waters appear to belong almost exclusively to microbes that do not perform the upstream steps in denitrification \u2013 they are facultative N2O respirers.  The research proposed here will investigate the factors that might control or stimulate N2O reduction in surface waters and characterize the microbes responsible for the process. Experiments will test the hypothesis that N2O respirers are versatile heterotrophs whose activity is related to organic matter supply and possibly associated with particulate material or linked to in situ primary production.  Researchers will perform 15N tracer incubations to measure the rate of N2O reduction and its response to various kinds of organic substrates, including in situ particulate material and fresh phytoplankton exudates. The quantity and community composition of nosZ-containing microbes will be determined using a suite of molecular biological methods \u2013 necessary because the nosZ gene is so diverse that previous methods have likely underestimated both its abundance and diversity and may not have identified the main microbes responsible for the process. Draft genomes of nosZ-containing microbes will be characterized to investigate their carbon metabolism and link their lifestyles to organic matter supply or phytoplankton.  One field expedition is planned to investigate the significance of N2O reduction in the North Atlantic subtropical gyre.  If N2O consumption occurs even at low rates over vast regions of the surface ocean, its impact on the overall N2O budget of the ocean and atmosphere could be large.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
