 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to examine the complex, causal linkages between direct and indirect exposure to compounding climate events (CCE) and youth mental health.  Leveraging a longstanding and successful partnership with Crisis Text Line, a mobile crisis counseling service with over 9 million text conversations since 2016, the research team gains access to a unique dataset on daily help-seeking behavior, which has the potential to provide situational awareness about youth mental health in response to CCEs across the US. This study works to (1) generate a new dataset of CCEs for social science use that integrates multiple CCE types (e.g., drought+wildfire; heatwave+drought); (2) identify geographic regions across the US prone to frequent CCEs; (3) highlight the feasibility of using novel digital data sources like Crisis Text Line for understanding the CCE effects on youth\u2019s mental health; and (4) extend causal inference linking complex CCEs to increased mental health risk in youth, a highly vulnerable population.\r\n\r\nCCE impacts on mental health in young people are an understudied and critical knowledge gap, as climate events are projected to increase in frequency and intensity. The research applies spatial and statistical methods to investigate (1) where and when CCEs occurred in the US and (2) what are the direct and indirect mental health implications of compounding or recurrent climate events. By linking large datasets of climate and help-seeking behavior, the research team also develops new methods to infer causality between CCEs and both direct and indirect mental health and addresses the dual climate and mental health crisis. Findings can advance understanding of the impact of multiple, co-occurring climate stressors on mental health in at-risk youth populations.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
