 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main research goal of this project is to apply analytic tools coming from physics, such as gauge theory and operator algebras, to topology, which is the study of geometric shapes. This research is divided into two themes: low dimensional topology and operator K-theory. In both fields, the aforementioned analytic tools are used to build invariants to study the geometric structure of manifolds, which are spaces modelled on Euclidean spaces, like the 3-dimensional space we live in. In both low dimensional topology and operator K-theory, the PI will use analytic tools to study questions about these spaces, such as how they are curved or how objects can be embedded inside them. These questions have a wide range of applications in biology and physics. The educational and outreach goals of this project involve math and general STEM enrichment programs at the middle and high school levels, with a focus on programs aimed at students from underserved communities and underrepresented groups, as well as mentorship in research at the high school, undergraduate and graduate levels.\r\n\r\nIn low dimensional topology, this project focuses on furthering our understanding of instanton and monopole Floer homologies and their relation to Khovanov homology, and using this to study existence questions of families of metrics with positive scalar curvature on manifolds, as well as questions about knot concordance. Separately this project also involves computationally studying knot concordance, both by a computer search for concordances and by computationally studying certain local equivalence and almost local equivalence groups that receive homomorphisms from the knot concordance groups. In operator algebras, this project focuses on studying their K-theory and its applications to invariants in geometry and topology. The K-theory groups of operator algebras are the targets of index maps of elliptic operators and have important applications to the geometry and topology of manifolds. This project involves studying the K-theory of certain C*-algebras and using them to study infinite dimensional spaces; studying the noncommutative geometry of groups that act on these infinite dimensional spaces and, in particular, the strong Novikov conjecture for these groups; and studying the coarse Baum-Connes conjecture for high dimensional expanders.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
