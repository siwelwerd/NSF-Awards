 "awd_abstract_narration": "Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions significantly contribute to the rise in global temperature. Various scientific reports emphasize the critical need for decarbonization technologies such as carbon capture to mitigate CO2 emissions and combat climate change. However, conventional heat-based carbon capture systems face technical challenges that limit their utility, including high energy requirements and the thermal degradation of absorbent materials. Electrochemical carbon capture (ECC) processes are being developed as an alternative to thermal-based processes. ECC processes are advantageous because they can operate at moderate temperatures and are plug-and-play and modular. ECC processes are also more efficient than similar thermal processes, relying solely on electricity potentially sourced entirely from renewables. This project will develop an innovative ECC process that employs engineered soft interfaces for a scalable, modular, and environmentally sustainable method of CO2 separation. This approach advances carbon capture science and supports the National Science Foundation's mission to promote scientific progress and national health by directly addressing CO2 emission mitigation. The project's educational and outreach initiatives, embedded in the investigator\u2019s Climate Learning Integration in Modern Education model, aim to inspire future STEM generations. These initiatives will be particularly impactful within underrepresented communities because they integrate cutting-edge research into the educational content through project-based learning, fostering a well-informed and environmentally conscious society.\r\n\r\nThe project aims to advance ECC by employing engineered soft interfaces at liquid-liquid interfaces between two immiscible electrolyte solutions. This novel approach addresses current ECC process performance limitations, such as the reliance on costly ion-selective membranes and oxygen gas sensitivity. These engineered interfaces will be developed and optimized for enhanced CO2 separation performance and system energetics. State-of-the-art scanning electrochemical microscopy will assess the interface performance, ensuring precision and innovation in the research methodology. The broader implications of this work extend to various electrochemical applications, including electrochemical-based water treatment and energy storage. Furthermore, integrating this research with STEM education through novel educational modules offers an effective platform for knowledge dissemination and student engagement in climate change solutions. Specifically, undergraduate pre-service STEM teachers will participate in the research through project-based learning techniques, which can inform the development of their curricula. This comprehensive approach highlights the project's potential to significantly contribute to our scientific understanding of ECCs and their capabilities in combating climate change.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
