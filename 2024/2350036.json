 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will develop novel pedagogies based around use of storytelling visualizations to teach data privacy. As society is adopting data-driven decision making across many aspects of life, there is growing concern regarding the privacy and security of data collected for these purposes and an increasing need for a STEM workforce that is well-versed in privacy protection. There are significant opportunities to make privacy education more accessible to a broader population via the use of technology enhanced learning tools and curriculum. Specifically, the use of storytelling and interactive visualizations have been shown to inspire engagement with content, creative thinking, and a deeper understanding of the subject matter. The goal of this project is to develop these artifacts, deploy them in classrooms, and assess their impact on student learning outcomes as well as instructor educational practices. This project will analyze collected data to create a novel pedagogical framework for privacy education based around the implementation of storytelling visualization techniques.\r\n\r\nThe project has two primary objectives: (1) It will develop a novel plugin for the Common Online Data Analysis Platform (CODAP), a widely used platform for teaching STEM and data science topics using visualizations. The plugin will support visualization of data privacy concepts for teaching and create a set of associated learning modules that can be integrated into privacy curriculums. (2) Both the plugin and the findings will be integrated into empirically driven pedagogical practices for teaching data privacy using a storytelling visualization approach.  In addition to making all learning modules, artifacts, and research findings public, the project team will conduct training workshops and provide ongoing support to help other instructors adopt the plugin and learning modules as well as create new modules. The team will work towards building an active community of instructors around visualization-based privacy teaching.  \r\n\r\nThis project is supported by the Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace (SaTC) program, which funds proposals that address cybersecurity and privacy, and in this case, cybersecurity education. The SaTC program aligns with the Federal Cybersecurity Research and Development Strategic Plan and the National Privacy Research Strategy to protect and preserve the growing social and economic benefits of cyber systems while ensuring security and privacy.  Support is also provided by the Improving Undergraduate STEM Education (IUSE:EDU) program.  The IUSE:EDU program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
