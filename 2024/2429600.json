 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact of this I-Corps project is based on the development of electrostatic actuation technology for space satellite applications. This technology enables dynamic re-shaping of membrane reflectors for satellite applications on-orbit. This capability has the potential to expand flexibility in commercial satellite communications from geostationary orbit to cover different geographic areas, by allowing repurposing of existing satellites. The ability to reshape the reflector on-orbit allows for large reflectors with unprecedented surface precision to be used for innovative atmospheric radar instruments and improved weather monitoring from space. This technology could enable longer-range and more precise forecasting of tropical cyclones, helping protect coastal communities from storms.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. The solution is based on the development of electrostatic actuation of membrane reflectors for satellite applications. The research builds on a concept originally proposed in the 1980s for membrane reflectors, where a command surface of electrodes parallel to the controlled reflector surface is used to apply a bias voltage across the gap. The coulomb force is used to pull the flexible membrane into a dished reflector shape, and the voltage applied to each electrode can be controlled to change the focal length or steer and shape the reflector beam. Current versions of membrane reflectors for satellite applications are largely passive, and thus limited in flexibility. However, electrostatic actuation allows active beam steering and focal length shifting as well as surface control. This innovation enables electrostatic actuation integration into existing designs to expand the capabilities of membrane reflectors for satellites.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
