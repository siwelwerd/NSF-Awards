 "awd_abstract_narration": "This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award to Rice University will advance the interdisciplinary field of cavity quantum electrodynamics (C-QED). C-QED integrates principles from quantum mechanics, photonics and materials science to explore and harness the unique interactions between light and matter enabled by micro- or nanoscopic cavities. The program will prepare a new generation of scientists and engineers to tackle complex problems, bridging fundamental research and applications based on quantum optical systems. The training program addresses a crucial need for highly skilled STEM professionals capable of leading innovations in quantum technologies. By providing interdisciplinary training to 150 graduate students, including 30 funded trainees from diverse fields across physics, materials science, and electrical engineering, this program will foster a comprehensive education for academic and industrial career opportunities. The traineeship aims to develop a versatile and diverse workforce equipped to drive advancements in quantum electrodynamics, including secure quantum communication, quantum materials, and nanoengineered photonic technologies, contributing to national security and economic competitiveness.\r\n\r\nThe NRT program will implement a robust, integrative educational model combining coursework, hands-on research, and professional development. Central to this program is the 2:1:1 co-advisory model, pairing each trainee with two faculty mentors from different disciplines in Natural Sciences and Engineering. This structure promotes interdisciplinary collaboration and broad exposure to complementary research. The curriculum is tailored to include fundamental education (e.g., \u2018Introduction to Quantum Information Science and Engineering\u2019) and specialized courses (e.g., \u2018Quantum Engineering of Nanomaterials for Energy Harvesting\u2019) to provide students with thorough and far-reaching formative training. Research projects will be developed through a \u2018problem-first\u2019 approach where open questions are identified, and research challenges are tackled with a problem-solving mindset. The method is consistent with professional careers even beyond academia, where defined goals typically set the agenda for the work of scientists and engineers. To facilitate the students\u2019 affiliation process, trainees will engage in rotational research groups, providing exposure to multiple research environments and helping them make informed decisions about their thesis topics. The program also includes extensive professional development components, including workshops in communication, leadership, and industry internships, ensuring that trainees are well-prepared for diverse career paths. By integrating research, education, and personal development, the program aims to educate graduates capable of making significant contributions to both academia and industry, ultimately driving innovation and technological advancement in the field of quantum science and engineering.\r\n\r\nThe NSF Research Traineeship (NRT) Program is designed to encourage the development and implementation of bold, new potentially transformative models for STEM graduate education training. The program is dedicated to effective training of STEM graduate students in high priority interdisciplinary or convergent research areas through comprehensive traineeship models that are innovative, evidence-based, and aligned with changing workforce and research needs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
