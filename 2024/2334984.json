 "awd_abstract_narration": "Work in the field of genetics often intersects with complex issues that inspire significant public interest and concern. However, the legacy of historical practices and priorities in the field of genetics informs current public perceptions of genetics researchers and the application of genetics in society. This legacy can also perpetuate feelings of alienation and exclusion in the genetics discipline among people of marginalized and backgrounds. Professional scientific societies are well positioned to support processes for needed cultural change within their disciplines and between their disciplines and society. Science communication and engagement are increasingly recognized as key elements of professional development for scientists at all stages of their careers, which in turn can positively impact perceptions of science and of scientists in the public sphere. By leveraging the unique role of professional scientific societies, this collaborative pilot project will examine the role of public engagement in building a more diverse, inclusive, and equitable culture in the field of genetics, and establishing a more reciprocal and engaged relationship between the field of genetics and diverse segments of society. The project will evaluate the impacts of a genetics society in bringing visibility and credibility to public engagement; creating opportunities for training, networking, and participation in this work; and developing a community of practice to support evidence-based activities that are centered on humanity, humility, and respect.\r\n\r\nThis is a two-year pilot project that brings together the Personal Genetics Education Project (PGED) of Harvard Medical School, the Genetics Society of America (GSA), the ReclaimingSTEM Institute, and a diverse advisory board. The project has three specific aims. Aim 1 is to co-create and pilot a program that provides resources and strategies for public engagement with science to genetics researchers. Consisting of 7 webinars, 2 workshops, and a symposium, the program will build awareness of the historical and current social impacts of genetics research and increase interest in and build skills around inclusive public engagement. Aim 2 is to establish a community of practice for genetics engagement to share knowledge, build relationships, and identify a shared vision for future efforts. Aim 3 is to generate a specific, actionable strategy for applying pilot program lessons, experiences, and perspectives in a multi-year effort to support cultural changes within and beyond the genetics field. An external evaluator will provide iterative evaluation throughout the project timeline to examine the project\u2019s impact on participating genetics researchers and the nascent community of practice, as well as to track the creation of a longer-term strategic plan.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
