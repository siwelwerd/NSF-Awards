 "awd_abstract_narration": "This BIORETS Site award to the Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center, located in New Orleans, Louisiana, will support the training of 10 teachers for six weeks during the summer and two weeks during the academic year. Three cohorts of teachers will be recruited from 2024 to 2026. Advanced biology is constantly evolving; therefore, it is essential for instructors to strengthen their STEM literacy in current genetic topics and technologies, to prepare future generations of high school graduates. During the summer, teacher participants in the GeneBIORETS Program will gain first-hand genetics research experience and obtain materials for classroom implementation. LSUHSC researchers will visit classrooms and provide assistance during the academic year. Project outcomes will be assessed through classroom implementation of curricula, and formative and summative assessments will be conducted by an external evaluator. To ensure the advancement of DEI goals, special emphasis will be placed on teachers who serve schools with large populations of students underrepresented in STEM fields. \r\n\r\nThe goals of the GeneBIORETS Program are for teachers to receive first-hand research experience in genetics and genomics, develop collaborations with colleagues and researchers, and receive training that will impact how they impart science education in their classrooms, ultimately inspiring diverse students to pursue and excel in STEM professions. Activities include 1.) conducting genetics research under faculty supervision, 2.) enhancing genetics curricular material, 3.) receiving instruction on research topics (i.e., responsible conduct in research), 4.) networking, and 5.) procuring resources to include science instruction for students of diverse educational needs (e.g., English Language Learners and those with hearing loss/utilizing assistive communication technology). Research includes computer-based (i.e., bioinformatics) or wet-lab (e.g., gene expression, cell proliferation) projects, and curriculum enhancement/professional development for classroom implementation utilizes didactic modules, videos, online quizzes, and STEM career-oriented reference materials. Teachers may apply via NSF ETAP (Education and Training Application). Admissions are based on recommendations from school administrators and personal statements demonstrating a motivation for research and enhancing curriculum. This award is jointly supported by the Division of Biological Infrastructure (DBI) in the Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) program in the Office of Integrative Activities (OIA). More information about the program is available by visiting https://www.medschool.lsuhsc.edu/genetics/genebiorets.aspx, or by contacting the PI (Dr. Fern Tsien at fmille@lsuhsc.edu) or the Co-PI (Dr. Kelly Jean Sherman at ksherm@lsuhsc.edu).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
