 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to synthesize existing tree-ring proxy data (ring width, stable oxygen isotope ratios, blue light intensity, and gridded Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) estimates) to create a seasonal-resolution paleo-streamflow reconstruction for Southeast Asia. The investigators will compare the reconstruction to paleo-streamflow estimates generated by forcing a Southeast Asia hydrological model with Paleoclimate Modelling Intercomparison Project Phase 4 (PMIP4) hydroclimate variables for the last millennium. The comparisons will include assessment of variability in modeled streamflow and comparison of dominant modes and spatial/temporal coherency of variability in the proxies and models. These analyses seek to illuminate the mechanisms that drive the observed dynamics.\r\n \r\nThe project includes support of two early career researchers from underrepresented groups, a graduate student and plans to include undergraduates in the research, development of an interactive public-facing web application with educational materials, and visualization of streamflow through space and time as part of an effort to help create more effective water management strategies for a densely populated region.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
