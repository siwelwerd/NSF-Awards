 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the increased sophistication of research workflows, it is essential for researchers to be well-versed in both domain-specific methods, and cross-cutting cyberinfrastructure (CI) technologies. While advanced CI holds tremendous potential to advance research, its success ultimately relies on the ability of researchers to effectively utilize these technologies to analyze data and gain new insights. Leveraging Texas A&M High Performance Research Computing\u2019s recognized researcher-training programs and strengths in AI/ML- enabled research, PACES, Providing Accelerated Cybertraining for Emerging Scientists, will serve as a novel regional CI-centric researcher training avenue that focuses on researchers at emerging research institutions. PACES will offer researchers with training opportunities to (i) familiarize themselves with CI, and (ii) use CI to advance CI in their respective fields of science. With a focus on supporting researchers at Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs), PACES will help establish CI training programs at community colleges, emerging research institutions, and Tribal Colleges. \r\n\r\nPACES will offer asynchronous and live training for researchers at emerging institutions partnering with Texas A&M University. PACS will offer 2 levels of training to researchers who are keen to apply AI and data science approaches on advanced computing resources in their scientific fields. The first level is for researchers  from all disciplines who are keen to develop skills and need to  use advanced CI. The second level offers specialized training and consulting for researchers who are keen to address key challenges in the fields of natural hazards,  chemical and materials design, genomics, geological sciences, and economics. Monthly virtual training sessions and asynchronous web-based training resources will support both tracks. Annual workshops along the introductory (2 days) and advanced track (5 days) will be offered.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
