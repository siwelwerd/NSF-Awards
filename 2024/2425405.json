 "awd_abstract_narration": "Artificial Intelligence (AI), Research Computing and Training (ART@SC24) is a workshop for advanced cyberinfrastructure (CI) professionals who support research computing on their campuses and conduct outreach in rural K-20 education environments. The workshop explores the benefits and risks associated with AI in academia, and share strategies to protect data privacy, security, and sovereignty. \r\n\r\nART@SC24 will convene in Atlanta, Georgia November 15-16, ahead of the Supercomputing Conference, SC24, November 17-22. This will be the sixth in a series of SC co-located workshops or events that STEM-Trek Nonprofit has hosted since 2015. This year, the workshop is teaming up with Texas A&M University High Performance Research Computing (HPRC) to explore the benefits and pitfalls of AI, and the complexities associated with AI/ML workflows. Travel grants and registration waivers will be available for a limited number. The SC24 General Chair has donated 18 full tech program registration waivers (with workshops and tutorials), a room for the meetings, and audiovisual support. Through HPRC, the grant will cover participant costs for U.S. delegates. Donations to STEM-Trek will support international delegate participation. This workshop series welcomes applications from NSF ACCESS and other Campus Champions from EPSCoR states and territories; CI professionals from rural-serving schools were especially encouraged to apply.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
