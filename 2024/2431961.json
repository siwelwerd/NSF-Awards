 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project, MITRE collaborates with Northeastern University, University of Colorado Boulder, University of Utah, and the SETI Institute to conduct long-duration dynamic spectrum sharing experimentation as the Engineering and Execution Lead (EEL) for the NSF National Radio Dynamic Zones (SII-NRDZ) program. Dynamic spectrum sharing is adaptive coexistence using techniques that enable multiple electromagnetic spectrum users to operate on the same frequencies in the same geographic area without causing harmful interference to other users. Dynamic spectrum sharing is essential to sustain the benefits of spectrum access for many sectors of society, including faster communications, new astronomical and scientific discoveries, more energy-efficient cities, increased highway capacity and safety, and more accurate weather predictions. The MITRE-led team, called SPARKIE, advances the use of spectrum sharing through maturing software solutions and conducting field experiment campaigns that generate scientific data and build stakeholder trust, and through releasing reusable spectrum sharing software. SPARKIE team activities also provide hands-on training, curriculum development, and recorded online content to expand the cadre of future spectrum managers, engineers and scientists in the spectrum field.\r\n\r\nInitial experimental campaigns use the Open Zone Management System (OpenZMS) software package from the University of Utah to manage dynamic spectrum sharing. The initial experimental campaigns include experiments at a radio astronomy facility, the Hat Creek Radio Observatory (HCRO) in California, for spectrum sharing with nearby 900 MHz ISM band smart utility meters; and at a facility for experimentation on advanced communications systems, the Platform for Open Wireless Data-driven Experimental Research (POWDER) in Salt Lake City, Utah, for spectrum sharing with nearby 5G cellular systems operating in the 3.55-3.70 GHz Citizens Broadband Radio Service band. Risk of the initial experimental campaigns is reduced by pre-deployment experiments in a digital twin that utilizes the Colosseum testbed of Northeastern University. Data from the initial campaigns informs selection of a zone management system solution and sites and applications for subsequent capstone experiments. The capstone experiments are planned to last at least four months of continuous spectrum sharing, demonstrating prevention of harmful interference while enhancing spectrum access for facility operations through sharing spectrum between the facilities and nearby users. Other outcomes from the project include a toolkit for building zone management systems, a cloud-based service for safe field tests of zone management systems, contributions to the Dynamic Sharing System Testbed specified in the 2023 National Spectrum Strategy, and initial definition of an envisioned future National Radio Dynamic Zone.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
