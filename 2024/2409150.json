 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMP) program assists universities and colleges in their efforts to significantly increase the numbers of students matriculating into and successfully completing high quality degree programs in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) disciplines in order to diversify the STEM workforce and supports the production of scholarly research in STEM broadening participation. Particular emphasis is placed on transforming undergraduate STEM education through innovative, evidence-based recruitment and retention strategies, and relevant educational experiences in support of racial and ethnic groups historically underrepresented in STEM disciplines: Blacks and African Americans, Hispanic and Latino Americans, American Indians, Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians, and Native Pacific Islanders. These strategies facilitate the production of highly competitive students motivated to pursue graduate education or careers in STEM. For the United States (U.S.) to remain globally competitive, it is vital that it taps into the talent of all its citizens and provides exceptional educational preparedness in STEM areas that underpin the knowledge-based economy.\r\n\r\nThis project develops a new alliance, Aligning STEM Trainees for Enterprising Research (ASTER), in eastern Kansas and Nebraska. ASTER LSAMP is composed of six institutions: University of Kansas, Pittsburg State University, University of Nebraska, Johnson County Community College, Kansas City Kansas Community College, and Southeast Community College. The alliance will develop pathways between the three 2-year community colleges and three 4-year universities to facilitate undergraduate research activities, matriculation of underrepresented minority students, and better prepare students for careers in academia, industry, and government. ASTER LSAMP goals include increasing the proportion of STEM students who 1) transfer to partnering 4-year institutions, 2) matriculate into their second and third undergraduate year, 3) graduate with STEM bachelor\u2019s degrees, and 4) earn a graduate degree. ASTER LSAMP will use evidence-based high impact educational practices including monthly professional development, involvement with research activities, conference attendance, peer mentorship, study groups, and summer internships to meet these goals. Students will be paired with faculty mentors who have participated in cultural humility training and understand evidence-based mentorship practices for diverse students. Participating students will gain professional, academic, and social skills to prepare them for coursework and post-graduate career success. ASTER LSAMP will contribute to the development of STEM talent in Kansas and Nebraska.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
