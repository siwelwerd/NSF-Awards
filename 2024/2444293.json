 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will coordinate a research conference between the United States (US) and Japan to promote Open Access and Research Data Management (RDM). Although Public Access, the free availability of federally funded scholarly materials to the public, has long been supported by librarians, librarians in the California State University System (CSUs) have also provided social and technical support for the principles and practices of Open Access as adopted by their research and publishing communities. The purpose of this proposal is to further socio-technical understanding by building capacity among the CSUs to explore and advance our readiness in supporting RDM. This is in response to the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) Memorandum on \u201cEnsuring Free, Immediate, and Equitable Access to Federally Funded Research and the Desirable Characteristics of Data Repositories for Federally Funded Research\u201d. Two US-Japan workshops and supporting meetings will be held to explore a sustainable RDM platform for open data from an international perspective. This conference proposal would generate research findings and deliverables comprising early- stage exploratory workshops and supporting meetings in California and Japan. The methods would comprise analysis, community planning, and leveraging knowledge on existing RDM cyberinfrastructure between the CSUs and Japan\u2019s National Institute of Informatics (NII).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
