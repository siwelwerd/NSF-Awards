 "awd_abstract_narration": "The CombinaTexas 2024 conference will be held at Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, on March 23-24, 2024. The conference will feature five fifty-minute plenary lectures and a number of contributed talks in various areas of Combinatorics and Graph Theory. The aim of the CombinaTexas series is to enhance communication among mathematicians in Texas and surrounding states, promote research activities of the local combinatorics community, and provide a platform for the presentation and discussion of the latest developments in the broad field of combinatorics. Ever since Texas A&M University hosted the first conference in 2000, it has been held almost every year at an institution in the South Central United States. CombinaTexas 2024 is the 20th conference in this series. The CombinaTexas conference series will be continuously held in 2025 and 2026 supported by this award.\r\n\r\nThe topics of the CombinaTexas Series include all branches of Combinatorics, Graph Theory, and their connections to Algebra, Geometry, Probability Theory, and Computer Science. In 2024 the confirmed plenary speakers are Boris Bukh (Carnegie Mellon University), Sam Hopkins (Howard University), Jeremy Martin (University of Kansas), Jessica Striker (North Dakota State University), and Fan Wei (Duke University). They will cover topics in Algebraic Combinatorics, Extremal Combinatorics, Discrete Geometry, Graph Theory and their interaction with Algebraic Geometry, Commutative Algebra, and Computer Science. About 70 participants are anticipated, with an estimated 20 contributed talks in parallel sessions. More information about the conference will be available at the webpage https://www.math.tamu.edu/conferences/combinatexas/\"\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
