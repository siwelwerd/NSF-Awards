 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanism-B (CSDM-B) program, Professor Jayaraman Sivaguru and his group at Bowling Green State University aim to discover new and productive photochemical pathways which result from the selective modification of chemical structure. These new photoreactions are designed to have applications in sustainable chemical synthesis.  Photochemistry is the science of chemical reactions that are initiated by light, and which proceed through highly energetic excited states. The proposed investigations will enable training of students in concepts related to photochemistry, photophysics and  physical organic chemistry and intellectually impact their understanding related to synthesis, nanoscience, and materials science. This research program integrates scientific research with educational training and outreach through engagement and collaboration. Professor Sivaguru and his team will continue to engage in a myriad of outreach activities that go beyond academics and scientific training. These outreach activities include the PICNICS (Parents Involvement with Children, Nurturing Intellectual Curiosity in Science) program, and engaging the community through the Saturday Seminar Series that has both national and international reach. The PICNICS program is conducted in collaboration with northwest Ohio high schools, engaging high school students through summer internships to positively influence their undergraduate career path.\r\n\r\nThis project aspires to foster creativity by uncovering new photochemical reactions. This will be done by channeling excited state reactivity through the exploitation of photochemical principles to (i) uncover novel reactivity that is unique to photoreactions; (ii) employ modern photochemical/photophysical tools to in an effort to develop comprehensive knowledge about excited state processes; and (iii) explore the importance of dynamics and lifetimes of excited states, as well as the stability of transient intermediates.  Structural modification is designed to uncover new photoreactivity, achieve regio-, stereo- and chemoselectivity and lead to a more comprehensive mechanistic model. All the above strategies seek to unearth new excited state pathways/reactivity are grounded in well- established photochemical principles. Realizing the full potential of the proposed strategies rely on juxtaposing the delicate balance between dynamics and lifetimes of the excited states with molecular features that transpire as photochemical control of reactivity.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
