 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recognizing the importance of providing innovative ways to support access to learning opportunities and resources in electro-mechanics (ELM), Wor-Wic Community College, in partnership with industry, will develop and offer stackable micro-credentials and a flexible laboratory to augment its associate of science in ELM (AAS ELM) degree program. Drawing on the DACUM (Developing a Curriculum) Occupational Analysis process and responding to student and industry needs, this initiative will provide on- and off-ramps for students needing short-term education options and learning opportunities for entry and advancement in ELM fields. To support the micro-credential initiative, the project aims to increase accessibility through the implementation of a flexible laboratory model and to foster diversity within the technician workforce through recruitment and retention strategies. The inclusion of professional development and industry certification for Wor-Wic's ELM faculty will enhance the institution's capacity and capability to provide high quality industry essential training in electro-mechanics and establish Wor-Wic Community College as an authorized training center. To ensure that the micro-credentials encompass and prioritize the needs of local employers, a subcommittee composed of industry representatives and the principal investigator from the NSF ATE-funded Technology and Information in Manufacturing and Engineering (TIME) Center will provide guidance in identifying the tasks required by technicians at various levels (entry to expert/lead technician). \r\n \r\nWith strong industry ties, the overarching goal of the project is the development of industry driven micro-credentials within the (AAS ELM) program, providing improved access to students and incumbent workers on Maryland\u2019s Lower Eastern Shore. The goals of the project are to (1) establish employer-recognized and supported micro-credentials within this AAS ELM program to serve as on- and off-ramps and milestones for achievement; (2) increase accessibility to the AAS ELM program to meet industry need; (3) provide professional development opportunities for faculty to foster high-quality instruction and earn designation as a MSSC (Manufacturing Skill Standards Council) and FANUC (Fuji Automatic Numerical Control) authorized training and certification center; and (4) grow the technician workforce in the region through the recruitment and retention of a diverse student population.  The mixed methods evaluation will advance knowledge about an innovative approach to the development and implementation of high-quality educational opportunities and will serve as a model for investment in future technician education programs serving the electromechanical industry.  This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced technology fields that drive the Nation's economy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
