 "awd_abstract_narration": "This National Science Foundation Innovations of Graduate Education (IGE) project at the University of Kentucky will enhance mining engineering graduate programs by integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) knowledge and skills. The project aims to address fundamental issues such as data analytics, machine learning, and generative AI in the mining industry by creating a new course titled \"Applications of Artificial Intelligence in the Mining Industry\" and significantly modifying an existing course on \"Mine Automation.\" These courses will cover critical AI applications, such as data collection, predictive analytics, safety and risk management, and ethical considerations in AI. By collaborating with leading mining companies and academic institutions, this initiative seeks to bridge the gap between AI advancements and mining education, ensuring graduates are well-equipped to tackle modern challenges in mining operations. This project will contribute to the scientific knowledge base and societal well-being by fostering innovation and promoting sustainable mining practices. \r\n\r\nThe hypothesis driving this project is that integrating AI-focused coursework into the mining engineering curriculum will enhance students' problem-solving abilities and adaptability to technological advancements in mining operations. The project seeks to align educational content with the practical, technological, and innovative demands of the industry, ensuring graduates are well-prepared to enter and excel in the workforce. The project's first step involves conducting a comprehensive analysis of current and emerging AI technologies impacting the mining industry through stakeholder engagement via a detailed questionnaire. This questionnaire will gather insights on AI applications, required competencies, and curriculum gaps, ensuring a diverse range of perspectives. With these insights, a flexible and comprehensive curriculum framework will be developed, covering essential AI elements from foundational concepts to advanced applications. This framework will guide the design of the syllabi for the proposed courses, balancing theoretical knowledge with practical applications. Each course will emphasize project-based learning and interdisciplinary collaboration, ensuring students gain hands-on experience with AI tools and technologies relevant to mining. A robust assessment plan will incorporate continuous feedback from academic and industry advisory boards. Semi-annual reviews will ensure the curriculum remains dynamic and responsive to technological advancements and industry needs. By aligning the educational experience with practical demands and evolving technologies, this initiative aims to prepare graduates to lead and innovate in the AI-enhanced mining sector. \r\n\r\nThe Innovations in Graduate Education (IGE) program is focused on research in graduate education. The goals of IGE are to pilot, test and validate innovative approaches to graduate education and to generate the knowledge required to move these approaches into the broader community.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
