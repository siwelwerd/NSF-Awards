 "awd_abstract_narration": "The three-year Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site: Multidisciplinary Approaches for Overcoming Water Resources and Sustainable Engineering Challenges in Appalachian Regions is hosted by the University of Kentucky. There is a long history of water resource and resilient infrastructure disparities among rural, low income, and minority-dominant communities, including in Appalachia. Educating a multidisciplinary workforce focused on water resources and sustainable engineering will support the development of innovative water networks, restoration of degraded ecosystems, and expansion of local food systems in the Appalachian region. This REU site will offer research experiences to ten undergraduate students each year. Recruiting efforts will focus on a student cohort where at least 60% of participants come from institutions with limited research opportunities and at least 40% are first-generation college students. Participants will experience first-hand issues about water resources and sustainable engineering challenges facing the Appalachian region. The project will promote and sustain undergraduate student interest in persisting in a STEM field and pursuing graduate education. Ten student participants will interact with faculty and graduate student mentors as well as professional engineers and natural resource practitioners in industry, consulting, nonprofit, and government sectors through research, professional development, and social activities.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe three-year Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site: Multidisciplinary Approaches for Overcoming Water Resources and Sustainable Engineering Challenges in Appalachian Regions is hosted by the University of Kentucky. The objectives of this REU site are to: 1) offer research experiences to undergraduate students where at least 60% of participants come from institutions with limited research opportunities and at least 40% are first-generation college students; 2) provide participants first-hand experiences about water resources and sustainable engineering challenges facing the Appalachian region through research and professional development opportunities; and 3) promote and sustain undergraduate student interest in persisting in a STEM field and pursuing graduate education. Ten undergraduates per year will conduct fundamental research with faculty mentors and interact with industry, consulting, nonprofit, and government partners. In addition, the project offers a series of communication development opportunities to share new knowledge, including presenting to local partners and peers, writing conference papers, preparing formal poster presentations, and conducting outreach to K-12 students. The student cohort will interact with faculty and graduate student mentors as well as professional engineers and natural resource practitioners through research, professional development, and social activities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
