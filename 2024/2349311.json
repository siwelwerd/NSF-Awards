 "awd_abstract_narration": "This REU Site award to Binghamton University, located in Binghamton, NY, will support the training of 10 students for 10 weeks during the summers of 2025-2027. The focus of this REU is to provide a collaborative research experience in the area of microbial biofilms. It is anticipated that a total of 30 students, primarily from schools with limited research opportunities, will be trained during the 3-year program. Students will learn how research is conducted, and many will present the results of their work at scientific conferences. The broad objective of this program is to provide high-quality, well-mentored research opportunities to students early in their college careers so that they have sufficient time to pursue their projects, build scientific and professional skills, and prepare to be competitive in STEM careers. Assessment of the program will be done through an online tool, and students will be tracked after the program to determine their career paths.\r\n\r\nStudent projects will be organized around three main areas: environmental biofilms in the built and natural environment, biofilms and engineered systems, and basic microbiological mechanisms for biofilm control. Faculty from the Departments of Biological Sciences, Chemistry, Biomedical Engineering, and Mechanical Engineering will serve as faculty mentors. Students will participate in a collaborative and multi-mentored research project in one of these main areas. Additionally, students will participate in professional development and scientific communication workshops, lab safety, responsible and ethical conduct of research, and microbiology training. Students will present their research at an end of summer poster session with other REU and undergraduate summer research programs on campus. Housing, stipend, meals, and travel allowances will be provided. Students will apply using the NSF ETAP website and they will be selected via a holistic review process.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
