 "awd_abstract_narration": "This workshop will convene experts from academia, industry, and government to explore the transformative potential of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) in hardware design. The workshop will be co-located with the 57th International Symposium on Microarchitecture (MICRO), sponsored by the Association for Computing Machinery and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, a premier forum for disseminating research in the fields of architecture, compilers, chips, and systems. Scheduled as a one-day event, it will feature keynote speeches, invited talks, a panel, and roundtable discussions, focusing on how generative AI can revolutionize hardware design and how advancements in hardware can enhance AI capabilities. The event will bring together researchers with diverse backgrounds to ensure a rich and inclusive exchange of ideas. It aims to foster collaborative research across disciplines, identify new research opportunities, and address challenges at the intersection of AI and hardware. This initiative supports the NSF's mission to promote the progress of science, advance national health, prosperity, and welfare, and secure the national defense.\r\n\r\nGenerative AI has the potential to significantly accelerate the design and optimization of computer architectures, enabling rapid prototyping and verification of innovative hardware solutions. Despite its potential, the development of AI-integrated hardware solutions faces substantial challenges due to the need for interdisciplinary knowledge spanning machine learning, systems engineering, and computer architecture. This workshop will address these challenges by bringing together leading experts to share insights, foster innovation, and discuss cutting-edge research. The workshop will highlight the reciprocal impact of generative AI and hardware design, where advancements in one area significantly enhance the other. Leveraging recent breakthroughs in generative AI, the workshop will explore how innovative hardware design can subsequently advance AI capabilities, promoting faster and more energy-efficient hardware systems that intuitively adapt to AI demands.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
