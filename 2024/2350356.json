 "awd_abstract_narration": "Observations of solitary waves that maintain their shape and velocity during their propagation were recorded around 200 years ago. First by Bidone in Turin in 1826, and then famously by Russell in 1834 who followed a hump of water moving at constant speed along a channel for several miles. Today these objects are known as solitons. Lying at the intersection of mathematics and physics, they have been studied rigorously since the 1960s. For completely integrable wave equations, many properties of solitons are known, such as their elastic collisions, their stability properties, as well as their role as building blocks in the long-time description of waves. The latter is particularly important, as it for example predicts how waves carrying information decompose into quantifiable units. In quantum physics, quantum chemistry, and material science, these mathematical tools allow for a better understanding of the movement of electrons in various media. This project aims to develop the mathematical foundations which support these areas in applied science, which are of great importance to industry and society at large. The project provides research training opportunities for graduate students.\r\n\r\nThe project\u2019s goal is to establish both new results and new techniques in nonlinear evolution partial differential equations on the one hand, and the spectral theory of disordered systems on the other hand. The long-range scattering theory developed by Luhrmann and the Principal Investigator (PI) achieved the first results on potentials which exhibit a threshold resonance in the context of topological solitons. This work is motivated by the fundamental question about asymptotic kink stability for the phi-4 model. Asymptotic stability of Ginzburg-Landau vortices in their own equivariance class is not understood. The linearized problem involves a non-selfadjoint matrix operator, and the PI has begun to work on its spectral theory. With collaborators, the PI will engage on research on bubbling for the harmonic map heat flow and attempt to combine the recent paper on continuous-in-time bubbling with a suitable modulation theory. The third area relevant to this project is the spectral theory of disordered systems. More specifically, the PI will continue his work on quasiperiodic symplectic cocycles which arise in several models in condensed matter physics such as in graphene and on non-perturbative methods to analyze them.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
