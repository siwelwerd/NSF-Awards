 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support the Underrepresented Students in Topology and Algebra Research Symposium (USTARS). A goal of this conference is to highlight research being conducted by underrepresented students in the areas of algebra and topology. At this unique meeting, attendees are exposed to a greater variety of current research, ideas, and results in their areas of study and beyond. Participants are also given the opportunity to meet and network with underrepresented professors and students who may later become collaborators and colleagues. This is particularly important for students with great academic potential who do not attend top-tier research institutions; students that are often overlooked, despite a strong faculty and graduate student population. Furthermore, USTARS promotes diversity in the mathematical sciences by encouraging women and minorities to attend and give talks. Participants of USTARS continue to influence the next generation of students in positive ways by serving as much needed mentors and encouraging students in the mathematical sciences to advance themselves and participate in research and conference events. USTARS exposes all participants to the research and activities of underrepresented mathematicians, encouraging a more collaborative mathematics community. \r\n\r\nThe Underrepresented Students in Topology and Algebra Research Symposium (USTARS) is a project proposed by a group of underrepresented young mathematicians. The conference organizing committee is diverse in gender, ethnicity, and educational background, and is well-positioned to actively encourage participation by women and minorities. The symposium includes networking sessions along with research presentations. Speakers will give 30-minute parallel research talks. Graduate students will give at least 75% of these presentations. Two distinguished graduate students and one invited faculty member are chosen to give 1-hour presentations and a poster session featuring invited undergraduates is also planned. Additionally, a discussion panel and creative math session will provide networking, guidance, and mentorship opportunities from past USTARS participants that have transitioned to full-time faculty positions. The conference website is https://www.ustars.org/.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
