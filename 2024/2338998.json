 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Hawaiian Islands are one of the most remote archipelagos in the world. Their rich ecosystems and local populations are particularly vulnerable to extreme weather events that can come from any direction and in many forms. Therefore, a deep understanding of the dynamics that regulate the islands\u2019 climate is essential to ensure that the islands remain habitable and sustainable, especially in the face of climate change. In this quest, the knowledge acquired by indigenous people through centuries of observations represents a valuable resource that can enrich the knowledge derived from scientific research. This project aims to combine the quantitative methods of science with the traditional knowledge of the islands\u2019 indigenous communities to provide a holistic understanding of climate variability in Hawai\u02bbi.\r\n\r\nThe project has two interrelated components. The first will use a scientific approach to quantify the impact of large-scale modes of variability, particularly at the intraseasonal scale, on Hawai\u02bbi\u2019s climate and extreme hydrometeorological events. This approach will mainly utilize extensive high-resolution data collected on the islands and state-of-the-art numerical models. The second component of the project will draw on the knowledge of the indigenous people of Hawai\u02bbi to develop educational and outreach materials. These will include an undergraduate course that uses place-based methods to teach about atmospheric convection and severe weather, a culturally centered online guide to Hawaiian weather, and a series of conferences that will bring together scientists, stakeholders, cultural practitioners, and the general population of the islands to discuss issues relevant to Hawai\u02bbi\u2019s climate and water resources.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
