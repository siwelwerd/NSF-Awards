 "awd_abstract_narration": "Despite great strides in personalized assistive devices, it remains challenging to achieve tailored performance in prosthetic devices for below-knee amputations (BKA). Wearable devices often provide a fixed level of assistance that does not adapt to user needs. This CAREER project seeks to innovate by acknowledging the unique movement patterns and sensory needs of individuals with BKA. The project aim is to develop a new form of personalized robotic prosthesis that is capable of adjusting to the individual movement patterns of BKA users to enhance their mobility and overall quality of life. Successful completion of this project will deepen our understanding of human-robot interaction and foster more inclusive technology designs. Additionally, the project integrates educational activities that aim to raise awareness about advanced technology among diverse student groups, including those with limited mobility and those who are underserved in STEM fields. This approach not only promotes inclusive education but also inspires a new generation of STEM professionals, contributing positively to society.\r\n\r\nThe research goal of this CAREER project is to transform the design and application of wearable robots for people with below-knee amputations (BKA) by focusing on personalized assistance that adapts to human changes. The motivation driving this research is that wearable robots, which are continually personalized and co-adaptive to user changes, will greatly improve outcomes for BKA users. The project includes three main studies. The first study will develop and test a personalized robotic prosthesis, using advanced adaptive optimization and biofeedback methods to adjust the device according to each user's specific needs. This personalized approach will allow the prosthesis to adapt in real-time to the user's movements. The second study will develop a coaching strategy using verbal instructions and real-time visual feedback, helping users learn and maintain beneficial movement patterns. This will encourage correct use of the prosthesis and help avoid movements that could cause long-term health problems. The final part of the project will use multi-objective optimization techniques to dynamically adjust the performance of the prosthetic, ensuring it continues to adapt and provide the best assistance. The expected results of this research include significantly improved mobility and quality of life for BKA users and new insights that could benefit a wider range of people with mobility challenges, informing future developments in wearable robotics and assistive technology.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
