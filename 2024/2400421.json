 "awd_abstract_narration": "This conference project provides support for doctoral students to participate in a Doctoral Consortium at a combined national conference of the Educational Data Mining and Learning at Scale professional organizations. The consortium will provide opportunities for the early career scholars (along with the mentors) to explore innovative methods to analyze learning and data about learning, enhance their knowledge and skills related to learning analytics research, and consider the intersection of theory, research, and practice. The overarching goal of the project is to advance knowledge and capacity through exchange of ideas and mentoring of early career researchers exploring the field of learning analytics. The project is part of an effort to nurture the development of expertise across disciplinary boundaries and to support the development of multidisciplinary teams necessary for conducting learning analytics research.\r\n\r\nThis project is supported by NSF\u2019s EDU Core Research (ECR) program. The ECR program emphasizes fundamental STEM education research that generates foundational knowledge in the field. Investments are made in critical areas that are essential, broad, and enduring: STEM learning and STEM learning environments, broadening participation in STEM, and STEM workforce development.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
