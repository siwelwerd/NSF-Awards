 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the TORA mathematics conference series. This series consists of annual meetings hosted by the University of North Texas, Oklahoma State University, and the University of Oklahoma on a rotating basis. This award provides support for three weekend conferences, one at the University of North Texas in Spring 2024 (TORA XIII), one at Oklahoma State University in Spring 2025 (TORA XIV), and another at the University of Oklahoma in Spring 2026 (TORA XV). Each conference will feature three prominent guest speakers from outside the Texas-Oklahoma region, in addition to other participants including students, post-doctoral researchers, and junior faculty. Regional graduate students and researchers will also give talks describing their work. These conferences will facilitate collaborations and interactions among the students and researchers in the region who work in the areas of Automorphic Forms, Representation Theory, and Number Theory.\r\n\r\nOver the last century, the theories of automorphic forms and representations have grown enormously. Important applications impact various fields of research, ranging from number theory, coding theory, algebraic geometry, and topology to Kac-Moody algebras and quantum field theory. The interplay of automorphic forms and representation theory has been especially fruitful, and many surprising and deep results have emerged. The TORA conference series will emphasize the interplay between automorphic forms and representations, both in the classical and adelic languages, and related topics like analytic number theory and harmonic analysis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe conference Texas-Oklahoma Representations and Automorphic forms XIII will take place on April 12-14, 2024, at the University of North Texas. Additional information can be found on the conference website: https://www.math.unt.edu/~richter/TORA/TORA13.html\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
