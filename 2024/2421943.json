 "awd_abstract_narration": "This conference award is to provide travel support for participating students to American Society for Composites (ASC) 39th Annual Technical Conference; San Diego, California; 21-23 October 2024. ASC conference is an annual event gathering researchers in composites since 1986. The funds will be used to broaden the participation of students by reducing their overall registration fee (about 160 students) and to provide travel awards for students from underrepresented groups in STEM (about 30 students) to attend ASC 2024. The funds will also be used to develop community building and professional development activities that include workshops, training sessions, and campus visits for these students. This award will provide unique opportunities for underrepresented students in STEM from US institutions of higher education to i) engage with researchers from academia, industry, and governmental research organizations related to advanced composite materials and structures, ii) create a network of young student researchers that can establish future partnerships and leadership nationwide, and iii) advance scientific knowledge in mechanics of composite materials and their advanced manufacturing.\r\n\r\nThe grant will provide unique opportunities for historically underrepresented students in STEM to attend the 39th ASC Annual Technical Conference, the premier venue for the dissemination of fundamental research and technology advancements in the composites field in the United States. Their participation in this event will not only increase the diversity of the field, but it will also promote their retention in the engineering workforce. The conference organizing committee, including the PI, is comprised of members from historically underrepresented groups who are particularly interested in and uniquely well-positioned to mentor students from the same backgrounds.\r\n\r\nThis project is jointly supported by the Mechanics of Materials and Structures (MoMS) program and the Advanced Manufacturing (AM) program.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This project focused on completing the following tasks: (1) lowering conference registration fees for all eligible students, (2) distributing 30 travel grants to broaden student participation at the conference, and (3) developing professional development and community-building events to maximize students' conference experience. The success of this project was measured by the demographics of the student participants and the short-term effects, which were assessed based on participant perceptions.</p>\r\n<p>We report that a total of 154 students attended the ASC 39th&nbsp;conference, accounting for 38% of all attendees. This represents a 15% increase from the student participation at the 29th&nbsp;ASC conference held in San Diego in 2014, despite the rising travel and lodging costs of recent years. Notably, approximately 70% of these students were first-time attendees, aligning with our goal of broadening the participation of students in the conference.</p>\r\n<p>The travel award was well received in the composite materials community. A total of 75 eligible applications were received from multiple universities in the country, representing students at various academic levels, from undergraduates to Ph.D. candidates. The 30 selected awardees formed a diverse student body from 25 universities across 17 states. Doctoral students comprised 70% of the award recipients, while undergraduate and master's&nbsp;students accounted for 20% and 10%, respectively. Additionally, 86% of all student awardees have never attended the ASC conference before.</p>\r\n<p>Three professional development events, in the form of virtual workshops, were organized for students one month before the conference. These workshops covered effective conference presentation practices, networking tips, and provided students the opportunity to interact with professors and industry experts before the event. The day before the conference began, an in-person community-building activity was organized for students at a park near the conference venue, allowing them to meet their peers in a more informal setting.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Based on the student feedback received in the Exit Survey, we can report that 97% of all student awardees agreed (and 60% strongly agreed) that the pre-conference virtual workshops improved their understanding of how to prepare a conference presentation. After attending these workshops, 97% of students also agreed they have a better sense of how to prepare for a networking event at a professional conference. The virtual networking event with composites experts also helped 93% of these students to develop their communication and networking skills before the conference.</p>\r\n<p>Supporting the growing network of students actively working in composite materials is of significant national importance, as it fosters future partnerships, advances scientific knowledge, and strengthens the field of mechanics and manufacturing of composite materials. The meaningful interactions between students and composite materials researchers from academia, industry, and government research organizations at the ASC Conference -the nation's premier event for composite materials- can drive research and development by sustaining ongoing efforts and clarifying key challenges for the next generation of engineers and scientists in this field. Furthermore, broadening student participation in the composites industry fosters innovation, introduces new ideas and diverse perspectives, and helps address future challenges in composite materials science and engineering.</p>\r\n<p>Given the student feedback received and the positive diversity markers in the demographics of the student body attending the ASC 39th&nbsp;conference, we gladly report that the project successfully achieved the proposed objectives.</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 02/25/2025<br>\nModified by: Paulina&nbsp;Diaz-Montiel</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2421943/2421943_10923077_1740508712416_StudentAwardees_p1--rgov-214x142.JPG\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2421943/2421943_10923077_1740508712416_StudentAwardees_p1--rgov-800width.JPG\" title=\"Student Awardees part 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2421943/2421943_10923077_1740508712416_StudentAwardees_p1--rgov-66x44.JPG\" alt=\"Student Awardees part 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Student awardees supported by this project at the 39th ASC conference in San Diego, CA, October 22, 2024 (part 1).</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Paulina Diaz-Montiel</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Paulina&nbsp;Diaz-Montiel\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Student Awardees part 1</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2421943/2421943_10923077_1740508756863_StudentAwardees_v2--rgov-214x142.JPG\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2421943/2421943_10923077_1740508756863_StudentAwardees_v2--rgov-800width.JPG\" title=\"Student Awardees part 2\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2421943/2421943_10923077_1740508756863_StudentAwardees_v2--rgov-66x44.JPG\" alt=\"Student Awardees part 2\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Student awardees supported by this project at the 39th ASC conference in San Diego, CA, October 22, 2024 (part 2).</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Paulina Diaz-Montiel</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Paulina&nbsp;Diaz-Montiel\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Student Awardees part 2</div>\n</div>\n</li></ul>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n",
