 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the support of the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program in the Division of Chemistry and the Office of Strategic Initiatives of the Directorate of Mathematical and Physical Sciences, Professor Marc A. Hillmyer of the University of Minnesota and his team will carry out a fundamental research project aimed at the discovery and development of new polymers critical for sustainable future. They will implement groundbreaking approaches to the generation of new rigid plastics and flexible rubbery polymers based on biobased polyesters. These polymeric compounds will be designed to achieve outstanding physical properties and to be industrially composted at the end of use. Solutions that will be explored in this work promote a practical circular plastics economy. The team will use the modern tools of polymer synthesis to optimize the molecular features of these new polymers to promote sustainability. The work will benefit the well-being of individuals given the urgent need to solve our pressing plastics predicament: modern society depends on these polymers and continually expects increased performance but suffers dire consequences from the associated pollution. The work will also promote a globally competitive workforce through training of diverse researchers in area of polymer chemistry and sustainable polymers.\r\n\r\nThe work described in this proposal will advance our understanding of how architectural control, stereocomplex formation, blend compatibilization, and morphological design in a class of promising aliphatic polyester block polymers can be harnessed in ways that optimize and valorize a class of materials that will positively impact the field of sustainable polymers. Accessible tools of modern polymer chemistry will be implemented to determine the scope and adaptability of numerous strategies to generate high-performance polymers in aliphatic polyester block polymers. The interplay between molecular structure and polymer self-assembly will play a central role in the research activities. The work will build a strong foundational base for researchers to implement designer approaches to other classes of sustainable polymers and demonstrate the range of possibilities to elevate their development going forward.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
