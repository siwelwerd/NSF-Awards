 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cellular wireless networks, such as fifth generation (5G) networks, are crucial for national economy and security. Next-generation networks, namely sixth generation (6G) and beyond, are envisioned to deliver much higher speeds and new services like city-scale perception. To invent the ideas that will enable next-generation networks, it is crucial that researchers can conduct novel experiments to test new ideas. This project will develop Houdini, a new flexible platform that allows researchers to mix-and-match different radio bands in unique ways for new experiments. Houdini will be designed to be flexible and programmable to support the unique needs of many different researchers. \r\n\r\nProject Houdini involves investigators from Rice University, University of California-San Diego, Northeastern University and University of Notre Dame. The project main thrusts are: 1) Houdini Mix-and-match Radio System: The project will develop open-access software-defined radio to simultaneously support multiple radio modules across different bands, 2) Houdini Software Stack: The project will develop a software framework to virtually bond multiple bands, and new open-source libraries to support research use cases in wireless networking, sensing, and imaging, and 3) Novel Dissemination Models: The project will support multiple models of platform access, including remote access, build-your-own and a rent-to-use model.\r\n\r\nHoudini will provide capabilities beyond existing platforms, and thereby empower the community to experimentally explore research in new directions in wireless networking, sensing and imaging. By building one platform that could address the needs of many research communities, the platform will also spur collaboration between diverse research communities. The project will develop course materials with hands-on tutorials and laboratory sessions, hold show-and-tell events, host a (remote) Genius bar and release novel datasets. The investigators will seek to involve underrepresented students in research and learning activities leveraging their regional collaborations with minority-serving institutions.\r\n\r\nThe Houdini project website will be https://houdini.rice.edu, which will host code, designs, user documentation and tutorials for the use of the platform. The project will ensure searchable, and well-organized documentation, including step-by-step multimedia enriched startup guides. The Houdini software, firmware, and hardware schematics will be hosted as public repositories on GitHub. New training modules will be developed to teach students the basics of developing communication, sensing and imaging applications using Houdini. We will design an open-source Houdini Data Recording Application Programming Interface to record real-world radio datasets in an easy and automated manner.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
