 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to provide a safe and reliable positioning and timing system for systems when the Global Positioning System (GPS) fails. Billions of users, including drone applications, precision farming, and The Department of Defense rely on GPS. Unfortunately, GPS signals are weak because they are transmitted from space, making them susceptible to jamming and hacking. Research from the scientific community has studied the use of low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite signals as a backup to GPS.  This project will deploy a novel platform for testing theoretical studies and required infrastructure that will enable the use of LEO satellite signals by vehicles to improve their navigation systems. Improving drone navigation technology will push several markets into full fruition, including drone package delivery and delivery of emergency medical supplies, which are projected to see double digit market growth over the next few years. Precise positioning is also expected to support fully autonomous tractors, which will boost the agriculture market by scaling precision seed laying. Additionally, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) considers 13 of the 16 critical infrastructures to be critically dependent on GPS.  This project aims to remove this single point of failure from over-reliance on GPS.\r\n\r\nThis SBIR Phase II project will develop a ground network service that supports the use of existing and future LEO satellite signals for positioning and timing to serve as an alternative or complement to GPS. The research objectives are to: 1) complete a proof-of-concept system enabling the use of these signals for positioning and timing, 2) analytically characterize performance of the system, and 3) demonstrate an operational proof-of-concept system in a region of the United States.  To reach these objectives, this project will leverage fundamentals from signal processing and estimation theory to convert LEO signals into GPS-like signals. Convex optimization theory will be used to guide the deployment of the infrastructure needed to realize the system. The demonstration of the system will be evaluated by comparing the mean and standard deviation of the position errors produced by the LEO satellite signals with theoretically achievable values.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
