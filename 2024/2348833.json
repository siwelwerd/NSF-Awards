 "awd_abstract_narration": "Algebraic structures have been employed for nearly two centuries to understand the behavior, particularly the symmetry, of various entities in nature. Now with the current technology of category theory (i.e., the study of objects and how they are transported), classical algebraic structures can be upgraded to provide information on natural phenomena that was not previously understood. This yields significant consequences in quantum physics. The work sponsored by this grant lies in the framework of monoidal categories, which are categories that come equipped with a way of combining objects and combining maps between objects. Several projects are earmarked for partial work by undergraduate and graduate students. Moreover, the PI will make significant progress on completing a three-volume, user-friendly textbook series on quantum algebra. The PI is also an active mentor for numerous members of underrepresented groups, particularly for those in groups to which the PI belongs (women, African-Americans, and first generation college students).\r\n\r\nThe first research theme of the projects sponsored by this grant is on algebras in monoidal categories. The PI will extend classical properties of algebras over a field to the monoidal context, and will also study properties that only have significant meaning in the categorical setting. In addition, the PI will examine other algebraic structures (e.g., Frobenius algebras) in monoidal categories, especially those tied to Topological Quantum Field Theories (TQFTs). Another theme of the PI's sponsored research work is on representations of certain monoidal categories that play a crucial role in 2-dimensional Conformal Field Theory (2d-CFTs), and that correspond to 3d-TQFTs. Of particular interest are representations of modular tensor categories, and the PI's work here will build on recent joint work with R. Laugwitz and M. Yakimov that constructs canonical representations of braided monoidal categories.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
