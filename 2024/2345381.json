 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will contribute to environmental sustainability, economic growth, and technological advancement. By pioneering a sensor network platform that operates at near-zero power, this project will significantly reduce the environmental footprint of electronic devices by extending their battery life, thereby decreasing electronic waste. Such advancements hold the promise of enabling sustainable sensor deployments across a vast array of Internet of Things (IoT) applications, particularly in challenging environments where traditional technologies falter. The commercial potential of this technology is vast, with initial applications in industries requiring robust sensor networks, such as warehousing, healthcare, and retail. This project aims to reinforce the United States' leadership in semiconductor manufacturing and IoT innovation and generate economic opportunities and job creation in underutilized business zones. The societal benefits extend to improved healthcare monitoring, efficient resource management, and enhanced consumer products, directly contributing to public well-being and safety.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is centered around the development and deployment of a cutting-edge sensor network platform designed to operate with exceptionally low power consumption. The core innovation lies in the integration of low-power wake-up radio technology with network protocols optimized for such radios, enabling always-on, low-latency communication without the traditional energy overhead. The proposed research aims to tackle the challenge of maintaining continuous, reliable sensor communication in environments where power resources are limited or costly to replace. By refining and scaling wake-up radio technology, the project intends to achieve significant improvement in communication energy efficiency compared to current standards. This advancement is expected to yield smaller, more cost-effective sensor nodes with extended lifespans, opening new possibilities for Internet of Things (IoT) applications that were previously impractical due to power constraints. The anticipated technical results include the successful demonstration of this technology in a real-world environment, showcasing its potential to revolutionize sensor networks across various industries. The anticipated technical results promise to advance the scientific and engineering understanding of low-power wireless communication, paving the way for wide-ranging applications in industrial monitoring, environmental sensing, healthcare, and beyond.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
