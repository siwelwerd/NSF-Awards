 "awd_abstract_narration": "Middlesex Community College (MCC) intends to design an Associate Degree in Science (AS) that will focus on emerging robotics and automation industries utilizing the Advanced Technological Education (ATE) program business and industry leadership team, or BILT, model to inform curriculum and validate the job skills students will learn. This project intends to create an employment pipeline and foster career development for the diverse student population at MCC, including high school students in early college (dual enrollment) classes.  MCC is committed to equity-based curriculum development and practices.  \r\n\r\nThe outcome of this project is intended to be an educated diverse workforce that lives in and supports the regional and local community. The design of MCC\u2019s AS in Robotics and Automation will be informed by industry partners to create a career pathway for both college and high school students selecting dual enrollment courses. This project will promote economic equity through broadening participation of students from underrepresented groups in the robotics industry. Students will also participate in an inclusive and supportive learning environment that will promote equity, retention, and success of all students. Implementing and assessing equity-focused high-impact pedagogical strategies is expected to improve technology education, increase its relevance and contribute to evidence-based practices and curriculum designed to strengthen the pipeline for Robotics and Automation workers into the community and the region. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
