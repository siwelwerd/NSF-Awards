 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will play a pivotal role in promoting inclusivity and advancing the field of statistics by supporting the participation of graduate students, early-career researchers, and underrepresented groups in the International Chinese Statistical Association (ICSA) 2024 Applied Statistics Symposium, which will be held in Nashville, Tennessee from June 16-June 19, 2024. With the overarching theme of \"Data-Driven Decision Making: Unleashing the Power of Statistics\u201d, the symposium will focus on collaboration and diversity. The event will not only promote education, research, and practical applications but also address broader societal goals by encouraging participation from women, minorities, and individuals with disabilities. The symposium's impact will extend beyond technical discussions, emphasizing professional development and bridging gaps in STEM fields through mentoring, career development, and opportunities for the next generation of statisticians.\r\nThe conference is a comprehensive platform designed to advance statistical theory, computational methods, and practical applications. With plenary talks, invited sessions, student paper competitions, contributed posters, and short courses, the conference covers a broad spectrum of topics crucial to the evolving landscape of statistics, data science, and artificial intelligence. A key technical component includes the integration of foundational statistical theory with advanced computational methods, addressing practical challenges in various scientific domains. Special sessions, such as the panels on mentoring and career development, provide a focused forum to discuss strategies for promoting diversity and inclusion, particularly for women and individuals underrepresented in STEM. The symposium's website, accessible at https://symposium2024.icsa.org/, serves as a hub for seamless communication and resource sharing among participants.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
