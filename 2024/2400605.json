 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 2024 CRM-PIMS Summer School in Probability will take place at the Centre de Recherches Math\u00e9matiques in Montreal, Canada from July 1 to 26, 2024. This summer school will be aimed at graduate students who are in a Ph.D. program in mathematics. The summer school will also have attendees who have recently obtained their degrees. During this conference the attendees will study current areas of research in probability. They will also study how these topics relate to research in optimization and data science. This award support the participation of American citizens, permanent residents and students at US universities in the summer school.\r\n\r\nThe summer school will consist two main courses and three week-long mini courses. One of the main courses is \"Random matrix theory of high-dimensional optimization\". This will be taught by Elliot Paquette. The other main course is \"Random walks and branching random walks: old and new perspectives\". This course will be taught by Perla Sousi. Each course will consist of 16 lectures as well as problem sessions.The three mini-courses are: 1. Probabilistic techniques in number theory, taught by Emma Bailey 2. Permutations in random geometry, taught by Jacopo Borga 3. Condensation phenomena in random trees, taught by Igor Kortchemski. These will each consist of three or four lectures. In addition we will have opportunities for the attendees to talk about their research. The website for the school is https://secure.math.ubc.ca/Links/ssprob24/index.php\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
