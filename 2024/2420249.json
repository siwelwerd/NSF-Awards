 "awd_abstract_narration": "The current environmental crisis is causing a significant loss of biodiversity, which severely impacts the stability of Earth's processes and the well-being of both humans and wildlife. Addressing this issue requires a better understanding of the state of threatened wildlife and the challenges they face. This project studies marine and terrestrial species in St. Vincent and the Grenadines (SVG) to improve wildlife management through research-based information. Annually, over three years, cohorts of six U.S. graduate and undergraduate students from underrepresented STEM backgrounds participate in an immersive, year-long training and research experience focused on human-wildlife interactions. The program includes two semesters of coursework in the US and four weeks of field work in SVG. During this time, students investigate the ecology and conservation status of vulnerable and charismatic terrestrial species (parrots), and marine species (cetaceans). Each student cohort receives direct mentorship from a multidisciplinary team of US and Vincentian researchers, conservation practitioners, and government officials. Through this program, students acquire diverse skills in the natural and social sciences. This enables them to understand the complex relationships between wildlife and their environment while actively collaborating with local experts to address immediate threats.\r\n \r\nTropical islands are major ecological hotspots around the globe. However, they face disproportionate environmental threats, leading to high rates of species declines and extinctions. Caribbean islands are particularly challenged by human-driven habitat encroachment and unsustainable resource exploitation, primarily from agriculture and fishing. This project investigates the ecology of parrots and cetaceans in SVG, assessing the impacts of human activity on these species and exploring the consequences of these interactions for local livelihoods. Students use field methods, including direct observations, passive acoustic monitoring, and remote sensing, to understand the drivers of wildlife distributions and densities. This approach provides insights into how habitat characteristics, anthropogenic pressures, and species' behavioral adaptations affect the abundance and distribution of endangered species. The findings are directly translated into management recommendations for the Vincentian government, helping to develop effective conservation strategies to better protect these imperiled species and their habitats. By including U.S. and Vincentian researchers, local NGOs, and government agencies, this project effectively bridges academic research with applied conservation, providing students with real-world experience in biodiversity science and conservation. This collaborative approach highlights the critical roles of academic research, societal needs, and governance in addressing the biodiversity crisis, particularly in tropical island systems.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
