 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 37th Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineering International System-on-Chip Conference (IEEE SoCC 2024) will be held September 16-19, 2024, in Dresden, Germany. For more than 36 years, the IEEE SoCC has been a premier forum for sharing the latest advancements in system-on-chip (SoC) architectures, systems, logic and circuit design, process technology, test, design tools, and application scenarios. The conference provides a unique platform for students to engage with leading experts, present their research, and network with professionals in the field. This project will support student travel to IEEE SoCC 2024 for up to 15 US-based participants. Supporting student participation in IEEE SoCC 2024 will significantly enhance the academic and professional development of young researchers. Exposure to cutting-edge research and networking opportunities with industry leaders and academic experts will enrich their educational experience. This exposure is crucial for inspiring innovative contributions to the field of SoC. Students will gain insights into the latest advancements, methodologies, and challenges in SoC design and implementation, which will inform and refine their research endeavors. Additionally, presenting their work at an esteemed conference will provide critical feedback and validation from the broader research community, further advancing their scholarly growth. \r\n\r\nThe travel grant will promote diversity and inclusion by enabling students from various backgrounds and institutions to participate in IEEE SoCC 2024. This initiative will help build a diverse pipeline of future leaders in the SoC community, ensuring that different perspectives and ideas contribute to the advancement of the field. By supporting students who might otherwise face financial barriers, the grant will foster an inclusive environment where talent and potential are the primary criteria for participation. This inclusivity is essential for driving innovation and addressing the complex challenges in SoC technology. The broader impacts of this initiative extend to enhancing the overall quality and diversity of the research community, promoting equitable opportunities for all students, and ultimately contributing to the development of robust and versatile SoC solutions that can benefit society at large.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
