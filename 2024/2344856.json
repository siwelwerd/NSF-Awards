 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of a process monitoring sensor for complex, two-phase products. Achieving the desired consistency of two-phase products is extremely complex due to a multitude of occurrences of simultaneous mechanical shearing and chemical reactions, allowing a narrow margin of error. Currently, no techniques are available to measure the real-time consistency of the product. Examples of two-phase products include grease, mayonnaise, sauces, jam, peanut butter, paper, and others. In grease production, for example, the difference in time taken to mix the acids and bases leads to consistency variation. For mayonnaise, the emulsion can break if the egg and emulsifying agents are not well dispersed and hydrated during oil addition. The consistency of the product varies due to the variation in the raw materials, feeding rate of the ingredients, and human errors. The batch of product having a consistency that does not meet set standards is discarded. The proposed senor technology may help understand the prevailing complex processes and their thermodynamics necessary to achieve a repeatable consistency of two-phase products for every batch, thus improving profit margin and eliminating waste in product and energy.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on the development of a process monitoring sensor unit (PSU), employed to measure the real-time consistency of two-phase products during their fabrication process. Two-phase products involve mixing solid and liquid ingredients in a kettle until the desired consistency is achieved. The proposed PSU measures the real-time accumulative entropy-generation values, developed in accordance with principles of thermodynamics and compares with consistency of the product. The power of the driving motors and the product\u2019s temperature may be employed for determining the accumulative entropy in process industries. The proposed approach has been applied to several irreversible complex systems and the research has revealed that the accumulative entropy generation of a finished product remains constant. The proposed PSU may ensure the product has the right consistency at every stage. In addition, PSU may also be used to trigger warning signals for prompt corrective action by the process engineer, guaranteeing the products meet standards and quality.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
