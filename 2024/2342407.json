 "awd_abstract_narration": "The conference \"Second Joint Alabama-Florida Conference on Differential Equations, Dynamical Systems and Applications (JAF DE-DS)\" organized by the departments of mathematics at Florida State University, Auburn University, University of Alabama at Birmingham, and Florida International University, will take place in Tallahassee, FL, on May 18-19, 2024. This meeting will be the second event in a sequence of annual JAF DE-DS conferences alternating between Auburn, UAB, FIU and FSU campuses that was inaugurated on May 13, 2023, at Auburn University.  This conference will bring together a diverse group of researchers in the geographic area near the States of Alabama and Florida which encompasses numerous universities. The conference will allow experts specializing in nonlinear partial differential equations and applied dynamical systems to exchange ideas, forge new collaborations, and disseminate their recent results. The award funds will help cover travel and local expenses of the participants with no current Federal support. Priority for financial support will be given to graduate and undergraduate students, postdoctoral fellows, early career researchers, and scientists from underrepresented groups in STEM.\r\n\r\nThematically, the conference will cover a wide spectrum of topics in the general area of applied mathematics with a focus on partial differential equations, integrable Hamiltonian dynamical systems and applications in the physical and biological sciences. In the past few decades, novel ideas and methods were developed to tackle complex problems related to existence, stability, and computation of solutions to various model equations arising in fluid mechanics, photonics, Bose-Einstein condensation, and biological systems. Motivated by this progress, the scientific program of the conference will revolve around similar topics including inverse scattering and integrable systems, existence, and long-time asymptotics of nonlinear waves and coherent structures for the nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger, Navier-Stokes, and reaction diffusion equations. Making progress in this direction will improve our theoretical knowledge and provide new insights into future research problems related to linear and nonlinear wave propagation in random and complex media.\r\n\r\n More information can be found on the conference website: \r\nhttps://www.math.fsu.edu/~musliman/Second_Alabama_Florida_Conference/\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
