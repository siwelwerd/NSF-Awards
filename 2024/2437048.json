 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project has the potential to enhance the impact of NSF sponsored research by catalyzing the formation and success of small business concerns founded by the NSF Small Business Innovation Research and Small Business Technology Transfer (SBIR and STTR) programs. The companies formed by these grantees are working to solve critical challenges facing our society, namely the generation and storage of renewable energy; the development of new semiconductor, communications, computing and quantum technologies; the advancement of national security technologies; and innovations in biological and medical technologies.  By facilitating international cooperation on deep-tech startup creation, this project will increase the economic competitiveness of the U.S. and encourage the development of enhanced infrastructure for research and education. Finally, this project will conduct activities to encourage and support participants reflecting the diversity of the United States in founding and leading deep-tech startups. \r\n\r\nThis project represents a tremendous opportunity for U.S. deep-tech startups to advance through international partnerships. While opportunity exists there has been very little work to date to identify specific methodologies that could help these startups to find, develop, and execute such partnerships. There is also a lack of information about potential opportunities that are currently available or that could be created in various partner countries. This project will address these knowledge gaps and test potential solutions with U.S. startup founders and prospective partners. Successful completion of this project will advance knowledge about the needs of NSF SBIR/STTR grantees and other deep-tech startups and on methods to leverage international collaboration to accelerate the formation and growth of these companies.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
