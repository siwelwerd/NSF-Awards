These advancements prompt a reassessment of techniques and technologies in signal processing, communications, and networking through a data-centric lens.\r\n\r\nThe forthcoming workshop, scheduled for May 17-18, 2024 at the Twin Cities campus of the University of Minnesota, explores the promises and impact of the integration of ML/AI in Signal Processing, Next Generation (NextG) Communications, and Networking. The workshop will focus on pioneering methodologies to model and govern interconnected systems. It will serve as a platform for interdisciplinary scientific exchange and visioning among field-shaping researchers and practitioners. It will provide opportunities for future collaborations enabling progress in data-driven approaches to signal processing, NextG communications, networking and their applications. The videos of the headline and expert presentations and panel discussions will be made publicly available on the workshop website, and the workshop report will be disseminated.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
