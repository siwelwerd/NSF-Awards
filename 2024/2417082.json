 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national interest by improving manufacturing education and learning for diverse learners. Leveraging a 4,000 square-foot manufacturing facility at Auburn University, this project will implement evidence-based teaching practices to develop accessible and experiential video-based learning modules that can benefit remote and in-person learners. This state-of-the-art facility simulates high-volume automotive manufacturing environments, such as those of Toyota and Honda, providing students with significant experiential learning in Lean Manufacturing. Lean Manufacturing is the third generation of industrial manufacturing, following the Job Shop and Henry Ford's Mass Production System, and is the primary focus of this project. As the reshoring of American manufacturing increases, experience-based knowledge in Lean Manufacturing is crucial for the nation's industrial competitiveness. Practical learning experiences gained by students in Lean Manufacturing equip them to support the growing manufacturing sector in the U.S. and improve student mindsets and persistence in STEM. This project will not only lead to the development of new instructional materials but also deliver knowledge pertinent to students' learning during these practical and experiential learning experiences. \r\n\r\nThe primary goal of this project is to develop comprehensive experiential learning modules in Lean Manufacturing and to leverage state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities to enhance learning outcomes beyond traditional classroom instruction. Some of the targeted Lean Manufacturing learning topics include (1) 5S, a systematic approach to creating an organized manufacturing environment with robust visual management, and (2) Value Stream Mapping, a methodology that identifies waste within a manufacturing system and that is often overlooked due to its complexity. By developing a web-based platform that offers online students and instructors interactive video access to state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities, the project will allow a more diverse set of students and educators to engage with a real production system and collaborate with on-campus students. This initiative aims to be scalable, extending its scope to a broad academic and industrial learner network. A team composed of manufacturing engineering educators and an educational psychologist will enable knowledge generation pertinent to gains in learning outcomes (e.g., critical thinking skills, attitudes towards engineering practice, cognitive gains), with comparisons of online and on-campus students. The findings will be disseminated through scientific and educational professional conferences and peer-reviewed academic publications. \r\n\r\nThe NSF IUSE: EDU Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through the Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
