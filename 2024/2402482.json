 "awd_abstract_narration": "Zack Hall is awarded an NSF Mathematical and Physical Sciences Ascending Postdoctoral Research Fellowship (NSF MPS-Ascend) to conduct a program of research and activities related to broadening participation by groups underrepresented in STEM. This fellowship to Dr. Hall supports the research project entitled \u201cPostdoctoral Fellowship: MPS-Ascend: Towards Precision Physics: Calculating Neutron Beta Decay with Lattice Quantum Chromodynamics\u201d under the mentorship of a sponsoring scientist. The host institution for the fellowship is Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Andre Walker-Loud.\r\n\r\nThis award supports the PI\u2019s study of non-perturbative calculation of quantum electrodynamic (QED) corrections to the nucleon axial coupling, gA, which is critical in determining the nuclear neutron beta decay rate. Comparing to the lattice quantum chromodynamics (LQCD) estimations, where only strong QCD interactions are considered, results of experimental measurements contain both strong and electromagnetic contributions. The objective of the investigation is to encompass a QCD+QED approach to evaluate gA with mesons, baryons, and nucleon matrix elements.\r\n\r\nThe PI plans to increase broadening participation in STEM by building on his previous experiences with designing and leading mentoring initiatives by actively working to provide access to quality mentors, improve science literacy, and facilitate opportunities for underrepresented minorities in STEM to gain valuable transferrable skills. The proposed work has several areas where graduate and undergraduate students can contribute to numerical calculations to hone their programming skills. Additionally, the PI will join existing out-reach programs at the host institution geared toward mentoring, establishing networks with STEM professionals, and building research skills for high school and college students.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
