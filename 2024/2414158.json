 "awd_abstract_narration": "An award is made to the University of Southern California in collaboration with Brown University to develop an instrument that can be used to investigate how mechanical forces can control or influence biological systems. Through the research activities, the award will provide training to undergraduate students, PhD students, and post-doctoral scholars. Notably, collaborating with the newly started NSF Advanced Technological Education Center located at Pasadena City College, will enable the hosting of two undergraduate community college students, directly incorporating undergraduates into the research activities. These students will be mentored by the PhD students and post-doctoral scholar who will be involved in this research effort. The finding will be disseminated through freely accessible online repositories such as the NIH 3D Print Exchange and GitHub and through scholarly publications and conference presentations. To increase the scientific literacy of the general public, social media will be leveraged for broader dissemination of the research findings and scientific life.\r\n\r\nIt is well-established that chemical exposure can modify a biological system, changing the behavior of cells and tissue. Evidence is emerging that physical forces can play a similar role, and in some cases, these physical effects can combine with chemical stimuli to amplify or to eliminate a biological response. Changes in the mechanical properties of surfaces in contact with cells and tissues also modulate biological activity. Therefore, it is critical to understand the role of mechanical forces in biological processes. However, only a few tools can accurately study this complex behavior in limited settings. This award will support the development and validation of a more broadly applicable instrument that will overcome this cross-cutting hurdle. The technology will be compatible with a standard fluorescence microscope, enabling simultaneous imaging and manipulation of the physical properties of the biological system. To accomplish this goal, two new synergistic technologies will be developed. To demonstrate relevance to current and future NSF BIO Directorate programs, a pair of proof-of-concept measurements in neuroscience and in bacterial research will be performed.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
