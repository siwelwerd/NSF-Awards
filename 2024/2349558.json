 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award establishes a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site in Human-Computer Interaction at Carnegie Mellon University to increase student interest and involvement in high-quality, interdisciplinary human-computer interaction research.  This new REU site will increase the involvement of students attending undergraduate-focused institutions, particularly members of groups underrepresented in computer science. Our long-term goal is to increase the number and diversity of students who pursue graduate studies in human-computer interaction and, more generally, research careers in computer science. The REU site --- dubbed HCI REU --- will focus on interdisciplinary Human-Computer Interaction research. Human-computer interaction is an important field within CISE, focusing on the design and use of technology and the interaction between people and technology. HCI research observes how people currently use technology, how technology impacts society, and develops novel ways for people to interact with technology.\r\n\r\nStudents in our program will get hands-on research experience and developmental exposure to research and career opportunities in Human-Computer Interaction. During the 10-week program, students will help define a research project, learn about and apply HCI research methods, collect and analyze data or build a system, present their work to their peers and members of the department, and write a summary report. In addition to engaging in research, students will attend seminars on graduate education, research in HCI, and research skills.  They will attend thesis proposals and defenses by Carnegie Mellon graduate students, and participate in local research seminars, lab meetings, and reading groups. We expect that students in the REU cohort will enter student research competitions and publish papers in top-tier conferences based on their work over the summer.\r\n\r\nThis site is supported by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
