 "awd_abstract_narration": "DNA computers can run programs outside of traditional electronics, integrating directly with materials, and enabling chemical control over physical matter. This novel technology has the potential to revolutionize diverse STEM fields, with applications such as intelligent medicine and nanofabrication. However, current DNA computer circuits have several key limitations. Most existing circuits have only enough energy to complete one round of computation. Additionally, current DNA circuits are hardcoded to perform a single task. Developing each new program requires constructing an entirely new circuit, which can take years. This project aims to address these limitations by developing a robust, high-power, easily programable, universal DNA computer to execute any task. Additionally, this project aims to integrate research with education to help grow the field of DNA computing. In this regard, the first comprehensive textbook in molecular programming will be produced to attract new researchers and pilot coursework at partner universities will be created for students to learn about molecular programming. A bridge for early career researchers will also be built to transfer chemical computing technology from academia to industry, fostering a more diverse, creative, and innovative engineering workforce. \r\n\r\nThis project focuses on creating: (1) A robust DNA circuit, capable of running extremely high concentration reactions with reduced off-target activity; (2) High-energy DNA circuits with a chemical power supply capable of sustaining up to a hundred cycles of chemical computation; (3) Sequential DNA logic circuits; and (4) A universal DNA computer capable of executing software instructions stored in chemical memory, while the underlying chemical hardware can remain constant. The project represents a paradigm shift in chemical computing, enabling construction of DNA circuits with sustained dynamics while simplifying programming by separating the tasks of designing chemical hardware from writing chemical software. Successful completion of this project will enable novel research areas in high-concentration DNA computing, including construction of fundamental circuits such as flip-flops, robust oscillators, and universal stored-program hardware, dramatically simplifying the task of programming DNA computers and building towards programmable matter.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
