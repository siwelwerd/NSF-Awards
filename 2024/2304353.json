 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is a mobile and compact Electroencephalography (EEG) concussion screening and recovery monitoring tool to reduce the time needed to seek proper patient care. Each year in the US, 5.5 million mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) or concussion cases are reported with athletes disproportionately affected. Most concussion assessments rely on subjective measures but have an estimated 50% false negative rate resulting in potentially harmful return to play. Current imaging tools detect structural versus functional injuries, and existing EEG systems are not readily usable for field applications. This system aims to provide a field usable, on-demand concussion screening tool that enables patients to seek care in a more rapid manner in the event of a concussive event. It will also reduce unnecessary emergency room visits during instances of non-concussions when used in conjunction with current assessment measures. The project presents an ultra-portable solution with quantifiable concussions measures.  The innovation targets the $6.8 billion concussion care market opportunity within sports injury management, military health, and hospital sectors.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a handheld electroencephalogram (EEG) device designed to simplify data collection for long-term brain health tracking. The device is a two-channel tool that can be used at multiple locations on the head to conduct rapid, quantifiable brain assessments. The system aims to overcome the current size limitations and training required for current brain wave-measuring equipment. The size and portability of the device enables use across a variety of situations including sports events, military applications, or at home/on-base during recovery. The project aims to address two technical challenges: developing a system to guide untrained users in effectively positioning the device to collect high-quality data and developing a discriminant function to sense a series of acute brain wave signal changes in individuals over time for detecting concussions. The objective of this project is to develop a usable prototype with suitable sensitivity and specificity when compared to current diagnostic screening measures.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
