 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national interest by creating opportunities for community college students to engage in hands-on, student-centered STEM research early in the college experience to support the development of STEM identity. To accomplish this, advanced microscope imaging and analysis techniques will be integrated into classroom activities and research experiences throughout the Geology (Earth Sciences) and Engineering two-year college pathways. This approach aims to increase awareness of and access to research opportunities for underrepresented student populations, who are already enrolled in entry-level courses in Geology and Engineering. The focus on hands-on learning experiences presents an opportunity to increase course success and graduation rates for diverse and non-traditional student populations. Ultimately, the project seeks to increase inclusion, equity and justice in these fields, and hence benefit the broader STEM community.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to increase student engagement and support student-centered learning through greater access to experiential, project-based learning. The project's four primary objectives include: (1) develop and integrate course-based undergraduate research experience in microscopy-centered lecture demonstrations and lab activities into select Geology and Engineering courses; (2) support focused, individual student research opportunities during the academic year at the college and over the summer at advanced scanning electron microscope (SEM) facilities; (3) create infrastructure for student-led outreach on Geology and SEM technologies to local middle school classrooms; and (4) establish an annual Research Symposium, where students involved in both course-based and individual research experiences will present and exhibit their research to the broader community. A multi-pronged assessment and evaluation plan provides a framework for gaining a deeper understanding of how early research activities impact student success. Specifically, the project will examine the impact of combining course-based undergraduate research experiences with individual student research activities that include student research presentations at professional STEM conferences. Project results will be disseminated at local, regional, and national venues and made available through web-based repositories.
