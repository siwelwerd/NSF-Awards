 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the next three editions of the Mid-Atlantic Algebra, Geometry, and Combinatorics (MAAGC) workshop, tentatively scheduled for October 12\u201313, 2024 at George Washington University, May 30\u201331, 2025 at CUNY Graduate Center, and May 29\u201330, 2026 at Virginia Commonwealth University. This conference series aims to bring together senior researchers and junior mathematicians in order to promote collaborations and regional interactions, while highlighting recent developments in algebraic combinatorics, algebraic geometry, representation theory, and other related fields. Each meeting will consist of four invited talks, a poster session for early-career participants, and a panel discussion on career advice, all while allowing for plenty of unstructured time for building mathematical connections.\r\n\r\nThe goals of MAAGC include helping researchers learn about cutting-edge developments and forge meaningful research collaborations and professional connections throughout the Mid-Atlantic region. The workshops are designed to strengthen and connect the scientific community in algebraic combinatorics and related areas, by facilitating positive interactions among undergraduate and graduate students, postdocs, and faculty at small colleges as well as research universities throughout the region. For more information, please visit the MAAGC website: http://maagc.info\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
