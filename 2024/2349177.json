 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site award to University of Arkansas, located in Fayetteville, AR, supports the training of 10 students for 10 weeks during the summers of 2024-2027.  In this program, funded by the Division of Chemistry, students will participate in research projects in chemical and materials synthesis, measurement, and modeling that incorporate the principles of green chemistry. The laboratory research will be supplemented with group learning experiences focused on innovation in industry, catalysis, metrology, simulation, teamwork, and communication. This site will provide unique research training to students that balances scientific discovery with sustainability.\r\n\r\nThe student-focused research projects will span a range of topics centered on sustainable chemistry.  These topics will include novel synthesis of earth-abundant materials, development of sustainable methods for energy conversion, study of chemical and physical processes using advanced analytical techniques, and development of high accuracy molecular modeling at scale. The professional development will comprise the cohort weekly group learning and the site visits to chemical industry and government laboratory in Arkansas. To broaden participation in STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics), this site will actively recruit first-generation and economically disadvantaged students, students from underrepresented groups, and students with disabilities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
