 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader/commercial impact of this SBIR Phase I project is an innovative approach to language acquisition leveraging a tumbler-style mechanism. This method capitalizes on cognates from Latin-based languages to expedite vocabulary development and enhance literacy skills across diverse age groups. The application's design, rooted in morphological principles, offers a robust framework for learners ranging from novices to advanced practitioners preparing for standardized tests. By emphasizing Latin roots, the tool unlocks access to a vast array of STEM fields, as the professional lexicon in these areas is predominantly Latin-derived. The versatility of this approach enables its adaptation to multiple languages sharing Latin origins, significantly broadening its potential impact. The unique root-based learning methodology provides a distinct pedagogical advantage, facilitating cross-linguistic connections and deepening overall language comprehension. This technology's potential to revolutionize language education lies in its scalability and wide-ranging applicability. By making complex vocabulary more accessible, the tool has the capacity to enhance scientific literacy and foster greater engagement with technical subjects among the general population.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to address the inefficiencies in vocabulary acquisition by investigating the efficacy of morpheme-based learning strategies. The research objectives encompass demonstrating that learning lexical components accelerates vocabulary development, enhances decoding abilities for complex unfamiliar words, and improves long-term retention of lexical items. The proposed research methodology involves the development of a digital application that employs a tumbler game mechanic to teach vocabulary through morphological analysis. A randomized controlled trial will be conducted, stratifying subjects into three cohorts: a control group utilizing traditional whole-word definition methods, and two experimental groups engaging with the application for 30 and 60 days, respectively. Assessment will be conducted via standardized multiple-choice and matching instruments at baseline, 30, 60, and 90 days. Anticipated technical outcomes include: 1) inferior long-term retention and novel word decoding capabilities in the control group; 2) enhanced interpolation/decoding skills and 90-day retention for the 30-day experimental group; and 3) a 50% increase in interpolation/decoding proficiency and superior long-term retention for the 60-day experimental group compared to both other cohorts.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
