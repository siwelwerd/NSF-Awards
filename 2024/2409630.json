 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project aims to advance quantum technology by exploring the potential of Rydberg excitons\u2014unique, large artificial atoms within semiconductors that exhibit strong interactions with light. These Rydberg excitons could lead to significant advances in quantum computing and secure communications by enabling new ways to manipulate and entangle light particles. The primary activity involves developing new theoretical models to understand and control how Rydberg excitons interact with their surroundings, particularly with crystal impurities. This work will not only deepen our knowledge of these interactions but also guide future experiments and technological applications. Additionally, the project will contribute to the training of graduate students and postdoctoral researchers in cutting-edge quantum mechanics and semiconductor physics, fostering the next generation of scientists in this exciting field. Furthermore, the project includes outreach activities such as developing an educational computer game to help students and the public learn about quantum phenomena in a fun and engaging way.\r\n\r\nThis project addresses a critical gap in the theoretical understanding of Rydberg exciton polaritons, which are promising candidates for scalable quantum systems due to their strong light-matter interactions and controllable exciton-exciton interactions. The research will develop a coupled-channel scattering theory to elucidate the interactions between Rydberg excitons and crystal impurities, quantify polariton-polariton interaction strengths, and calculate polariton scattering in structured photonic environments. These theoretical advancements will provide a comprehensive framework to interpret experimental results and explore the potential of Rydberg exciton polaritons in optical quantum technologies. By establishing scattering theory as the appropriate method for these systems, the project will address significant loss mechanisms due to charged defects in high-purity semiconductors and reveal the long-range nature of Rydberg polariton interactions. The findings will also demonstrate how photonic band engineering can control these interactions, advancing the field of quantum optics and the development of solid-state quantum information processing platforms.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
