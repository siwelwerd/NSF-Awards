 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project's primary objective is to address the national shortage of qualified math and science teachers, particularly prevalent in rural and underserved school systems. These areas struggle the most to attract and retain skilled STEM educators, often resorting to substitutes or teachers lacking proper qualifications. To tackle this, the project offers financial aid, an accelerated path to teacher certification, and innovative strategies tailored for students in these underserved settings. Prospective teachers can pursue a math or science degree while undergoing intensive STEM teacher training, leading to a swift pathway to teacher certification. This comprehensive initiative targets recruiting STEM majors interested in teaching, providing them with specialized training in STEM content, teaching methodologies, and increased practical experiences to better equip them for the classroom and to enhance STEM education overall.\r\n\r\nThis project at The University of West Alabama (UWA) includes partnerships with a two-year institution; Coastal Alabama Community College; as well as collaborations with rural high-need K\u201012 school districts, University Charter School and Sumter County School District both located in the highly impoverished Sumter County, Alabama. The project's overarching goals encompass 1) recruiting and certifying 29 new STEM teachers over five years from UWA's math, science, and computer science programs; 2) fostering a highly supportive atmosphere for aspiring educators, through mentorship by esteemed UWA\u2010Teach expert faculty, and 3) implementing an induction program for continued development of subject matter comprehension and pedagogical practices. The project employs a mixed methods research methodology, combining quantitative data from surveys and databases with qualitative insights from semi\u2010structured interviews. Key research questions include assessing the impact of project experiences on UWA STEM majors' interest in teaching in underserved schools and their efficacy in engaging with K\u201012 students from these communities. Additionally, it examines the project's success in enlisting and retaining scholars and fellows, striving for an 80\u201090% completion rate in meeting STEM certification requirements. Likewise, it investigates the perceived effectiveness of the induction program for its graduates. Employing a responsive evaluation model, the project adapts to evolving needs by continuously gathering and analyzing data, enabling annual reporting and necessary program adjustments. The intellectual merit lies in the model of best practices developed for recruiting, educating, and supporting STEM teachers as they face the everyday challenges that plague underserved schools. The broader impact aims to elevate future generations by producing more qualified STEM teachers willing to serve in underserved schools, ultimately enhancing the education of children who often lack access to well\u2010qualified educators. Subsequently, the expectation is that the number and caliber of students entering postsecondary institutions as STEM majors will increase, initiating a positive and sustainable cycle of support for STEM education. This Track 1: Scholarships and Stipends project is supported through the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program (Noyce). The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K\u201012 STEM teachers and experienced, exemplary K\u201012 teachers to become STEM master teachers in high\u2010need school districts. It also supports research on the effectiveness and retention of K\u201012 STEM teachers in high\u2010need school districts.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
