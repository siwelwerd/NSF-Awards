 "awd_abstract_narration": "The recent rapid advancement in quantum computing has created a complex Quantum Cyberinfrastructure (QCI) that includes quantum algorithms, hardware, and software. However, this infrastructure is vulnerable to new quantum security threats, and the development of a secure QCI workforce has not kept pace. This gap poses risks to the technology industry, economic stability, national security, and US competitiveness. This project addresses this critical issue by proposing a comprehensive QCI curriculum, training projects, and various educational programs, designed for both beginners and advanced learners, with a special focus on engaging underrepresented minority groups. By enhancing quantum security awareness and QCI knowledge, this project aims to expand the QCI workforce, elevate secure QCI use in Science and Engineering research, and promote diversity in QCI education, ultimately supporting national interests in advancing science, prosperity, and security.\r\n\r\nThe long-term goal of this research team is to establish a strong foundation for advanced and secure QCI learning and workforce development. This project will move toward this goal by developing a two-level QCI curriculum covering Basics, Algorithms, Hardware, and Software, along with corresponding training projects and activities. The key contributions include: (1) a modularized QCI curriculum, (2) specialized training projects, and (3) broadening educational activities. The work leverages the extensive collaborative research and educational experience of the three Principal Investigators, who possess expertise in quantum computing, physics, security, and cyberinfrastructure. The success of this project will expand the secure QCI workforce, improve fundamental Science and Engineering research and education, and enhance community diversity, thereby benefiting the national technology industry, economy, security, and overall competitiveness.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
