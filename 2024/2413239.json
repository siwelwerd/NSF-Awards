 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national interest by recruiting and retaining students in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) through providing them with opportunities to participate in authentic research. Drawing on national reports and the research literature on evidence-based practices associated with increasing student success and persistence in STEM, the project team from CUNY Kingsborough Community College aims to establish a unifying approach to undergraduate research through creating a campus-wide community of research facilitated by the use of a discipline neutral program management template. The project team builds on a pilot effort that tested the validity of the template and on the interest and commitment of faculty across the STEM disciplines. The project revolves around providing authentic data-centric research opportunities for students, with particular focus on the Biological Sciences and the Social, Economic, and Behavioral Sciences.\r\n\r\nTo advance a culture of research at the institution, the project team proposes to (1) develop a discipline-neutral project management template for integrating research experience into courses and non-course based activities; (2) create and implement faculty professional development that promotes and generates data-centric undergraduate research experiences; and (3) design resources and processes for transitioning Course-based Undergraduate Research Experiences (CUREs) into non- course based Undergraduate Research Experiences (UREs). The mixed methods investigation is guided by a set of targeted questions that are aligned with data sources, use of validated instruments, and expected findings linked to project activities. This effort is designed to generate findings and recommendations for project improvement and to document and assess effectiveness, expected outcomes, and processes for accountability purposes. Importantly, the lessons learned from the investigation of project activities, deliverables/resources, and established infrastructure will inform efforts to sustain a culture of research, institutional support, and has the potential to provide a model for other two-year colleges. The NSF IUSE: Innovation in Two-Year College STEM Education (ITYC) Program seeks to accelerate the impact of and advance knowledge about emerging and evidence-based practices in undergraduate STEM education at two-year colleges.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
