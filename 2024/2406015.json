 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) through Targeted Infusion Projects supports the development, implementation, and study of evidence-based, innovative models and approaches for improving the preparation and success of HBCU undergraduate students so that they may pursue science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) graduate programs and/or careers. The goal of this project is to support the implementation of bioinformatics and biotechnology certificate programs at Lane College.\r\n\r\nThe project aims to accomplish this goal through three primary objectives: 1) create bioinformatics and biotechnology certification programs; 2) increase participation of undergraduate African American students and women in the fields of bioinformatics and computational biology; and 3) enhance an active presence of African American students and women in the industrial sectors of biotechnology. The project will also explore the impact of student engagement in undergraduate research experiences and new courses that incorporate core concepts in bioinformatics and biotechnology on student persistence in STEM degree programs and noncognitive factors including self-efficacy, influences by family, and potential earnings. This project will lead to the better preparation of students for careers in the competitive fields of bioinformatics and biotechnology and address the national shortage of skilled professionals in these fields.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
