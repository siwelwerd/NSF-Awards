It also enables recruiters and search committees to identify potential new faculty members. The poster session is organized by The Early Career Professionals Subcommittee (ECPSC) Materials Research Society (MRS). Previous sessions have witnessed participation ranging from 70 to 100 attendees. This year's MRS Fall meeting will commemorate the 5th anniversary of this impactful poster session which further highlights its\r\nintellectual merits and impact within the community. Attendees come from a broad spectrum of materials research subareas, thus providing a means for interdisciplinary communication that will foster new research ideas and collaborations. This award will increase participation in this meeting by defraying the cost of registration.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
