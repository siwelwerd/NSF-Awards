 "awd_abstract_narration": "This CAREER study will focus on understanding the racial and gender disparities in STEM pathways spanning K-12 education, higher education, and the labor market. Prior research on this topic investigates racial and gender disparities in access to STEM course taking and test scores in K-12.  This has implications for unequal access to STEM prior to the end of high school for subsequent educational and labor market trajectories. In contrast, this CAREER research will take the less common approach of describing the college and career pathways of Black, Hispanic, Asian, and White women and men who graduate from high school with equivalent STEM course taking and test scores. The goal is to investigate the magnitude and mechanisms of potential racial and gender disparities in the returns to comparable K-12 STEM opportunity and preparation. The research study will describe potential racial and gender differences among such students across the subsequent outcomes of obtaining a STEM college degree and working in a STEM industry. The research will focus intensively on the potential for intersecting racial and gender differences in college and career pathways of those with equivalent K-12 STEM preparation. The project contributes to the understanding of for whom and under what circumstances early life investments in STEM education later pay off economically.  Findings can point to mechanisms underlying potential disparities in such returns. These are crucial insights at a time when STEM skills and credentials are increasingly important for one\u2019s life chances in today\u2019s knowledge economy.\r\n\r\nThe research will draw upon state-level administrative data from Texas covering the high school graduating classes of 2008-2013, with students followed into higher education and the labor market. K-12 STEM preparation will be measured with detailed course taking records and state standardized test scores. Potentially unequal returns to K-12 STEM preparation will be assessed across three outcomes, measured up to ten years after high school graduation: 1) probability of obtaining a STEM college degree, 2) STEM intensity of industry of employment, and 3) annual wages. The research will also develop a decomposition model of race-gender differences in the wage return to K-12 STEM preparation. The model intends to help explain differences in choice of and returns to STEM degrees and STEM-intensive industries among those with equivalent preparation. This project will implement and evaluate an online course plug-in to help college students emphasize their STEM skills and link their courses of study to careers. The effort is based on a working hypotheses and preliminary findings showing that a relatively large number of women and Black and Hispanic students with strong K-12 STEM preparation opt for social science courses of study in college. Therefore, emphasizing the scientific rigor of, and improving the employment and wage returns to, social science fields is a way to tap into an underlying distribution of historically marginalized STEM talent. \r\n\r\nThis is a Faculty Early Career Development Program project responsive to a National Science Foundation-wide activity that offers the most prestigious awards in support of early-career faculty who have the potential to serve as academic role models in research and education. This project is supported by NSF's EDU Core Research (ECR) program. The ECR program emphasizes fundamental STEM education research that generates foundational knowledge in the field. Investments are made in critical areas that are essential, broad and enduring: STEM learning and STEM learning environments, broadening participation in STEM, and STEM workforce development.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
