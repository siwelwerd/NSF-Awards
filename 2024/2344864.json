 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to address the national need for developing highly qualified K-5 teachers adept at using inclusive practices in STEM instruction and addressing global environmental challenges. The project will work directly with practicing K-5 teachers in New Jersey and engage two cohorts of 12 experienced K-5 teachers who will serve as Master Teacher Fellows (MTFs). The first year of the program will include coursework to complete a graduate certificate in Environmental Sustainability Education. In Year 2, MTFs will engage in professional learning sessions focused on developing teacher-leader skill sets. During Year 3, MTFs will support future teachers in developing leadership focused on inclusive practices in environmental education. In Years 4 and 5, MTFs will define their own unique and personalized pathways for serving as STEM teacher-leaders in their schools, classrooms, networks, and communities. Through consultation with the project team, the MTFs will develop and implement their personalized leadership plans and become in-house experts supporting colleagues in their schools and beyond.\r\n\r\nThis project at The College of New Jersey includes partnerships with the Alliance for New Jersey Environmental Education, the Hunterdon, Somerset, and Mercer Tri-County STEM Ecosystem, and five regional high-needs school districts: Hamilton Township Public Schools, Flemington-Raritan Regional School District, Lawrence Township Public Schools, Delran Township Public Schools, and Ewing Public Schools. Developing two cadres of teacher-leaders will provide mentorship and guidance for their peers, colleagues, and students, ensuring that future generations are well-prepared to handle these challenges. The 24 MTFs supported by this project will improve their own pedagogy, content knowledge, and confidence in sustainable and inclusive STEM and, through service as teacher-leaders, will impact the knowledge and skill set of their colleagues and families. Furthermore, this project will foster connections between MTFs and local community organizations, shifting the focus of education beyond the walls of school buildings or classrooms. The proposal for this Track 3: Master Teaching Fellowship project is supported through the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program (Noyce), which supports talented STEM majors and professionals in becoming effective K-12 STEM educators. This project aims to develop these individuals while researching the effectiveness and retention of experienced and exemplary K-12 STEM teachers across various school settings, including high-need districts.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
