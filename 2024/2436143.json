 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funding to support about 10 United States-based students to attend a doctoral consortium (DC) at the ACM 2025 ACM International Conference on Supporting Group Work (Group 2025), to be held in Hilton Head, South Carolina.  The Group 2025 DC focuses on participating students' doctoral dissertations, which represent state-of-the-art research in the areas of organizational systems, information systems, social informatics, and computer-supported cooperative work. The DC provides both an opportunity for these projects to be shaped through intellectual exchange as well as an opportunity to communicate the character of the work to a key group of early career researchers. Bringing together students and experienced faculty, both during the DC and during the conference poster presentations, will foster interdisciplinary conversations that are valuable for both the participants and the Group community as a whole.\r\n\r\nThrough a structured program both during the DC and the conference, students will gain a number of benefits in terms of valuable scholarly critique, career advice, and connections to senior researchers.  Both participating students and faculty will be a diverse group in may ways, both in terms of their intellectual and demographic backgrounds.  This diversity will help broaden participants' horizons at a critical stage in their professional development through providing a wider range of expertise and perspectives on the work.  Further, DC participants often later become leaders in the community themselves, both around research and through mentoring future junior scholars, growing and sustaining the community.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
