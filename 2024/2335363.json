 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to replace a 50+-year-old technology that uses toxic blood bags with a completely non-toxic blood bag that keeps blood healthier and longer. With the European Union (EU) banning the toxic plasticizer in the current polyvinyl chloride (PVC) blood bags and the disposal of PVC products releasing toxic, chlorine-based chemicals that build up in the water, air, and food chain, this is an urgent need. This technology replaces both PVC and the toxic plasticizer in addition to preventing a short supply of blood. The solution has the potential to save millions of lives yearly while avoiding waste by storing blood longer. The technology can seamlessly integrate into film manufacturing and blood storage infrastructure. The new technology can be expanded into non-toxic dialysis bags, intravenous (IV) bags, medical tubing, and bioprocessing industry applications. The technology's commercial potential in the global blood bag industry is expected to reach about $845 million by 2033. \r\n\r\nThis STTR Phase I project applies interdisciplinary tools, encompassing the chemistry of nanoporous macrostructure materials, polymer engineering, and blood biology, to advance the knowledge required to develop non-toxic composite bags while taking into consideration stringent requirements of physicochemical and mechanical properties for application as a blood bag. The technical challenge is to balance the competing needs of a blood storage container and manufacture using commercial blood bag machinery while ensuring sufficient active surfaces of the composite films without any leaching of the active ingredient during blood storage. The technology development addresses several technical challenges for storing whole blood longer than 28 days while keeping it healthy. Additionally, technical challenges in sealing the composite films while maintaining the required polymer integrity during steam sterilization are addressed. Solutions to the above-mentioned challenges are anticipated to achieve the primary goal of the Phase I project, which is to demonstrate that the non-toxic composite blood bags extend the shelf life of human whole blood by protecting against cold storage-induced oxidative injury and spontaneous hemolysis of red blood cells.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
