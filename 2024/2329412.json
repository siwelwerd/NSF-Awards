 "awd_abstract_narration": "Powder metallurgy is applied in practically every sector of the manufacturing economy, directly impacting economic welfare and national security. This award supports student participation in the International Conference on Powder Metallurgy and Particulate Materials (PowderMet2024) and the co-located Additive Manufacturing with Powder Metallurgy (AMPM2024) conference, to be held 16-19 June 2024, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The support provides an opportunity for outstanding student researchers to attend the advanced manufacturing conferences, present their work, learn from leading experts in the field, and interact with students from other institutions, fostering a sense of worldwide community of scientific inquiry. The supported students will present research posters and participate in the conference poster award competition, among other activities. The relationships with conference participants will help the students in determining their specific areas of interest in this broad field and create colleagues for future interactions and potential collaboration. This will not only stimulate learning and training for the students, but also allow them to be exposed to new research concepts in powder metallurgy and additive manufacturing.\r\n\r\nThe objectives of the student participation in PowderMet2024 and AMPM2024 are to (1) expand career-enhancing learning opportunities for a broader knowledge of powder metallurgy and metal additive manufacturing, (2) promote technology transfer and provide a forum to introduce new research and development activities, (3) promote collaborative partnerships between organizations in advanced manufacturing and in emerging technologies to increase workforce development, and (4) develop a workforce aligned with regional economies based on emerging technologies across the Nation. The conference organizers will support up to 40 successful student applicants, who study at US institutions. An emphasis will be placed on students whose institutions are under-resourced and would otherwise not be able to send them to the conference, and students presenting their research results at the conference. The organizers will invite applications through conference announcements and other means. The awards will provide support toward registration and accommodation. The availability of this support will encourage the participation of members of groups underrepresented in powder metallurgy research, and graduate and undergraduate students who are otherwise unable to afford attending these highly specialized advanced manufacturing conferences.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The conference serves as the primary global platform for technology transfer in powder metallurgy (PM) and additive manufacturing (AM), enabling students to engage with industry leaders, government researchers, and academic professionals. The award provided students with opportunities to present their research through poster sessions, with all participants delivering 10-minute oral presentations during the Talk' N Technology session. Gratifyingly, 20% of student participants submitted manuscripts that were included in the conference proceedings. One of the key outcomes that resulted from this travel award was the structured mentorship program, where each student was able to pair with an industry professional from the MPIF Technical Board, MPIF Industry Development Board, or APMI Board of Directors. Mentors guided students in research presentation preparation, networking strategies, and career development, holding pre-conference virtual meetings, daily in-person check-ins, and post-conference interviews to evaluate students' perceptions of the PM industry and their career aspirations. The conference's extensive technical program and industry exhibition provided a deeper understanding of conventional and emerging PM and AM processes, exposing students to critical manufacturing technologies such as press &amp; sinter, metal injection molding, and novel sinter-based AM techniques. Many students reported gaining new insights into PM applications and the scale of the industry, particularly after attending technical presentations and the \"State of the North American PM Industry\" address. The conference also emphasized professional networking by assigning students to industry tables during the Opening General Session, allowing them to interact directly with established professionals. Several students were recognized for their outstanding contributions, with three receiving Poster of Merit awards. Along with NSF's prior support, this award also had a long-term professional impact. The past awardees are seen to continue to contribute to the field, with 57% currently employed in PM-related industries and 24% in other manufacturing sectors, while others have pursued academic careers at institutions such as Penn State, UCSB, and the University of Puerto Rico Mayag&uuml;ez. The award played a crucial role in bridging academic research with industry applications, fostering the next generation of materials scientists and engineers who will drive advancements in powder metallurgy and metal additive manufacturing. By integrating research exposure, industry mentorship, and professional networking, this award has supported the NSF's broader impact goals of workforce development and the advancement of U.S. manufacturing capabilities.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 03/03/2025<br>\nModified by: Yong-Jie&nbsp;Hu</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n></div>\n</div>\n",
