 "awd_abstract_narration": "The AI for Youth ExLent Explorations project aims to democratize access to cutting-edge artificial intelligence (AI) education, providing students from diverse backgrounds and educational profiles with the opportunity to learn vital AI topics. In a world where AI technologies are increasingly ubiquitous, ensuring inclusivity in AI education is paramount for building future technologies on principles of equity and fairness. Despite this imperative, challenges such as the lack of teacher training in AI and a comprehensive pedagogical framework impede the integration of AI into K-12 curricula, specifically in under-represented schools. AI for Youth aims to prepare the next generation of AI innovators irrespective of gender, ethnicity, or socioeconomic status. By targeting underrepresented minority and low-income high school students, the project aims to demystify AI career pathways and empower students to address social issues through AI-powered solutions.\r\n\r\nAI for Youth also empowers high school teachers to implement an innovative AI curriculum, thereby inspiring and motivating high school students, particularly those from underserved groups, to pursue careers in AI. Through a multifaceted approach, the initiative equips teachers with essential AI skills, offers transformative learning experiences for students, and fosters proficiencies in communication, leadership, and teamwork necessary for success in higher education and AI-related careers. The initiative includes a comprehensive paid internship program for high school students and a mentorship model pairing faculty members and graduate students with teachers and students. The project encourages leadership, problem-solving, and critical thinking by engaging students in action-oriented, team-based activities. Overall, AI for Youth seeks to cultivate a diverse, creative, and ethical AI workforce while empowering students to address real-world challenges through AI innovation. This initiative is in accordance with the NSF ExLENT Program, which is supported by the NSF TIP and EDU Directorates.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
