 "awd_abstract_narration": "Acquisition of a new multicollector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (MC-ICP-MS) will replace an aging instrument maintained by the Trace Element and Radiogenic Isotope Lab (TRAIL) at University of Arkansas. The  new instrument will support critical advances in our understanding of Pb-Zn (lead-zinc) ore formation and development of novel Pb-isotope techniques for repatriating human remains to Native American peoples. The acquisition of this new MC-ICP-MS extends these impactful efforts and supports the development of innovative new research programs relevant to geology, hydrology, archeology, and paleobiology. These include research on quantification of metal loads transported by streams draining lead and zinc mining districts in the southern Ozark region, which provides critical environmental and societal need for residents of Oklahoma, Arkansas, and Missouri. The new equipment supports ongoing broader  impacts for Native American tribes in the Tri-State lead and zinc mining district. This district has had a history of unsustainable development of resources, which led to long-lasting effects on the people, including the Cherokee, Miami, and Quapaw nations. The Tar Creek Superfund Site is the only tribal-led reclamation of the nation. Therefore, this work provides critical information for a better understanding of the challenges of sustainable ecosystem management. In addition, Pb-isotope analysis of human remains allows identification of their ancient human geographic origins and their cultural affiliations. In collaboration with tribes throughout the south-central U.S.A., co-PI Samuelsen\u2019s assessment of contamination and novel MC-ICP-MS technique will continue enabling the successful repatriation of human remains. \r\n\r\nThe replacement MC-ICP-MS will have a transformative impact on research at institutional, regional, and state levels. At the institutional level, the acquisition will support several Earth science-, archeology-, and biology-related research activities of a diverse team consisting of one early-career archeologist, four NSF-funded mid-career geoscientists, and four additional UA faculty members. These activities include: (1) constraining the sources and genesis of hydrothermal Pb-Zn ore deposits, (2) determining the provenance of Native American artifacts, human remains, and ancient animals, (3) development of split-stream laser ablation techniques for analysis of zircon and monazite for constraining the evolution of continental crust and provenance of clastic sediments, (4) analysis of biogenic phosphate and fossil bone for constraining rates and mechanisms of fossilization and the depositional environment of bone beds, (5) in situ chronology and isotopic analysis of Apollo Moon rocks, and (6) determining the source and quality of Arkansas waters. At the regional and state levels, successful integration of the new acquisition permits the TRAIL facility to become one of less than twenty laser ablation split-stream facilities in the U.S. and enable new advances in this emerging field. TRAIL has a positive history of instrument management and research productivity with strong institutional support. Since 2016, the facility has been serving a diverse and regional group of users with critical instrumental needs beyond our EPSCoR institution. The new state-of-the-art MC-ICP-MS will enhance training of the next generation of multi-disciplinary scientists at the University of Arkansas. In addition, it will be used in undergraduate and graduate course work related to geochemistry, petrology and loaboratory methods in archeology to enhance technical skils of students.This award is funded by the Division of Earth Sciences and the Instrumentation and Facilities programs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
