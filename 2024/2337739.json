 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Faculty Early Career development (CAREER) award supports research that will apply experimental and computational strategies to quantify the biomechanical properties of periventricular white matter and its age-related degeneration. Brain aging is characterized by progressive neurodegeneration that inescapably leads to cognitive slowing and functional decline. As such, corresponding cell-level changes manifest on the organ-level as brain shape changes in the form of cortical thinning, white matter shrinking, and \u2013 most notably \u2013 lateral ventricular enlargement. The research seeks to study how progressive tissue loss drives ventricular enlargement, leads to tissue damage associated with neuroinflammation and axon loss and is clearly visible in medical imaging of the brain. The framework will explain the impact of decade-long brain shape changes on functional brain structures, such as the ventricular wall. This work could lead to potential identification of subjects showing signs of abnormal aging early on. The research will also inform educational activities that aim at educating the public about basic brain aging mechanisms and fostering early interest in science, engineering, and medicine among underrepresented groups in STEM. That includes contributions to the annual Brain Awareness Week as well as research opportunities catered to 10th-graders and undergraduate engineering students.  \r\n\r\nThe specific goal of the research is to combine medical image registration, mechanical characterization, and constitutive modeling to fundamentally understand the relationship between organ-level tissue volume loss and periventricular tissue degeneration during aging. Thus, the research objectives of this project include to (i) infer ventricular enlargement from longitudinal image data; (ii) to quantify the evolving properties of periventricular tissues; and (iii) to establish a constitutive brain aging model that predicts ventricular enlargement and corresponding periventricular whiter matter lesion locations. Upon completion of the work, it will become clear (i) how cerebral atrophy drives microstructural degeneration of periventricular white matter tissue and (ii) how the severity of age-related brain shape changes is a reliable predictor for the brain\u2019s overall state of health. Additionally, the tools arising from this work will be an important addition to the soft tissue biomechanics community. The overarching focus will be on using the newly generated knowledge to identify subjects that are at increased risk for early periventricular white matter lesion formation. This project will ultimately allow the PI to advance the emerging field of computational and experimental neuromechanics and establish his long-term career in brain health.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
