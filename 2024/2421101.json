 "awd_abstract_narration": "Technical:\r\nThe International Workshop on Nitride Semiconductors (IWN) is a renowned biennial academic\r\nconference with a rich history spanning 24 years. Focusing on cutting-edge research in III-Nitrides semiconductors, IWN is a global platform that brings together almost 1,000 experts, researchers, faculty, and students from around the world. In 2024, IWN is set to take place in Honolulu, Hawai'i, (November 3-8) promising to be a significant milestone in the field.\r\nThis conference will bring together almost 1,000 participants from academy, industry, and\r\ngovernment to share their recent results in their respective III-Nitrides research. All these\r\nparticipants come from around the world to discuss the latest progress in the area while enriching the community by introducing students and new scientists to the community.\r\n\r\nNon-Technical:\r\nThe International Workshop on Nitride Semiconductors (IWN) 2024 holds immense significance\r\nfor the United States and the global semiconductor community. It serves as a beacon of innovation, collaboration, and inclusivity.\r\nThe IWN conference is consistent with NSF efforts on funding opportunities for engineering research in microelectronics and semiconductors, specifically in the fields of Wide-bandgap and ultrawide- bandgap semiconductor devices and circuits. The funds will be used to partially cover student registrations and will provide 5 fellowships for junior faculty or students to fully cover their registrations from EPSCoR eligible jurisdictions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
