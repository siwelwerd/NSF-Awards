 "awd_abstract_narration": "There are millions of potential power wheelchair drivers today for whom independent mobility is difficult, or even entirely impossible. The result is a deprivation-for persons with disabilities, and their caregivers-of independence and engagement within the community and workforce. This project proposes to accelerate the accessibility and utility of power wheelchairs by radically changing how control inputs are captured from the human body and transferred to the machine, and by leveraging practical machine intelligence to enhance safety and facilitate independent wheelchair operation. \r\n\r\nThe wheelchair industry has yet to fully harness AI and driver assistance tools to help ensure safety and efficacy. In 2020 this began to change, as the first commercially-available, FDA-registered driver assistance system for power wheelchairs entered the market (LUCI). There remains a gap however between their (subtractive-only) assistance and the automation achieved by robot companies or even automobile driver assistance. From active steering around obstacles to semi-autonomous navigation, the potential impact for active driving assistance is tremendous. \r\n\r\nThis project will bring to market the first active driving assistance system for power wheelchairs. It also will continue to develop and advocate for a digital and open wheelchair communication standard, and develop a flexible control interface that conforms to an individual's abilities and preferences. With these innovations, the project will greatly expand access to independent mobility by those with severe motor impairments-which is significant for both for quality of life and participation in the workforce, and by both persons with disabilities and their caregivers. \r\n\r\nThe partners on this convergence accelerator include stakeholders to provide hands-on use and clinical expertise that guides the prototype design, and engineers to realize and later translate that design. The partnership spans non-profits (AbleGamers, Shirley Ryan AbilityLab), academia (Northwestern University), and industry (LUCI Mobility, Function Engineering, LifeDrive).\r\n\r\nThe following research thrusts will accomplish this work:\r\n\r\n- Thrust 1: Advancing safety and independence with wheelchair intelligence that provides active, as well as fully autonomous, driving assistance. We will bring to market active driving assistance within a commercial sensor-based wheelchair safety system (LUCI).\r\n\r\n- Thrust 2: Modernizing and democratizing the wheelchair input mechanism, by advocating for the adoption of a digital and open-source API (the Wheelchair Digital Interface) as the ISO/RESNA standard for communication between wheelchair control systems and control inputs-opening the door to any digital interface being used to drive a power wheelchair. \r\n\r\n- Thrust 3: Bridging the gap in accessible wheelchair control between drivers who can operate a joystick and those who cannot, through the development of a flexible and multimodal control interface that conforms to the user and captures control signals from nearly anywhere on their body, and can be used in concert with existing interfaces for both wheelchair and computer control.\r\n\r\nThe assistive wheelchair market is ready for the integration of these advanced capabilities, and persons with degenerative diseases in particular need this greatly expanded scope of assistance without delay.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
