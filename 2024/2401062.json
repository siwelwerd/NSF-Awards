 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 2023 International Conference on Microbiome Engineering will focus on the latest advances in microbiome engineering and fundamental microbiome research. The conference will bring together key stakeholders from academia and industry who have expertise in the fields of systems biology, synthetic biology, microbiology, biotechnology and bioengineering. The conference\u2019s program includes many aspects of microbiome research, including fundamental studies of microbiome dynamics, experimental and computational tools for engineering microbiomes, and the industrial, environmental, and food applications of microbiome engineering. The conference is distinct from other microbiome conferences, as it specifically highlights the integration of engineering design principles with fundamental microbiome research. A major goal of the conference is to create an environment where a diverse group of researchers can gather and exchange information. Additionally, the conference aims to give students and post-doctoral researchers opportunities to share their work, to network with the foremost leaders in the field, and to develop their careers.\r\n\r\nThe 2023 International Conference on Microbiome Engineering connects experts from academia and industry to share the field\u2019s most recent developments. Notable areas of research include genetically engineered organisms that function within microbiomes, control of microbiomes through environmental modifications, identifying engineering principles for microbiomes, and industrial, environmental, and food applications of microbiome engineering. This conference is distinct from other microbiome conferences, specifically highlighting the integration of engineering design principles with microbiome research. The conference integrates synthetic biology, systems biology, microbial ecology, and bioinformatics across a range of application spaces, from the environment, to manufacturing, to food, to human health.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
