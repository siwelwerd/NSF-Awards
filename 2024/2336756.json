 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national interest by enhancing Peer+, a free tool that supports Peer Instruction. When using Peer Instruction an instructor displays a question that students answer individually. The students then discuss the question with nearby peers and refine their answers. Peer+ will add two new ways for students to discuss the question with their peers through (1) a text-chat for answering questions during lecture, and (2) a pseudo text-chat for answering questions after lecture. While there is substantial evidence for the effectiveness of Peer Instruction, preliminary research at the University of Michigan has found that using text-chat during lectures improved learning. Peer Instruction is known to improve retention in STEM classes, especially for students from minoritized groups. Providing new types of peer discussion could further improve retention and thus increase the number and diversity of students who succeed in STEM classes.\r\n\r\nThe research associated with this project will increase knowledge about effective STEM education and approaches that attempt to reduce barriers to adoption of Peer Instruction. Since it can be hard for instructors to find the time to adopt new teaching methods, a summer instructor workshop will be offered, and follow-up support will be provided. The project will investigate (1) the effect of three different modes for peer discussion on learning and student satisfaction at four institutions and in a variety of courses, (2) the effect of the Peer+ tool on student retention, and (3) how instructor attitudes towards and knowledge of Peer Instruction change due to a workshop, follow-up support, and use of Peer+. A design-based research approach will be used, based on theory, and the system will be evaluated in real educational settings. The research will be evaluated using both qualitative and quantitative measures. The NSF IUSE:EDU Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through the Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
