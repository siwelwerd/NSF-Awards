 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will use laboratory experiments and computer simulations to study the generation of waves in the interior of the ocean caused by different types of submarine ridges. Results will be compared to simplified theoretical concepts and will be used to propose approximations to this phenomenon in global-scale computer models. To test the validity of the results, they will also be compared to measurements that have already been obtained at two sites: off Hawaii and in the Luzon Strait. The project will support one graduate student and undergraduate interns. Laboratory experiments will be used to spark the interest of a wide range of students in topics related to fluid motions.\r\n\r\nThis study seeks to fill a gap in our understanding of the generation of internal waves in the ocean over idealized topography. Laboratory experiments and numerical simulations would try to decipher such generation mechanisms. The study would explore three specific effects caused by: (1) ridge complexity (number and amplitude of ridges superimposed on a larger topography); (2) slope asymmetry of the ridges (allowing supercritical and subcritical wave generation); and (3) varying topography shape. Nonlinear wave generation would be determined by comparing experiment results with linear theory. The study would also explore (4) alterations to ridge complexity, slope asymmetry and ridge shape and compare all results to more complex topographies and to measurements over Kaena Ridge and Luzon Strait. For Broader Impacts, the study is expected to provide better parameterizations of internal wave generation for global scale models. The project would also involve one graduate student and several undergraduate interns. In addition, laboratory methods and results would help develop outreach activities for high school and undergraduate students.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
