 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-Technical Abstract: This project advances the fields of inorganic and biological inorganic chemistry while providing significant educational opportunities at Texas Southern University, a Historically Black College and University. It develops novel ruthenium complexes and focuses on their unique molecular structures, holding potential for breakthroughs in areas ranging from catalysis to medicinal chemistry. The educational component engages students historically underrepresented in STEM fields. Through hands-on research experiences and robust mentorship programs, students gain invaluable skills and knowledge, enhancing their academic and professional prospects. This dual focus on cutting-edge research and inclusive education promises broader societal benefits, including the advancement of science and the empowerment of future scientists.\r\n\r\nTechnical Abstract: The research explores the reactivity of novel mono-ruthenium complexes coordinated with asymmetric chiral ligands. The project aims to understand how the molecular structure of these ruthenium complexes influences their chemical properties, particularly their interactions with nitric oxide and deoxyribonucleic acid. The research team synthesizes a series of mono-ruthenium complexes using oxazolidine-2-thione and thiazolidine-2-thione derivatives as ligands. Various synthetic routes are employed to obtain and characterize these complexes, investigating their structural, electrochemical, and spectroscopic properties. By examining the stereochemical effects and establishing comprehensive structure-reactivity profiles, this research project fills critical knowledge gaps and paves the way for innovative applications in catalysis, photochemistry, and medicinal chemistry. Ultimately, the findings contribute to the development of more efficient and selective functional materials, enhancing the understanding of ruthenium-based chemistry and its potential applications.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
