 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Earth Sciences Instrumentation and Facilities award supports the procurement of a Wavelength Dispersive X-ray Fluorescence Spectrometer (WD-XRF) for California State University, Bakersfield (CSUB), the sole comprehensive university within a 100-mile radius and a designated Hispanic-Serving Institution. The new WD-XRF, an analytical system, assesses complex matrix materials with a broad spectrum of light and heavy elements, ranging from trace to high concentration levels. The acquisition of this new instrument will enhance research capabilities across diverse disciplines at CSUB, including Geology, Engineering, Environmental Studies, Physics, and Agriculture. It plays an integral role in initiatives aimed at boosting minority student enrollment and retention, elevating educational achievements, and fostering research skills in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math fields. The instrument also contributes to community outreach efforts, including the high school dual credit program.\r\n\r\nThe new WD-XRF system is one fully automated benchtop XRF, featuring a 12-sample changer and sample spin capability for student use with minimal training. It eliminates the need for cooling water, reducing maintenance and ownership costs. With superior sensitivity and spectral resolution compared to Energy Dispersive XRF spectrometers, it rivals larger WD-XRF systems. Its introduction to CSUB will bring advanced technological capabilities, leading to research advancements in areas including upcycling of mine tailings, polymeric composite materials, agricultural-waste-derived catalysts for energy and resource recovery, paleoceanography, and paleoclimate. Beyond its technical capabilities, the instrument will pave the way for new research directions at CSUB, encouraging collaborative projects among faculty from different departments and facilitating partnerships with researchers from other institutions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
