 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project accelerates the development of potential new drug options for improved survival outcomes of cancer patients with greatly reduced time and costs. This project will use a novel artificial intelligence (AI) technology that utilizes big data to comprehensively discover repositioning drugs for treating refractory non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients after exhausting all therapeutic options. Drug repositioning (also known as drug repurposing) involves the investigation of existing drugs for new therapeutic purposes. The software product enables oncologists to select repositioning drugs and design clinical trials. This project will specifically aid oncologists who do not have options to treat cancer patients after the prior therapies failed as well as their patients. The novel partnership between subject experts in academia and industry will increase the effectiveness of the technology. The software product built during the project can facilitate the research and development at pharmaceutical companies, benefit millions of cancer patients, and reduce the healthcare burden by improving the quality of care.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will test the feasibility of developing a software product developed using a patented artificial intelligence (AI) technology that enables oncologists to choose among repositioning drugs for the treatment of lung cancer in patients with failed prior therapies. Based on established proofs of concept, this project will develop a software product with a cloud-based backend data portal with more than 378 therapeutic compounds discovered using AI technology for treating lung cancer.  The solution will also have a web-based frontend with a graphical user interface for oncologists to select a repositioning drug based on patient responder characteristics and new indications for treating lung cancer. Since the safety profiles of repositioning drugs are established, the efficacy test of their new indications can bypass preclinical studies and Phase I clinical trials. The software product can accelerate Phase II/III clinical trials of the new indications of existing drugs for Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval. Meanwhile, this solution will also facilitate new drug development for pharmaceutical companies. Once feasibility is validated, the team will expand the software product to other cancer types.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
