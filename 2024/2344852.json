 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of technology that advances belowground root systems analysis using x-ray computed tomography (XCT) scans. This technology enables the accurate identification and quantification of live and dead roots, providing information about the health and structure of root systems. Beyond applications in agriculture, forestry, environmental conservation and land management, this technology has the potential to change how we understand and interact with belowground ecosystems, particularly in wetland ecosystems. By offering insights into wetland root systems, this technology may address pressing global challenges such as climate change and land management in these critical environments. The tool paves the way for sustainable development and commercial growth in various industries to improve the overall understanding of root ecosystems within wetlands and beyond.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on the development of the \"X-Roots\" technology, which utilizes advanced algorithms to analyze x-ray computed tomography (XCT) scans of belowground root systems. These algorithms enable the segmentation and classification of root components, including macro-pores, dead roots, live roots, and sediments, with a high degree of precision. The project aims to refine and tailor this technology to meet the unique needs of potential customers across diverse sectors. The innovation potential of X-Roots ranges from optimizing agricultural practices by evaluating soil health and nutrient uptake to enhance environmental conservation efforts by providing detailed insights into intricate root networks in wetlands. By making visible the hidden world beneath the Earth's surface, X-Roots expands understanding of root systems and their impact on ecosystems. This, in turn, opens the door for innovation, conservation, and commercial growth in potentially multiple industries.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
