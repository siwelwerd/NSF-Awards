 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) grant will advance fundamental understanding of the vascular lesions of human vocal folds. These lesions refer to dilated blood vessels in the fold\u2019s tissue and are particularly common in professions with high voice usage, such as educators, public speakers, and singers. The presence of vascular lesions and their potential rupture affect the ability of the tissue to vibrate normally, which severely disrupts speech and leads to vocal fatigue. However, the underlying mechanisms of lesion growth and fatigue resulting from this condition remain uncertain. There is thus a significant need to investigate the effects of vascular lesions on the phonation process. This project will develop predictive computational models of coupled aerodynamics, hemodynamics, and solid mechanics to account for these lesions, their progression, and the corresponding voice fatigue. The resultant framework will enable improvements in biomechanical models of the human larynx, while such models are also being considered for potential use in surgical interventions, enhancement in prevention of voice disorders, and exploring issues related to voice training. Along with the development and dissemination of technical tools, the award will also support the education and training of underrepresented minorities, expansion through virtual and on-site outreach activities to inspire appreciation of phonation biomechanics within a general audience and connect with interested patients, as well as interaction with pre-collegiate students from marginalized backgrounds through an annual summer workshop. \r\n\r\nThe specific goal of the research is to analyze the three-way interaction between the vascular lesion, poroviscoelastic vocal fold tissue, and glottal airflow, to illustrate the biomechanical characteristics of the tissue and quantify metrics that are hypothesized to be associated with vocal fatigue. Therefore, the research objectives of this project include: (1) developing a fully coupled multi-component fluid-poroelastic structure interaction modeling approach integrating the turbulent glottal airflow and permeable fold tissue in presence of vascular lesions to assess voice fatigue indicators, (2) creating a computational solver for modeling the lesion progression in the form of the pressure-driven crack filled with blood propagating in the poroelastic tissue to explore the significance of phonation conditions, and (3) quantifying the uncertainty in the model predictions using a Monte-Carlo type simulation approach to evaluate how various physical parameters and morphological features affect the fold\u2019s biomechanics and lesion propagation. This project will enable the PI to advance the knowledge base in mechanics and computational simulation, establishing the foundation for her long-term career in speech biomechanics.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
