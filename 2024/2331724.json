 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project introduces a non-flammable and affordable stationary energy storage solution. Renewable energy generation has significantly increased over the past decade; however, in order for renewable electricity to be fully utilized along with demand and without curtailment, accompanying energy storage is a necessity. Storage capacity is currently lacking and must catch up with renewable generation to ensure a stable and clean grid. Current state-of-the-art lithium-ion storage solutions remain expensive, hazardous, and subject to global supply chain constraints. The technology involved in this project halves the cost of production compared to lithium-ion, is non-flammable, and utilizes abundant, domestically sourced materials. Advancing the technology in this project will open up new energy storage market opportunities, lower the barrier to adoption for energy storage, eliminate the risk of battery fires, and maximize the usage of renewable energy.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project develops and demonstrates a new battery in the commercially-relevant amp-hour scale, bringing it from the lab to market. Demonstrating its properties at this scale, namely its energy density, cost, manufacturability, electrochemical properties, and non-flammability, will provide crucial technology and manufacturing validation for the stationary energy storage space. Widespread adoption of this technology will bring about peak power reduction, energy cost reductions, reduced frequency of service interruptions and lower overall greenhouse gas emissions. The Phase I research efforts have successfully demonstrated the feasibility and stability of the chemistry, and the Phase II project will develop an Amp hour (Ah)-level commercially relevant cell product for third party testing and customer validation, as well as for the performance of tests to meet regulatory standards, such as UL 9540A for battery systems. New, safe energy storage technologies are necessary to meet increasing global energy demands, stabilize the grid, and accelerate further renewable energy generation.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
