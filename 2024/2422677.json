 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-Technical\r\nThe future response of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet (EAIS) to climate change and its consequent effect on global sea level remains a pressing problem, with implications for societal well-being, the economy, and national security. Projections of future ice-sheet behavior rely in part on understanding gained from ice-sheet response to past climate change, which can be found in geologic records. This project uses geologic features produced at the base of the ice sheet to examine a large change in EAIS behavior and to place ages on when this change occurred. By comparison to climate records from the same time, the project results will allow assessment of ice-sheet response to a climate that likely was warmer than at present. Such information will improve understanding of possible ice-sheet responses to a warming climate, as well as the underlying mechanisms.  A better assessment of the likely EAIS response to future warming climate will aid in setting national and international policy and improve public welfare, by promoting more accurate predictions of the amounts and rates of sea-level rise. This project will contribute to the education of young scientists, thereby increasing the STEM workforce, which is in the national interest. A general-audience book will be produced to explain the importance of Antarctica to the public.\r\n\r\nTechnical\r\nAccurate, well-dated reconstructions of the behavior of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet (EAIS) afford insight into its response to future climate change. This project uses new insights in subglacial hydrology and erosion to identify and date a major missing piece of Antarctic glacial history, involving massive expansion of the EAIS over the Transantarctic Mountains. This expansion led to formation of an extensive erosional landscape that was characterized by subglacial meltwater and represents a significant shift in ice-sheet behavior. Understanding the age and reasons for such an expansion are important in part, because the subglacial meltwater must have been linked to the Wilkes Subglacial Basin \u2013 an area thought to be susceptible to large-scale ice collapse under warm climates. The project will constrain the extent and age of this surface through 1) detailed geomorphological mapping from imagery, 2) reassessment of existing chronologic data, and 3) new surface exposure dating of existing samples. Results will test the hypothesis that the scoured surface and the ice-sheet behavior that it represents is much younger than its traditionally assigned age of \u226514 Ma and thus relevant to current investigations into ice-sheet behavior under warmer-than-present climates. The work affords mentoring opportunities for students of all ages and will include the production of a book on the landscapes of the Transantarctic Mountains designed to introduce the public to the importance of Antarctica.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
