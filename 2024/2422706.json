 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is to provide partial support for attendees of The 21st International Fibonacci Conference which will run from July 8th to 12th, 2024 at Harvey Mudd College in California. Fibonacci numbers in particular and recurrence relations in general arise in many areas. Thus there are many colleagues at all levels, from R1 institutions to teaching colleges to general scientists, working on problems in the field. The goal is to provide an inviting avenue for people to present their work and meet other interested parties. By bringing together a diverse group of researchers and practitioners we expect, as has happened in previous years, to have a productive meeting where several vantage points are provided to researchers to help suggest approaches and related problems; based on successes from previous conferences we expect many new collaborations to form. We have expanded topics from previous years to include applications in mathematical biology, music, and secondary education to excite the next generation of students. Run by the Fibonacci Association, many of the talks will be recorded and made publicly available, and papers related to the talks will be published as a conference proceedings as a special issue of the Fibonacci Quarterly.\r\n\r\nWith two sessions each day which can be attended in person or by zoom, speakers will discuss their work in 20 minute talks. Topics range from applications to $L$-functions to graph theory to combinatorial games to mathematics education to music to expanded predator-prey models in mathematical biology. There will also be 1-2 problem sessions where researchers will discuss both problems related to their talks as well as accessible topics for young researchers; the goal is to build research groups with senior personnel mentoring the large number of young mathematicians in attendance. For more information see:\r\nhttps://21stinternationalfibonacciconference.wordpress.com/ .\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
