 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project aims to develop a Hands-Off-Detection (HOD) system for the vehicle steering wheel with integrated heating functionality, addressing the performance and implementation issues of current solutions, and replacing traditional, more cumbersome systems with a simplified design and the use of proprietary electronic textiles. The broad impact of this project is helping to mitigate human errors that cause driving accidents, significantly reducing the economic costs associated with motor vehicle accidents, and ultimately, helping to save lives. Additionally, the innovation promotes sustainability by minimizing waste and material consumption through the integration of electronic components directly into fabric. This eco-friendly approach will not only enhance fuel efficiency in transportation applications but also offers streamlined manufacturing processes and ease of recycling, addressing the challenge of electronic waste. Furthermore, the project supports the advancement of flexible circuit technology, potentially benefiting other sectors such as medical devices, robotics, and smart clothing. Hands-Off-Detection is a crucial and mandatory element of any steering assistance system. Specifically, all cars with Line-Keeping-Assistance are required to have Hands-Off-Detection. The global market size for this component is estimated to reach $721 million by 2030.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this project lies in its innovative approach to integrating a Hands-Off-Detection system with heating functionality within a vehicle steering wheel using special electronic textile technology. The core innovation replaces the traditional, bulky two-electrode capacitive touch sensors with a single antenna system, enhancing reliability and reducing material use. The primary research objectives are to demonstrate the feasibility of this new Hands-Off-Detection and Heating component by ensuring it meets critical technical parameters, performs consistently across the full automotive interior temperature range, and achieves a reduced carbon footprint. The research will involve building and testing a functional prototype in a controlled lab environment, focusing on minimizing false readings and interference, optimizing sensor response time, and achieving uniform heating performance. Anticipated technical results include a thinner, more flexible, and easier-to-integrate Hands-Off-Detection & Heating component that not only meets but exceeds the performance standards of existing solutions. Additionally, this project aims to validate the environmental benefits of the proprietary electronic textile technology used to build this automotive component, ensuring it provides a sustainable alternative to current market leaders. This project is expected to advance the field of electronic textiles, providing a robust, scalable solution for automotive and potentially other applications.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
