 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact of this I-Corps project is the development of a drug to mitigate/recover from long-term neurotoxic side effects of radiation. This technology holds promise in managing radiation injuries during cancer treatment. By targeting mitochondrial dysfunction and promoting the growth of neural progenitor cells, the approach aims to address radiation induced injuries during surface cancer therapy. This technology may also help mitigate/recover from long-term neurotoxic side effects of radiation. Cognitive impairment and white matter disease are common concerns in patients undergoing radiation therapy; Protecting or regenerating neural progenitor cells may alleviate these issues. This approach could enhance patient outcomes and improve quality of life. Potential markets include patients with surface cancer (i.e., breast, head, and neck cancers).\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. This solution is based on the development of a drug to mitigate/recover mitochondrial dysfunction from long-term neurotoxic side effects of radiation. This technology represents a groundbreaking approach in the management of radiation injuries as it has not been explored previously. Radiation damages critical tissues. Agents that are safe and promote neural progenitor cells growth in affected areas may promote tissue repair and regeneration. This effect may not only replace damaged cells faster but also modulate the inflammatory response. Moreover, the product can cross the blood-brain barrier, reaching brain regions affected by radiation and offering localized repair.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
