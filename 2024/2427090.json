 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to develop fundamental design principles for molecular qubit quantum sensors. The project team will exploit key quantum features of molecules to enhance the sensitivity and response of both optical and electrical sensors.  These fundamental advances in sensor design have potential applications from materials to biology. By leveraging Rowan University's strong connection to the South Jersey area and the extensive quantum science network of the University of Chicago, the team will expand the impact of both universities by bringing quantum training and opportunities to the local community in South Jersey.  Efforts include a graduate student exchange program and a community college outreach program.  As quantum information for science and engineering is a vital and growing field in the modern research environment, this project will contribute to developing new fundamental principles for the design of more effective quantum sensors and equipping students through research and outreach with highly desirable skills for future careers in both industry and academia.\r\n\r\nThe second quantum revolution is underway bringing with it the promise of a new generation of novel electric and magnetic field sensors of unparalleled sensitivity.  Designing a quantum sensor that processes single-charge detection sensitivity, however, requires a thorough understanding of the dynamics of coherent electronic states in strongly correlated molecules.  The project team will be developing fundamental design principles to enhance the sensitivity and response of both optical and electrical sensors by exploiting key quantum features including entanglement and strong electron correlation. Research thrusts include (1) leveraging strongly correlated electrons in ground and excited states to amplify and enhance the optical sensitivity and response of molecular qubit sensors and (2) exploiting strong correlation in non-equilibrium steady states to optimize the electrical response of the sensors. Rowan University and its network of community colleges are providing a conduit for reaching a student population that has not yet been exposed to the opportunities provided by quantum information science.  Broader impact efforts include (1) a graduate student exchange program and (2) QISE outreach at local community colleges in South Jersey. The graduate student exchange program will send Rowan Ph.D. students to the University of Chicago for training and research and attract Ph.D. students from the University of Chicago to assist in developing its quantum science program. The outreach efforts at local community colleges will introduce local students to the field and engage the next generation of undergraduate quantum researchers. In combination, these efforts will create new opportunities for training the future quantum workforce.\r\n\r\nThis award is co-funded by the Advancing Informal STEM Learning program.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
