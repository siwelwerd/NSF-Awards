 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is to advance the conversion of gas turbines for power generation to utilize sustainable hydrogen as a fuel. Although hydrogen offers zero exhaust emissions, it poses challenges due to its higher flame temperature and reactivity with alloys compared to natural gas. This project focuses on developing a high-temperature alloy system, fabricated through additive manufacturing, ensuring longevity and reliability in hydrogen combustion environments. Through scaling a patent-pending thermal treatment, the project aims to enhance the alloy's material properties for durable aftermarket parts like vanes, blades, shrouds, and panel segments. These components can surpass the properties of existing precision investment castings and are essential for converting industrial gas turbines to efficiently burn hydrogen, currently powering a significant portion of US combined heat and power and global electricity generation. The carbon abatement potential is substantial, with the conversion of one targeted segment capable of reducing over 1 GT of CO2 emissions. The innovation extends to manufacturing advanced, high-value components for aerospace jet engine repair and overhaul, presenting a potential Year 3 production revenue of $20 million and providing critical supply base resiliency for hard-to-source components in gas turbines. \r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project aims to advance additively manufactured, high-temperature alloy research, focusing on applications in hydrogen combustion within industrial gas turbines. The project will fabricate mechanical and environmental test specimens using an alloy composition containing oxide dispersion-strengthening constituents designed specifically to withstand reactive hydrogen conditions. Testing will encompass critical properties like creep resistance, low cycle fatigue, and hydrogen embrittlement. A pivotal aspect involves post-processing the alloy through directional heat treatment and modifying the grain structure to enhance creep resistance, which is critical in the high-temperature operation of vane segments, shrouds, blades, and gas turbine components. Studies show superior properties compared to existing additively manufactured superalloys and precision investment cast equivalents. The project's objectives include optimizing the alloy, refining manufacturing conditions, and obtaining key performance data for service conditions. Preliminary design curve data will be established, facilitating the fabrication of components for hot-fire testing and retrofitting into real gas turbine engines. This initiative promises significant progress in high-temperature alloy capabilities, particularly for advancing hydrogen combustion technology in industrial gas turbines.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
