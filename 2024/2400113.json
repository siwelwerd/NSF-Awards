 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides three years of funding to help defray the expenses of participants in the semi-annual conference series \"Brazos Analysis Seminar\" 2024-2026, the first meeting of which will be held in Spring 2024 at Texas Christian University. Subsequent meetings will rotate among the University of Texas at Austin, University of Houston, Texas A&M University, and Baylor University. The Brazos Analysis Seminar will bring together analysts at academic institutions within the South-Central region of the United States on a regular basis to communicate their research, with a particular emphasis on providing an opportunity for young researchers and graduate students to meet, collaborate and disseminate their work on a regular basis during the academic year. The format for the seminar provides ample opportunity for graduate students, postdocs, and junior investigators to present their work, start new collaborations, learn about the latest developments in modern analysis, and to advance their careers. \r\n\r\nThe scientific topics of this conference series will focus on the analytic theory of operator algebras and operator space theories and their connections to harmonic analysis, ergodic theory, dynamic systems, and the quantum information theory. These include free probability method in the study of quantum groups, Fourier multipliers theory on noncommutative Lp spaces, dynamical system, and K-theory of C*-algebras and von Neumann algebras. In each meeting, there will be 3 plenary talks given by prominent experts and 6 contributed talks presented by 3 experts from the region, and 3 postdoctoral or upper level PhD students. The goal is to keep both junior and senior researchers in the south-central institutions exposed and informed of the latest major mathematical developments in noncommutative Analysis, and to enhance and advance the research on the related topics. Additional information is available on the seminar website https://sites.google.com/site/brazosanalysisseminar.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
