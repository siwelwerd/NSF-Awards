 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader/commercial impact of this SBIR Phase I project is the successful addressing of longstanding institutional problems that have historically plagued American society. Data is clear in showing that American institutions perpetuate a myriad of problems that have not been successfully addressed (e.g., inequitable wages and access to resources; harmful climates including bullying and harassment, abuse of vulnerable populations). These problems impact the health and well-being of institutions and the individuals within them. These problems also have slowed the evolution of science and the ability of the United States and its citizens to thrive into the future. This project involves the creation of an online platform (informed by research in social and organizational psychology) that will address institutional problems on a far-reaching scale to promote a better humanity. This platform is aimed at eliminating destructive institutional behaviors, and aimed toward increasing integrity, equity, inclusion, community, and honor in institutions. It will promote institutional accountability and will address institutional problems with greater permanency than has been achieved in the past. It will positively impact all American outcomes (e.g., increase economic competitiveness and healthcare access, improve military institutions and national defense, improve educational institutions, and increase the happiness of all citizens).\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will create a novel multi-component platform that is designed to integrate and analyze data provided by users regarding their institutional affiliations. It will be designed (based in research in social and organizational psychology) to have a positive impact on humanity by addressing institutional problems that have not heretofore been addressed successfully. The deep technical complexity includes the creation of a multi-component and multi-function platform that has web-based applications and is scalable across multiple devices. The technology will incorporate complex statistical analysis of institutional data that is provided by users who are institutional members or affiliates. The technology will integrate and summarize accumulated data and will yield an institutional score that represents each institution. Constructing this platform will be a cyclic, iterative process: (1) The design stage involves considerations of human behavior, eliciting information from targeted users and then incorporating results into the design. (2) The implementation stage involves programming and rapid prototyping. (3) The evaluation stage involves empirical research aimed at usability testing. The technical goal is to create a human-centered software, service, and system that improves lives through the innovative technology and the societal issues it aims to address.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
