 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of solutions aimed at enhancing healthcare information security and transparency. While focused on data security and price transparency, the project scope examines the multifaceted challenges faced by patients, providers, and payers. By addressing these complexities, the initiative seeks to ensure transparent and affordable healthcare while fostering informed and empowered patient-provider relationships. The project streamlines healthcare processes, improves accessibility, and builds trust among stakeholders. \r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on the development of a machine learning cybersecurity risk analysis framework tailored to the evolving vulnerabilities in fifth-generation (5G) connected systems, notably the 5G Connected Network (5GCN) deployed within healthcare networks. This project seeks to identify and mitigate the complexities of cybersecurity threats posed by the integration of Network Function Virtualization (NFV), Software Defined Networking (SDN), and malicious Input/Output (IO) peripherals. Through comprehensive analysis and pattern recognition, 119 potential exploits have been identified, highlighting the vulnerability interactions that compromise 5GCN security. Furthermore, this research demonstrates how compromised 5GCNs trigger distinct attacks within the 5G Authentication and Key Agreement protocol, exposing vulnerabilities at the application layer. The findings underscore the need for enhanced security measures within healthcare systems, aligning with industry demands for robust data protection frameworks to facilitate transparent and secure information accessibility for all key stakeholders.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
