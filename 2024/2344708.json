 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of a nonreciprocal photonic solution for solar energy harvesting systems. Compared to traditional solar cells, this proposed technology enables continuous electricity production in a cost-effective manner, operates around the clock, demonstrates compactness, scalability, and portability, and, most importantly, exhibits significantly higher efficiency compared to traditional solar photovoltaic systems. In addition, the portable nature of this technology makes it particularly suitable for deployment in underdeveloped regions and areas where establishing conventional power plants is challenging. The scalability allows for integration into existing power grids, presenting a green solution for facilitating electricity generation in concentrated solar energy power plants. The proposed technology may be beneficial to the safe operation of solar energy power plants and the energy security of the US. With the nonreciprocal functionality, the efficiency of solar power plants can be improved significantly. Such improvement may translate to more clean energy and, therefore, increase national energy security. Overall, the adoption of this technology represents a significant stride towards transitioning away from oil and gas as the primary fuel for power plants and embracing cleaner sources of energy for electricity generation. \r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on the development of a nonreciprocal photonic device that may be used in solar thermophotovoltaics to improve conversion efficiency. Using this proposed technology, the undesired back emission from the intermediate layer at elevated temperatures may be significantly suppressed. Recent theoretical analysis shows that the efficiency of solar energy harvesting may be pushed to the theoretical upper limit with nonreciprocal photonic functionality.  Regarding dispatchability and compactness, the nonreciprocal solar thermophotovoltaic technology is designed to couple with thermal storage components and provide on-demand electric power and the system that may be scaled up or down based on the power demand.  In addition, the proposed technology is designed to be integrated into traditional solar thermophotovoltaic systems by upgrading the intermediate layer. All other parts in the upper and lower stream of the intermediate layer should have no need to be changed.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
