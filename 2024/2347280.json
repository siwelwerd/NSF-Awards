 "awd_abstract_narration": "There is a high demand in the Georgia Piedmont Technical College (GPTC) service region, and nationwide, for trained mechatronics technicians to support this critical industry.  Mechatronics is a cutting-edge field that merges mechanics, electronics, and computer science to create intelligent machines and systems.  To support this growing demand, the project will implement a pathway for military veterans to have an immersive learning experience exposing them to the mechatronics career field.  Veterans are uniquely qualified for this field; even those without direct technology training make ideal candidates for a technical position in the civilian workforce, as their military experiences have instilled discipline, teamwork, and leadership skills, key qualities that employers look for in a workforce.  Because GPTC has a high population of economically disadvantaged and underrepresented students in STEM fields, this project has the potential to broaden participation in the mechatronics workforce and generate new knowledge on how exposure to mechatronics through an immersive learning experience can prepare a diverse body of participants for high-demand career fields. \r\n\r\nThe overall goal of the project is to provide military veterans with an accessible pathway into careers in emerging technology.  This project will prepare participants to enter the workforce as a mechatronics technician with relevant training, while integrating mentorship and experiential learning activities involving representatives from local industries and will focus on exposure to the mechatronics career field, academic persistence, workforce readiness, and job placement.   Over a 16-week period, participants will engage in an immersive learning experience facilitated by GPTC faculty, combining hands-on training, career exploration, and mentorship opportunities with local employers and community partners.  Additionally, a competitive financial stipend for participants will be provided to address any equity gaps, ensuring inclusivity.  Through this approach, the project will offer a comprehensive learning experience, serving as an entry point into high-demand, high-wage careers as mechatronics technicians.  Participants will have the opportunity to articulate earned credits towards GPTC's degree programs in mechatronics or related emerging technology fields, further advancing their educational and career pathways.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
