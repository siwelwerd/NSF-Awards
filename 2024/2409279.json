 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides travel support for up to 40 students attending the 51st International Symposium on Computer Architecture (ISCA) on June 29-July 3, 2024 in Buenos Aires, Argentina, for the first time in Latin American. ISCA is one of the largest and most respected conferences in the field of computer architecture and systems. Renowned researchers from academia and industry convene at ISCA to lead workshops and tutorials, share insights through distinguished talks and paper presentations, and recruit talented students. This travel grant aims to broaden students participation, granting them access to cutting-edge research, networking opportunities with peers and researchers, and the chance to develop important professional skills while exploring potential career paths. Specifically designed to support students studying in US schools requiring additional financial assistance, the grant fosters the symposium's commitment to inclusivity and STEM retention. Moreover, it seeks to engage undergraduate students, including students from traditionally underrepresented group, to participate in conference activities. \r\n\r\nISCA has maintained its status as a flagship event in the field for over five decades. Its main program features keynote addresses and approximately 80 technical papers presented across parallel sessions, complemented by around 26 workshops and tutorials during the two-day workshop. With the support provided, students will actively participate in various conference facets, including paper presentation, engaging discussions with experts to nurture innovative ideas, networking opportunities to build a sense of community, and mentorship sessions to shape their career trajectories. The selection of travel grant awardees will be conducted carefully, considering applicants' academic achievements, research progress, financial needs, and their background, ensuring a diverse and inclusive representation.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
