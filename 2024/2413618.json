 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Inaugural Berkeley-Stanford Workshop on Veridical Data Science will be held on Friday \r\nMay 31, 2024, at BIDS on UC Berkeley campus. The organizing committee consists of \r\nBin Yu (UC Berkeley, co-chair), Russ Poldrack (Stanford, co-chair), Maya Mathur \r\n(Stanford), and Tiffany Tang (University of Michigan). This conference is jointly hosted \r\nby the Berkeley Institute of Data Science (BIDS) and the Department of Statistics, parts of \r\nUC Berkeley's College of Computing, Data Science, and Society (CDSS) and Stanford \r\nData Science Center for Open and Reproducible Science (SDS-CORES).\r\n\r\n\r\nData science is playing a ubiquitous role in science, society, and beyond, underscoring \r\nthe urgent need to ensure the trustworthiness and safety of data science including \r\nmachine learning. The data science life cycle (DSLC) is often a complex and multi-step \r\nprocess, including domain problem formulation, data collection and cleaning, data \r\nvisualization, model/algorithm development, post-hoc visualization, interpretation, \r\nvetting and communication. In every step of a DSLC, human judgment calls are made \r\nand often unaccounted for in the traditional uncertainty quantification. Veridical data \r\nscience (VDS) is the practice of rigorously conducting data analysis while making \r\nhuman judgment calls and using domain knowledge to extract and communicate useful, \r\ntrustworthy information from data to solve a real-world domain problem. The \r\nPredictability-Computability-Stability (PCS) framework and documentation have been \r\ndeveloped towards veridical data science. This conference is focused on veridical \r\n(truthful) data science (VDS) for responsible data analysis and decision-making. There \r\nwill be 4 keynote speakers and 9 invited speakers. We expect around 100\u2013150 \r\nattendees from both academia and industry. 8-10 lightning talk speakers will be \r\nselected based on submitted abstracts. This workshop intends to build a community of \r\nveridical data science researchers. https://na.eventscloud.com/website/69057\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
