 "awd_abstract_narration": "The conference ``Recent Advances in Nonlinear Partial Differential Equations\u201d will be held from May 13-May 17, 2024, at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities. The conference provides much needed opportunities for the participants to keep track of the significant developments in some of the most active research areas in PDEs. The schedule is carefully arranged to allow junior participants ample time to interact with experts in their area of interest. There will be a poster session where junior participants are encouraged to present their own research. Panel discussions on career developments and experts-led sessions on open problems will further enhance the involvement of participants in the conference. Speakers will be asked for permission to record their talks that will be made publicly available for a wider accessibility. Special attention will be paid to advertise and recruit participants from underrepresented groups.\r\n\r\nThe study of fluid equations and Calculus of Variations (CVs) is undergoing very rapid and significant progress in recent years. The conference features a wide scope of active topics in both fluid equations and calculus of variations. Specifically, the scientific themes of the conference include (i) Computation and Computer Assisted Proofs in PDEs, (ii) Convex Integration Techniques and its Applications, (iii) Regularity theory of the Euler and Navier Stokes equations, (iv) Hydrodynamic stability in high Reynolds number regime, (v) Calculus of Variations from material sciences. Important breakthroughs have been achieved in recent years in all these closely related areas. CVs is a fertile source of ideas for many branches of PDEs including fluid equations. It is hoped that by bringing together experts from both areas a cross-fertilization is more likely to occur. Detailed logistic information on the conference can be found at https://cse.umn.edu/math/events/recent-advances-nonlinear-partial-differential-equations.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
