 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the support of the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program in the Division of Chemistry, Prof. Esser-Kahn of the University of Chicago will explore a method of polymer synthesis mediated by electric fields. The research will focus on the mechanism of how electric fields can be used to control and mediate the vibration of particles that produce chemical reactions. By examining the mechanism of both vibration and chemical reaction, the team will explore a new method to generate polymers and materials that can, shortly, be compatible with programmable interfaces via computer. The potential impacts of this work include enabling new forms of adhesives. Understanding these processes could improve other materials developments. Prof. Esser-Kahn, plans to continue his new educational program for high school students at the University of Chicago. This program educates 30 students each year, selected from 120 applicants, provides them with coursework and hands-on training to develop an understanding of engineering and design and the fundamentals of energy storage and transfer. The team hopes to retain and improve the outcomes of the program, which has served more than 100 students with a launching platform for their enrollment in STEM programs across the United States, with 50% enrollment in STEM PhDs. \r\n\r\nThe project will examine how the particle's surface, as it charges, induces new forms of reactivity. This reactivity is focused on ionic interactions that mediate particles' interactions with solutions and their ability to transfer electrons to reagents for polymerization. We will determine how the electric field influences the particles' rate of reactivity and their interplay with the solution based on the ionic interaction between the particle and the double layer formed by the solvent and secondary ions. The interplay between the solvent, ions, and dipole will be examined to determine how these ratios influence the reactivity of different species.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
