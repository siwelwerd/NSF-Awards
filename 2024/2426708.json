The CIKM conference is recognized as a premier gathering within the fields of databases, data mining, artificial intelligence and information retrieval. It will feature a curated selection of top-tier technical papers, attracting a diverse international audience. The tentative five-day schedule for CIKM 2024 includes: Tutorials and Industry Day on Monday, Main conference from Tuesday to Thursday, and Workshop and PhD Symposium on Friday.
