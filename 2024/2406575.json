 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation program assists universities and colleges in their efforts to significantly increase the numbers of students matriculating into and successfully completing high quality degree programs in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) disciplines to diversify the STEM workforce. Particular emphasis is placed on transforming undergraduate STEM education through innovative, evidence-based recruitment and retention strategies, and relevant educational experiences in support of populations underrepresented in STEM disciplines: African Americans, Hispanic Americans, American Indians, Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians, and Native Pacific Islanders. These strategies facilitate the production of well-prepared students highly qualified and motivated to pursue graduate education or careers in STEM.\r\n\r\nFor the United States to remain globally competitive, it is vital that it taps into the talent of all its citizens and provides exceptional educational preparedness in STEM areas that underpin the knowledge-based economy. The Louis Stokes Mississippi Alliance for Minority Participation (LS-MAMP) STEM Pathway and Research Alliance has formed an alliance in response to the need for a more diverse and skilled technical workforce. That need still exists and is particularly acute in Mississippi. The institutions that make up the Alliance are renowned for their collaborative spirit and individual strengths and include Jackson State University (the lead institution), the University of Mississippi, Mississippi State University, Alcorn State University, Mississippi Valley State University, the University of Southern Mississippi, Tougaloo College, Delta State University, Coahoma Community College, and Hinds Community College. Through this project, the Alliance will provide mentoring, proactive interventions, community college transfer programs, conferences, expert speakers, summer internships, advising, faculty research, and other initiatives aimed at retaining and graduating historically underrepresented and underserved students in STEM fields. In addition, LS-MAMP research project will contribute to the broadening participation body of knowledge by helping to understand the effect of interventions or specific aspects of interventions on student engagement outcomes such as retention and graduation rates, time to degree completion, career achievement and labor market outcomes. The Alliance team is also committed to disseminating lessons learned through practice and research to audiences within the state, region and nationwide, supporting the National Science Foundation's strategic goal to \"empower STEM talent to fully participate in science and engineering\" by improving conditions for minoritized students in STEM and helping build a diverse and excellent STEM workforce.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
