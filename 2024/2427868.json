 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the 18th Graduate Climate Conference (GCC), planned for 1-3 November 2024 at the Pack Conference Center of the University of Washington. The conference is held annually and alternates between Woods Hole the University of Washington.\r\n\r\nThe GCC is an interdisciplinary climate conference organized entirely by and for graduate students. It provides a discussion forum for students conducting research on climate in a variety of disciplines including atmospheric and oceanic dynamics, biogeochemical cycles, clouds and aerosols, and the cryosphere. The meeting is intended to help students familiarize themselves with the breadth of climate science, gain exposure to the enormous range of tools available to address climate-related questions, and understand how their research fits into the broader landscape of current climate science. The conference seeks to better prepare graduate students for scientific inquiry in a field that increasingly demands interdisciplinary approaches. Funds provided here support travel and subsistence for 120 students chosen through a competitive process.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
