 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national interest by enhancing the academic and professional preparation of community college students in STEM disciplines, particularly those transferring to four-year institutions. By creating robust support systems and research opportunities, the project directly addresses the well-documented need for highly skilled STEM graduates and aligns with the National Science Foundation's mission to advance the health, prosperity, and welfare of the nation. This project, Strengthening Transfer Pathways in the Laboratory Sciences through Undergraduate Research Experiences, distinguishes itself through innovative components like the Science Transfer Resource Group and the competitive Research Assistantship Program. Expected outcomes include increased retention and graduation rates, improved integration of transfer students into four-year programs, and enhanced competitiveness of participants in the STEM fields. These advancements are anticipated to lead to broader societal impacts by ensuring a diverse and well-equipped STEM workforce.\r\n\r\nThe project goals are to reduce barriers faced by transfer students in STEM fields through structured academic support and hands-on research experiences. The scope of this project includes the implementation of the Science Transfer Resource Group to provide tailored advising and career exploration, and the Research Assistantship Program at George Mason University's Center for Molecular Engineering, which offers practical laboratory experience. Methodologies involve longitudinal tracking of student outcomes, regular assessment of academic integration, and evaluation of the professional skills acquired through assistantships. This data will inform ongoing adjustments to the program and contribute to the broader field of STEM education research by providing insights into effective transfer support mechanisms. Plans for the dissemination of results include academic publications and presentations at educational conferences. The NSF IUSE: Innovation in Two-Year College STEM Education (ITYC) Program seeks to accelerate the impact of and advance knowledge about emerging and evidence-based practices in undergraduate STEM education at two-year colleges.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
