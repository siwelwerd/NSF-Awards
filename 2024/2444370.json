 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 2024 IEEE International Conference on Data Science and Advanced Analytics (DSAA) will be held in San Diego, CA, USA, from October 6th to 10th, 2024. This conference features a strong interdisciplinary synergy between statistics, computing, information/intelligence sciences, and cross-domain interactions between academia and business for data science and analytics. It also provides an ideal setting for students and others new to the field to learn about cutting-edge research by hearing outstanding invited speakers and attending tutorials.\r\n  \r\nTwenty students from United States' universities will have the opportunity to participate in the DSAA 2024 Student Forum and the conference's technical program. These students will include both graduate and undergraduate students in data science or closely related fields. Support will be extended to those from underrepresented groups, and institutions not traditionally represented at DSAA conferences. Participation in the DSAA 2024 Student Forum will enhance students' educational experiences by exposing them to cutting-edge research and methodologies. Engaging with leading experts and peers will help them build crucial professional networks.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
