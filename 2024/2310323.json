 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project offers significant changes to the conventional concept of spacecraft orientation control by providing increased agility, along with reduced mass, volume, and cost. These advantages open doors to new scientific and commercial opportunities.  The project addresses the demanding needs of future space observatories and commercial spacecraft that require high agility systems, currently unachievable with existing attitude control solutions. Moreover, this system, as a more affordable 3-axis control option, is set to increase access to space for lower-budget missions, making space exploration more accessible than ever before. The systems application is envisioned to enable advances in sectors such as satellite-to-satellite communications, adding momentum to global digital connectivity initiatives. \r\n\r\nThis STTR Phase I project seeks to develop a Multifunctional Structures for Attitude Control (MSAC) system and increase its efficiency and reliability, pushing it towards achieving readiness for flight demonstration. The project addresses the existing challenge of the system's fatigue strength and its compatibility with the harsh space environment, factors crucial for its commercial success and durability in its intended application. This project's aim is to design a flight-capable system, drawing on the insights from lab-scale tests and prototypes.  It also seeks to simultaneously improve the system's mechanical and electrical design to elevate efficiency and reliability standards. Through this research method, the team anticipates a better understanding and eventual mitigation of potential failure modes, paving the way for the realization of a robust, space-ready prototype. The anticipated technical results from this endeavor have the potential to revolutionize the spacecraft attitude control market.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
