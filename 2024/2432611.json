 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will enable researchers to visualize the dynamics of the biological events in live animals. The product, the miniaturized optical imaging micro-endoscope, will change researchers\u2019 current paradigm of only visualizing and exploring the superficial layers of tissue at a subcellular level. Visualizing the deeper layers of tissue in >1 mm depth at the subcellular level using the miniaturized optical imaging micro-endoscope will enable a range of discoveries in different areas of biomedical research. In the long term, the developed product can be utilized by physicians to improve the current standards of care in various medical applications.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is developing a nanophotonic imaging microendoscope for in vivo imaging with minimal damage. Current optical microscopy imaging cannot be used for imaging beyond 1 mm depth. The current microendoscopes have a diameter larger than 0.5-1 mm, so they cause severe damage to the tissue when inserted into the tissue. The current microendoscopes cannot provide images in >1 mm depth since the damage to the tissue changes the whole tissue structure. Miniaturized microendoscopic tools with subcellular resolution are vital for deep tissue imaging (>1 mm). The product of this SBIR project will be 100 \u00b5m diameter, a hair-size micro-endoscope allowing researchers and scientists to conduct their studies at >3 mm depth in a live animal. The state of the art of optical design and nanofabrication techniques will be utilized to make the miniaturized microendoscope. This project will lead to derisking the risks associated with the miniaturization of the optical microendoscope and enabling its usage for in vivo imaging.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
