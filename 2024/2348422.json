 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project advances Mobile Terminal Collaboration (MTC), a key technology for next-generation cellular networking systems that allows different end devices to collaborate on tasks. MTC plays a vital role in the evolving 5G and 6G systems by enabling efficient device-to-device communication, collaborative computing, and seamless space-air-ground integration. Despite its potential, the practical implementation of MTC faces significant challenges in managing resources effectively under incomplete information.  Addressing these challenges will lead to more reliable and faster communication networks where the terminals both are mobile and need to collaborate with each other.  This will benefit the use of 5G and 6G systems in various sectors, including telecommunications, agriculture, and emergency services. Also, the project supports education and diversity by involving students in cutting-edge research, thereby fostering the next generation of scientists and engineers. The project seeks to tackle fundamental issues in MTC, particularly the current reliance on complete information for resource management and the lack of practical evaluation of existing designs. The research will bridge the gap between theory and practice by developing novel models, algorithms, and protocols and validating them through real-world implementation and testing. The findings will provide valuable guidelines for the research community and industry, ensuring that MTC can be realized in future communication and computing systems.\r\n\r\nThe primary goal of this project is to address theoretical and practical aspects of resource management for MTC resource management under the assumption of incomplete information. The research will focus on the following areas: 1) Theoretical Framework: Developing new models and algorithms using advanced mathematical tools such as convex optimization theory, game theory, and stochastic geometry. These models will address resource management challenges in the presence of incomplete information; 2) Implementation Techniques: Designing novel protocols and techniques for practical implementation of MTC. It involves creating mechanisms that can function effectively in real-world scenarios, where information is typically imperfect or uncertain; 3) System Evaluation: Conducting comprehensive system performance evaluations through theoretical analysis, numerical computation, simulation experiments, and real-world tests. The project aims to yield significant intellectual contributions by exploring resource management for MTC under incomplete information. The new models, algorithms, and analytical techniques developed will advance the theoretical understanding of MTC. Simultaneously, the novel protocol designs and practical evaluations will provide valuable insights for real-world system implementations. The broader impact of this project lies in its potential to establish foundational principles for MTC, guiding future research and practical applications, and by supporting educational initiatives, including ones for female graduate students. By bridging the gap between theoretical studies and practical designs, the project will contribute to developing efficient resource management mechanisms in emerging communication and computing systems, benefiting both the academic community and the industry.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
