 "awd_abstract_narration": "Portland cement concrete is a ubiquitous element of the built environment and is a crucial component of building and infrastructure development worldwide. The production of concrete, the most widely used manufactured material, is a contributor to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.  The production of cement results in 4-8% of global energy-related carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions.  There is a need to reduce the CO2 emissions both during construction and throughout the life of the concrete.  The Concrete Advancement Network (CAN), an Industry-University Cooperative Research Phase I Center (IUCRC) established by the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee and Oregon State University, focuses on reducing the global warming potential (GWP) of concrete while improving the long-term durability of concrete thereby enabling significant economic and societal benefits. CAN focuses on implementing nanotechnology advancements, recyclability, digital manufacturing, multi-scale modeling, artificial intelligence, and advanced testing techniques will be used to fast-track the implementation of cutting-edge concepts into this key industrial sector, which frequently relies on older technology. Breakthroughs in the concrete field can be achieved using model-based prediction and verification combined with experimental methods, thereby advancing the pace of technology transfer from concept to implementation.  The CAN center aims to develop innovative concrete mixtures with reduced GWP while establishing methods to quantify the GWP and performance for member companies while training a diverse and skilled science and engineering workforce for the industry at large.  Thus, CAN activities are strategically important to the U.S. economy because they will provide long-term solutions for the nation\u2019s deteriorating infrastructure and meet the demand for transportation and buildings.\r\n\r\nThe CAN Oregon State site is focused on the development of approaches to improve concrete performance predictions specifically as it relates to durability, by-product utilization, and a reduced carbon footprint. Novel experimental measurement techniques and computational tools will be showcased that can provide value to the industry. Oregon State will focus primarily on four primary research thrust areas: 1) the increased use of \u2018off-spec\u2019, natural, and \u2018industrial by-product\u2019 supplementary cementitious materials to reduce the global warming potential of concrete, 2) carbon reduction, sequestration, and use of carbonatable binders, 3) molecular and thermodynamic modeling and 4) concrete durability, longevity, and service life modeling.  It is anticipated that work will focus on the development of mixture proportioning tools that result in mixtures with low GWP as well as approaches that better consider the service life emissions of concrete.  Advanced experimental techniques like neutron radiography are planned to assess the influence of fluid transport and carbonation on concrete development and performance.  Additionally, work will be performed to quantify the durability of concrete which will likely include updates to the service life prediction of concrete exposed to acid and the role of commercial additives in reducing transport and acid damage.  Finally, training programs are planned to help prepare the next generation of engineers while also providing information updates for practitioners.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
