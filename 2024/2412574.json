 "awd_abstract_narration": "The IEEE International Conference on Computer Communications (INFOCOM) is a premier international conference, held annually, covering a wide spectrum of theoretical and applied research in the networking field. The conference provides a unique platform for researchers and practitioners to present their latest research results. Attending such a high-caliber technical event, with multiple technical sessions and workshops, is important for graduate students' professional development. The students will have the opportunity to present their work and be exposed to the state-of-the-art developments in the field. They will also have the opportunity to interact with peers from institutions worldwide, meet with senior researchers, and participate in discussions that are likely to shape the future of the field.\r\n\r\nThis award will support approximately 20 students in the United States to attend the 2024 IEEE INFOCOM which will be held in Vancouver, Canada from May 20 to May 23, 2024. This travel grant will target graduate students who will substantially benefit from attending this conference but have limited travel funds. Priority will be given to first time attendees, especially those without papers, and students from under-represented groups.  Selected students will be supported by this grant to attend the 2024 IEEE INFOCOM in person.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
