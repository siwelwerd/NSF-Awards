 "awd_abstract_narration": "While seamless ubiquitous mobile broadband coverage is an important objective of Next-generation (Next-G) wireless Networks, they are expected to be also part of the enabling infrastructure for many future vertical applications. These requirements demand Next-G wireless networks to be space-aerial-ground (SAG) integrated, open networks supporting multiple functionalities and native features. However, at-scale experimentation, testing and validation of innovative research, research and development (R&D) outcomes and technology translation in such open and integrated network technologies is currently not possible due to the lack of a large-scale testbed with open access to the broader community. Building such a testbed is a major investment that is not possible by individual researchers or institutions. This workshop brings together key stakeholders from both the wireless and aerospace research and development communities, including subject matter experts from relevant government agencies, private industry and academic institutions, to formulate a comprehensive roadmap that will define elements and design requirements of an open, integrated, space-air-ground network testbed composed of satellite, aerial and terrestrial segments. The testbed is expected to serve both R&D community and technology translators by providing a versatile, accessible, and programmable platform capable of conducting experiments within the context of integrated sensing-compute-communications, seamless multi-domain ubiquitous connectivity and vertical-driven technology development (both space-verticals and wireless-verticals) using the Open Radio Access Networking (O-RAN) principles of modular, open, and standardized interfaces.\r\n\r\nThe in-person workshop will feature keynotes and group discussions to develop an understanding of the essential features, minimum capabilities, design requirements and use-cases for launching a national shared Open and Integrated Networks testbed. To stimulate discussion and collect the perspectives from attendees belonging to a diverse range of technical communities on different aspects of the testbed roadmap, each breakout session will be comprised of several parallel group discussions. Information and insights collected from each of the sessions will be used to compile a technical report including a set of recommendations defining a roadmap for the design, development and launching of an integrated open space-aerial-ground wireless networking testbed with desired functionalities and capabilities that will benefit both scientific community and technology translation.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
