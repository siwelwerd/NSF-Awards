 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader/commercial impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve public health and local economies by developing technologies that reduce greenhouse gas emissions and energy consumption associated with industrial heating processes. Currently, industrial heating processes are a major contributor to global emissions. The technology developed through this project will enhance the efficiency of established processes in the chemical industry and beyond, significantly reducing energy consumption for heat production compared to conventional technologies. The underlying technology of this project provides a significant competitive advantage over current competitors in Joule heater production by reducing production costs, improving manufacturing efficiency, increasing heating performance, and offering greater product customizability. This will enable widespread adoption across multiple markets. Targeting the rapidly growing alternative fuels market, the technology developed through this project is projected to generate substantial revenue over the next three years, serving as a critical pathway for the associated company success. Overall, this SBIR project will enable robust technologies of high-performance Joule heat production, leading industrial decarbonization efforts through and ensuring the success of a burgeoning small business. \r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will enable the development and scaled production of novel additively manufactured, plastic-derived carbon materials as Joule heaters for decarbonizing critical industrial processes, such as large-scale chemical syntheses. Producing heat for these reactions is one of the largest contributors to CO2 emissions in the industrial sector. Electrifying these processes with high-performance Joule heaters significantly reduces energy consumption and CO2 emissions, and allows for the use of renewable energy sources. Traditional Joule heaters, typically made from metal alloys, are difficult to manufacture into complex geometries optimal for chemical reactions and offer limited energy savings. This project will investigate the effects of various parameters during the chemical treatment and pyrolysis processes that convert additively manufactured plastic precursors into structured carbon products. This research aims to provide critical insights into controlling pore textures, material properties, and reproducibility of the carbon products, ultimately translating this technology into market-ready products. By optimizing these processes, the project seeks to develop high-performance carbon Joule heaters that offer superior heating efficiency, reduced energy consumption, and increased durability, thus supporting the transition to more sustainable industrial practices and contributing to environmental sustainability and economic growth.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
