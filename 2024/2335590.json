 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will be in enhancing the well-being of chickens on poultry farms and in equipping growers with effective tools to monitor bird conditions. As chicken is a widely consumed source of live-animal protein globally, there is a growing consumer preference for ethically raised animals. The project addresses this demand by fostering improved welfare practices in poultry farming. There are collaborative movements with major producers and institutional consumers to establish evidence-based welfare standards impacting entire supply chain. With a declining agricultural workforce in the United States, it is essential to have automated mechanisms to extend a farmer\u2019s capabilities. This project will develop a smart monitoring system for the birds meeting these needs, resulting in improved bird welfare and amplification of the farmer\u2019s capacity.\r\n \r\nThis Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project uses audio monitoring and machine listening to measure animal behavior. Since poultry operations differ significantly from farm to farm and over the life of the chicken as it grows from chick to a mature bird, the machine learning algorithms must adapt. The monitoring systems must be appliance-like in that they do not require expertise or any more than minimal involvement on the part of the farmer. This research will result in the advancement and productization of acoustic machine learning algorithms which search out unusual behaviors in the animals in their environment and provide early indications of distress, sickness, discomfort, and feed and water issues to the grower based on intelligent listening and inference. Acoustic approaches do not disturb the animals, are more robust than video for long-term deployment in dusty environments, and operate around the clock and in the dark. By providing early actionable insights to the grower, this technology can correct problems early, thereby improving not only the animal\u2019s welfare, but their productivity as well. By deploying inexpensive microphones at multiple locations in a grow-out house, activities and problems can be localized, bringing precision livestock technology to flock-based animal management.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
