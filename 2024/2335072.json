 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Computing Research Association\u2019s (CRA) Center for Evaluating the Research Pipeline (CERP) was established in 2013 by CRA-W and the Coalition to Diversify Computing with a mission to promote diversity through evaluation and research. CERP\u2019s vision is to be a resource for the computing community that fulfills the need for national data collection, comparative and longitudinal evaluation, and engagement with the community for dissemination of broadening participation in computing (BPC) related research and evidence based best practices. The Center\u2019s activities are centered around data, evaluation and research, and community engagement. As part of this project, CERP provides the computing community with resources in these areas to support the collective effort to create a strong computing education and workforce pipeline. CERP\u2019s activities are designed based on the community\u2019s needs and adjusted in a timely manner depending on the changing demands. Being part of CRA, a service-oriented organization, CERP maintains the expertise of professional staff to offer continuous support to the community\u2019s BPC efforts. CERP\u2019s work on setting up infrastructures for large scale data collection and systematic evaluation services, coupled with the Center\u2019s efforts to connect with the computing community, makes it uniquely suited to act as a central resource. \r\n\r\nThis project aims to bring CERP\u2019s services and activities under one umbrella to support the computing community\u2019s efforts to broaden participation in the field. CERP\u2019s data resources will include large scale longitudinal surveys of computing students at the higher education level and professionals, departmental level data, and curation of data resources from third party sources. CERP\u2019s evaluation services will range from scalable comparative evaluation to customized program impact assessments. CERP\u2019s community engagement activities will utilize BPCnet.org and its associated projects to provide curated resources (e.g. BPCnet.org Resource Library, BPCnet.org Statistics and Data Hub), services (e.g., consultancy), and events (e.g., workshops, webinars) for the computing community. This project will generate data and resources that will contribute to our collective knowledge on computing education and broadening participation. CERP\u2019s national level data sources will be available for all researchers to answer questions regarding computing education and gain a better insight into individuals\u2019 experiences in computing. Further, the services (e.g., evaluation, BPC consultancy) provided by this project will benefit the computing community broadly and computing education community more specifically.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
