 "awd_abstract_narration": "The East Coast Operator Algebra Symposium (ECOAS) is an annual research conference centered around the theory of operator algebras and their applications. The first meeting was at Vanderbilt University in the Fall of 2003, and since then meetings have occurred annually. This award will partially support participants for this year's event, the 20th meeting of ECOAS, held at North Carolina State University in Raleigh, North Carolina, November 9-10, 2024. The conference will provide a venue for early career researchers to learn about developments at the forefront of their field, to share their work with the broader community, and to network with other early career researchers as well as more senior members of the community. \r\n\r\nThis event focuses on C*-algebras, von Neumann algebras and a wide variety of applications, including to quantum physics, representation theory, and dynamical systems. Thirty to sixty participants are expected. The plenary speakers will review recent advances, enabling participants to keep abreast of recent developments in a vast and rapidly expanding subject. More information is available at the conference website https://www.coreyjonesmath.com/ecoas-2024.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
