 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Bermuda Institute of Ocean Sciences (BIOS) is a U.S. not-for-profit research organization, founded in 1903 and incorporated in the state of New York in 1926. In October 2021, BIOS and Arizona State University (ASU) executed a services and affiliation agreement, establishing BIOS as part of ASU\u2019s Global Futures Laboratory. BIOS will host a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site program annually in 2024-2026. The program will be held during the fall semester for twelve weeks and will engage seven undergraduate students from across the country in ongoing research and professional development activities. BIOS is uniquely situated in the Northwest Atlantic Ocean, allowing students the opportunity to conduct research in a wide range of marine science areas, Professional development will provide a focus on scientific communication, data processing, and other activities. Significantly, all REU students at BIOS will have the opportunity to participate in a research cruise aboard the R/V Atlantic Explorer, a UNOLS Ocean/Intermediate Class Vessel.\r\n\r\nREU interns at BIOS conduct research in a wide-range of marine science areas, from the open ocean in conjunction with established oceanographic time-series programs and other oceanic research projects, to the near-shore environment of one of the most northerly coral reef systems in the world. Professional development is integrated throughout the program, with intensive training, workshops, and opportunities to practice science communication. BIOS seeks to draw applicants from broad geographic and demographic pools. The program also integrates outreach with lesson plan development for middle school and high school, work shadow placements for local two-year college students, and training in successful dissemination of research findings to wider society, including science writing and social media. Interns may have the opportunity to attend a scientific conference to present their research after the program concludes.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
