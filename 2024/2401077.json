 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Marconi Society's Paul Baran Young Scholar Award welcomes promising young scientists and engineers into a fellowship that includes recipients of the Marconi Prize as well as other Young Scholars. Often referred to as the \"Nobel Prize for Communications,\" the Marconi Prize winners are some of the most distinguished and accomplished leaders in communications research and innovation. More than just recognition for past achievements, the Young Scholar Award serves to create a foundation for leadership and foster the development of those who will carry this legacy forward.  This year's awardee has developed techniques for assessing the performance properties of commonly used heuristics in networking, making contributions at the intersection of internet congestion control, video streaming, privacy-preserving computation, wireless networks, and mobile systems.\r\n\r\nThe Marconi Society's mission is to advance digital equity around telecommunication technologies; Young Scholar awardees are connected with a powerful network at a critical juncture in their careers, allowing them to amplify their work around that mission.  Awardees are chosen by a selection committee considering nominations from experts in the field of telecommunications, based on the impact of applicants' work, their leadership qualities, and the alignment of their work with the society's mission.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
