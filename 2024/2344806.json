 "awd_abstract_narration": "\u201cModel organisms\u201d such as the fruit fly and Baker\u2019s yeast provide scientific researchers the means to reveal fundamental insights into universal biological principles as well as models of human genetic disease, in some cases leading to important treatments. In addition, research on model plants, such as Arabidopsis, have led to breakthrough technologies that have revolutionized agriculture. These model organisms are notable for their brief lifespans, standardized genetic modification techniques, and ease of use in a laboratory setting. The Genetics Society of America (GSA) believes that science works best when individuals from diverse backgrounds come together, bringing their points of view and cultural contexts to the table. To optimize new research perspectives and facilitate scientific discovery, The Allied Genetics Conference (TAGC), organized by GSA, will occur March 6-10, 2024, in National Harbor, MD. The conference will bring together geneticists from different fields and disciplines including cell biology, genetics, biochemistry, biophysics, neuroscience, genomics, industry, and more from around the world to discuss a variety of new research projects, techniques, and ideas focused on model organism research and the advancement of science using a cross-disciplinary approach. TAGC will provide a unique platform to bring together researchers leveraging diverse model organisms. This conference will encourage dialogue among attendees and help seed new collaborations and innovative ideas for their research under one umbrella. This award will invest in the next generation of researchers by facilitating a comprehensive support plan at TAGC for early-career scientists and those from historically underrepresented groups. \r\n\r\nGSA and TAGC organizers will engage a diverse group of participants, speakers, and organizers who represent the full spectrum of diverse talent in the US, as well as a broad range of career stages, institutional types, and geographical regions to ensure the inclusion of historically under-represented or underserved communities and institutions. The conference will be organized to center around trainees and will include a plenary keynote on mentoring. This award will sponsor 50 early career researchers spanning multiple scientific communities.\r\n\r\nThis award is supported jointly by the Genetic Mechanisms Program, the Cellular Dynamics and Function Program and the Systems and Synthetic Biology Program in BIO/MCB and by the Developmental Systems Cluster and the Plant Genome Research Program in BIO/IOS.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
