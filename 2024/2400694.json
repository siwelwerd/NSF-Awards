 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national interest by integrating cyber safety principles into Information Technology (IT/IS) associate degree track at Nash Community College. The project intends to produce skilled IT/IS technicians equipped with essential cybersecurity knowledge to safeguard organizational data, networks, and applications. The project team plans to develop six cyber safety modules culminating in a badge. The project has the potential to address critical needs identified in collaboration with local industry leaders. The project will continue to collaborate with industry leaders ensuring ongoing relevance and responsiveness to workforce needs.\r\n\r\nThe project includes the creation of a cyber-safe culture through the Nighthawk Cyber Alliance (NCA). Beyond IT disciplines, the NCA extends its influence to benefit non-IT faculty, students, and local businesses, which will foster a community-wide commitment to cyber safety. Targeted efforts will address the underrepresentation of women in IT/IS programs, establishing collaborations with high schools and industry partners. Nationally, the project has the potential to offer a replicable model for curriculum infusion and cyber alliance partnerships, providing a comprehensive approach to cybersecurity education in community colleges. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the Nation's economy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
