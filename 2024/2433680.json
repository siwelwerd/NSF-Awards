 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this travel grant is to broaden and diversify the student participation in the 44th International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems (ICDCS 2024), sponsored by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), a premier annual international forum for the presentation of research results in distributed computing. It seeks to increase student participation in the conference and the field. The requested funding would support the travel of eligible students from US universities and institutions to the conference. \r\n\r\nThis travel grant encourages the involvement of students in the field who are not well funded and those who are just beginning their participation in the field or are interested in entering it. A special effort is made to reach out to women, people from underrepresented populations in computing, students from Minority-Serving Institutions, and students from institutions in jurisdictions eligible to NSF\u2019s Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR). Preference is also given to students who will present their research at ICDCS.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
