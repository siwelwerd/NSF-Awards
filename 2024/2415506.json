 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hands-on technology-rich maker activities that combine computer programming, digital fabrication (e.g., 3D printing), and computer-aided design are shown to support learners\u2019 empowerment, social competence, and technical training. However, existing maker activities and makerspaces are often not designed for learners with autism. This results in missed opportunities for including youth and young adults with autism in empowering and meaningful STEM learning experiences. This project will investigate how to design accessible and safe makerspaces and technology-rich maker activities for youth and young adults with disabilities, with input from therapists, special education teachers, psychologists, assistive technology experts, and learners themselves. The project will (1) create three accessible community makerspaces in Baltimore for learners with autism; (2) develop accessible technology-rich STEM learning activities for learners with autism and an educator training program to prepare out-of-school time educators to deliver them; (3) study the impact of participating in the activities on the learners\u2019 empowerment and STEM attitudes and engagement, and the training on the educators\u2019 self-efficacy and preparedness to deliver accessible STEM learning activities. The project will result in three accessible makerspaces in Baltimore and will directly impact 90 youth and young adults with autism and 20 educators and experts. The project will result in several resources that will support the development of accessible makerspaces and activities at other sites. These will include a design framework with guidelines, lessons learned, research findings, and an educator training module. This project is a collaboration between the Digital Harbor Foundation, University of Maryland Baltimore County, the Kennedy Krieger Institute, GWWO Architects, and MN Associates, Inc. \r\n\r\nThe project will use a mixed-methods approach to investigate how to create three accessible community makerspaces and technology-rich maker activities for youth and young adults with autism in Baltimore and how to prepare out-of-school time educators to deliver the learning activities, and will assess the impact of participating in the activities on learners\u2019 empowerment and attitudes towards STEM and the educators\u2019 preparedness to deliver STEM programs. The research will use qualitative data collection and analysis methods, including expert interviews and focus groups, youth focus groups, and co-design session observations. It will also use quantitative measures, including a modified Upper Elementary and Middle/High School Student Attitudes toward STEM survey, a retrospective technology self-efficacy survey, and pre-post surveys. Project research and resources will reach key audiences of learning scientists, special education experts, and out-of-school time educators through articles in peer-reviewed and practitioner journals, public events, and professional conferences. Project outcomes, including the design framework, will also be shared publicly through a project website and the Digital Harbor Foundation\u2019s Localization Toolkit, which is an online resource for preparing equity-based learning programs across the nation, and the Kennedy Krieger\u2019s School Programs network, which includes 16 school districts in Maryland.\r\n\r\nThis Integrating Research and Practice project is funded by the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program, which supports projects that: (a) contribute to research and practice that considers informal STEM learning's role in equity and belonging in STEM; (b) promote personal and educational success in STEM; (c) advance public engagement in scientific discovery; (d) foster interest in STEM careers; (e) create and enhance the theoretical and empirical foundations for effective informal STEM learning; (f) improve community vibrancy; and/or (g) enhance science communication and the public's engagement in and understanding of STEM and STEM processes.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
