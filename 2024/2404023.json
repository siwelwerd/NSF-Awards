 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the participation of early-career researchers and graduate students from the US at the 17th International Conference on Computability, Complexity and Randomness (CCR 2024), taking place March 11-15, 2024 at Nagoya University in Nagoya, Japan. The conferences in this series have as their central theme the study of randomness at the intersection of mathematics and computer science. Randomness is a natural informal notion in our lives and a formal, mathematical notion in probability theory, but here we seek to use different types of algorithms to quantify the levels of randomness that a mathematical object (such as an infinite binary string) can possess. Since the pandemic has made it far more difficult for American early-career researchers and graduate students to form international professional networks, it is extremely important for them to be able to travel, share their work, and build in-person collaborations with their colleagues abroad now.\r\n\r\nThe Computability, Complexity and Randomness conference series has been ongoing since 2004 and promotes research in algorithmic randomness, complexity theory, and computability theory as well as applications of algorithmic randomness to areas of mathematics such as ergodic theory and geometric measure theory and other areas of computability theory such as computable structure theory and reverse mathematics. This year, we are seeking to extend the focus of this conference and welcome researchers in related areas such as effective set theory and continuous combinatorics. It is a common venue for early-career researchers and graduate students to present their own work in contributed talks and encounter areas of research that are new to them, accelerating their professional development and enhancing their research networks. The conference website can be found at https://sites.google.com/view/ccr2024/home .\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
