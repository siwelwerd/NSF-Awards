 "awd_abstract_narration": "Equity in STEM is a critical part of collaboration. The overall goal of this RCN: Diversity in Ecology, Evolution, Marine Science, and Disease (RCN: DEEMD) is to promote collaboration and equity in ecology, evolution, marine science (EEMS) and the emerging infectious disease (EID) fields. These fields overlap in many different places, yet formal collaborative efforts need to be in place to facilitate equitable interactions. RCN:DEEMD aims to bridge both basic and social science approaches by 1) facilitating in-person workshops, 2) developing virtual working groups, 3) establishing and maintaining a mentorship program, and 4) generating a framework for more equity in approaches to EEMS and EID research. Early career training is provided through webinars and seminars to support training, professional development, laboratory exchanges, and career preparation. Assessments are done through surveys for the overall RCN, the in person workshops, and the mentorship program. Products from RCN: DEEMD are being widely disseminated through and other communication platforms.\r\n\r\nClimate change and other human induced stressors can cause an increase of pathogens spreading between wildlife and humans. EIDs can have devastating consequences on biodiversity while also highlighting the health inequities experienced in human populations world wide. Globally, EIDs often disproportionately affect marginalized and impoverished human populations. Such disparities start long before peak disease outbreaks and extend to interactions with wildlife. Therefore, it is critical to understand the underlying ecological, and evolutionary context of disease dynamics and their impact on vulnerable wildlife and human populations. However, to accomplish this, there needs to be more equity and diversity in the scientists that are studying this very large issue. Through the development of RCN: DEEMD investigation of the intersection of basic science and social science in EIDs is being achieved by integrating approaches from EEMS. Diverse research collaborations from underrepresented groups are being elevated to help develop a better structure for integrative communication to tackle such a large issue.\r\n\r\nThis project is supported by the Division of Ocean Sciences, Division of Biological Infrastructure, Division of Environmental Biology, and Division of Integrative Organismal Systems.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
