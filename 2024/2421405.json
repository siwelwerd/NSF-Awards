 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Improving Undergraduate STEM Education: Hispanic\u2010Serving\r\nInstitutions (HSI Program), this Track 2 project aims to increase participation in scholarly STEM\r\nexperiences for Latin\u00e9 and other historically underserved students at Northern Arizona\r\nUniversity to promote culturally sustaining values, career competencies and academic success.\r\nThese populations continue to be underrepresented in STEM fields, excluding their voices from\r\nthe important process of solving pressing societal problems. Participation in paid undergraduate\r\nresearch, internships, and other scholarly experiences support students' sense of belonging in\r\nSTEM, and develop career competencies, important for economic mobility. These experiences\r\ncan increase the motivation to persist in STEM and pursue STEM careers. In this project, lower\r\ndivision undergraduate students will be exposed to scholarly STEM experiences, while upper\r\ndivision students will participate in mentored internships to communicate research outcomes\r\nwith the broader community and local youth. Participation in scholarly STEM experiences that\r\nbenefit society builds on students\u2019 cultural assets and supports the integration of cultural and\r\nscience identities, important for increasing representation in STEM. To further support students,\r\na new culturally responsive mentoring module will be incorporated into existing faculty and staff\r\nmentor training. Outcomes for scholars will include development of career competencies, and\r\nincreases in STEM identity, academic success, and retention to graduation.\r\n\r\nThe specific aims of the project are 1. to prepare lower division students to be\r\ncompetitive for scholarly STEM experiences, 2. to provide upper division science and education\r\nstudents science communication internships integrating cultural assets and career\r\ncompetencies, 3. to offer research mentors culturally responsive mentor training to augment\r\ncurrent mentor training opportunities, and 4. to generate new knowledge about how\r\nparticipation in scholarly STEM experiences impacts Latin\u00e9 and other underserved minority\r\nstudents' identities and sense of belonging in STEM. The research study will use a concurrent\r\nmixed methods design to offer a fuller understanding of the impact for historically underserved\r\nstudents and their intersectional identities when culturally responsive practices and cultural\r\nassets are intentionally integrated into program design. Research and evaluation findings will\r\ninform development of co\u2010curricular STEM experiences for historically underserved populations\r\nwhile also addressing cultural and STEM identities. Additionally, the inclusion of elementary\r\neducation students will contribute to knowledge about how engaging with the scientific\r\nresearch community through informal experiences can contribute to the development of science\r\nteacher identities. Findings will be disseminated to the broader audience of postsecondary\r\ninstitutions serving high numbers of Latin\u00e9 and other traditionally underserved students, and\r\nthe local community. The HSI Program aims to enhance undergraduate STEM education and\r\nbuild capacity at HSIs. Projects supported by the HSI Program will also generate new knowledge\r\non how to achieve these aims\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
