 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to optimize circularity, from the city up, transforming the linear consumption model of raw material extraction, production, use, and disposal that dominates the global economy. This linear model has led to serious unintended worldwide issues, from pollution to resource depletion. This project will reimagine how we design, from molecules and materials to buildings and communities. The newly updated and expanded Circularity Assessment Protocol (CAP) framework will be co-implemented with 11 cities. CAP integrates the open data tool Debris Tracker with data freely available, joining data from nearly 100 countries around the world. The new portal for this project will house the data from Phase I and Phase II communities aiming to foster global dialogue about community circularity and creating meaningful change. To increase circularity, the researchers will help communities address systemic and intersectional issues, including pollution burdens, lack of infrastructure, and lack of access to services. The project will further develop a platform for underrepresented voices through an existing podcast called Aquathread, produced and recorded at WUGA, the University of Georgia\u2019s NPR affiliate. This research will continue to increase public scientific literacy and engagement with science and technology through the use of open data and free mobile citizen science apps; improve the well-being of individuals in society by reducing waste and improving the built environment; and develop a diverse, globally competitive workforce. All communities, partners, and the public will have access to project data, facilitating the use of science and technology to inform public policy and support decision-making.\r\n\r\nIn contrast to the linear economy of \u2018take, make, waste\u2019, circular economy (CE) decouples economic growth from resource consumption. CE principles are based on the efficient use of resources and eliminating waste from product life cycles. This project will tackle the complex challenges that currently inhibit the circular economy\u2019s growth by deeply integrating diverse disciplines through the researchers\u2019 proven holistic systems framework. In Phase II, the newly updated and expanded Circularity Assessment Protocol (CAP) framework will be used to converge circularity across plastics (exploring polyfluoroalkyl substance-free alternatives), organic materials, and the built environment in 11 cities. In Phase I of this project, a circularity path was connected and converged across multiple materials and scales in two large metropolitan areas. Phase II will expand this work by training local implementation partners, and further developing a novel dynamic data and education portal. This portal will include city and metadata dashboards to facilitate inter- and intra-community dialogue to create systems change. Project partners include the Resilient Cities Network, a city-led network that brings together over 200 Chief Resilience Officers, practitioners, and researchers; the 2030 Districts Network of cities working to catalyze transformation in the built environment to mitigate the effects of climate change; Mississippi River Cities and Towns Initiative Mayors; and the Upper Midwest Association for Campus Sustainability (UMACS). This network of networks is the next step in expanding this project into a sustainable future as a continued resource and platform for sharing amongst cities around the world catalyzing change.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
