 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact of this I-Corps project is based on the development of an improved approach to treating Glioblastoma to improve patient outcomes and well-being. By offering a minimally invasive, potentially more effective treatment, this approach is expected to result in improved patient outcomes and quality of life, addressing a critical need within oncology care. The innovation underlying the solution enriches magnetic hyperthermia therapy (MHT) and nanoparticle technology. This project illustrates the potential for cutting-edge treatments to influence healthcare policies towards more innovative and cost-effective solutions, offering economic benefits and setting a precedent for future medical technologies. Furthermore, this project underscores the societal value of investing in health innovation for the betterment of patient care and treatment possibilities across various diseases.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. The solution is based on the development of an innovative treatment system for Glioblastoma, a highly aggressive brain cancer with limited current treatment options. This system utilizes Magnetic Hyperthermia Therapy (MHT) with magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles to selectively target and destroy tumor cells while preserving surrounding healthy tissue. This solution integrates multiple functionalities into a single, minimally invasive device, including real-time temperature monitoring for precise therapy delivery, tumor debulking, biopsy capabilities, and electrocautery to minimize blood loss. This approach has shown promising results in small animal trials, indicating its potential to significantly improve Glioblastoma treatment outcomes.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
