 "awd_abstract_narration": "Current paths to entry into the STEM workforce are insufficient. Increasing the accessibility of STEM fields requires more than ensuring the path is open. STEM accessibility requires targeted investment in exposing all learners to various potential paths while equipping them with the skills essential to succeed in the field. \u201cReal life\u201d research projects have a positive impact on students, empowering them to grasp the real-world relevance of their studies and make meaningful connections between book knowledge and real scientific problems. Despite their undeniable positive impact, these activities are rare, especially among post-secondary students, and almost unheard of among middle school students. This project will provide 7-12th graders year-long biotechnology training and career exploration that includes advanced science education, skill building, authentic research experience, mentorship, and networking to inspire the next generation of STEM workers. \r\n\r\nThe project implements two experiential learning programs in biotechnology for middle and high school students. The SPARK program for middle school (7-8 grade) students offers real-world research experience in an after school setting through collaboration with schools, scientists, and educators. The LABS program (10-12 grade) builds foundational skills for careers in biotechnology, including experimental design, data analysis, interpretation, and scientific communication. Both programs provide a year-long engagement that immerse students in the field, grow confidence in biotechnology skills, and build relationships with peers, instructors, and mentors. Authentic research experiences anchor both programs. Wrap-around participant support will reduce barriers through stipends, transportation, food, and professional development. Exploration of careers in biotechnology and other emerging STEM fields will be supported through development of a digital STEM Career Directory. A coordinated evaluation will assess program outcomes through program statistics, student surveys, key informant interviews, and parent focus groups. These data will support future efforts to diversify the STEM workforce and the development of formal and informal science education programs. This project is co-funded by the Discovery Research preK-12 program (DRK-12). DRK-12 is an applied research program that seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers. Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for funded projects.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
