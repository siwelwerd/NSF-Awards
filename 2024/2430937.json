 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader/commercial impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is in the development of a sustainable solution to the global problem of plastic waste. Currently, over 90% of plastics ever produced still exist in the environment, posing significant threats to ecosystems and human health. This project aims to transform waste plastics into valuable materials that can be used in infrastructure applications, such as road construction. By recycling non-recyclable plastics into high-performance elastomers, this project not only reduces the environmental impact of plastic waste but also enhances the durability and longevity of pavements. The commercial impact includes the creation of new jobs in the recycling and construction industries, generating tax revenue, and contributing to a more sustainable economy. This project aligns with NSF's mission to promote scientific progress and support innovations that address societal challenges, ultimately improving the quality of life for U.S. citizens.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe strong technical innovation in this project is the use of Reversible Addition-Fragmentation Chain Transfer (RAFT) polymerization to produce high-value elastomers from depolymerized plastic oligomers. This method allows for precise control over the polymerization process, resulting in materials with superior mechanical properties compared to traditional recycling methods. The research will explore the optimal conditions for depolymerizing waste plastics and subsequently polymerizing them into elastomers suitable for infrastructure applications. The goals of this project include demonstrating the feasibility of this approach, optimizing the material properties for pavement use, and conducting performance testing to validate the effectiveness of the produced elastomers. The methods involve a combination of laboratory experiments, material characterization, and mechanical testing to ensure the produced elastomers meet industry standards for durability and performance. This innovative approach has the potential to revolutionize the recycling of plastics and contribute to the development of sustainable infrastructure materials.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
