 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project enhances Purdue University\u2019s external connectivity to the world, delivers fast networking for data intensive research within Purdue, and extends connectivity to under-served research facilities. These network expansions position Purdue to address data challenges in cutting-edge research and enable emerging research such as artificial intelligence across several disciplines. Several educational and workforce development activities, including formal training and mentorship, are included in this project to engage undergraduate students in the deployment and operation of network infrastructure and support experiential and residential learning programs on Purdue\u2019s campus. \r\n\r\nWith this project, Purdue connects to Indiana GigaPOP and the ESnet network with a 400 Gbps wide-area network. This upgrade enables Purdue university to fully leverage Internet2\u2019s fifth generation backbone as well as the 400 Gbps transatlantic Large Hadron Collider Open Network Environment that includes Purdue as a participating site. Furthermore, the project provides fast connectivity to Purdue research farms, Agronomy, and Animal sciences to support emerging science in under-served facilities. Finally, the project expands Purdue\u2019s science DMZ to enable high-bandwidth, low latency communication required for real-time video analytics and public-private partnerships within the Purdue Discovery Park District.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
