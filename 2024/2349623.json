 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will investigate several questions in commutative algebra, a field that studies solution sets of polynomial equations. The research will yield concrete information about the properties of solution sets of such equations. Polynomial equations arise in a wide number of applications; one fruitful approach to their study is via studying polynomial functions on their solution sets, that form what is known as a commutative ring. This offers an enormous amount of flexibility in studying solutions sets in various settings, and indeed commutative algebra continues to develop a fascinating interaction with several fields, becoming an increasingly valuable tool in science and engineering. A key component of this project is the training of graduate students in topics connected with the research program.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe focus of the research is on questions related to local cohomology, differential operators, and the property of having finite Frobenius representation type. Local cohomology often provides the best answers to fundamental questions such as the least number of polynomial equations needed to define a solution set; this will be investigated for solution sets related to certain rings of invariants. The differential operators that one encounters in calculus make sense in good generality on solution sets of polynomial equations and are proving to be an increasingly fruitful object of study. Similarly, finite Frobenius representation type, first introduced for the study of differential operators, is proving to be a very powerful property with several applications.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
