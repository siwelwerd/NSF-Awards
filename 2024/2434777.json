 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Improving Undergraduate STEM Education: Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSI Program), this Educational Instrumentation project at Hartnell College (HC), a 2-year college in California, will strengthen undergraduate learning in anatomy and physiology. Specifically, this project will secure two Anatomage clinical tables, which will allow students to conduct virtual dissection using complex 3D models. Five courses at HC: Introductory Human Anatomy and Physiology, Introduction to Pathophysiology, Human Biology, Human Anatomy, and Introductory Physiology. Up to 1600 students will utilize the project-funded equipment each year. In addition to providing improved experiences in biology courses, the new equipment will be integrated into internship opportunities and community outreach activities.  \r\n\r\nThe goals of this project are to enrich the learning and experiences of undergraduate students by providing critical equipment for the study of anatomy and physiology. Anatomage tables provide high-definition 3D models of systems and structures across the human body.  In addition to providing a more accessible and pleasant experience as compared to securing cadavers, the technology also allows for the upload and study of medical images (e.g., X-ray, CT, and MRI scans). This equipment will provide multiple hands-on learning opportunities that directly prepare students for transfer to 4-year programs or entry into the biomedical workforce. The project will assess the impact of the project funded equipment using institutional data and anonymous student surveys. This project is funded by the HSI Program, which aims to enhance undergraduate STEM education, broaden participation in STEM, and increase capacity to engage in the development and implementation of innovations to improve STEM teaching and learning at HSIs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
