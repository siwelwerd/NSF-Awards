 "awd_abstract_narration": "The annual conference, \"TROY MathFest\", will be held on the campus of Troy University in Troy, Alabama, on April 12-13, 2024, April 11-12, 2025, and April 10-11, 2026.  It is a conference aimed primarily for undergraduate students.  It provides a forum for students to present their work on mathematics projects and to attend lectures of prominent keynote speakers and connects students to graduate school representatives.  The broader impacts include allowing students to learn new mathematical ideas and therefore improving scientific literacy; giving student speakers the experience of preparing and delivering a presentation on their mathematics projects (thereby preparing them for future careers); and giving those pursuing careers in mathematics experiences that will benefit them in graduate school and beyond.  \r\n\r\n\r\nThe conference provides a forum for undergraduates to present their projects as either giving a presentation or a poster; attend keynote lectures by prominent mathematicians; interact with graduate school representatives typically from the southeast region; and participate in a calculus competition and a math trivia contest. The research projects that students presenting are under the supervision of college or university faculty members or person in the mathematics profession. Both original work and results maybe known to the mathematical community at large but not to the student are accepted for the conference. The most recent conference URL is https://www.troy.edu/academics/colleges-schools/college-arts-sciences/departments/school-science-technology/mathematics-department/about/mathfest/.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
