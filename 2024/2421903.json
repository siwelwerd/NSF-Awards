 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader/commercial impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 1 project lies in its potential to revolutionize the nation\u2019s 3D printing industry by introducing Tullomer, a proprietary liquid crystal polymer (LCP) that offers unparalleled strength, lightweight properties, radio transparency, inertness, and non-flammability using sustainable non-toxic materials. Eliminating lower performance, difficult-to-print polymers like PEEK, which require fluorobenzene processing and annealing, the project's innovative approach to improving as-printed tensile strength shall establish Tullomer as a superior alternative to existing FDM filaments. Tullomer also has the potential to greatly expand the $1B high-performance 3D printing market by democratizing engineering-grade printing on consumer printers. The company\u2019s business model involves strategic partnerships with major industry players, ensuring strong market entry and scalability. The initial market segment will target applications where lightweight, high-strength materials are critical, such as automotive, defense, and aerospace industries. Tullomer\u2019s potential to replace both metals and certain unsustainable high-performance polymers is key to Z-Polymers' commercial success, innovation, and economic growth.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 1 project addresses significant limitations in fused deposition modeling 3D printing by developing a novel liquid crystal polymer known as Tullomer, derived from 4-hydroxybenzoic acid. Traditional fused deposition modeling materials suffer from inadequate inter-layer adhesion, leading to weak and inconsistent parts. This project aims to enhance the mechanical properties and environmental compatibility of these materials by optimizing monomer ratios, integrating nucleation additives, controlling mesogenic state formation, and tuning molecular weight and viscosity. The technical approach involves developing methods for surface activation and incorporating cross-linking additives to improve inter-layer bonding and rheological properties. Distinctive attributes of this liquid crystal polymer include its melt-processability, lack of per-fluorinated compounds, and absence of Bisphenol A in processing, which contributes to its superior environmental compatibility. The anticipated results are a high-strength, eco-friendly filament that can be processed on standard 3D printers (~300\u00b0C). This filament is expected to outperform existing materials in terms of both mechanical strength and sustainability. Validation will include performance testing against industry standards and comparison with current filaments. The project aligns with global trends, positioning Tullomer as a disruptive force in the 3D printing market, particularly for applications in electric vehicles, defense, automotive, and aerospace industries.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
