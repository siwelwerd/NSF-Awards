 "awd_abstract_narration": "Quantum information science is a transdisciplinary field spanning physics, math, chemistry, computer science, and most of the engineering disciplines. It involves the study of matter at the smallest scales -- the scale of atoms and subatomic particles -- and its application to a variety of technologies. Technologies based on quantum science are poised to revolutionize many aspects of our current world and industry predicts a need for a rapidly expanding quantum workforce. With the field poised for rapid growth, now is the time to understand and address systemic equity challenges in the field in order to build an inclusive and equitable workforce. Systemic challenges in quantum education and workforce development restrict access to key education and career opportunities, limiting the ability of institutions to meet industry needs. Researchers studying quantum education and workforce development can play key roles in understanding and addressing these challenges.\r\n \r\nThe Quantum Education Research Postdoctoral Fellowship will prepare recent doctoral recipients to become leaders in quantum education and workforce development research. The program is designed to 1) launch the careers and individual research programs of three recent doctoral recipients with diverse personal, disciplinary, and research backgrounds; (2) support the use of a convergence approach to quantum education and workforce development research through a cohort research model that contributes to the establishment of a diverse and equitable quantum workforce; and (3) advance access, justice, equity, diversity and inclusion in STEM education through transdisciplinary research projects. The project aims to advance knowledge and understanding of systemic challenges to equity, inclusion, and access. Through this work, the Fellows can generate knowledge that can help in the creation of an inclusive and equitable workforce. The program will provide wrap-around support in the form of career guidance, mentorship, professional development workshops, and access to leaders in related disciplines to aid in Fellows\u2019 development as leaders in this field.\r\n\r\nThis project is funded by the Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) Education Postdoctoral Research Fellowship Program (STEM Ed PRF) with co-funding from the EDU Core Research: Building Capacity in STEM Education Research (ECR: BCSER) Program. The STEM Ed PRF Program aims to enhance the research knowledge, skills, and practices of recent doctorates in STEM, STEM education, education, and related disciplines to advance their preparation to engage in fundamental and applied research that advances knowledge within the field. ECR: BCSER is designed to build the capacity of individuals to carry out high-quality, fundamental STEM education research in STEM learning and learning environments, broadening participation in STEM fields, and STEM workforce development.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
