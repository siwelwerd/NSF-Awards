 "awd_abstract_narration": "The conference ``A celebration of algebraic combinatorics''  takes place on June 3-7, 2024, at the Harvard Geological lecture hall at Harvard University.  It covers many aspects of combinatorics, a field which was extensively developed by Richard Stanley through his work in algebraic, topological, geometric, and enumerative combinatorics.  The conference presents a chance to bring together both experts in the field and early career mathematicians to learn about the latest developments in the field.\r\n\r\nThe talks at the conference  cover a range of topics, ranging from total positivity, symmetric functions, Schubert calculus, poset topology, polytopes, to cluster algebras, log-concavity, the dimer model, and connections with probability.  Besides the talks, there are plans to have an open problem session. The website for the conference can be found at https://www.math.harvard.edu/event/math-conference-honoring-richard-p-stanley/\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
