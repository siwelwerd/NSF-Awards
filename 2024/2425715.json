 "awd_abstract_narration": "Earthquakes are powerful and unpredictable forces of nature, capable of causing immense destruction and loss of life. Despite advances in understanding the Earth's movements, predicting earthquakes remains a challenge. This project aims to revolutionize the field of earthquake science by using artificial intelligence (AI) to unravel the mysteries hidden within seismic data \u2013 the vibrations caused by earthquakes. Imagine an AI system that can \"read\" the unique signals from each earthquake, much like a detective deciphers clues. This AI, trained on massive amounts of data, will learn to recognize patterns in seismic waves, revealing details about the earthquake's source and the path the waves took through the Earth. By gaining a deeper understanding of these patterns, scientists can develop more accurate tools for earthquake monitoring and potentially even predict earthquakes with greater accuracy. This advancement will be crucial for preparing communities, improving early warning systems, and ultimately saving lives. The knowledge gained from this project could also be applied to other natural hazards, such as volcanic eruptions and landslides, further enhancing our ability to understand and prepare for these events.\r\n\r\nThis research project proposes the development of a foundational AI model for advanced seismic data analysis. The model will be trained on a vast archive of seismic data to identify and characterize earthquake signals, utilizing cutting-edge AI techniques like transformer models. This will involve the development of specialized neural network modules optimized for seismic data and the implementation of a modular and sparse multi-path framework for efficient waveform analysis. The project will focus on improving earthquake detection, localization, and characterization, with potential for broader applications in geophysics. By fostering collaboration between AI experts and geoscientists, the project will contribute to the training of a new generation of interdisciplinary researchers. Importantly, the findings, tools, and computational resources from this project will be made available to the scientific community through open-source platforms, promoting transparency and facilitating further research and innovation in the field of earthquake science.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
