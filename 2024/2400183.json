 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the support of the Chemical Catalysis program in the Division of Chemistry, Kunlun Ding of Louisiana State University (LSU) is developing novel catalysts for converting natural gas and carbon dioxide into value-added chemicals. This project will explore new chemistry for the preparation of well-defined catalysts with uniform compositions. Dr. Ding\u2019s group will combine spectroscopy and electron microscopy techniques to understand the structural evolution of the catalysts as they are used. Dr. Ding will introduce research frontiers and integrate experiments into the LSU curriculum and arrange site undergraduate and graduate student visits to local chemical industry and a synchrotron facility. Demonstration modules related to this project will be developed for outreach programs at LSU to attract underrepresented K-12 students to science.\r\n\r\nDr. Ding and his research group are developing site-specific synthesis methods and characterization techniques for tackling the structural heterogeneity issues in heterogeneous catalysis. The proposed project will explore surface inorganometallic chemistry for controlling the interactions between different metal complexes in the synthesis of supported bimetallic and intermetallic catalysts. These catalysts will be used in the tandem catalytic conversion of light alkanes and carbon dioxide, producing olefins, hydrogen, and carbon monoxide. The gained knowledge on the structural dynamics of well-defined supported bimetallic and intermetallic catalysts under reaction conditions is expected to provide a basis for more accurate computational modeling to understand the structure-property relationship of bimetallic and intermetallic catalysts, and further guide the rational catalyst design for alkane and carbon dioxide activation. The new approach for the synthesis of well-defined supported bimetallic and intermetallic catalysts has the potential for longer term scientific impact in other thermocatalytic and electrocatalytic applications.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
