 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supports the International Project Office (IPO) of the International Global Atmospheric Chemistry (IGAC) project. IGAC aims to facilitate international scientific collaborations, cultivate the next generation of atmospheric scientists, build capacity for atmospheric research globally and in under-studied regions, and foster a cohesive international community of atmospheric scientists working together across disciplines and geographical boundaries to address global environmental change and sustainability issues. IGAC continues to be sponsored by iCACGP and is now a Global Research Project under the umbrella of Future Earth. IGAC is a tremendously effective organization for connecting the global atmospheric chemistry community, both scientifically and with regards to building community.\r\n\r\nIGAC provides a framework for scientific experts to convene at the international level, identify knowledge gaps, and organize strategies to address them through topical activities that evolve with the state of knowledge. Current and proposed activities include the following: creating a forum to build common awareness on issues of regional and global interest; sponsoring science-focused activities organized and led from the bottom up; scoping, synthesis, and review articles; creating, managing, and supporting regional or project-based working groups; providing a vision on knowledge gaps; initiating workshops to tackle key challenges as they emerge; and advocating for balance across all fields of science necessary to achieve a better understanding of atmospheric chemistry. A new activity for IGAC this year involves engaging society in these issues.\r\n\r\nThe IGAC IPO is also supported by NASA and NOAA.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
