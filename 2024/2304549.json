 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks the development of a first-of-its-kind proximity sensor that consumes near-zero power at standby for touchless interface applications. The proximity detector is based on a proprietary micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) infrared detector technology that is more accurate, more compact, and 100 times more power efficient than any existing infrared detector technology. The innovation is a digitized, ultra-low power, uncooled infrared detector. The total addressable market for this proximity sensor is estimated to be ~$4.7 billion in 2023, with a serviceable obtainable market of hundreds of millions for the technology. Although the market for proximity and presence sensing is extremely broad, the team has chosen to target touchless faucets and auto sanitizer dispensers as the go-to-market applications due to the technology and market readiness. The product and its commercialization process are expected to create societal and economic impacts in four areas including conservation of resources, hygiene promotion, and enhanced partnerships between university and industry.\r\n \r\nThe intellectual merit of this project includes the first demonstration of a near-zero power proximity sensor with a wide field-of-view, tunable detection range, and temperature stability in a relevant indoor environment. State-of-the-art sensors drain battery power continuously regardless of the presence of target signal. The team recently broke the fundamental paradigm of wasting energy in standby mode with the invention of a completely passive sensor microsystem that can detect and discriminate events of interest by exploiting only the energy contained in their specific physical signatures. Remaining challenges for chip-scale hand detection include efficiently harvesting the tiny amount of thermal energy emitted by a hand to trigger a micromechanical photo-switch while achieving a high level of immunity to background temperature changes. A new plasmonically-enhanced, long-wave infrared absorber, a threshold tuning mechanism, and vacuum packaging are developed and expected to lead to the demonstration of a miniaturized prototype capable of reliably detecting a hand at 2-10 cm distance, while consuming less than 1 microamp current in standby mode.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
