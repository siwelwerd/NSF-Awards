 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to increase the scale and throughput of novel technology with the potential to enable the discovery and development of next-generation therapeutics for obesity and the array of associated medical conditions that can be ameliorated with weight loss. This technology could also be expanded to therapeutic development to address other reproductive and ageing disorders characterized by diseased fat cells.\r\n\r\nThis project may enable drug development in human fat cells at a previously unattainable quality and scale. For the last 50 years, the first stage of drug development in adipocytes has been limited by the lack of a tractable system that faithfully reproduces the clinical features of mature fat cells. The technology in this project could efficiently turn adult human stem cells into fat cells and accelerate their maturation thousands of times relative to conventional methods. Adipocytes generated by this new technology may more closely match the cellular shape and size, gene expression profile, and function of mature fat cells in adults. Scaling the technology will require development of novel devices for automation and the design and testing of customized protocols. Success will be determined by measures of manufacturing quality control and specific properties of mature human fat tissue.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

All aspects of all milestones in the Phase I grant were accomplished. In so doing, MelliCell was able to conclude that M<sup>3</sup> technology reliably induces differentiation of human stem cells into fat cells and accelerates their morphological and functional maturation thousands of times beyond 2D, conventional limits and matching that of mature fat cells in adult humans.</p>\n<p>For Milestone 1, we set design criteria for M<sup>3</sup> technology to ensure the adipocytes generated were more similar to mature human adipocytes in vivo. Specifically, the cellular morphology, gene expression, and function of several key markers of fat cell maturity were recapitulated using MelliCell&rsquo;s proprietary M<sup>3</sup> technology. Original technology invented by the Principal Investigator prior to this Phase I SBIR grant involved a manual method to pattern a preadipocyte culture surface for high differentiation efficiency and accelerated maturation and subsequently install a cell support insert over the cells to provide attachment points and three-dimensional support during hypertrophic growth in extended culture. Scaling the original, manual version of Micropatterning and Matrix Mimicry technology presented multiple challenges that were overcome in Phase I of the SBIR project. Anticipated problems with alternative approaches included development time and cost, leaking or diffusion between wells, experimental interdependence, and selection of a material and dimensions for support inserts to accommodate a secure press fit without limiting the number of cells that can be cultured per well. A traditional multi-well form factor was selected to reduce development time and cost and eliminate interdependence concerns. Finally, the dimensions of support inserts were reinforced with greater thickness so the footprint could be reduced to accommodate more cells in the 96-well device. Multiple additional innovations and improvements collectively allowed MelliCell to invent completely novel technology independent of the original, manual methods used for Micropatterning and Matrix Mimicry. The new, high-throughput methods and approaches are called M<sup>3</sup> technology, which overcomes the barriers to provide mature human adipocytes to the industry at scale. To achieve increased scale, we engineered a device with 96-heads for automated micropatterning and installation of inserts as in the original design of micropatterning and matrix mimicry technology. With the increased scale of M<sup>3 </sup>technology, this work extended the significant technical advancement over conventional in vitro models which do not adequately model adipocyte maturation, including hypertrophic growth by increasing cell volume. Since changes in gene expression, glucose metabolism, and adipokine secretion accompany changes in adipocyte morphology and these morphological and functional markers of adipocyte maturation are recapitulated by M<sup>3</sup> technology, these data establish M<sup>3</sup> technology as a more reliable representation of in vivo adipocyte biology and pathophysiology. For example, adipose secretes bioactive peptides, known as adipokines. These analytes act in an autocrine, paracrine, or endocrine manner to regulate energy metabolism. M<sup>3</sup> technology enables us to detect these adipokines relevant to physiologic levels.</p>\n<p>For Milestone 2, MelliCell validated the capabilities of the high-throughput M<sup>3</sup> platform to meet specific unmet needs in the pharmaceutical industry. As part of this NSF phase I study, MelliCell has displayed the ability to perform high-throughput small molecule screening, candidate gene overexpression and knockdown studies, and carried out brown vs. white adipogenesis comparison using the M<sup>3</sup> technology. We detected significant enrichment of UCP1 expression in brown adipocytes compared to white adipocytes. As a characteristic morphologic feature of white vs. brown adipocytes, we detected significantly increased mitochondrial content in brown adipocytes than white adipocytes. Since large-scale gene knockdown in mature adipocytes remains a challenge, MelliCell also achieved gene knockdown in mature M<sup>3 </sup>adipocytes using a variety of methods. Gene knockdown is used to reduce or eliminate the function of a protein, which facilitates researchers to understand how proteins function. MelliCell also implemented gene overexpression studies. Furthermore, adipose tissue immune cells are an important contributor to the metabolic dysfunction in chronic diseases. To model the adipose tissue microenvironment using the M<sup>3</sup> technology, we designed a co-culture experiment in the presence of mature adipocytes and human immune cells. This demonstrated MelliCell&rsquo;s capability to generate a co-culture platform using mature adipocytes and human immune cells.
