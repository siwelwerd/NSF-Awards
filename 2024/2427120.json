 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nontechnical Abstract: \r\nThe transformative promise of quantum information science ranges from advances in fundamental understanding of the natural world to unprecedented technological and societal impact. Realizing this promise requires a scalable physical system capable of both rapidly controlling and preserving quantum information. Hybrid systems that combine multiple types of physical platforms enable the optimal properties of distinct platforms to be jointly harnessed in order to address these challenges. This project investigates a novel type of hybrid quantum system that combines the advantages of semiconductor quantum bits (qubits) and superconducting circuits, which represent two compatible and currently promising solid-state quantum computing platforms. The project\u2019s integrated research and educational efforts leverage the deep quantum science and engineering expertise of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Center for Quantum Engineering to help develop and sustain the emerging quantum information science program at the University of Rhode Island and lay the groundwork for a broader effort in quantum information science and engineering, thereby (1) advancing the forefront of quantum information science knowledge by bringing together state-of-the-art efforts in the semiconductor and superconducting quantum computing fields; (2) providing the basis for a novel and practical pathway to scalable quantum computing; and (3) creating new cutting-edge opportunities in quantum information science and engineering for students and young scientists across educational and expertise levels and backgrounds to contribute to developing a diverse regional and national quantum workforce. \r\n\r\nTechnical Abstract: \r\nThis project theoretically and experimentally investigates hybrid solid-state quantum systems that integrate compact and coherent semiconductor spin qubit memories with highly tunable superconducting circuit elements, with the goal of enabling the realization of a versatile and modular quantum information processing platform capable of quantum coherence preservation simultaneously with rapid and robust control. Specifically, the project investigates hybrid solid-state qubit modules where superconducting circuit elements serve as interfaces between spin qubits in quantum dots for achieving tunable spin-spin and spin-photon coupling with expanded scope for controlling and distributing quantum information. These investigations are carried out under three main objectives: (1) Transfer and entanglement of hybrid solid-state quantum information; (2) Hybrid qubit control and coherence optimization; and (3) Proof-of-principle experimental demonstrations. The research involves identifying and optimizing spin qubit encodings and mechanisms by which the intrinsic spin-dependent electric dipole moment associated with spin qubits can coherently interface with linear and nonlinear superconducting circuit elements to enable tunable spin-spin entanglement and enhanced spin-photon coupling. The developed theoretical framework provides guidance for proof-of-principle experimental demonstrations. This work serves to generate new fundamental understanding of quantum states, coherence, control, and entanglement in hybrid semiconductor qubit-superconducting circuit systems, as well as to provide a basis for efficiently linking semiconductor qubit modules via superconducting circuits and tailoring these systems to function as building blocks of a modular quantum processor.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
