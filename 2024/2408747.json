 "awd_abstract_narration": "Rocky planets orbiting stars other than the Sun (exoplanets) are common, and cutting-edge space- and ground-based telescopes are now observing their atmospheres through their spectroscopic features. By analogy to Earth, the atmospheres of these planets are expected to be shaped by release of gases from their hot interiors, termed \u201coutgassing\u201d. Drawing connections between studies of Earth and studies of exoplanets, researchers at the University of Arizona will model the geochemistry and observational signposts of magmatic outgassing on temperate, Earth-like exoplanets. They will integrate this exoplanet research with a science enrichment program conducted at Flandrau Planetarium, targeting grades 3-6 from the diverse Tucson school system, reaching thousands of students. \r\n\r\nAtmospheres of terrestrial exoplanets are now becoming observable, and the first hints of atmospheric detections have begun to emerge. Some of these exoplanets are predicted to have enhanced magmatic outgassing of volatile species due to strong tidal heating, which might detectably modify their atmospheres. This is significant because magmatic volcanism is invoked as both a habitability indicator and as a potential source of abiotic false positives for biosignature gases. The investigators will produce theoretical models of exoplanet volcanism, accounting for magmatic outgassing of volatiles, their atmospheric photochemical processing, and radiative transfer simulations of the resultant planetary spectra. They will determine the best spectral signatures of magmatic outgassing and how those signatures may be used to determine the properties of the underlying planet. They will also develop a new Astronomy Discovery Program at Flandrau Science Center & Planetarium, consisting of hands-on inquiry-based activities. The goal is to enhance science literacy and recruitment to STEM and college and to broaden the demographical participation in science. The program will include exoplanet themes, leveraging the expertise of the researchers; it addresses state and national science standards, meeting community needs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
