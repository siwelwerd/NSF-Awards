 "awd_abstract_narration": "Documenting and learning from observations after \"extreme events\" is central to advancing the state-of-art in multi-hazards infrastructure engineering.  Recorded observations serve as benchmarks of the effects of these events, their underlying causative mechanisms, and for validation of design procedures.  Capturing key lessons learned from extreme events constitutes an important task for advancing research in geotechnical engineering since many design procedures are based on empirical methods that require continuous re-evaluation as important new case histories emerge.  The NSF-sponsored Geotechnical Extreme Events Reconnaissance (GEER) Association organizes and supports the reconnaissance efforts of geotechnical researchers and develops techniques to capture perishable data to learn from these events.  The scope of GEER reconnaissance activities includes earthquakes, landslides, and debris flows, and associated impacts such as liquefaction, and fault rupture, building and bridge foundation failures, as well as dam, levee and retaining structure collapses.  The primary objectives of GEER include: documenting geotechnical effects of important extreme events to identify important topics in need of research; employing innovative technologies for post-event reconnaissance; and advancing the capabilities of individuals performing research based on field observations.  Much of the data generated during extreme events is perishable and therefore must be collected soon after the event.  The challenge is to develop the most effective approaches for documenting the results of \"full-scale experiments\" that often occur with limited advance warning, if any.  Since 2015, GEER has successfully documented the geotechnical effects of 18 extreme events, including hurricanes Irma and Harvey, floods in South Carolina, Illinois, and Texas, and earthquakes in Mexico, New Zealand, Equador, Nepal and USA, amongst others. Many GEER efforts have led to follow-on funded projects, reflecting that GEER reconnaissance efforts are identifying important research issues that can lead to advancements in science and engineering.  Many of the innovative techniques employed in reconnaissance efforts over the past decade or so, such as the utilization of GoogleEarthTM, GPS devices, remote sensing, and LIDAR, were initiated by GEER members.  GEER is well positioned to continue making similar advancements with respect to the use of new technology and data communication and sharing approaches for field reconnaissance. \r\n\r\nThis award provides funds for continuation of GEER activities to enable rapid, responsive geotechnical investigations after natural and human-induced disasters. It is expected that two to four investigations after moderate-sized events will be conducted each year.  An important aspect of the work is to leverage the benefits of the recently established NSF NHERI initiative and to enhance the interactions between GEER and the other existing and future elements of the NHERI initiative.  In particular, a strong focus to coordinate interactions between GEER and the NSF RAPID facility at the University of Washington has been identified as a priority.   To ensure that this important interaction is accomplished, the PI will assume direct responsibility for coordinating these critical activities including development and delivery of training efforts.  If a larger event occurs, GEER will recommend submission of a RAPID proposal to NSF by an identified GEER team leader to respond effectively to the event.  Unfortunately, extreme events will continue to happen.  It would be even more unfortunate if the engineering profession did not capture the perishable data that enables it to understand which design procedures result in good engineering performance and which procedures still need improvement.  GEER with its engaged and expert geo-professional participants will continue to help \"turn disasters into knowledge\".\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

While the PI?s activities in GEER have included education and outreach activities as well as general management with colleagues of the Association, this outcomes statement will focus on three events for which the PI either led or co-lead the reconnaissance response. These examples illustrate GEER?s resilience and adaptability, as well as its leadership role in the global reconnaissance community.</p>\n<p>The first event is the 2020 Port of Beirut Explosion. GEER decided early on to engage with this disaster for two main reasons: (1) it was an explosion of unprecedented scale in the center of a major port complex and adjacent to a dense urban area ? as such the opportunity to learn from the disaster by mapping the explosion?s impact on building and other infrastructure was considered to be valuable; (2) we reached out to other domestic reconnaissance organizations, all of whom declined to engage, hence we felt a responsibility to perform this work for the broader engineering community. As is typical of GEER deployments outside of the U.S., we began by partnering with local contacts that both have strong technical credentials and connections to appropriate government officials, in this case Prof. Salah Sadek at the American University of Beirut. Because the event occurred during the height of the pandemic, we encountered challenges that prevented us from sending personnel or equipment to Beirut. Nonetheless, through regular weekly meetings over an extended period of time, and a dedicated workforce leveraged from Beirut universities and professional organizations, an extensive survey of impacts on port infrastructure and buildings was completed. The results are published in GEER report 070 and a journal article (Sadek et al. 2022), which are the only publically available documents providing detailed information on the damaging effects of the explosion. Figure 1 shows damaged grain silos at the Port of Beirut, which were extensively documented as part of this work.</p>\n<p>The second event is the 2020 <strong>M</strong> 7.0 Samos Island (Aegean Sea) Earthquake. This event occurred just off the coast of Samos Island, which is part of Greece, but was also proximate to some large urban centers along the Turkish coast, where collapsed structures and numerous fatalities occurred. GEER has strong contacts in both countries and learned that the in-country personnel were conducting reconnaissance but without any between-nation coordination. GEER, in partnership with EERI, encouraged a coordinated effort with the PI serving as a liaison and technical coordinator. This effort was successful, and instead of a series of bifurcated national reports, a single combined report (GEER Report 069) was produced with contributions from GEER, EERI, and multiple professional societies in Greece and Turkey. This collaborative spirit continued with the publication of a special issue in the <em>Bulletin of Earthquake Engineering</em> with many papers jointly authored by Greek and Turkish authors (along with some Americans). Figure 2 shows the cover image from the joint report, which shows collapsed structures from a portion of Izmir where pronounced site response effects occurred, as well as a child?s rescue.</p>\n<p>The third event is the sequence of devastating earthquakes from February 2023 in Turkey along the East Anatolian Fault. As a catastrophic event on a major plate-boundary strike-slip fault, the relevance of the data from this event was immediately apparent. Accordingly, GEER decided early on that a major response was essential. From the early days, in-country seismologists, geotechnical engineers, and structural engineers deployed to the area. We established communications with these groups to understand conditions on the ground. Within the US community, we strongly encouraged a coordinated response among GEER and other agencies including EERs and professional socities. EERI agreed and partnered with GEER, as had been the case with the Samos event. As a result, combined EERI/GEER teams deployed and worked closely with Turkish partners. Ultimately this occurred as a phased response with multiple GEER and EERI teams gathering essential data. Following this data collection, GEER worked closely with EERI and Turkish partners to produce a joint report, which was published 3 months after the mainshock on May 6 2023 (GEER report 082). Figure 3 shows the report cover image, which shows a building with foundation failure from liquefaction and structural damage. Numerous NSF Rapid proposals have been funded for follow up research and data collection. Hence, the response to this event is ongoing.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 08/15/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Jonathan&nbsp;Stewart</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1826458/1826458_10567460_1692110740133_OutcomesFig1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1826458/1826458_10567460_1692110740133_OutcomesFig1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Port of Beirut\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1826458/1826458_10567460_1692110740133_OutcomesFig1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Port of Beirut\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Figure 1.
