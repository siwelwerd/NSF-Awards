 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ribonucleic acid (RNA) is a polymeric molecule essential in various biological roles in coding, decoding, regulation, and expression of genes. A non-coding RNA (ncRNA) is an RNA molecule that is not translated into a protein. Non-coding RNAs contribute to diseases including cancers, autism, and Alzheimer's. Non-coding (nc) RNAs, such as microRNA (miRNA) and long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), play pivotal roles in the regulation of various physiological and pathological processes. Nonetheless, the mechanistic\r\nregulation, subcellular distribution, and mode of action of ncRNAs remain elusive due to a lack of effective tools for probing ncRNAs in live cells. \r\n\r\nThe PI will develope a multispectral single molecule barcode biosensor for dynamic multigene analysis. They will establish a convertible tetrahedral DNA (CTED) biosensor along with a multispectral single molecule sensing (MSMS) system for multiplex ncRNA detection in live cells.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
