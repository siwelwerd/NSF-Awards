 "awd_abstract_narration": "Understanding future arctic terrestrial carbon balance is vital because high latitude soils contain about twice as much carbon as is in the atmosphere and its release would drive a major acceleration of atmospheric carbon dioxide accumulation. This research will advance the understanding of processes regulating the storage and release of carbon from arctic soils across biological and physical scales using a modeling approach. The study will promote both basic research into the controls on arctic soil and ecosystem processes and be applicable to management agencies by describing how linked biotic-abiotic responses to unprecedented warming may influence future carbon balance in Arctic terrestrial ecosystems. Further, this grant will help advance the career of an Assistant Professor at a primarily undergraduate institution, while enhancing gender and racial diversity in the biogeosciences. This research will also directly enhance undergraduate education in arctic biogeoscience through directed mentorship of undergraduate researchers; the research approach and findings will also be incorporated into courses and other teaching activities by the primary investigators.\r\n\r\nField studies suggest that inconsistent responses to comparable experimental manipulations across arctic tundra ecosystems might be driven by local variation in the plant and decomposer community. However, the relative importance of, and links between, key biotic (e.g. microbial acclimation) and abiotic factors (e.g. altered snowpack, thaw depth, and nutrient availability) that govern these divergent responses of tundra to climate variation, remains unknown. This project will synthesize available data from ambient and experimental manipulations of arctic ecosystems. The investigators will then use the synthesis to refine, parameterize, and validate a changed version of the Stoichiometrically Coupled, Acclimating Microbe-Plant-Soil (SCAMPS) model. Simulations will explore how variation in seasonal warming and the acclimation potential of the soil microbial and plant community, encompassing community shifts, evolutionary adaptation, and physiological changes across tundra landscapes, affects biogeochemical feedbacks and regulates future carbon balance of arctic soils and ecosystems.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n            This project advanced the understanding of the processes regulating carbon sequestration in and carbon release from arctic soils.  The permafrost underlying arctic soils holds between 20 and 40% of all the organic matter in soils globally.  The amount of carbon in this organic matter is equivalent to over twice the carbon currently in atmospheric carbon dioxide.  Because the organic matter in permafrost is frozen, it has remained biologically inactive for thousands of years.  However, as the Arctic warms, the permafrost will begin to thaw and this very large stock of organic matter will become susceptible to decomposition by soil bacteria.  As the bacteria metabolize the organic matter, they release the carbon as carbon dioxide or as methane, both of which are potent greenhouse gasses.  Thus, the thawing of permafrost and the consequent decomposition of organic matter currently in deep-freeze storage is potentially a major source of greenhouse gasses to the atmosphere, which could substantially exacerbate global warming.\n\n            Unfortunately, the full story is more complicated.  As the bacteria metabolize soil organic matter releasing carbon, they also release nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus that are vital to plant growth. The organic matter in permafrost contains large quantities of nitrogen and phosphorus.  As these nutrients are released from the permafrost and the overlying seasonally active soil layers, they will increase the fertility of arctic soils and are expected to stimulate plant growth.  As plants grow, they remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere through photosynthesis and incorporate that carbon into their tissues.  Plant, particularly plants that have a lot of woody tissues, hold in their tissues three to six times as much carbon per unit nitrogen or phosphorus as does soil organic matter.  Thus, if the release of nutrients from soil organic matter can stimulate plant growth sufficiently, it can result in a net removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and a net accumulation of carbon in the ecosystem.  Furthermore, as the plants grow, they drop dead leaves and branches and turnover older roots.  These dead tissues become part of the soil organic matter and contribute to the amount of carbon stored in soils. \n\n            The net gain or loss of carbon by arctic ecosystems is determined by the balance between these opposing processes of carbon release associated with more microbial activity with warming and carbon sequestration associated with plant growth stimulated by nutrients released from soils.  To understand the factors affecting this balance, scientists on this project made use of two computer models that couple soil and plant processes but have different foci.  The first model is the Stoichiometrically Coupled, Acclimating Microbe-Plant-Soil (SCAMPS) model, which has a detailed representation of carbon-nitrogen interactions in soils including microbial release of enzymes that target and decompose specific classes of organic matter.  The second is the Multiple Element Limitation (MEL) model, which calculates how plants allocate effort toward the uptake of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus to optimize plant growth.  By combining the two perspectives represented by these two models, scientists are better able to evaluate long-term data sets and forecast likely responses of arctic tundra to climate warming.\n\n            In addition to its contributions to general knowledge that should be helpful to society's adaptation to climate change, the project has helped launch the career of a promising young scientist and enhance gender and racial diversity by supporting a female scientist of color in the biogeosciences.  The project also helped train a female post-doctoral scientist and has contributed to undergraduate education at The Marine Biological Laboratory, Hampshire College, and the California Polytechnic State University.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/08/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Edward B Rastetter"
