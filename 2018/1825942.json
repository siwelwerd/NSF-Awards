 "awd_abstract_narration": "Human sensorimotor capabilities vastly out-perform those of modern robots. Prior research suggests that humans achieve skillful movement by exploiting combinations of \"dynamic primitives\", which are robust building blocks of coordination that simplify control. Interaction with complex objects - such as spreading a tablecloth - requires prediction which, in turn, requires mental representations of the objects and environment.  This project explores the extent to which such mental models may also take the form of dynamic primitives.  The project team will perform fundamental research exploring: how humans learn to manipulate a complex flexible object through the composition of dynamic primitives; the impact of explicit instruction on the acquisition of the mental models; and whether a primitive-based control structure to be implemented in a robot can achieve skillful manipulation of complex objects and fluid interactions between humans and robot. This project serves the national interest because the resulting understanding of human sensorimotor control and robot control methods may result in improved efficacy of robot-assisted physical rehabilitation after neuromotor injuries such as stroke, where safe physical cooperation with humans is fundamental and mutual learning is of paramount importance.  The project will involve an educational component that provides engineering and research methods training to graduate and undergraduate students, as well as STEM outreach to individuals of all ages at the Museum of Science in Boston. Additional efforts will be made to attract and retain women into careers in science and engineering.\r\n\r\nThis research investigates a biomimetic approach to robot control that promise improved human-robot physical interaction during co-manipulation of flexible objects with complex continuum dynamics. Methods include skill acquisition experiments involving expert and novice human subjects to test how mental representations are formed and the extent to which they may be shaped by explicit instruction during training; a theoretical study of how motor learning may be facilitated using mental models based on dynamic primitives vs. lumped mechanical properties; and a study of human-robot co-manipulation of flexible objects wherein dynamic primitives provide the basis not only for robotic control, but also for communication and mutual learning between the human and robot partners. This research promises new insights into the manipulation of complex objects and tools, an area where humans still outperform machines.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Yet, the human motor system is higher-dimensional, has slower neural transmission and has ubiquitous noise in the sensorimotor system.&nbsp;How do humans overcome these seemingly profound limitations?&nbsp;To reveal the foundations of the neuromuscular system, research in human motor neuroscience to date has focused on relatively simple movements, predominantly reaching in the horizontal plane. However, to inform robotic control, human research also needs to address the skilled movements where humans excel and out-perform robots by all measures. The&nbsp;goals of this collaborative research were to understand how humans interact with flexible objects to generate insights to controlling robots.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>- We conducted human experiments to examine how humans learn to strike a target with a whip.</p>\n<p>- We showed that despite the complexity of these whole-body movements and the large variability between individuals, a small set of features characterized skilled performance.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>- We developed a mathematical model of the whip to derive the control inputs needed to strike a target with a modeled whip.</p>\n<p>- We conducted model simulations (with collaborators at MIT) to test the hypothesis that a small number of building-blocks sufficed to strike a target with a whip.</p>\n<p>- We created a simplified 3D-printed whip model that a robot can manipulate.</p>\n<p>Our experimental results showed that humans develop highly constrained initial conditions for the whip prior to strike that determined the hitting success. Our simulation results demonstrated that humans use a simplifying strategy for control: composing actions from well-learned building-block actions, specifically 1) single movements; 2) continuous oscillations; and 3) the compliance of the limbs, which can be adjusted voluntarily.&nbsp;These building blocks are stable dynamic primitives that arise in the dynamics of sensorimotor system and &lsquo;collect&rsquo; the neuromuscular machinery without requiring explicit detailed control from the brain.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Intellectual Merit</h2>\n<p>A series of experimental studies with human participants with a wide range of experience showed that humans achieved skilled manipulation of the whip. Despite considerable inter-individual variations, one key feature to accurately striking the target was preparing the whip into full extension (at a certain angle) prior to the forward-striking action. Analyses of one professional whip performer revealed that variability was lowest at the tip of the whip, demonstrating that the expert controlled the tip, i.e., &lsquo;embodied&rsquo; the whip. Another long-term experiment tested whether participants with physics training who also received in-depth information about wave dynamics, acquired the skill faster compared to participants without this cognitive information. First results showed no advantage, suggesting that cognitive understanding of the whip&rsquo;s dynamics contributes little to skilled performance.</p>\n<p>We also conducted computer simulations of a human arm wielding a whip to strike a range of distant targets (with collaborators at MIT). Using optimization, we showed that a single human-like movement (between two rest configurations) sufficed to strike most targets. A remarkable feature of these simulations was that they converged within a few hundred iterations, in contrast to state-of-the-art machine-learning approaches which require many thousands to millions of iterations. It appears that this characteristically human movement (with smooth, symmetrical bell-shaped speed profile) is well-suited to initiating and propagating a wave pulse along the whip, which can then be fine-tuned to reach a target.</p>\n<p>Complementary to these simulation, we built a physical 3D-printed model of the whip that was mounted on a robot arm. The mathematical model of the whip became the basis for more theoretical work on the control of this high-dimensional object.</p>\n<h2>Broader Impacts</h2>\n<p>Our research significantly extends current research in human movement neuroscience that has advanced the underpinnings of the sensorimotor system in simple movements, such as single-joint flexions. Our research opened up a highly novel research agenda by investigating complex movement skills from a theoretical perspective. As such, our work received a lot of attention ranging from class visits to coverage in a New York Times article and attracted new people to this kind of research. The female PI has also become a role model for many students.</p>\n<p>The behavioral and theoretical analyses perfectly bridge to robotic research as control of underactuated objects is a state-of-the-art challenge in robotics. Our results highlight new features relevant for the control of flexible objects: initial conditions are critical for successful manipulation leading to astonishing control over the tip of the whip. Composing behavior from well-learned building blocks may account for observed motor behavior and serve as new approach to robot programming.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Given the steady advance of robots into our daily lives it is important that robots harmoniously collaborate with humans. Robots that exhibit behavior similar to humans are more comprehensible by humans and therefore fundamentally more trustworthy and acceptable. This will facilitate seamless integration of robotic technology into daily life and work.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1></h1>\n<h1></h1>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/30/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Dagmar&nbsp;Sternad</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"></div>\n</div>",

To reveal the foundations of the neuromuscular system, research in human motor neuroscience to date has focused on relatively simple movements, predominantly reaching in the horizontal plane. However, to inform robotic control, human research also needs to address the skilled movements where humans excel and out-perform robots by all measures. The goals of this collaborative research were to understand how humans interact with flexible objects to generate insights to controlling robots. \n\n- We conducted human experiments to examine how humans learn to strike a target with a whip.\n\n- We showed that despite the complexity of these whole-body movements and the large variability between individuals, a small set of features characterized skilled performance. \n\n- We developed a mathematical model of the whip to derive the control inputs needed to strike a target with a modeled whip.\n\n- We conducted model simulations (with collaborators at MIT) to test the hypothesis that a small number of building-blocks sufficed to strike a target with a whip.\n\n- We created a simplified 3D-printed whip model that a robot can manipulate.\n\nOur experimental results showed that humans develop highly constrained initial conditions for the whip prior to strike that determined the hitting success. Our simulation results demonstrated that humans use a simplifying strategy for control: composing actions from well-learned building-block actions, specifically 1) single movements; 2) continuous oscillations; and 3) the compliance of the limbs, which can be adjusted voluntarily. These building blocks are stable dynamic primitives that arise in the dynamics of sensorimotor system and \u2018collect\u2019 the neuromuscular machinery without requiring explicit detailed control from the brain. \nIntellectual Merit\n\nA series of experimental studies with human participants with a wide range of experience showed that humans achieved skilled manipulation of the whip. Despite considerable inter-individual variations, one key feature to accurately striking the target was preparing the whip into full extension (at a certain angle) prior to the forward-striking action. Analyses of one professional whip performer revealed that variability was lowest at the tip of the whip, demonstrating that the expert controlled the tip, i.e., \u2018embodied\u2019 the whip. Another long-term experiment tested whether participants with physics training who also received in-depth information about wave dynamics, acquired the skill faster compared to participants without this cognitive information. First results showed no advantage, suggesting that cognitive understanding of the whip\u2019s dynamics contributes little to skilled performance.\n\nWe also conducted computer simulations of a human arm wielding a whip to strike a range of distant targets (with collaborators at MIT). Using optimization, we showed that a single human-like movement (between two rest configurations) sufficed to strike most targets. A remarkable feature of these simulations was that they converged within a few hundred iterations, in contrast to state-of-the-art machine-learning approaches which require many thousands to millions of iterations. It appears that this characteristically human movement (with smooth, symmetrical bell-shaped speed profile) is well-suited to initiating and propagating a wave pulse along the whip, which can then be fine-tuned to reach a target.\n\nComplementary to these simulation, we built a physical 3D-printed model of the whip that was mounted on a robot arm. The mathematical model of the whip became the basis for more theoretical work on the control of this high-dimensional object.\nBroader Impacts\n\nOur research significantly extends current research in human movement neuroscience that has advanced the underpinnings of the sensorimotor system in simple movements, such as single-joint flexions. Our research opened up a highly novel research agenda by investigating complex movement skills from a theoretical perspective. As such, our work received a lot of attention ranging from class visits to coverage in a New York Times article and attracted new people to this kind of research. The female PI has also become a role model for many students.\n\nThe behavioral and theoretical analyses perfectly bridge to robotic research as control of underactuated objects is a state-of-the-art challenge in robotics. Our results highlight new features relevant for the control of flexible objects: initial conditions are critical for successful manipulation leading to astonishing control over the tip of the whip. Composing behavior from well-learned building blocks may account for observed motor behavior and serve as new approach to robot programming. \n\nGiven the steady advance of robots into our daily lives it is important that robots harmoniously collaborate with humans. Robots that exhibit behavior similar to humans are more comprehensible by humans and therefore fundamentally more trustworthy and acceptable. This will facilitate seamless integration of robotic technology into daily life and work. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/30/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Dagmar Sternad"
