 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will study the how collisions between ultracold atoms can be controlled by an external laser field.  These experiments will lead to a greater understanding of light-assisted collisions and simple chemical reactions.   The major advancement in this project is that the laser will be pulsed on a time scale, and chirped over a frequency range, commensurate with the atomic collision process.  Using ultrafast lasers, related experiments on much faster time scales have led to a greater understanding of light-assisted chemical reactions.  However, because atoms in the planned experiments will be very cold, the new experiments can be conducted on significantly slower time scales.  This team has already developed a novel amplitude and phase modulated laser system for these experiments.  This laser system will also be used to explore new methods for controlling atomic excitations.  This is important for slowing atoms and is an interesting avenue toward slowing molecules to a stop.  These activities provide an ideal environment for undergraduate physics students to conduct exciting physics and experiments, use lasers to control quantum mechanical excited-state collisions, and explore new techniques for preparing ultracold molecules.  Engaging students in undergraduate research is a high-impact teaching practice and helps to generate trained scientists.  \r\n\r\nBoth of the projects are centered on a novel laser system to generate intense frequency-chirped pulses of laser light.  This laser will be used to affect a variety of dynamics in atomic physics, including coherently controlling ultracold collisions and studying rapid adiabatic passage.  In the first project, this team will use loss from a magneto-optical trap as a tool to explore coherently controlling trajectories in inelastic light-assisted collisions between atoms.  Recent work has shown that ultracold collisions between two rubidium atoms can be controlled with frequency-chirped laser light; typically the entire process takes about one nanosecond.  By tuning the laser frequency and amplitude on that same time scale, one can influence the behavior of the collision and the entire process can be coherent.  The initial experiments have shown that this is the case using a 1 GHz in 100 ns laser pulse; however, the experiments weren't fast enough to observe total control over collisional processes.  This team has shown, using semi-classical simulations, that a modest increase in the chirp-rate leads to full control over collisional processes of this type (1 GHz in 20 ns).  This project now aims to show that shaping laser pulses on the one nanosecond time scale can lead to control over collisions in a novel way.   In the second project, this team will explore shaped frequency-chirped laser light as a means to accelerate atomic gases.  They will do this by using a pair of counter propagating frequency-chirped pulses delayed by much less than the lifetime of the transition.  This will work with a Doppler broadened gas because the range of chirp is large and rubidium is heavy. Successful developments on this project may increase the likelihood that coherent processes will be used to slow molecular beams (SrF, CaF, etc), for cold and ultracold molecule experiments.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nAward Title: RUI: Atomic Physics with Rapidly Frequency Chirped Laser Light\nFederal Award ID: 1803837\nReport Submission Period: 09/01/2020 to 08/31/2021\n \nThe last forty years has been an exciting time for ultracold physics.  During this time the field has continued to develop even more control over atoms (and now molecules).  The continuing level of control of atoms has been one of the main contributors to the second quantum revolution now underway and many other exciting developments such as realization of Bose-Einstein Condensation and Strongly-Interacting Fermi Gases.  Often times, the \"control\" part of these experiments comes from using laser light to manipulate atoms through adjusting the precise frequency and amplitude of the lasers used.\n\n\nRapidly modulating the frequency and amplitude of laser fields provide some exciting means to control atoms and molecules.  For example, rapid adiabatic passage, transfer of an atom from one state to another without using spontaneous emission (often a limiting process) has shown to be successful.  This can be done by rapidly tuning while simultaneously pulsing a laser over a specific frequency and time range.  For this project, we have extended the ability to generate rapid frequency chirps (on the nanosecond time scale) and our understanding of the physics of this chirped light generation.  Using a laser amplifier, we can generate our frequency chirps at significantly higher power. Since a faster chirp requires higher power to successfully drive transitions, we will be able to explore various atomic physics processes at higher speeds, where the negative effects of spontaneous emission can be minimized.\n\n\nWe are actively exploring how the development of our laser system can be used in atomic physics experiments.  In particular, we are interested in exploring light-assisted collisions between ultracold atoms.  In these collisions, multiple interactions with a laser via rapid adiabatic passage is used to control the movement of atom pairs on a molecular potential while a collision is occurring.  This has been an area of research that we have explored successfully in the past.\n\n\nOur research team has a strong focus on undergraduate student involvement and training in all of our projects.  For example, the group associated with this project is exclusively made up of and led by undergraduate students (with the exception of the PI).  Over the three years of funding, 11 different undergraduate students worked directly on this project.  Another 7 students worked on additional research projects that were not associated with the NSF supported project.  Approximately 50% of the research group is female.  During that time, our research group presented at several conferences, had one peer-reviewed publication accepted that was not related to the grant, and 12 op-eds.  One of the op-eds was directly related to the NSF project. \n\n \n\nStudents working on this project have developed a wide range of skills (lasers, optics, electronics, data acquisition, computer programming, etc.).  Students associated with this project have pursued many different of careers, including mechanical engineering, applied mathematics, and Ph.D. programs in physics and bio-medical engineering.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/13/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Matthew Wright"
