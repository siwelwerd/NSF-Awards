 "awd_abstract_narration": "Work plays a substantial role in many individual lives and influences adult personality development. We know that the most substantial changes in adult personality occur when individuals enter the workforce; these changes are consistent with the reward structure and expectations of the work environment.  But we do not know much about the specific mechanisms that link experiences in the workplace with personality trait change. This project will evaluate the complex effects of work, including the absence of regular or meaningful work, on personality trait development in young adults. The results of this research will show what skills are needed to find a job and to succeed in the workplace, and provide valuable information about the effects of unemployment and underemployment on personality development. This information will help policy makers identify potential interventions that can aid underemployed workers in becoming more competitive for full-time permanent positions. Results from this project may be especially helpful to colleges and universities as they strive to promote successful transitions from college to the workforce. \r\n\r\nThe project will conduct a multi-wave longitudinal study of close to 1,000 graduating seniors from a large Midwestern university who are entering the workforce. Participants will be solicited from all available majors on campus and baseline data will be collected during their final semester in college. Subsequent surveys will be administered every six months for the first two years of the study to obtain detailed information about transitions to the workforce. Annual surveys will then be administered for two additional years to obtain longer-term information about personality trait change, workplace experiences, and the effects of unemployment or underemployment. Personality traits will be assessed at each time point using both self- and informant-reports. In addition, information will also be gathered about participant work experiences, perceived fit and engagement with their jobs, and investment in family and community activities. Structural equation modeling will be used to examine the effects of work experiences on adult personality trait development while controlling for other life events. The results of these analyses will enhance theoretical understanding of how work is related to psychological and social development in the 21st century.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
