 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed project seeks financial support to support invited speakers and conference organization needs at a meeting to be held in March 2019 in Washington, DC. The \"Emergent Technologies for Intelligent Networks of Sensors and Actuators\" Conference will focus on bringing together a multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary group of researchers whose ideas can help advance the conception and development of intelligence in wireless systems and networks that will revolutionize the way we live and change the industries and the economy. This conference will foster advances in understanding of intelligence and the conception and development of future intelligent systems or networks which will transform the society.  The conference's objectives and approach are inspired by Intelligent Wireless Networks of Sensors and Actuators that are a digital business innovation concept making Internet-of-Things service-oriented architectures, and advanced human-computer interactions converge to a more agile, flexible, and proactive management of unexpected events.  The convergence of technologies that were uniquely independent such as, analog and digital, software and hardware, packaging and electronic materials, in addition to a convergence of their cyber-biophysical capabilities in terms of curiosity-driven intelligence, and multi-brain control and decision making will be a key topic of the conference.  The Conference is expected to play a key role in identifying new directions in understanding of intelligence and the conception and development of future intelligent systems or networks which will transform the society. It will promote the convergence of diverse groups of designers, innovative ideas, demonstration of concepts and commercialization of products.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
