 "awd_abstract_narration": "Digital surfaces are being massively produced from scanners, imaging systems, sensors and many other devices these days.  How to compare and categorize these surfaces is an urgent and important problem.  This National Science Foundation funded project aims to develop mathematical theories for an efficient and speedy classification of digital surfaces.  A successful completion of this National Science Foundation funded project will have applications in medical imaging, game industry, engineering and many fields. Some of the earlier work of the PI in this area have already been used in health and game industries.  The project work will further advance this progress and develop deep mathematics based on the classical Riemann surface theory and conformal geometry. \r\n \r\nThe classical theory of Riemann surfaces is a powerful tool for classifying surfaces up to conformal diffeomorphisms. The most important theorem in the theory is the Poincare-Koebe's uniformization theorem. The theorem has a wide range of applications within and outside mathematics. However, computation of uniformization maps and metrics on non-flat surfaces are very difficult in general. The goal of the proposal is to develop a theory of discrete conformal geometry for polyhedral surfaces, to establish the counterpart of the uniformization theorem in the discrete setting, and to prove convergence of discrete conformal maps to conformal maps. The PI will develop efficient algorithms to compute uniformization metrics through collaboration.  The main ingredient in developing a discrete conformal geometry is to define the notion of discrete conformality. In a recent joint work with collaborators, the PI introduced a notion of discrete conformal equivalence for polyhedral metrics on surfaces. The PI and his collaborators proved a discrete version of uniformization theorem for compact polyhedral surfaces and showed that discrete conformal maps converge to conformal maps on tori and disks.  There remain several major open problems of establishing the convergence of discrete conformal maps for all surfaces and proving the discrete uniformization theorem for all non-compact simply connected surfaces. The discrete conformality introduced by us is closely related to the work of Alexandrov, Pogorelov and Thurston on convex surfaces in hyperbolic three-space, the classical Wyle problem and the Koebe circle domain conjecture.  Tools developed in the classical area of mathematics will be used to solve the proposed problems.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project investigates geometry of surfaces and its real-world applications.  Classical geometry of surfaces developed by Gauss in the 19-th century investigates the shapes of curved surfaces using the notion of curvature (a measurement of how a surface is curved at points)  and measurement of distances between two points on the surface.   B. Riemann, a student of Guass,  initiated a different approach to surface theory by focusing on the notion of angles on the surface.  This is called the conformal geometry of surfaces.  For instance, two surfaces are considered to be conformal if one can map one surface to the other one, in the one-to-one onto manner, such that the map preserves angles at every point.  These maps are called conformal maps.  The key problem is to identify if two surfaces can be conformally mapped to each other.  Solution of this fundamental problem has many real world applications.  At the beginning of the last century, Poincare and Koebe solved the key problem and proved that if a surface in the 3-space has no holes (mathematically called simply connected), then it can be conformally mapped to the round 2-sphere, or the plane or the round disk.  According to this theorem,  any human face can be flattened to a round disk in such way that angles are preserved.  One can use this flattened figure for facial comparison and facial recognition. This is one example of application of the Poincare-Koebe theorem. It has many other real-world applications including medical imaging, computer graphics and shape comparision.  However, the proofs of the Poincare-Koebe fundamental theorem do not provide any algorithms on how to compute the conformal maps.   The project investigates surfaces using polyhedral approximations  (sometimes called discrete surfaces). By  establishing  the counterpart of Poincare-Koebe theorem in the discrete setting, the PI aims to show that discrete conformal maps approximate  the smooth conformal maps. The outcomes of this project produce a practical algorithm to compute these conformal maps and theoretically verify the images produced by our algorithm are accurate.\n\nMathematically, the project investigates polyhedral surfaces which are made of Euclidean triangles and the associated discrete conformal geometry.  Polyhedral surfaces are ubiquitous due to digitization and can be coded by a computer algorithm easily.  Smooth surfaces can be approximated by polyhedral surfaces.  The previous work of the PI and his collaborators proved the counterpart of the Poincare-Koebe uniformization theorem for compact polyhedral surfaces.   The first goal of the project is to extend the discrete uniformization theorem to the non-compact simply connected surfaces. The second goal is to show that discrete conformal maps converge to the classical conformal maps.  The solutions of these problems will theoretically guarantee that the algorithms produced by the discrete conformal geometry converge to the smooth cases.  The outcomes of the project show that both goals have been achieved.  These results will be useful for categorize and classify polyhedral surfaces.  Mathematicians and computer scientists who are working with digital surfaces and 2-dimensional data sets will benefit from this research.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/11/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Feng Luo"
