 "awd_abstract_narration": "The surfaces of devices such as a wind turbine blade, of an airplane wing, of a propeller or fan are all designed to manage the flow of air in a beneficial way. However, turbulence that inevitably accompanies the flow produces pressure fluctuations on a surface that can result in undesirable vibration or sound. This research effort is directed at understanding how treatments placed just above a surface might be able to substantially reduce the pressure fluctuations, without negatively impacting the beneficial effects of a surface on the flow. The work will involve coordinated wind tunnel experiments at Virginia Tech, and theoretical studies at Florida Atlantic University. As well as advancing science and engineering in the area of fluid dynamics, the effort will be focused on the research training of PhD and undergraduate students. In particular the experiments will be integrated with required undergraduate laboratories at Virginia Tech, impacting several hundred students over the course of the project.\r\n\r\nThe main objective of this work is to establish the fundamental scientific basis for surface treatments that reduce turbulent surface pressure fluctuations, while maintaining the wall-normal transport of momentum and low drag that is required in most fluid dynamic applications. Recent studies have definitively demonstrated that pressure shielding is possible. The purpose of this work is to provide a quantitatively usable fundamental understanding of the mechanisms behind these effects, and the mathematical methods needed for their prediction.  The research program is focused on the application of pressure shielding treatments to two fundamental flows; the shear-free boundary layer formed adjacent to a wall in homogeneous turbulence, and a conventional flat plate turbulent boundary layer. These flows have been chosen since they cleanly separate some of the major mechanisms expected to be responsible for pressure shielding. They are also geometrically simple and well characterized, since analytical or experimental models of the complete correlation structure of these flows exist. Large scale experiments on these configurations with and without treatment, will be performed at Virginia Tech. Parallel mathematical modeling will be carried out at Florida Atlantic University. Through this closely linked study we expect not only to extract the fundamental nature of the pressure shielding, but also to build mathematically well-founded analytical tools needed for its prediction. A key goal is to provide research education to a diverse group of students drawn from a broad range of academic levels. The planned work includes specific tasks to be conducted by groups of undergraduate and high school students across both institutions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

These surfaces include structures that change the mean velocity profile and the distribution of turbulence in the flow as a function of height above the surface and result in Modified Boundary Layer flows. It has been shown that Modified Boundary Layers reduce sound radiation from different types of surface, including bio-inspired surfaces based on the silent flight owls. During the course of this study an analytical model for the surface pressure spectrum below a Modified Boundary Layer was developed. It was established that there are high frequency and low frequency parts to the spectrum that scale on different lengthscales and turbulent velocities, and the results were found to be consistent with measurements in the Virginia Tech wall jet facility. For Modified Boundary layers that had porous canopies it was found that lower porosity levels give the most significant improvement acoustic performance. This is attributed to the higher levels of viscous resistance in the MBL. It was also demonstrated that changing the mean velocity profile in a turbulent boundary layer influences the surface pressure fluctuations. Changing the profile can translate into a localization of the unsteady part of the flow reducing the surface pressure fluctuations. This effect translates into shear sheltering and pressure shielding at particular frequencies. However, it was also found that there are frequencies where the mean velocity profile increases surface pressure when compared to the constant shear profile. These frequencies and vortex sheet locations cause a higher level of surface pressure fluctuations caused by shear amplification. Designing Modified Boundary layers to reduce surface pressure fluctuations requires a trade off between these two effects. It was also found numerically that the presence of a structure in the flow to modify the distribution of turbulence always increased the effective surface drag, but the drag penalty was smallest when the structure was closest to the surface. During the course of this grant three graduate students were supported by the grant and completed their Masters Degrees. In addition, five undergraduate students carried out research projects related to the theme of the grant.</p>\n<!-- @font-face \t{font-family:\"Cambria Math\"; \tpanose-1:2 4 5 3 5 4 6 3 2 4; \tmso-font-charset:0; \tmso-generic-font-family:roman; \tmso-font-pitch:variable; \tmso-font-signature:-536870145 1107305727 0 0 415 0;}@font-face \t{font-family:Calibri; \tpanose-1:2 15 5 2 2 2 4 3 2 4; \tmso-font-charset:0; \tmso-generic-font-family:swiss; \tmso-font-pitch:variable; \tmso-font-signature:-536859905 -1073732485 9 0 511 0;}@font-face \t{font-family:\"Times New Roman \\(Body CS\\)\"; \tpanose-1:2 11 6 4 2 2 2 2 2 4; \tmso-font-alt:\"Times New Roman\"; \tmso-font-charset:0; \tmso-generic-font-family:roman; \tmso-font-pitch:auto; \tmso-font-signature:0 0 0 0 0 0;}p.MsoNormal, li.MsoNormal, div.MsoNormal \t{mso-style-unhide:no; \tmso-style-qformat:yes; \tmso-style-parent:\"\"; \tmargin:0in; \tmso-pagination:widow-orphan; \tfont-size:12.0pt; \tfont-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif; \tmso-fareast-font-family:Calibri; \tmso-fareast-theme-font:minor-latin; \tmso-bidi-font-family:\"Times New Roman \\(Body CS\\)\";}p \t{mso-style-priority:99; \tmso-margin-top-alt:auto; \tmargin-right:0in; \tmso-margin-bottom-alt:auto; \tmargin-left:0in; \tmso-pagination:widow-orphan; \tfont-size:12.0pt; \tfont-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif; \tmso-fareast-font-family:\"Times New Roman\";}.MsoChpDefault \t{mso-style-type:export-only; \tmso-default-props:yes; \tmso-fareast-font-family:Calibri; \tmso-fareast-theme-font:minor-latin; \tmso-bidi-font-family:\"Times New Roman \\(Body CS\\)\";}div.WordSection1 \t{page:WordSection1;} --><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 03/04/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Stewart&nbsp;A&nbsp;Glegg</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"></div>\n</div>",
