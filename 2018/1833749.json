 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the 12th Graduate Climate Conference (GCC), to be held at the Pack Center of the University of Washington from November 2nd to November 4th 2018. The GCC is an annual interdisciplinary climate science conference organized by and for graduate students. It provides a discussion forum for students conducting research on climate in a variety of disciplines including atmospheric dynamics, ocean dynamics, ocean biology and chemistry, atmospheric chemistry, climate dynamics, paleoclimate, and human dimensions of climate variability and change. The meeting is intended to help students familiarize themselves with the breadth of climate science, gain exposure to the enormous range of tools available to address climate-related questions, and understand how their research fits into the broader landscape of current climate science. The conference seeks to better prepare graduate students for scientific inquiry in a field that increasingly demands interdisciplinary approaches. Funds provided here support travel and subsistence for over 60 students chosen through a competitive process which places emphasis on selecting a cross-section of applicants that reflects the diversity of the next generation of scientists, and recognizes the value in a wide range of geographic and ethnic backgrounds.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
