It is expected that the award will further the faculty member's research capability, improve research and teaching at the institution, and involve undergraduate students in research experiences. The award to Bowie State University has potential to broader impact in a number of areas. This proposal aims to synthesize a library of compounds with subtle structural changes to determine how a non-functional binding site on a protein can affect the protein?s function. Gaining an understanding how small molecule affect this protein can help scientists understand and control cell death. Undergraduate students will gain research experience in organic synthesis and biochemistry. \r\n\r\nThe cell has many adaptive mechanisms used for the cellular repair during endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. If proteostasis is not re-established, unfolded proteins are tagged for clearance through the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). Aberrant cells have been shown to exploit these prosurvival mechanisms as a way to circumvent cell death. However proteasome disruption leads to cell death. Valosin-containing protein (VCP) is a key component of the UPS which may be targeted to investigate its role in proteostasis. Small molecule heterocycles such as imidazoles have the potential to allosterically bind to VCP to disrupt the UPS in rogue cells. The utilization of a two-step synthesis of a library of novel imidazole compounds through microwave-assisted multicomponent reactions will allow a variety of imidazole compounds to be rapidly synthesized. Ultimately these compounds will be used to identify the structural features which are key for allosteric binding to VCP.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project successfully produced 18 new compounds to target the protein VCP which is proposed to be responsible for cell death.  This was accomplished through a microwave-assisted multi-component reaction where three or more reagents were used to do several reactions at one time.  Microwave energy helped these reactions occur very rapidly through the use of high heat and pressure.  This method can be used to generate numerous other compounds to target VCP or other protein targets.  The funding awarded for this project has elevated the research capabilities and student experience at Bowie State University.  A state-of-the art microwave reactor was purchased in order to conduct these syntheses.  Also underrepresented minority students of Bowie State University have been highly trained in organic synthesis in the process of making these compounds.  They have learned about the drug discovery process and conducted in-depth literature reviews of VCP and its associate system.  In addition, students have been able to present their work both orally and in poster presentations at conferences all around the country.  Through collaborations with local high schools, our undergrads have also mentored 12th graders during their time in the lab.  Overall this project has not only impacted the scientific community but has exposed minority students from high school through college to several areas of scientific research including organic chemistry, biochemistry, bioinformatics and biology.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/22/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jacqueline A Smith"
