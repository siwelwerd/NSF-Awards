 "awd_abstract_narration": "Galaxies often eject large amounts of gas and dust in outflowing galactic winds, which are a crucial element in how galaxies evolve with cosmic time. These galactic outflows explain why galaxies form relatively few stars, compared to the amount of potential fuel available for star formation. They are required by theoretical models to correctly match the observed distributions of masses and star formation rates in galaxies, yet they remain poorly understood. This project will test the extent to which stars can create such winds. Investigators will determine the physical properties of outflows in galaxies that are undergoing a burst of star formation. This project will determine the physical characteristics of both the stars in the galaxies and the outflows they are driving. These galaxies likely represent a crucial phase in the creation of massive galaxies as they consume gas and shut down the future formation of stars. This project will train undergraduate and graduate students in research and implement outreach activities that will connect K-12 classrooms across the country with professional astronomers through in-class video discussions and follow-up reflection and assessment.\r\n\r\nFeedback in the form of outflowing gas and dust is a crucial aspect of galaxy evolution, explaining why galaxies form relatively few stars, compared to the baryon budget of the Universe. Galactic outflows are prevalent in star-forming galaxies and likely regulate and eventually shut off star formation. Despite the critical importance of feedback to the galaxy evolution process, its physical mechanisms remain poorly understood. This project will test the limits of stellar feedback by characterizing the physical properties and determining the space density of compact starburst galaxies that exhibit the fastest outflows (>1000 km/s) and highest star formation rate surface densities known. This project will determine physical characteristics of both the dusty starburst cores of these galaxies as well as the multi-phase outflowing gas. These results will constrain the physical drivers of these extreme outflows, as well as their impact on their host galaxies. This project aims to fully characterize the nature of the outflows, test a time sequence for the shutdown of star formation and the development of feedback, and place these galaxies in the broader context of massive galaxy formation. This project will also support the research efforts of multiple undergraduate students, as well as two graduate students, and will support outreach efforts to connect K-12 students with research by bringing professional astronomers into classrooms via in-class video discussions and follow-up reflection and assessment.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nA major question in galaxy evolution is how massive galaxies stop forming stars. One of the most likely explanations is that the gas that fuels the formation of new stars is expelled from the galaxy. This so-called feedback is theorized to be driven either by the energy from exploding stars, the momentum from photons emitted by the most massive stars, from the extremely hot gas that enters supermassive black holes (SMBH) in galaxy centers, called Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), or from some combination of these three. It is often difficult to determine the origin of this feedback as accretion on to SMBH and intense star formation often go together. \n\nThe co-PIs of this proposal discovered a population of ultra-compact galaxies in the distant Universe. These galaxies were surprising because they exhibited outflows of material in very large amounts and at very high velocities exceeding 1000 km/s, very young stars, but no evidence of any accretion onto a SMBH. These galaxies were also very compact and clearly in the process of merging, which could have driven gas to their centers where it could form stars. The final mystery is that these galaxies have significant amounts of star formation that is significantly obscured by dust. If the outflows are driven by young stars, it demonstrates that feedback from young stars and supernovae is sufficient to remove gas completely from massive galaxies. \n\nThe goalsof this project that fall under the heading of intellectual merit were to: 1) test the limits of stellar feedback by characterizing the physical properties of these galaxies; 2) to determine the properties of the gas outflowing from these galaxies; 3) to determine the space density of these galaxies, which will link them to other populations and help to determine their overall importance. This project will determine physical characteristics of both the dusty starburst cores of these galaxies as well as the multi-phase outflowing gas. These results will constrain the physical drivers of these extreme outflows, as well as their impact on their host galaxies.\n\nThe goals of the project that fall under the heading of broader impact were to join with the other co-PIs in discussing their results with high school students. The co-PI also runs a research-based outreach program at a local high school.\n\nThe project has produced a variety of impactful outcomes in the areas of Intellectual Merit and Broader Impact.\n\nIntellectual Merit\n\n1. We have found that in addition to the ionized gas ejected from these galaxies, a significant amount of molecular gas is ejected. This implies that the outflows are capable of removing dense gas to far distances from the galaxies.\n\n2. Using Keck observations, we discovered that one of the objects, called Makani (Wind in native Hawaiian) has the largest ever nebula of hot gas in a galaxy that contains no AGN. This gas extended over 300,000 light years and gave direct observational evidence for the expelled gas from these galaxies extending far into the regime where the outflowing gas interacts with gas infalling into the galaxies for the first time.\n\n3. Using Hubble Space Telescope imaging, we measured the velocity needed to escape from our galaxies and found that the gas that is being expelled is doing so well in excess of this escape velocity. This added to the evidence that these phenomena are capable of removing gas and shutting down star formation.\n\n4. We were able to determine the space density of our objects by determining how long they would be observable in their current state and using that to uncover the underlying population that are the progenitors of our objects. We concluded that our compact starburst galaxies are the most extreme tail of compact and star-forming galaxies.\n\n5. Detailed spectroscopy with Keck and with the ALMA telescope allowed us to confirm that the outflowing gas exists in multiple phases with a complex outflow history. We also determined that entire holes are being blown in the gas surrounding these galaxies, allowing extreme ultraviolet radiation to leak directly out.\n\n6. We analyzed the motions of the gas compared to the properties of the galaxies such as their star formation rate and the density of star formation in the galaxies. The outflowing gas velocity correlates with these properties and provides further evidence that AGN are not the primary energy source driving these outflows. \n\nBroader Impact\n\n1.
