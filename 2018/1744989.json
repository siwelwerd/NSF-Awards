 "awd_abstract_narration": "The emperor penguin is an iconic seabird that is found in colonies distributed around the entirety of the Antarctic coastline. Emperor penguins are an important indicator species for the health of the Southern Ocean because their reliance on sea ice for major parts of their life cycle means that their population can be influenced by changes in the extent and duration of sea ice around Antarctica. Although baseline data exists on emperor penguin distributions and overall population size, data on how population size varies at individual colonies is limited to only a few locations. Thus, knowledge about how changes in local or regional environmental conditions impacts local or global population status is poorly understood. By combining established methods in satellite remote sensing with ground and aerial surveys of several colonies across the continent, this project will generate population estimates for the 54 known emperor penguin colonies. Decadal scale population trend data will be combined with environmental variables (e.g., sea ice extent and duration among others) to reveal which conditions influence population fluctuations at regional and continental scales. The project will engage with international collaborators, train post-doctoral associates and future scientists, and develop citizen science and K-12 outreach programs. \r\n\r\nThis project on emperor penguin populations will quantify penguin presence/absence, and colony size and trajectory, across the entire Antarctic continent using high-resolution satellite imagery. For a subset of the colonies, population estimates derived from high-resolution satellite images will be compared with those determined by aerial surveys. This validated information will be used to determine population estimates for all emperor penguin colonies through iterations of supervised classification and maximum likelihood calculations on the high-resolution imagery. The effect of spatial, geophysical, and environmental variables on population size and decadal-scale trends will be assessed using generalized linear models. This research will result in a first ever empirical result for emperor penguin population trends and habitat suitability, and will leverage currently-funded NSF infrastructure and hosting sites to publish results in near-real time to the public.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Because they live in such inaccessible places, emperor penguins have been traditionally difficult to study and that means that a full understanding of their habitat requirements and global population trends have been elusive until now. We combined counts of adult birds from aerial photographs and ground counts, with data from high-resolution satellite imagery (just like in Google Earth) to learn how many adult emperor penguins were in attendance at colonies in the springtime (mostly the months of September and October) during 2009-2018. We also wanted to understand what factors influence their choice in habitat: in other words, why do they live in some places and not in other places?</p>\n<p>Accounting for observation errors and population processes in our statistical models, we learned that there is an 88% chance that the global population of emperor penguins in Antarctica is smaller in 2018 than in 2009 (going from approximately 250,000 birds to approximately 230,000 birds; these are indices of abundance). We estimate an approximate 9.6% decrease in the index of birds in attendance at the colony during the spring time, and we note that this is a conservative estimate since we are unlikely to be accounting for failed breeders or non-breeding animals. However, we cannot attribute the change we detected to any environmental variables yet, and changes in populations differed by region. For example, there was a decrease in the Weddell Sea sector but populations seemed to have remained stable in a few places like the Bellingshausen Sea. The declines we detected could be consistent with reduced breeding propensity, increased reproductive failure, and/or increased mortality of any age class, i.e. lower recruitment.</p>\n<p>Emperor penguins are well-known to return to the same locations to breed and so we were also interested in the reasons emperor penguins choose certain locations to breed over others. We combined information about colony location with several characteristics about the fast ice (the sea ice \"fastened\" to land), and other physical and biological environment characteristics to determine if there is a set of criteria that emperor penguins \"choose\" when choosing their habitat to breed. As it turns out, the habitats emperor penguins choose are quite diverse and depend on the region where the colony is located. For example, in the Ross Sea (home to the largest marine protected area in the world since 2017) emperor penguins tend to choose habitat that is far from Weddell seals with low persistence of the fast ice; but in East Antarctica, emperor penguins like to be near Weddell seals and the persistence of the fast ice there is high. These two examples are basically opposites of each other. Within each region, we also found little difference between the colony locations and areas devoid of emperor penguin colonies. Together, we interpret this to mean that emperor penguins may exhibit what is called, \"behavioral plasticity\", which is another way of saying they can cope with unusual challenges.</p>\n<p>In summary, we found a probable decrease in the index of abundance of birds we are seeing on the satellite images during the springtime over the course of 10 years. But, we note that emperor penguins seem to respond to their environments differently depending on the region, and there does not seem to be one defining factor that influences habitat selection for the species. Our work can be used to inform conservation and policy decisions within the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meetings (ATCM), the Commission on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR), and the International Union on the Conservation of Nature (IUCN).</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/29/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Michelle&nbsp;A&nbsp;Larue</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1744989/1744989_10556519_1698625077159_Figure4_PackIce--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1744989/1744989_10556519_1698625077159_Figure4_PackIce--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Regional trends in Emperor penguin colonies during 2009-2018\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1744989/1744989_10556519_1698625077159_Figure4_PackIce--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Regional trends in Emperor penguin colonies during 2009-2018\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Regional dynamics of emperor penguin populations (indices of abundance of adult penguins observed from VHR imagery during each austral spring on the Y-axis, which is fixed from 0 at the origin to a maximum of 125,000 birds;
