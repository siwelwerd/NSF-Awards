 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Division of Chemistry is awarding funding to Dr. Cynthia Burrows at the University of Utah.  Her research team plans to investigate how the genomes of microorganisms adapt to environmental stress.  Many species of plants, algae and bacteria have adapted to live under extreme conditions of heat, salt, drought or intense UV light, all of which place chemical stress on the cell's DNA.  Other organisms, such as the coral symbiont zooxanthellae, a close cousin of algae, have not adapted to stress, and rising ocean temperatures are leading to coral 'bleaching' due to loss of their algae, a food source for the coral.  Research supported by this grant investigates the hypothesis that sequences of DNA that can fold into a motif termed \"G-quadruplex\" may help the organism respond to oxidative stress caused by an increase in temperature and increased photosynthesis.  Students involved in this work are to learn how the chemistry of the environment influences the chemistry of the cell at the level of the organism's genetic code.  In addition, the PI is developing a series of lectures, \"Beyond Watson and Crick,\" that communicate the importance of changes in the DNA to life processes.\r\n\r\nTo address the question of why certain microorganisms, notably algae and thermophilic bacteria, have dense potential G-quadruplex sequences (PQS) in their genomes, a reporter plasmid assay is to be developed in the model algal organism Chlamydomonas. Synthetically altered DNA sequences is to be inserted into promoter sequences of a reporter gene, and gene expression will be monitored as a function of oxidative stress.  In addition, the PQS density in Thermus bacteria is to be investigated. The sites of oxidative damage are to be mapped onto the promoter regions and PQS sites to discover correlations between G-quadruplex sequences, regulation of oxidative damage, and adaptive responses to environmental stress.  These studies help define the circumstances under which chemically-modified bases in DNA, such as 8-oxoguanine, serve as epigenetic markers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nMany bacteria are able to adapt to extreme environments involving high temperature, high salt, extremes in pH or ultraviolet radiation damage.  Specialized mechanisms for these cells may exclude or readjust the concentrations of salts, acids or bases, but thermophiles&mdash;high temperature-loving organisms&mdash;must be able function at temperatures that would normally cause the DNA duplex and folded proteins to unravel.  A solution to this for the DNA double helix is to have a high guanine/cytosine (G/C) content in the genome because these base pairs stabilize the duplex at high temperature.  On the other hand, high guanine content sensitizes the DNA to oxidative stress and radiation.\n\nOur goal was to investigate whether microorganisms utilize G-rich regions of their genomes to respond epigenetically to oxidative stress.  As a component of this work, we examined the photochemistry of several modified and/or epigenetic bases and compared them to guanine photochemical behavior.  We found that while methylated bases such as 5-methylC and 6-methylA are more readily photooxidized than C or A, that the canonical base G is still the best site of oxidation.  Secondly, we found that for large genomic DNA, we could employ base excision repair enzymes as a method of finding the relatively rare DNA base modifications so that they could be tagged for sequencing.  Graduate student Justin Dingman won the \u2018Best Poster\u2019 award at the International Conference on Environmental Mutagenesis in Ottawa in August 2022 presenting on this topic.\n\nIn a third area, we became intrigued by the impact of ozone as a DNA oxidant.  We were able to fill a substantial gap in the literature by determining the major product of ozone oxidation of guanine; rather than the commonly held belief that 8-oxoguanine is the major product, we found that an unstable isomer is formed, which rearranges to a final product that is particularly challenging to characterize by traditional methods.  This outcome suggests that new methods are needed for assessing the environmental impact of ozone on human (and other organisms\u2019) health.\n\nStudents trained in this work gained experience in understanding how the chemistry of the environment interacts with the chemistry of the cell at the level of the organism\u2019s genetic code.  In addition, the PI developed a series of lectures, \"Beyond Watson and Crick,\" that communicate the importance of alternative nucleobases and alternative folds of DNA to life processes.  These lectures formed the basis of several visits to PUIs, additionally supported by a Phi Beta Kappa Lectureship award to the PI.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/22/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Cynthia J Burrows"
