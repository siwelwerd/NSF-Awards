 "awd_abstract_narration": "This multi-disciplinary study will investigate the processes that trigger submarine slope failures on the New Zealand continental margin. The investigation will explore how many failures occur and their frequency, whether small landslides in an area make the slope resistant to large landslides, and  what types of landslides generate tsunamis. Recent work off the northwest coast of the U.S. has shown that small landslides on continental margins occur more frequently than previously thought. The small landslides are caused by shaking generated by both local and remote earthquakes. Changes in the overlying water column were also found to be important in generating the small landslides. In this new study off New Zealand, seafloor sensor data will be combined with other available geophysical, water column, and meteorological data, to evaluate whether the results of the Cascadia work on the stability of submarine slopes can be generalized to other subduction zone margins. The results of this study will improve the capability to identify past large earthquakes in the sedimentary record. In addition, this study will provide constraints for models of submarine landslides and aid in predicting areas of potential slope failure. The study supports the training of a postdoctoral investigator.\r\n\r\n\r\nAccretionary margins that overlie active subduction zones undergo continuous re-surfacing by repeated sediment slope failures and gravity flows. Studies done off Cascadia show that slope failures can occur either spontaneously or be triggered by identifiable events that include oceanographic processes or by seismic waves generated by local or remote earthquakes. The mechanisms and key attributes of these triggering seismic waves (e.g., frequency content, duration, etc.) remain speculative. Preliminary results also indicate that the geologic structure and topography of the accretionary wedge have profound impacts on the seismic loading. Sediment slope failures and flows also can be triggered by storms, tides, upper water column eddies and circulation changes. This study tests these ideas by analyzing new data from seafloor sensors that were deployed on the Hikurangi margin off New Zealand in 2015. These data will also be used to examine the signature of slow slip events on the shallow plate interface. A Regional Ocean Modeling System hindcast will provide insight into the nature of signals at the seafloor that originate from ocean surface forcing in this area. By combining seafloor pressure, temperature and seismic ground motion measurements, with other available geophysical, water column and meteorological data, and the oceanographic context provided by the regional model, it will be possible to improve the fidelity of seafloor temperature and pressure signals associated with sediment slope failures and flows, with the side-benefit of characterizing near-surface eddies and ocean circulation changes\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nCoastal margins of continental plates that cover active subduction zones are at risk from large earthquakes as the tectonic plates collide.  These earthquakes also cause sediment landslides produced by the effect of shaking on steep margin slopes.   These underwater landslides can generate large tsunami waves that overwhelm and destroy areas of the heavily-populated coastal zones.  Understanding subduction faults. and the processes that produce large margin sediment landslides, is a key problem in marine sciences. \n\n \n\nWith this research project we conducted a study of earthquake hazard that centered on analyzing recent data from seafloor instruments on the New Zealand margin.  Our research evaluated the ability to identify Slow Slip Events (SSEs).  SSE is the term for slow earthquakes that can last over several weeks.  This slow motion makes SSEs very difficult to identify using instruments placed on the seafloor.  In contrast, normal subduction zone faults relieve stress by violent movement that occur in only tens of seconds. This rapid slipping of several meters produces large magnitude earthquakes and enormous tsunami waves that can destroy coastal communities.  SSE are a different type of slow fault movement of only a few tens of centimeters that takes place over tens of days.  This slow movement of the seafloor changes the thickness of the overlying seawater column sightly, and this small elevation movement produces pressure variations that are recorded by seafloor instrumentation used in this project.\n\n \n\nUnfortunately, seasonal changes in water column currents can also change seafloor pressures, and this \u2018seawater noise\u2019 must first be removed from pressure records in order to identify the SSE movements.   While the slow movement of SSEs cannot cause tsunamis or damage to structures on the nearby coast, the rate that they occur on the subduction zone faults can be used to predict the larger magnitude destructive earthquakes.   The ability to accurately identify SSEs with seafloor measurements is critical to evaluate the seismic and tsunami hazards for populated coastal communities. \n\n \n\nImproving the ability to identify the pressure changes detected by seafloor instruments that are only from SSEs, by removing noise due to water column circulation changes, was the basic objective of this research project.\n\n \n\nOur research successfully determined pressure changes from known SSEs using data that was collected during the \"Hikurangi Ocean Bottom Investigation of Tremor and Slow Slip\" experiment in New Zealand.  During the period when our seafloor data was collected, a strong SSE occurred on the New Zealand margin and was identified using land-based GPS stations.  Our research results indicate that the seafloor elevation changes due to SSEs can be accurately measured by submarine pressure instrumentation, but only if the competing pressure changes from normal ocean circulation are removed as noise.  In summary, our research project was successful in the stated goal of increasing the accuracy of seafloor instrumentation.\n\n \n\nThe Broader Impacts component of this project grant supported an undergraduate research assistant at the University of Washington and the publication of a major research paper on our results (Gomberg, J., Hautala, S., Johnson, H.
