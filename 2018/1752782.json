 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nontechnical description:  The abundant and sustained nature of sunlight leaves little doubt that solar cell technology will play a pivotal role in future clean energy strategies. It is for this reason that considerable efforts are underway to improve upon current solar cell designs that can only convert less than a third of sun light into electricity. The research team seeks significantly increased conversion efficiencies through a new, low cost, next generation solar cell that utilizes previously unharnessed low energy sun light. Achieving this goal requires an understanding of how molecules assemble and interact on solar cell surfaces, how fast each step in the light-to-electricity conversion process unfolds, and the barriers preventing solar cell materials from creating more energy from available light. Integrated into the project are outreach activities that engage the online community with research-related photos, videos, and stories via blogs and other social media. Complementing this online effort is also an event called Ask a Scientist where several scientists engage local community members in casual conversations about science during a once-a-month art, music, and entertainment festival.\r\n\r\nTechnical description: Photon upconversion, combining two or more low energy photons to generate a higher energy excited state, is an intriguing strategy to harness low energy light, circumvent the Shockley-Queisser limit, and increase the maximum theoretical solar cell efficiency from 33% to above 45%. However, achieving efficient upconversion under ambient solar intensities and incorporating this process directly into a solar cell remains challenging. This CAREER project utilizes multilayer self-assembly on inorganic surfaces to manipulate energy and electron transfer dynamics at an interface and directly harness upconversion in a solar cell. This project also combines electrochemical and spectroscopic techniques to gain a fundamental understanding of the rate and efficiency limiting energy and electron transfer processes in assemblies at metal oxide interfaces. The incorporation of new sensitizer and acceptor molecules into the bilayer film is necessary to achieve efficient upconversion under low energy, solar irradiation. Complementing this research effort are a number of outreach activities that target individuals from many different educational, socio-economic, and racial/ethnic backgrounds.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

It is for this reason that considerable efforts are dedicated to increasing solar cell efficiencies in order to decrease module costs. However, due to fundamental physical limitations, a standard solar cell has a maximum theoretical efficiency of &lt;33%. Molecular photon upconversion, the process of combining two low energy photons to generate a higher energy excited state, is a promising means of harnessing low energy portions of the solar spectrum in a solar cell and increase theoretical efficiencies to &gt;45%. As a step towards this goal, our team used multilayer self-assembly of photon upconversion molecules on an inorganic surface for direct incorporation in a solar cell. Early contributions include the demonstration that the observed photocurrent (i.e., current generated from light) was due to an upconversion process and that previously transmitted solar energy was being harnessed by a solar cell. Progressive modification of the components resulted in a nearly a hundred-fold increase in the current generated up to 315 microamps per centimeter squared which still stands as the world record for harnessing photon upconversion in a solar cell under standard solar conditions. We also used molecular design strategies to shift the absorption of the upconversion film from the visible to the near infrared portions of the solar spectrum, a light harvesting region necessary to maximize the efficiency of upconversion. In parallel to this progression, we gained fundamental insights into the rates of the various competing processes in the multilayer assembly and upconversion solar cell and determined the efficiency limiting processes. We found that critical to many of the dynamics processes was the structure of the assembly and made significant progress towards determining and controlling the structure of the multilayer. Beyond our efforts harnessing upconversion in a solar cell, molecular-inorganic interfaces are ubiquitous to all organic electronics including OLEDs, OPVs, biosensors, photodetectors, and more. This work has generated general knowledge on how the structure and property of these interfaces dictate the performance and utility of these hybrid junctions. This new information will be relevant to many areas spanning materials science, biomedical science, engineering, and more. Complementing our research efforts are several outreach activities that target individuals from many different educational, socio-economic, and racial/ethnic backgrounds. These activities include engaging the online community through social media, interacting with the local community during in-person and online Ask a Scientist event, as well as mentoring graduate and undergraduate students.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 09/24/2024<br>\nModified by: Kenneth&nbsp;G&nbsp;Hanson</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n></div>\n</div>\n",
