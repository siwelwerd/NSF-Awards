 "awd_abstract_narration": "In many models of physical reality, coherent system states emerge and are maintained through a balance of countervailing influences.  Effects that concentrate, aggregate, or focus are generated by nonlinear mechanisms.  Competing influences that diffuse, disperse or fragment are often due to linear action.  This project addresses several problems which involve a dynamic balance of this kind, whose solution will require the development of new and useful mathematical tools.  These problems arise in connection with investigations in animal ecology, image analysis, optimal transportation, fluid dynamics, and stochastic models of interacting agents.  The new mathematical ideas to be developed promise to be of strong interest to researchers in a variety of disciplines.  The project will also engage students and young researchers, and lead to results to be communicated at seminars, conferences, summer schools, and lecture series.\r\n\r\nIn particular, this project's research will focus on understanding dynamic phenomena that concern four topics strongly motivated by applications and the present state of theory in partial differential equations: (1) A fundamental merging-splitting model of group-size distributions, arising in H.-S. Niwa's analysis of empirical data on fish school size in the mid-ocean;  (2) Least action principles for volume-preserving shape deformations and their connection to (regularized) optimal transport metrics, motivated by modeling dynamics of constant-density crowd configurations;  (3) A novel type of weakly singular shock wave dynamics in a regularized model for shallow water equations describing waves on scales large compared to the water depth;  (4) How coherent waves and patterns form through gradient-like dynamics in a proposed new model of nonlocal dispersion and nonlinear focusing, related to fixed-point formulations for computing wave shapes in a variety of nonlinear systems.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe theme of the research supported by this grant is to analyze mathematical models of physical phenomena involving opposing mechanisms that (i) focus or concentrate by long-range (nonlocal) means, vs. those that (ii) diffuse or smooth.\n\nRegarding intellectual merit, we mention a few highlights.  A singular finding of this work emerged as a by-product of studying a method for deforming images in ways mathematically related to incompressible fluid flow.  Using numerical experiments performed by reversing time, we identified  a controlled scenario in which motion of the fluid surface may fail to remain smooth and form a sharp corner, in apparently self-similar fashion (see figure).  In physical fluid motions this corresponds to an extra-powerful impact of an ocean wave on a seawall. A rigorous analysis of the scenario may be possible in future work.\n\nIn another part of this work we enhanced our mathematical explanation for why schools of ocean fish, following simple rules for merging and splitting, develop a highly skewed non-bell-shaped size distribution.  We analyzed how such distributions can spread out in self-similar form, by exploiting recent progress in complex function theory.\n\nFurther, new principles were found that govern how many different stable communities of species are possible in classic Lotka-Volterra growth-death models of population biology.  The PI and graduate student Won Eui Hong found (i) such communities can never differ by only one species, (ii) contrary to conjectures generated by others' numerical experiments, it is possible for a single species, stable on its own, to participate in another stable community, and (iii) with certain robust patterns of weak and strong competition, huge numbers of stable communities are possible (exponentially large).\n\nSome interesting results for other topics concern: emergence of weak singularities in shallow water models regularized by dispersive shock-suppressing terms; oscillations in time in a classic Becker-Doering model of cluster growth (for raindrop formation in clouds, e.g.) with steady source and removal mechanisms; and existence of solitary waves in peridynamics models of strong deformations in solid bodies.\n\nRegarding the broader impacts of this work, a wide community of scientists and engineers should find interest in the singular type of fluid motion we uncovered through time-reversed simulation.  Population biologists, fisheries scientists, and others should find interest in our results on merging-splitting and Lotka-Volterra models.  E.g., recent research suggests populations of bacteria in the human gut may be stabilized by patterns of weak and strong competition.  The project has facilitated PhD research completed by 5 graduate students (co-)supervised by the PI, collaboration with 4 postdoctoral researchers, and research investigations undertaken by 2 undergraduates at Carnegie Mellon.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/21/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Robert L Pego"
