 "awd_abstract_narration": "This collaborative project at the Rochester Institute of Technology and the University of Cincinnati aims to increase the number of students who graduate in STEM, so that the United States can maintain a strong workforce for global competitiveness. Retaining more students in STEM majors during the first two years of college is especially critical. This project will create, test, evaluate, and disseminate a set of interactive online tutorials for introductory physics classes.  These tutorials will be designed to help students develop the skills necessary for solving complex problems, while giving students early, positive experiences that will build their confidence and persistence. Based on multimedia learning principles and research on human learning and memory, each tutorial will provide varying amounts and types of support, aligned with individual student needs. The support will be delivered through (online) mini-lectures, hints, tips, or encouragement by a tutor (a real person who appears in a video). Students who struggle more will receive more guidance, and students who struggle less will be able to navigate through the tutorial at a faster pace. The process is intended to be similar to having a live tutor for help and guidance.\r\n\r\nThe project's overarching goals are to improve physics instruction for all students by using online tutorials for teaching problem solving, and to contribute to physics education research by studying the use of the tutorials. To achieve these goals, the project team has identified the following objectives: (1) Create a set of 30 online Interactive Video-Enhanced Tutorials (IVETs). (2) Disseminate the IVETs through the ComPADRE Digital Library of educational resources in physics and astronomy (https://www.compadre.org/). (3) Evaluate the effectiveness of at least ten of the IVETs, and compare the effectiveness of IVETs at the two collaborating universities. (4) Disseminate the results of the research. The IVETs will be an innovative resource that can support introductory physics courses.  In addition, the research on students' interactions with the IVETs can increase understanding of instructional strategies that optimize students' use of online homework systems.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

These activities, called Interactive Video-Enhanced Tutorials (IVETs), combine videos of real instructors who guide students through an expert-like problem-solving process with a series of required multiple-choice questions that encourage students to interact with the material. When students choose a wrong answer, they are given feedback about why their answer is not correct, and they are sent back to the question to try again. When students choose a correct answer, they are provided with an explanation of the reasoning behind the answer choice before they are sent to the next page in the IVET. We also evaluated the IVETs for their impact on students' ability to transfer what was learned to a follow up problem. We compared the learning gains of students who used the IVETs to those who were shown a non-interactive video summary of the problem solution. This summary solution&nbsp; emphasized the same expert-like problem solving approaches found throughout the IVET. In this way, we were in part testing the interactive versus non-interactive nature of the two resources. Our findings indicated that students were more likely to engage in expert-like approaches to problem-solving when completing a follow up problem after receiving the IVET as their treatment. Given the popularity of the \"flipped\" or active learning classrooms, where students are often asked to watch non-interactive pre-lecture videos, such as Khan Academy, <strong>our research supports pedagogical methods that provide students with interactive web-based materials for improved learning in the home setting</strong>. In addition, we found IVET completion rates to be much higher than when students were given pre-lecture readings or non-interactive videos. Part of this may be due to points being assigned for completing the IVETs, but we believe that the value students placed on the IVETs for improving their learning also played a role. Students often commented on features of the IVETs that they felt impacted their learning, which included multiple choice questions that checked their understanding and helped build confidence, hints and feedback that guided their thinking, and a supportive narrator who motivated them to keep going even when they were struggling. We also found that students particularly valued the IVETs when they were assigned with related end-of-chapter homework problems. <strong>These \"lessons learned\" advance knowledge about best practices in the design and implementation of interactive online materials.</strong></p>\n<p class=\"TextBody\">All 30 IVETs can be freely downloaded by instructors for seamless integration into their courses with minimal effort. We expect this ease of adoption, along with our encouraging research outcomes, to expand the use of the IVETs in introductory physics courses across the country, promoting the learning of expert-like problem-solving approaches for a large number of students. In addition, the Vignette Studio II software, which was developed under this project to program the IVETs, can also be freely downloaded along with a video tutorial and text manual on how to use the software to create one's own IVETs. This is important given that the design of the IVETs&nbsp; can be used to support learning across disciplines, extending their impact beyond the physics classroom and supporting the success and retention of all students in STEM, regardless of race, first-generation college status, or gender. In addition, our research has identified multiple features of the IVETs that engage students and support their learning. One such feature is the use of affect-adaptive methods that help students reflect on their feelings while using an IVET and provide targeted support and encouragement for students who are struggling. These findings serve as a guide to future developers of web-based materials, particularly those interested in designing tools for active learning to be completed in the home setting. The lessons we learned regarding best practices for effective implementation of the IVETs also serve as a guide for instructors regarding how to integrate our IVETs or similar materials into their classrooms for <strong>broad</strong> <strong>participation</strong>.&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 01/28/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Kathleen&nbsp;Koenig</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImage\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation onePhoto\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1821396/1821396_10577375_1674934829932_thumbnail_Figure-1foroutcomesreport--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1821396/1821396_10577375_1674934829932_thumbnail_Figure-1foroutcomesreport--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Screenshot of typical IVET page\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1821396/1821396_10577375_1674934829932_thumbnail_Figure-1foroutcomesreport--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Screenshot of typical IVET page\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A typical question page in an IVET includes a video (but the student can choose a text description instead), a multiple-choice or multiple-select question, and options buttons.
