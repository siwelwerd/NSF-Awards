 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award, the Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Division of Chemistry and the Cellular and Biochemical Engineering Program in the Division of Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental and Transport Systems are funding Dr. Lionel Cheruzel from San Jose State University for his proposed work on merging chemical catalysis with light-activated enzymes. Selective functionalization of inert C-H bonds in small molecules is very challenging. The Cheruzel lab is using visible light in conjunction with suitable light-harvesting compounds to promote selective chemical and enzymatic functionalization of such bonds. This technology aims at expanding the toolbox of organic chemistry and meeting the demand for green and sustainable synthesis of fine chemicals. In addition to fostering undergraduate students' interests in light-driven processes, the PI is also bringing experiments related to protein engineering into high schools as part of the outreach program.\r\n\r\nThis research project focuses on the development of selective light-driven chemoenzymatic approaches by cobining the advantages of chemocatalysis with the unique selectivity of engineered hybrid cytochrome P450 biocatalysts. The chemoenzymatic approach targets multi-step selective C-H bond functionalizations and C-C bond formations towards the production of valuable sought-after synthons. Recent automation is facilitating the protein engineering of the next generation of light-driven biocatalysts. In addition, optimization of the photochemical processes involves instrument development to maximize the irradiation time, surface area and reaction yields. The proposed methodology paves the way for future efforts in chemoenzymatic reactions initiated by visible light irradiation. Special emphasis is placed on enhancing the scientific educational experience of undergraduate and high school students in the San Jose area.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
