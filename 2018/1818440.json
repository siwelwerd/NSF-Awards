This project at the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff provides a strategic approach to reform the introductory mathematics curriculum to increase student success. Undergraduate students are involved in this project as peer leaders and researchers.\r\n\r\nThe project seeks to develop faculty expertise in evidence-based instruction, specifically research and project-based learning, web-based learning, and peer-led team learning, and to infuse these strategies into introductory mathematics courses. It is envisioned that these  approaches will improve the retention and graduation rates of STEM majors at the university. The proposed activities are: to update the College Algebra curriculum incorporating evidence-based instructions methods and pilot two courses; to develop a co-requisite College Algebra curriculum and pilot a course; and to develop a peer-led team learning center. The project is guided by formative and summative evaluation.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
