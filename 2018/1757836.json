 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site on Accessible Information and Communication Technology (AICT) provides undergraduate participants with research experiences on projects that enhance accessibility of information and communication technologies, such as mobile phones or streaming videos for consumers who are deaf, hard of hearing, or deaf-blind (DHHDB). The participants will collaborate with DHHDB peers and mentors on a research project for 10 weeks. The diverse teams provide students with the experience and knowledge to recognize the range and complexity of accessibility challenges in accessing information and communication technology and to evaluate the efficacy of proposed solutions in a unique research environment. DHHDB students are extremely underrepresented in academics at the graduate level especially in STEM. The AICT REU site creates a critically needed pipeline of these students for graduate school and encourages them to participate in undergraduate and graduate programs in accessible information and communications technology.\r\n\r\nEach research project addresses unsolved accessibility challenges for deaf, hard of hearing or deaf-blind consumers in using existing information and communication technology that undergraduate researchers can easily understand, analyze and solve. The inclusion of undergraduate and faculty researchers who have aural disabilities increases accessibility and usability of information and communication technologies. The interactive and personal nature of the research projects provides a link between research and practice, and a diverse, inclusive and collaborative research experience for the participants. They will learn to create and disseminate their research outcomes through seminar training and participation in college and institutional conferences. The AICT REU Site website (http://accessiblemultimedia.com) provides additional information.",
