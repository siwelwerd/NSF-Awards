 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (or AMOC) is an important part of the global three-dimensional ocean circulation (global ocean conveyor belt) that includes the well-known, northward-flowing Gulf Stream current that redistributes heat and thereby affects climate. The AMOC is expected to weaken or even collapse in the coming centuries, with several recent studies suggesting that this weakening has already begun. The AMOC collapse would not only severely impact climate in the North Atlantic region but would also weaken the monsoon rains that a large portion of the global population depends on for their livelihood. Studying ice cores can shed light on past changes in the strength of the AMOC and can help scientists better understand the stability and behavior of this important ocean circulation system. Greenland ice cores and ocean sediment records show that during the last Ice Age (100,000 to 20,000 years ago) the AMOC repeatedly collapsed and restarted, resulting in a series of extreme climate oscillations commonly known as Dansgaard-Oeschger (D-O) cycles. Each D-O event consists of an abrupt (decadal-scale) warming episode (increase of 8-15 degrees Centigrade) observed in Greenland ice cores, leading to a few millennia of warmer climate followed by a gradual cooling back to full glacial conditions. The proposed research will develop temperature records from two Greenland ice cores to determine both the geographic distribution as well as the intensity of the D-O events throughout Greenland. These records will provide a spatial ?fingerprint? of the D-O events, which can be used a forensic tool to determine the location of D-O warming and the migration of the sea-ice edge around Greenland during these events. These data will be included in climate simulations using state-of-the-art global climate models to improve our understanding of the physical nature of these enigmatic events. The research will contribute to reliable timescales for the two ice cores, with benefits to the wider ice core community. The work will support an early-career scientist and a graduate student and will also provide outreach to public schools. \r\n\r\nUnderstanding the physical processes that drive the Earth?s climate system throughout a Dansgaard-Oeschger (D-O) event remains an important open scientific question in paleoclimate research. The spatial pattern of D-O warming holds clues to the origin of D-O events, in particular whether the critical geographic area is located in the Labrador Sea or in the GIN (Greenland, Iceland, Norwegian) seas. Ultra-high-resolution stable isotope records from these ice cores document changes in the hydrological cycle associated with these abrupt warming episodes. Climate models show that the southern Dye-3 ice core is more sensitive to abrupt climate change than previously analyzed ice cores, giving the possibility of observing for the first time the temperature imprint of a Heinrich event (a natural phenomenon in which large armadas of icebergs break off from glaciers and traverse the North Atlantic Ocean), as well as the largest D-O warmings ever observed. Isotope enabled climate model simulations will provide improved interpretation of changes in second-order isotope parameters (deuterium- and 17O excess) through D-O and Heinrich-events.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe primary motivation for our study was a desire to map (both geographical and magnitude of) abrupt warming episodes throughout Greenland over the last glacial/interglacial termination (between 10,000 years (10kyr) and 30 kyr).  Our hope was to use our results to test various model predictions so that we can be more confident in the models as they redirected to predicting future climate change associated with the current buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. \n\n \n\nWe utilized two cores, 1) the Dye 3 core which was drilled in 1979-81 by US-CREEL and our Danish colleagues and stored in Copenhagen for over 40 years, and 2) the new EGRIP ice core which is currently underway within the North East Greenland Ice Stream (NEGIS).  Our progress has been significantly impacted by COVID restrictions combined with drilling challenges in very hard ice.  The EGRIP core will hopefully be completed during the upcoming summer season (2023). \n\n \n\nThe Penn State contribution to this project was the generation of N2 isotope data (gas bubbles in core) which are tied to the magnitude of the abrupt temperature jump through isotope fractionation associated with thermal gradients in the snow above the bubble close off region.  Our results from the Dye 3 core showed the largest N2 isotope excursions of any Greenland Ice core covering the last glacial period.  This result suggests the largest temperature jumps are located in the southern most ice cores. \n\n \n\nThe EGRIP N2 isotope data were utilized in a preliminary fashion to compare EGRIP with the other deep Greenland cores.  Data and results are plotted in Figure 1 for the warming episodes associated with the Bolling/Allerod (14.7k) and the end of the Younger Dryas (11.6ka).  As you can see, the EGRIP results are in line with the other Summit cores (GISP 2 and GRIP) with the Bolling/Allerod transition showing a larger temperature jump than the warming associated with the end of the Younger Dryas (11.6k) and the general trend of larger temperature jumps in the southern cores.  Unfortunately, the Dye 3 archive for this portion of the record was not sufficient for gas analyses here at Penn State.    \n\n \n\nOur results are consistent with atmospheric modeling studies involving the initiation of the formation of north Atlantic deep water (NADW) production that brings warm temperate surface  waters to the N. Atlantic.  The fingerprint of warming in Greenland is more intense in the south due to closer proximity to the northward flowing surface waters.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/30/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Todd A Sowers"
