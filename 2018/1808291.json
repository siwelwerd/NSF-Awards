This meeting brings together world leaders in space plasma phenomena from South Korea, Japan, Europe and the USA and provides significant opportunity for students to participate in sessions. The meeting is largely focused on the variability of the space plasma environment and enables a collaborative, workshop-style environment for discussions. This is timely and relevant to the nation's space weather efforts. Understanding of the environment is important for understanding how space weather events evolve.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
