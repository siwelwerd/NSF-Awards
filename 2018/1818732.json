The project at Alabama A&M University seeks to improve undergraduate students' preparation and success towards a career in nuclear engineering or an advanced degree by focusing on active learning strategies. Undergraduate students are involved in the project as researchers. \r\n\r\nThis project has the objectives to: enhance student learning and technical skills by integrating active learning units into nuclear engineering courses; study the efficacy of the active learning model and units on nuclear engineering skill-set development; and improve retention and graduation rates in nuclear engineering programs, thus increasing the participation of women and underrepresented minorities in the nuclear engineering workforce. This project is guided by formative and summative evaluation.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
