 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Himalaya of Nepal is one of Earth's most rugged and rapidly eroding landscape, with local relief greater than 5,000 meters and a morphology dominated by deep fluvial incision. This regional pattern of relief is broken in western Nepal, where the Bhumichula plateau represents a approximately 250 square kilomter area of low-relief (200-400 meters), but high-elevation (4200-4800 meters) ground isolated amidst surrounding deeply incised topography resembling that of Tibet. This projects investigates how and when the Bhumichula plateau formed. Determining whether the Bhumichula plateau formed as a low-elevation surface that was later uplifted and incised, or whether it was high standing from its earlier stages and part of a larger Tibetan plateau and was later modified by surface processes, is significant for the understanding of the mechanisms forming high topography on Earth. High elevation features such as the Himalaya and Tibet are a product of tectonic processes over geological time, which are responsible today for the location and magnitude of earthquakes. The Himalayas and Tibet also play a significant role on climate by driving the Asian monsoon and thus control the distribution of fresh water on our planet. Important societal outcomes deriving from this project include training of graduate students  This project also supports the training of graduate and undergraduate students in an important science, technology, engineering and mathematics discipline (STEM), thereby contributing to the increased economic competitiveness of the United States. The project also contributes to the broadening of underrepresented groups in STEM, thereby promoting diversity in science.  and minorities, female research scientists, and promotes diversity in science. It also is supporting the development of an online virtual field trip experiences for general education and upper division classes.\r\n\r\nThis is a muldisciplinary invesgation that uses geological mapping, low-temperature thermochronology, cosmogenic nuclide dating, geomorphological analysis, stable isotope paleoaltimetry, and 40Ar/39Ar geochronology to determine the age of basement rocks, the timing of deformation, erosion/incision and uplift of the Bhumichula plateau in western Nepal. Although other low-relief, high-elevation surfaces have been identified in the Himalaya, none has been investigated with the complete array of methods to be employed in this work.  A principal goal of the project is to establish a workflow for how to analyze and interpret these low-relief surfaces in general, which are common features in the Himalaya to the east of Nepal. This study is the first attempt to apply such a wide array of techniques to unravel the history of landscape development in the India-Asia collisional environment, including the first attempt to determine paleoelevation on the southern slope of the Himalaya. Three main hypotheses will be tested: (1) BP formed as a low-elevation surface that was uplifted to high elevation and incised by antecedent and headward eroding rivers; (2) the BP is a remnant of a once much larger paleo-Tibetan landscape that reached nearly to the front of the Himalaya during the Miocene, and has been etched northward by headward erosion since that time; and (3) the BP formed in response to drainage reorganization and feedbacks between drainage area, erosion, and elevation.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The Himalaya today is remarkable for extreme local relief and topographic grandeur, but HELR surfaces scattered along the medial part of the range suggest the present situation may be a recent result of rapid fluvial incision that has actually reduced the size of the mountains over the last 10 million years (Ma).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Our strategy involved: (1) detailed geologic documentation of the HELR surface; (2) low-temperature thermochronology to constrain the exhumation history through the temperature range ~60-180 &deg;C; (3) cosmogenic nuclide dating to constrain the recent erosion history; and (4) deuterium isotope analysis of white micas in normal fault zones to reconstruct paleoelevations. Three hypotheses for the formation of the Bhumichula HELR surface were tested: (a) it formed at low elevation and was subsequently uplifted; (b) it formed while rising to high elevation and was incised by antecedent rivers on its flanks; (c) it formed at or while rising to high elevation and was incised by laterally migrating fluvial knickpoints or headward erosion.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Our data demonstrate the following: (1) Bhumichula Plateau is composed of amphibolite facies Greater Himalayan metamorphic rocks. The overall structure of the Plateau is synformal, and the HELR surface cuts the fabric of this synform, proving the surface formed after folding. The HELR surface must post-date significant regional tectonic shortening, which must have been isostatically compensated by development of high elevation, so we can say based on simple geological arguments that the HELR surface formed at high elevation, eliminating hypothesis (a).</p>\n<p>(2) Thermochronologic ages range between ca. 15 Ma and 5 Ma, decreasing with elevation and distance upstream in major rivers that are etching the flanks of the Bhumichula Plateau. Age vs. elevation/distance trends are inconsistent with antecedent erosion of a rising Bhumichula Plateau (hypothesis b), which would be expected to form a younging downward trend, rather than the observed younging upward/upstream trend. Hypothesis (c) is satisfied by the younging upward age trend. We interpret the Bhumichula HELR surface as the result of rapid post-Late Miocene (&lt; 8 Ma) exhumation by headward eroding fluvial valleys.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>(3) Cosmogenic nuclide analyses are not fully completed owing to Covid delays, but preliminary&nbsp;<sup>10</sup>Be and&nbsp;<sup>26</sup>Al data indicate very slow erosion over the past 20 Ka, extending the conclusion of slow HELR surface erosion to very recent times. Erosion rates range between 39 and 367 m/Myr.

The PoC locality is Laghoi Kangri, where Greater Himalayan rocks punch through surrounding Tethyan Himalayan rocks in the northern half of the Himalayan thrust belt. A low-angle extensional detachment fault was sampled along an elevation transect.&nbsp;Average muscovite&nbsp;dD<sub>musc</sub>&nbsp;(VSMOW) from the shear zone are between -193&permil; and -77&permil;.&nbsp;dD mica values fall into two categories, those from extensional shear zones with high water/rock ratios (&ldquo;water buffered&rdquo;, like Lhagoi Kangri) and those from contractional shear zones, such as Bhumichula, that are &ldquo;rock-buffered&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;systems. Water-buffered systems show the northern Himalaya rose to average elevations greater than today during the Middle-Late Miocene. Results from Bhumichula suggest most shear zones in the area did not experience much water-rock interaction, with four notable exceptions that display exceptionally low values&nbsp;dD for muscovite (&lt;-132&permil;).&nbsp;Reconstructed water&nbsp;d<sup>18</sup>O<sub>SMOW</sub>&nbsp;values are -14.5 to -16.1&permil; indicating that recharged deformation zones must have had 4-5 km elevation during the Middle Miocene.

Thus, Bhumichula Plateau is a remnant of more widespread high topography in the Lesser Himalaya. This in turn suggests large volumes of Himalayan rock have been excavated by rivers since Late Miocene time, causing the major topographic step to retreat northward from near the front of the Himalaya to its present location in northern Nepal.
