 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-technical Description\r\n\r\nThe New Hampshire Center for Multiscale Modeling and Manufacturing of Biomaterials (NH Bio-Made) promises to create new knowledge and drive technological innovation, and train workforce in the areas of biotechnology and advanced manufacturing. The project's activities are organized around an integrated design approach that connects computational modeling, advanced manufacturing, and measurement of materials properties, all oriented toward developing new materials for biomedical applications such as orthopedic bearings and tissue engineering scaffolds. The integrated approach is intended to encourage close collaboration across disciplines to drive biomaterials development. The project will also include major investments in New Hampshire's research capacity. NH Bio-Made will establish a shared Biomaterials Core Facility to provide access to state-of the-art instrumentation and cyberinfrastructure for researchers statewide, and will support the hiring of eleven new faculty researchers at institutions across the state. The project's research activities will be integrated with an ambitious workforce development agenda aimed at providing diverse students with the specific biomaterials and manufacturing skills needed to enable their career success. These efforts will emphasize training for students in high schools, community colleges, and at institutions of higher learning in NH and will be directed toward careers in the biotechnology sector.\r\n\r\nTechnical Description\r\n\r\nNH Bio-Made's goal is to advance the design and manufacture of hierarchical, heterogeneous biomaterials and enable the knowledge to predict and control their composition, structure, properties, and function. To accomplish this, the project will develop computational tools that span materials spatial scales from atomic to the macroscale. It will combine bottom-up self-assembly with top-down 3D printing to create biomaterials with designed structure at the nanoscale. These activities will employ a systems-level approach that drives hierarchical, heterogeneous biomaterial design for highly specific and verifiable functionalities. Research activities will be organized into four major thrusts, each working towards the development of specific categories of biomaterials: 1) composites for orthopedic bearings; 2) sheet metal for trauma fixation; 3) tissue engineering scaffolds; and 4) porous, conductive biosensors. These efforts will be supported by the Biomaterials Core Facility that will provide researchers across the state with shared access to high-performance computing infrastructure, advanced manufacturing equipment, and materials characterization instrumentation. The expectation is that the NH Bio-Made will advance understanding of new the design and manufacture of advanced materials while accelerating the state's competitiveness in the growing and important biotechnology industry. To ensure broad benefits from these research and infrastructure investments, the project will also provide training for students preparing to enter the biomaterials and advanced manufacturing workforce. These efforts will include both work-based learning opportunities for high school and community college students moving into the workforce and programs to facilitate the transition for students choosing to continue their education.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This research, supported by a Track-1 award from the National Science Foundation EPSCoR Research Infrastructure Improvement program (Award #1757371), was led by the University of New Hampshire in partnership with Dartmouth College and Keene State College.</p>\r\n<p>There were four research thrust areas: Composites for Orthopedic Bearings for Joint Implants, Sheet Metal Implants for Trauma Repair, Scaffolds for Tissue Regeneration, and Biocompatible Sensors for Use in the Human Body.Intellectual Merit and Sustainability: The four research thrusts of NH BioMade have made significant strides in advancing scientific knowledge about biomaterials. We authored 161 peer-reviewed publications, were awarded 7 patents (11 applications are pending), and gave 375 presentations on our research at scientific conferences and professional meetings. Forty-seven new proposals that leveraged NH BioMade research results were awarded, totaling $21.5 million. These new awards include four NSF CAREER awards, and two National Institutes of Health (NIH) R35 MIRA awards given to promising new investigators.NH BioMade research findings were instrumental in launching the new Center for Industrial Metal Forming (CIMF) at the University of New Hampshire, with funding from the NSF Industry/University Cooperative Research (IUCRC) program. CIMF is a partnership between UNH, Ohio State University, and Oakland University and will carry out cutting-edge, fundamental research in metal forming science and engineering, essential to competitiveness in the automotive, aerospace, defense, electronics, appliances, and biomedical industries.</p>\r\n<p>The goal of our research seed grant program was to facilitate high-risk, high-impact, and transformative research in focal areas aligned with NH BioMade. Thirty-four seed grants were made totaling $2.0 million, resulting in 25 peer-reviewed research publications, 2 patent applications, and a $599,138 award from the National Institutes of Health to advance the development of an injectable hydrogel to accelerate wound healing, and an NIH R15 grant for $460,050 resulting from a NH BioMade industry-university collaboration seed grant.NH BioMade researchers established 75 new collaborations with scientists at external institutions, resulting in 53 publications in scientific journals and 18 proposal submissions. Researchers developed sustained, multi-year collaborations with scientists at the Institute for Metal Forming and Lightweight Components (IUL) at TU Dortmund (Germany), Los Alamos National Laboratory, DEVCOM Army Research Laboratory, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, and the California Institute of Technology.</p>\r\n<p>Broader Impacts: NH BioMade hired 13 new faculty members at UNH, Dartmouth, and Keene State College; nine are early career faculty. All but one remain at their respective universities in New Hampshire. These faculty members have published extensively in academic journals, submitted new patent applications, mentored NH BioMade students and postdoctoral research associates, and have been awarded new funding to continue their biomaterials research.</p>\r\n<p>NH BioMade also made significant inroads in preparing a new generation of female engineers and chemists. Thirty-two percent of faculty were women, as were 25% of postdoctoral research associates, 40% of graduate students, and 60% of undergraduate students.Collectively, NH BioMade provided research opportunities to 205 students and post-docs, who are now employed at engineering firms, in bioscience and chemical industries, as faculty members at high schools and universities, or are pursuing their advanced degrees. Two students received Fulbright scholarships to further their education, and three students received awards through NSF's Graduate Research Fellowship Program. Another graduate student launched her own company, NovaGyn LLC, to focus on better biomaterials for pelvic reconstruction surgery and has received an initial $292,752 from NIH.</p>\r\n<p>NH BioMade had an education seed grant program, which made 16 grants totaling $247,011, supporting the development of new curriculum and training. The summer Undergraduate Research Training program supported research opportunities for 79 students in labs at UNH, Dartmouth, and Keene State College. The NH BioMade Transfer Scholar program provided financial scholarships and academic support to 24 community college students, enabling them to transfer to a 4-year institution and pursue their bachelor's degree in STEM fields.</p>\r\n<p>The final networking event organized by NH BioMade was a national symposium on bioinnovations for biosensors, tissue engineering, and orthopedic implants, with a cross-cutting focus on computational sciences, and an emphasis on developing new research connections and collaborations. The event brought together 150 academic and industry scientists and educators to hear from 60 featured speakers and was done in partnership with the Advanced Regenerative Manufacturing Institute (ARMI) and NH Life Sciences Association. Attendees indicated they connected with colleagues to advance their work, forged new collaborations, and learned of new approaches and technologies not directly related to their area of expertise.
