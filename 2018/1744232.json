 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will fund the participation of US-based researchers in the third US-Mexico Conference on Representation Theory, Categorification, and Non-Commutative Algebra that will take place at Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico in Mexico City, November 27-December 1, 2017. Representation theory is a major branch of mathematics that studies symmetries of physical theories and of mathematical objects. Often the main objects in representation theory are only the shadow of richer structures that are recovered through deeper study. Non-commutative algebra is another major, related branch of algebra that studies deformations of commutative objects found in quantum theories, representation theory, and geometry. The foci of the conference will be on recent advances at the interface of representation theory and non-commutative algebra; on fostering an environment for the establishment of international collaborations between the US and Mexico in this research areas; and on exposing graduate students, post-docs, and young faculty in both countries to current developments in the field.\r\n\r\nThe PIs have been organizing one week-long conference in this US-Mexico series each academic year since January 2015. These conferences alternate between the US and Mexico. The main scientific topics for the 3rd conference will be algebraic, geometric and homological methods in representation theory, categorification, and representations and ideal structure of non-commutative algebras. The talks will cover some of the most recent trends including: cluster algebras, quantum symmetries, monoidal and additive categorifications, Calabi-Yau algebras and categories, and non-commutative projective algebraic geometry.
