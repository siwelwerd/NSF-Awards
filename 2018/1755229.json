 "awd_abstract_narration": "Studies of long-lived social mammals such as primates, elephants and dolphins repeatedly show that individual social behavior is linked to survival and reproduction. Yet, few have examined what factors contribute to individual variation in social behavior within a species or population. For instance, it has yet be to determined why some individuals are more gregarious than others. In mammals, it is known that mothers have a pervasive influence on offspring behavioral development, not just through genetic inheritance, but also through social learning (maternal effects). Here, the research team will focus on how maternal effects influence offspring social development, a key contributor to individual variation in social behavior. Dolphins in Shark Bay, Australia, are an excellent empirical system for examining these questions because they live in a large open and dynamic social community with over one hundred potential associates to choose from. Long-term data on this social system spans 35+ years and enables this team of scientists to quantify: 1). how a dolphin changes its social behavior in space and time throughout its development, 2). the extent to which this is influenced by maternal and non-maternal effects, and 3). the extent to which maternal effects provide fitness benefits to offspring. This study will have broad reach, appeal, and implications well beyond the scientific community because it will contribute to wildlife policy, management, and conservation as well as train multiple undergraduate and graduate students and early-career stage researchers in STEM. \r\n\r\n\r\nWhile several studies link sociality to fitness in long-lived mammals, maternal influence on inter- and intra-individual variation in sociality (e.g. dynamic social patterns) and fitness outcomes is relatively unexplored. This study investigates how sociality evolved, not just why. Recent computational advances allow this project to incorporate multi-level, dynamic variation to advance understanding of how sociality evolved, i.e., transmission pathways. This study system, a 35-year longitudinal study of wild bottlenose dolphins, provides a unique opportunity to address these questions because of species characteristics, and the size, detail, and long-term nature of the dataset. This project will use: 1). novel quantitative genetics methodologies to unravel the importance of maternal effects on social behavior while accounting for both additive genetic variation and the mothers' social environment; 2). next-generation sequencing combined with demographic data to construct accurate pedigree information from high- density single nucleotide polymorphisms; 3). dynamic social network modeling (social association/interaction matrices) to account for changing social attributes of individuals rather than just static traits. As such, this study will be a comprehensive exploration of how maternal effects impact social traits over the lifespan and across more than one generation within an evolutionary framework. In addition, this is the first study to do so in wild long-lived mammal with extensive maternal social transmission, while accounting for additive genetic variation. The results will provide significant advances by extending our study of the genetic and non-genetic mechanisms of inheritance, which play critical roles in evolution and responses to environmental change.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The current study capitalized on 35 years of demographic, behavioral, ecological and genetic data on wild bottlenose dolphins in Shark Bay, Australia (a UNESCO World Heritage Site), to examine maternal effects, the non-genetic impact of a mother on her offspring, which includes maternal care, but can be also be physiological influences, and social and ecological behavior. While most studies of maternal effects have been in laboratory settings, we showed the long-lasting impact of maternal effects in a wild population. Specifically, the social and ecological behavior of offspring was better explained by what calves learned from their mothers during the long period of dependency (averaging 4 years), than genetic effects.&nbsp; Furthermore, many offspring traits were repeatable on a decadal scale, particularly for daughters who tended to emulate maternal strategies. For some highly specialized foraging tactics that a small minority of the population uses, such as tool-use with marine sponges, fidelity from mother to daughter was nearly 100%. This is striking given that dolphins interact with hundreds of associates and do not have stable groups. They are thus exposed to a diversity of behaviors and strategies throughout their lives. However, individual differences between females, and maternal style, are not linked to calving success (the number of calves surviving to age 3). We did find that male mating success is strongly predicted by age. The probability of fathering an offspring increases with age, especially when males reach middle-age (about 20+ years). As their survival is linked to their social position and close male associates, social skills that develop early in life through the mother are &nbsp;important. We also examined the sex- and age-specific patterns of mortality, demonstrating that while both sexes had equal chances of survival while still dependent on their mothers, sons were at greater mortality risk post-weaning, during the juvenile period, likely due to male-male competition. However, in early adulthood, females were now at higher mortality risk, likely due to the costs of reproduction, including male harassment and sexual coercion. By mid-adulthood, mortality risk was low for both sexes; some individuals lived into their early 50s.</span></p>\n<p class=\"Default\"><span>Although interrupted by the pandemic, we conducted four field seasons in Shark Bay, Australia and published 20 peer-reviewed journal articles, 5 peer-reviewed book chapters, 3 invited articles and presented 42 conference papers.
