 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project focuses on a group of microscopic single-celled photosynthetic organisms in the ocean called diatoms. Diatoms float in the surface ocean as part of a group of organisms collectively called phytoplankton. There are thousands of different species of diatoms distributed across the global ocean.  A famous oceanographer Henry Bigelow once said \"All fish is diatoms\" reflecting the importance of diatoms as the base of the food chain that supports the world's largest fisheries. Despite their small size, diatom photosynthesis produces 20% of the oxygen on earth each year. That's more than all of the tropical rain forests on land. The major objective of the research is to understand how the metabolic differences among diatom species affects the amount of diatom organic carbon that is carried, or exported, from the surface ocean to the deep ocean. As diatoms are photo-synthesizers like green plants, their biological carbon comes from converting carbon dioxide dissolved in seawater from the atmosphere into organic forms.  Diatoms also require a series of other nurtrients supplied by the ocean such as nitrogen and phosphorous and, uniquely for diatoms, the silicon used to construct their glass shells.  This research will investigate how genetic and physiological differences among diatoms influence how each species react to changes in nutrient levels in the ocean and how those shifts affect the export of diatom carbon to the deep sea. The link between diatoms' physiological response and their carbon export comes about because shifts in physiology affect diatom attributes like how fast they sink and how tasty they are to predators. So if we can relate the physiological condition of different diatoms to the food-web pathways followed by different species, we can ultimately use knowledge of diatom physiological status and food web structure to predict how much diatom carbon gets to the deep sea. The research involves investigators with expertise in the physiology and genomics of diatoms and in the ocean's chemistry. The work will initially take place in the subarctic North Pacific in conjunction with the NASA Export Processes in the Ocean from RemoTe Sensing (EXPORTS) field program. The EXPORTS program is using a wide variety of methods to quantify the export and fate of photo-synthetically fixed carbon in the upper ocean. The research supports the training of undergraduate students, graduate students and a postdoctoral scholar. The research will also serve as the basis for activities aimed at K-12 and junior high school students. \r\n\r\nThe research will broadly impact our understanding of the biology of the biological pump (the transport of photo-synthetically fixed organic carbon to the deep sea) by forming a mechanistic basis for predicting the export of diatom carbon. It is hypothesized that the type and degree of diatom physiological stress are vital aspects of ecosystem state that drive export. To test this hypothesis, the genetic composition, rates of nutrient use and growth response of diatom communities will be evaluated and supported with measurements of silicon and iron stress to evaluate stress as a predictor of the path of diatom carbon export. The subarctic N. Pacific ecosystem is characterized as high nutrient low chlorophyll (HNLC) due to low iron (Fe) levels that are primary controllers constraining phytoplankton utilization of other nutrients. It has been a paradigm in low Fe, HNLC systems that diatoms grow at elevated Si:C and Si:N ratios and should be efficiently exported as particles significantly enriched in Si relative to C. However, Fe limitation also alters diatoms species composition and the high Si demand imposed by low Fe can drive HNLC regions to Si limitation or Si/Fe co-limitation. Thus, the degree of Si and/or Fe stress in HNLC waters can all alter diatom taxonomic composition, the elemental composition of diatom cells, and the path cells follow through the food web ultimately altering diatom carbon export.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
