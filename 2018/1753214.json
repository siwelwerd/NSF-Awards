 "awd_abstract_narration": "This CAREER grant will study the upper atmosphere and magnetosphere-ionosphere-thermosphere (MIT) coupling at high latitudes. The polar upper atmosphere is a complex region driven by wave disturbances generated in the lower atmosphere and by the energy fed through the magnetosphere. The research work will advance our understanding of the variability of the polar upper atmosphere region by novel applications of lidar and radar observations, and computational models. This CAREER grant will integrate research and education by developing a new curriculum in atmospheric modeling, giving students an early exposure to current research topics in atmospheric research and high-performance computing. The grant will also support integration of research and education to develop a knowledgeable STEM workforce. The outreach activities will actively pursue efforts to broaden participation amongst members of underrepresented groups and develop a diverse scientific workforce that is reflective of our society. \r\n\r\nThe overall goal of this CAREER grant is to study atmospheric wave dynamics and magnetosphere-ionosphere-thermosphere (MIT) coupling in the polar regions using observations and computational models.  The research will investigate the following key aspects of the polar aeronomy:    \r\n1) the dynamics, coupling, and interactions of polar atmospheric waves; \r\n2) the localized magnetospheric energy deposition and MIT coupling at high latitudes; and \r\n3) the interactions and comparative contributions of the lower atmosphere wave forcing and magnetospheric forcing to the variability of geospace.\r\n\r\nResults from this research will advance our understanding of the role wave-wave and wave-mean interactions, intra-hemispheric coupling, and inter-hemispheric asymmetries on the polar upper atmosphere. The research will also lead to improvement in computational models used to upper atmospheric research.\r\n\r\nThe research also includes a major educational development component. The educational activities will: \r\n1) develop a new curriculum for atmospheric modeling and create an inventory of numerical programs that will be used for both education and research, and develop and publicize an education website to host this inventory for highly interactive model runs and learning; \r\n2) mentor graduate and undergraduate students with interdisciplinary knowledge and solid skills, and provide research opportunities for underrepresented students via the Call Me Mister program; and\r\n3) involve high school students and K-12 teachers from South Carolina rural communities in atmospheric science education via Clemson's Emerging Scholar and outreach programs.\r\n\r\nThis career grant will provide education and training opportunities for the next generation of STEM workforce and implement activities for broadening participation and the development of a diverse scientific workforce.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
