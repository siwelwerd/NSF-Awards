The efficiency of organic solar cells may be enhanced significantly by harnessing singlet fission (SF), a quantum mechanical process that can lead to the generation of two conducting species, for example electrons, from one quantum of light. Presently, few materials are known to exhibit intermolecular SF in the solid state, and they belong to restricted chemical families. The vast number of possible molecules and crystals that could be made has not been explored for SF. The PIs will use computer simulations to search the many possibilities for new SF materials. To this end, a new approach will be developed, one that integrates cutting-edge advances in quantum mechanical simulations and machine learning. This research will advance both fields of materials science and data science. Graduate and undergraduate students will train in a collaborative cross-disciplinary environment at the interface of computational materials science and data science and acquire transferrable job skills in high demand. \r\n\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\nThis award supports continued collaboration of materials researchers with data scientists kindled at the MATDAT18 Datathon event. Singlet fission (SF) is the conversion of one photogenerated singlet exciton into two triplet excitons. Recently, there has been a surge of interest in SF thanks to its potential to significantly increase the efficiency of organic solar cells by harvesting two charge carriers from one photon. However, few materials are presently known to exhibit intermolecular SF with high efficiency, hindering the realization of solid-state SF-based solar cells. The chemical compound space of possible chromophores is infinitely vast and largely unexplored. To enable computational discovery of SF materials, a new multi-fidelity screening approach will be developed, which integrates quantum mechanical simulations at different levels of fidelity with machine learning (ML) and database mining. ML algorithms will be used to analyze data generated by quantum mechanical simulations and to steer simulations for further data acquisition. High-cost high-fidelity evaluations of excited state properties of solid-state forms of candidate chromophores will be performed with many-body perturbation theory methods within the GW approximation and the Bethe-Salpeter equation. Lower-cost lower-fidelity evaluations of ground state features will be performed with density functional theory. Feature selection algorithms will then determine which descriptors are most predictive of the thermodynamic driving force for SF. These descriptors will be used to screen databases that contain crystal structures with no information or only partial information on their electronic properties. Optimization algorithms will be employed to decide which data points to sample and at what level of fidelity to maximize information gain. This research will advance the discovery of new intermolecular SF chromophores and will lead to advances in data science in the area of experimental design.  \r\n\r\nThe award is jointly funded through the Division of Materials Research and the Division of Mathematical Sciences in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The objective of this portion of the project is to advance statistical methodology to support materials science research on singlet fission materials. A key task in the emerging field of materials informatics is to use machine learning to predict a material's properties and functions.  A fast and accurate predictive model allows researchers to more efficiently identify or construct a material with desirable properties.  In this project we have made important methodological contributions to this field.\n\nIntellectual merit: The project split into two sub-projects.  In the first subproject, we develop a procedure to determine the most important structural features of a material to predict its function. Unlike standard procedures that provide a single solution or a set of similar solutions, the proposed method aims to capture the diversity of possible solutions to give the researcher multiple potential explanations of the underlying science and thus multiple avenues for future research. The second subproject combines multiple data sources to improve prediction of a material\u2019s function via transfer learning. In this analysis, we use deep learning for prediction and incorporate an auxiliary data analysis via the prior distribution in a Bayesian analysis. We find that that proposed method is superior to state-of-the-art machine learning methods for predicting a material\u2019s band gap, an important indicator for a single fission material.  In both subprojects, we thoroughly study the methods using simulations, apply them to materials science case studies and make code available in the public domain.   \n\nBroader impacts: The ramifications of this project will be felt beyond materials science and statistics.  Variable selection is a fundamental data science procedure and thus the methods developed in this project can be applied across all areas of science including biological and epidemiological applications.  Similarly, deep learning is a leading method of artificial intelligence/machine learning and is applied to a wide variety of tasks including computer vision, natural language processing and protein folding.  The proposed methods to combine multiple sources of data in the deep learning framework could help train deep leaning models more quickly from smaller datasets.  Finally, the project trained three graduate students, including one female and one African American, in interdisciplinary and computational work which is an important contribution to our workforce. \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/27/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Brian J Reich"
