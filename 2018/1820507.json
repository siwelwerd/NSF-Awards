 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to accelerate the most common computations in processing Big Data and performing real-time analyses on data streaming-in to enterprise data centers. For the same total cost, the technology advanced by the proposed project is expected to increase performance by a factor of 12. As part of this improvement, it is expected to reduce the energy per instruction by a factor of 25 times or greater. This frees businesses to apply more advanced analytics techniques and react more quickly to changing business conditions.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the ever-growing need to process more data, but on a fixed budget. The objective is to provide accelerator technology for an increasingly critical set of applications that are currently underserved by generic CPU technology. The project aims eventually to deliver a PCIe accelerator card populated by silicon chips based on a new type of accelerator micro-architecture.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
