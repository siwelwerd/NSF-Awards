 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nearly every large galaxy seems to host a supermassive black hole. The mass of the black hole is related to several properties of the host galaxy. However, for lower mass galaxies, these relationships are not as strong as they are for the more massive galaxies. This project will simulate the growth of both low mass galaxies and their black holes simultaneously over the age of the universe to better understand the physical reasons for the relationship between the massive black hole and the properties of the low mass galaxy that hosts it. This project will also involve undergraduate students at a community college.\r\n\r\nThe proposed project intends to model the growth of supermassive black holes (SMBH) in dwarf galaxies in a systematic way to identify the physical origins of the SMBH/galaxy correlations. The project will use their code CHANGA that was used in the ROMULUS25 cosmological simulations. The team will extract individual dwarf galaxies of interest from this simulation and do \"zoom-in\" simulations of the galaxy evolution. They will use a technique call \"genetic modification\" that will allow for systematic small variations in the initial conditions of the targeted galaxy without dramatically changing the local cosmological environment. When completed the project will identify the key physical processes that lead to the SMBH/galaxy correlations for dwarf galaxies. The project will also support and mentor first-generation undergraduates in research at both institutions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellecutal Merit:\nThe primary goal of this project was to examine simulations of dwarf galaxies hosting massive black holes, determine evolutionary characteristics that might differentiate them from galaxies without black holes, and aid observers in discovering and characterizing more dwarf galaxies with black holes.\n\nWe discovered that approximately half of the massive black holes in dwarf galaxies are off-center, due to galaxy-galaxy mergers (Bellovary et al 2021).  This prediction directly preceeded the discovery of off-center black hole candidates in dwarfs by Reines et al (2020).\n\nBoth off-center and central black holes in dwarfs have low accretion rates and are difficult to detect with conventional telescopes.  However, merging massive black holes will create gravitational waves which can be detected by the upcoming Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) instrument.  We predict that dwarf galaxies can indeed host black hole mergers and could be an important contributor to the overall LISA signal (Bellovary et al 2019).  In an upcoming paper we analytically analyze black hole pairings from the simulations and determine indeed that they do often merge within observable timescales (de Cun et al, in prep).\n\nOverall, the gas and stellar properties of dwarf galaxies with and without black holes do not differ (Bellovary et al 2019).  To examine this further, we also simulated a wandering black hole in a dwarf galaxy with extremely high resolution, to determine whether the gravitational force due to the wandering black hole will have an effect on the stars' dynamics.  Unfortunately this indirect detection method did not yield a measurable result (Bellovary et al 2021).\n\nOverall the impact of this project is to highlight that black holes in dwarf galaxies may not exist in galaxy centers, but may wander around the inner few kiloparsecs.  They are difficult to detect, and thus it is possible that there are far more hidden black holes lurking undetected in dwarfs.  The upcoming LISA instrument will put constraints on the overall black hole population by measuring signals from mergers such as those we have predicted in our work.\n\n\nBroader Impacts:\nFour REU students from underrepresented backgrounds were involved in this project.  These students learned computer programming in python, data visualization, and presentation and writing skills.  They also participated in professional development seminars and trainings hosted by the REU programs at the American Museum of Natural History and Queensborough Community College.  Three of the four students attended community college at the time of the internship.  Two of the four are now applying to graduate school in astronomy, while the other two are majoring in engineering fields.  Three of the four students are authors on the publication Bellovary et al (2021), and the fourth is authoring her own first-author paper to be submitted within the next month.  This project has surely served to build a diverse scientific workforce.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/09/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jillian M Bellovary"
