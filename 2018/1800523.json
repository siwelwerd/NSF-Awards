 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanism (CSDM-A) program of the Chemistry Division. Professor David Jonas of the University of Colorado at Boulder is developing femtosecond laser techniques to study the motion of electrons in molecules. A femtosecond is a millionth of a billionth of a second. Inside molecules, atoms and slow electrons move on the femtosecond timescale. The goal of the project is to measure how atomic and electronic motions are linked when the forces driving their motion are weak. Such weak forces can arise from energies on the order of the thermal energy. This project explores the smallest energy required to drive motion of electrons. Similar electronic motions are involved in lighting, displays, and photosynthesis. Three dimensional spectra correlate electronic and atomic motion. High symmetry molecules simplify the study of electronic and atomic motions.\r\n\r\nIn 3D Fourier transform spectroscopy, four-wave mixing is used to record transient signals as a function of three time delays between pulses. Triple Fourier transformation with respect to the three time delays generates a spectrum that is a function of three frequency axes. Unlike most 2D spectra, the pulse spectra and pulse propagation effects can be divided out in 3D. This reveals the underlying 3D nonlinear response, which should be independent of experimental conditions. The signal from cross-phase modulation in transparent solvents produces compact time-domain transients for initial experimental recovery of the underlying 3D response. 2D and 3D electronic spectroscopy of high symmetry molecules with pseudo Jahn-Teller effects can reveal the mechanism of their femtosecond electronic population transfer through comparison to quantum mechanical calculations. The calculations fully incorporate non-adiabatic interactions between motion of electrons and the vibrational motion of atoms. The broader impacts of this project include training of students in modern experimental and computational techniques plus potential societal benefits from a better understanding of the minimum energy required to drive electronic motion.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIn this project, we have shown how to use spectroscopy to measure thermodynamic free energies for the excited states of disordered materials.  Previously, spectroscopic measurements of free energy had been possible only for perfectly ordered materials such as single crystals.  The measurement relies on a single-molecule relationship between absorption and emission spectra.  Light is composed of photons and each photon has an energy that can be determined from its wavelength or frequency.  Light sources are characterized by a spectrum that measures the number of photons as a function of the photon energy - these spectra determine the color of the light.  Molecules have spectra that measure their rate of absorbing and emitting photons in each frequency interval - these molecular spectra determine the molecule's color under white light.  The frequencies that are absorbed and emitted in molecular spectra measure energy differences between the molecule's quantum states. However, allowed molecular reactions are determined by differences in thermodynamic free energy, which depends on both molecular energy and molecular entropy.  Entropy is a measure of disorder.  In disordered materials, even if each molecule has absorption and emission spectra that obey the single-molecule relationship which determines the change in free energy between the ground and excited state, the relationship will not be obeyed when the spectra of different molecules in the sample are added together.  For example, small nanocrystals known as quantum dots have spectra that depend on their size and quantum dot spectra are broadened by the distribution of quantum dot sizes.  In this project, we used two-dimensional spectra that correlate absorption and emission to show that the single-molecule relationship is obeyed by quantum dots of the same size and to determine their change in free energy upon electronic excitation.  This measurement also revealed that, under appropriate conditions, the shift in photon energy between absorption and emission is unaffected by the size distribution and reflects the single-molecule linewidth.  The single-molecule relationship provides a rapid way to measure the size distribution of quantum dots and to determine whether the molecule in a sample is present in more than one molecular form.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/30/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: David M Jonas"
