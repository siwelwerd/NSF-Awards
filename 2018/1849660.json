 "awd_abstract_narration": "This travel award supports student participation at the 4th International Workshop on Software Analytics (SWAN 2018) happening in Florida, USA on November 5, 2018. The funds seek to encourage US-based students to attend, with priority given to underrepresented groups, US citizens/residents, and those otherwise unable to attend without financial support. The area of software analytics as the basis for empirical research in software engineering leads to a scientific understanding of phenomena surrounding software and its development. The area is emerging and will be boosted by increasing student participation in this start-up workshop series. The workshop is a forum for presentation of work in this field, and as such, it will help expand research and strengthen US participation in the field.\r\n\r\nThe technical scope of the workshop covers data-driven approaches for data exploration and analysis; predictive analytics for software; web analytics, development analytics; business intelligence tools; large-scale data mining, analysis and analytics for software projects; software analytics for various stakeholders (e.g., managers vs. developers); empirical studies on how software analytics are used in practice and their  effectiveness.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
