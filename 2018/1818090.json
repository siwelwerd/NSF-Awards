 "awd_abstract_narration": "The overall goal of this project is to determine the mechanism for how proteins interact with nanoparticle surfaces. Protein-surface interactions are a significant consideration in many scientific fields, from engineering protein-functionalized nanoparticles (NPs) to preventing the attachment of marine organisms to ship hulls. Understanding the mechanism of interaction may lead to better strategies for controlling protein-surface interactions. The project will focus specifically on gold nanoparticles. A better understanding of protein-gold nanoparticle interactions could lead to more sensitive ways to detect molecules in the environment. The project is expected to produce two important results. First, it will lead to better predictive models for understanding why proteins interact with gold nanoparticles. Second, it will reveal the structural characteristics of proteins once they bind. In addition, the project supports a summer training camp for undergraduate researchers in the southeast. This program, called Biochemistry Boot Camp, trains students how to use computational tools for interpreting protein structure and function. These tools are used not only in this research project, but many others as well.\r\n\r\nThis project aims to study the forces involved in protein adsorption using novel NMR-based approaches for monitoring protein interactions with gold nanoparticles. Nanoparticles are useful for studying protein-surface interactions because of their extremely high surface to volume ratio. This project will characterize the biophysical forces involved in multiple protein adsorption to gold nanoparticle surfaces, using novel approaches to monitor adsorption in real time. Specifically, it will identify the structural properties that control adsorption kinetics and thermodynamics to gold nanoparticles. The project will also investigate the structure of several small model proteins after they have attached to the gold nanoparticle surface. Thus, this work addresses one of the key challenges in the field of nanotechnology while laying the groundwork for new investigations into generalized protein-surface interactions. In addition, the project is expected to result in new NMR-based tools for studying proteins on other types of surfaces. \r\n\r\nThis award is jointly funded by the Molecular Biophysics Cluster of the Division of Cellular and Molecular Biosciences and the OIA/EPSCoR.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
