 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project focuses on understanding the exchange of trace gases across the ice-sea-air interface during a large, collaborative field effort in the Arctic Ocean. Investigators will collect data over an entire year and with collaborators, reduce uncertainty in regional and global climate models. They will measure carbon dioxide, methane, dimethylsufide, and ozone from the bow of an icebreaking research vessel and from towers and portable instruments at field camps established on sea ice. The study is an integral part of the year-long Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate (MOSAiC) that will take place 2019-2020, bringing together an international team of scientists to understand the causes and consequences of recent and predicted changes in sea ice. The investigators plan a variety of outreach and educational efforts to spark interest and build knowledge in science educators and students about the Arctic and its climate system, and this study will provide education and training opportunities for a postdoctoral scientist and undergraduates.\r\n\r\nThis study will improve understanding of processes controlling exchange of climate-active gases between sea ice and atmosphere in the Arctic. The investigators will participate in a year-long, international field campaign in the high Arctic, Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate (MOSAiC). They will conduct continuous turbulent flux measurements using the eddy correlation method from a tower on the bow of the German icebreaker Polarstern and from a tower situated on a nearby ice camp. These will account for gas transfer over large, km-scale areas of ice and open water leads. The investigators will also collect measurements of direct gas emission and deposition over smaller areas of ice and snow and a range of surface types using portable dynamic flux chambers. In collaboration with members of the Biogeochemical Exchange Processes at Sea-Ice Interfaces working group (BEPSII), observations of direct gas transfer will inform and validate biogeochemical models of trace gas dynamics in sea ice. In addition, a physical parameterization of air/sea gas transfer will be developed as an extension of the Coupled Ocean-Atmosphere Response Experiment gas transfer (COAREG) model, enabling regional estimates of net gas transfer in the sea ice environment. Finally, results will be used to develop and evaluate of ocean-sea ice-boundary layer exchange of climate-active trace gases in both 1-D and meso-scale (Polar Weather Research and Forecasting) atmospheric chemistry-meteorological modelling systems.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This project contributes to understanding the complexity of processes that drive this amplified rate of change and the consequences this has on the Arctic environment in the future. Over almost a full year, we investigated the exchange of carbon dioxide, methane, ozone and dimethyl sulfide (DMS) between the atmosphere and ocean in the remote, sea-ice dominated, central Arctic Ocean.

In a collaborative project between partners at Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences and the University of Colorado at Boulder, we measured the air-sea exchange rates of the four gases at two complementary scales. Eddy-covariance systems situated on the sea-ice and on the bow of the ship monitored gas concentrations and directly quantified air-sea fluxes throughout the year over the ~4 km<sup>2</sup> of the sea-ice floe. To complement these broader-scale flux measurements, the gas exchange rates over a much smaller surface area of less than 1m<sup>2</sup>, were measured using a dynamic flux chamber system. Sea-ice is a highly heterogenous and dynamic environment, comprising a mixture of ice and snow, melt ponds and open-sea surfaces that change sometimes rapidly but also seasonally. The dynamic flux chamber measurements solved two purposes: they aimed to explain how seasonal changes in surface composition influenced the kilometer-scale eddy-covariance flux estimates; and they aimed to link the gas exchange rates to the physical, chemical and biological processes in the underlying ice and water.</p>\n<p>The dynamic chamber system was a bespoke design and construction for MOSAiC, specifically built to quantify the anticipated low gas exchange rates, particularly during the Arctic winter (Image 1). Chamber measurements of carbon dioxide and methane were carried out on all five legs of the expedition, from November 2019 to October 2020, amounting to over 300 site-specific measurements. Technical difficulties prevented chamber measurements of ozone to support the year-round eddy-covariance record, something we knew would be challenging. While instrument failure meant we were able to measure eddy covariance and surface-specific DMS fluxes only through summer, on legs 4 and 5.
