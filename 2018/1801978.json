 "awd_abstract_narration": "Emily Martin is awarded an NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics Postdoctoral Fellowship to conduct a program of research and education at the University of California, Santa Cruz.  Using high resolution near-infrared spectra, Martin will measure the abundances of molecules in the atmospheres of brown dwarfs --- objects that are intermediate between low-mass stars and giant planets.  She will also design a new precision radial velocity spectrograph that will be useful in the search for Earth-like planets around nearby stars.  Alongside this research, Martin will conduct a summer workshop to help incoming freshmen succeed in physics classes and encourage them to pursue physics degrees.\r\n \r\nThe proposed scientific program takes a two-pronged approach to advance the understanding of brown dwarf atmospheres.  First, Martin will conduct spectroscopic observations of brown dwarf atmospheres and connect these observations to advanced imaging observations and atmospheric models.  Second, she will lead the development of a conceptual design for a new, high-resolution near-infrared spectrograph for Lick Observatory.  The new spectrograph will have a resolving power of nearly 100,000 at H and K bands (1.5-2.4 microns) and will be capable of working with any telescope with an adaptive optics system.  For the education component of her work, Martin will develop a summer workshop for incoming students, in which she will use inquiry-based activities to engage the students, introduce them to local physicists working in a variety of careers, and connect them to peer mentors within the physics department.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
