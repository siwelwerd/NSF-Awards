 "awd_abstract_narration": "Policymakers, professional organizations, and educational researchers have cited the importance of widespread adoption of inquiry-oriented, student-centered instruction across all levels of undergraduate mathematics. The Mathematical Inquiry Project (MIP) at Oklahoma State University aims to achieve that goal by fostering a statewide collaboration among mathematics departments at the 27 public institutions of higher education in Oklahoma.  The MIP focuses on increasing the use of three elements of mathematical inquiry: active learning techniques, incorporation of meaningful applications of mathematics, and development of academic success skills.  To achieve this transformative change in undergraduate mathematics instruction, the project will develop a community of practice to provide the needed professional support, mentoring, instructional activity development, and community development. By fostering sustainable, effective implementation of mathematical inquiry at large scale in Oklahoma, the MIP aims to enhance the effectiveness of hundreds of mathematics faculty and improve the learning of thousands of entry-level mathematics students across the state. \r\n\r\nTo achieve its goals, the MIP will conduct Initiation Workshops to prioritize the concepts and skills for College Algebra/Precalculus, Quantitative Reasoning, Modeling, Calculus 1, and Academic Success Skills. Following these workshops, Collaborative Research and Development teams will develop instructional modules for each of the priority topics defined by the Initiation Workshops. Subsequently, Regional Workshops, led by the members of the relevant Collaborative Research and Development team, will help faculty learn to how to use these modules in their courses and provide continuing peer mentoring during implementation of the instructional modules.  Throughout the project, project personnel will examine the evolution of the MIP community of practice, the evolution of individual faculty, and the impact of MIP on student success.  This analysis will be used to produce a refined model for developing and sustaining an effective system-wide faculty community of practice.  The MIP model for building a community of practice around inquiry-oriented mathematics, refined through the project research and evaluation, can inform mathematics faculty professional development and mentoring throughout the nation, potentially exerting a transformative impact on undergraduate mathematics teaching and learning.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
