 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the context of education, reflection entails thinking about what one is doing, which is necessary for learning from experience. Reflection is closely linked to metacognitive skill, or the ability to think about one's thinking processes and independently guide one's own learning during new tasks. It is widely accepted by the education community that students who reflect and develop strong metacognitive skills often become better students, learners, and professionals, since they obtain the ability to identify what they don't know (but need to learn) and how they can acquire knowledge for improvement. These are lifelong learning skills that enable self-management of necessary learning during one's career. Despite being closely linked to lifelong learning outcomes, reflection and metacognition are not skills that are regularly cultivated or practiced in the engineering education curriculum. Thus, prominent education scholars have called for more reflection and metacognition within the curriculum as well as publication of classroom studies involving their use. The problem to be addressed by this research is the development and propagation of a new method for cultivating metacognitive skills in engineering students by combining questions that promote reflective thought with computer-aided simulation tools for electronic-circuit building that can be used for problem exploration. During homework and after quizzes and exams, students will use the simulator to discover gaps in their learning and understanding of electronic circuits. Beyond the electrical and computer engineering classroom, the techniques are broadly applicable to other engineering disciplines since each has complex problems for which simulation tools are used. The impact of incorporating simulation tools within the reflective process will be studied, and the findings will contribute to the promotion of needed reflective and metacognitive practices in science, engineering, technology, and math (STEM), which will prepare students for the challenges of professional practice, for which lifelong learning skills are needed.\r\n\r\nThis research aims to determine the impact of systematic, frequent reflection - using SPICE simulation with homework or after exams - on the professional formation of engineers with respect to metacognitive, reflective, and technical performance outcomes. SPICE is the de facto standard simulation environment used by professionals to predict electronic circuit behavior. This work is informed by Kolb's Experiential Learning Theory and Schons Theory of the Reflective Practitioner, which rely on \"doing\" as well as \"reflecting on the doing\" for one's learning. The key research questions are: 1) To what extent does systematic, frequent reflection, particularly involving the use of simulation, enhance students' reflective practices and technical course performance? 2) Why and how does this occur? Outcomes will be investigated for all students as well as specific demographics, including females and under-represented minorities. The research questions will be investigated by comparing the depth and content of students' reflections as well as course performance metrics under different amounts of reflective activity within the course. Thus, both qualitative and quantitative research methods will be used, in particular double-coded content analysis of reflections and analysis-of-variance statistical techniques using baseline course performance data. Student perspectives on the impact of reflection will be assessed through interviews, focus groups, and surveys. This research aims to respond to recent calls from the literature and prominent educators for: 1) formal inclusion of metacognitive skill development within the curriculum, and 2) additional scholarly publications on reflection in engineering education to propagate these skills, which support lifelong, self-regulated learning for demanding professional practice.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

During homework and after quizzes and exams in two electrical and computer engineering courses, students used the simulator to discover gaps in their understanding and subsequently write a reflection on their learning. \n\nInitially, a pre-course survey illustrated lack of student experience with reflection and hence an opportunity.  It was determined that 81% of respondents had little or no previous experience with reflecting as part of their coursework.  Also, the two most common student definitions of reflection pointed to lower-complexity understandings of reflection and its benefits.  \n\nIn examining the students\u2019 reflections, the investigators found that it is important to be aware of potential student fatigue with repeated reflection.  However, fatigue may be reducible by varying the reflective questions through skillfully crafting question variants.  However, although the investigators hypothesized fatigue was an issue, this should be confirmed by gathering student reactions to reflection, as suggested by Turns and colleagues with their recent research.  Secondly, milestone events, such as examinations, may drive students to participate more diligently in reflection activity.  For example, with reflection after the midterm examinations, students reflected to a greater depth versus after several quizzes.

For example, 47% indicated reflection improved their learning in the course to a large or very large extent, with another 36% indicating to a moderate extent.  Thirty-five percent (35%) said their experience in the course motivated them to a large or very large extent to incorporate reflection in their processes moving forward, with another 47% indicating that was the case to a moderate extent.  A content analysis of the perceived impacts of reflection in the course resulted in top response categories of metacognitive behavior/development and learning, mentioned by 57% and 55% of respondents, respectively, as part of an open-ended response.\n\nIn addition, a funded supplemental study was done to gather student outcomes related to motivation, perceived stress, college experiences, and learning during the COVID remote instructional period.  Several months after the onset of the pandemic in the fall of 2020, a large subset of undergraduate engineering students at the University of Pittsburgh responded to a survey study, with an outstanding response rate of 42%.  Stark percentages were uncovered, including 78% of survey respondents who said their motivation was less versus before remote instruction. Remote coursework was the most-frequent de-motivator. Based on the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10), students experienced higher perceived stress (median = 22) several months into the pandemic, versus other undergraduates previously.  The most-frequent stressor was academic, reported by 61% of survey respondents.  Sixty-three percent (63%) of survey respondents said they valued their university education less or much less versus before remote instruction due to COVID.  The valued experience cited most often was campus-based instruction with peers, which was related to both the top de-motivator and the top stressor.  All university experiences were identified by students as being negatively impacted.  Seventy-one percent (71%) of survey respondents rated their learning as less or much less versus before remote instruction.  The survey study was later followed by focus groups in the spring of 2021.  In all focus groups, low or decreased motivation was mentioned.  Such information can be used to support creation and development of interventions and support structures in future times of crisis.  This may be particularly relevant for engineering schools, whose students face unique stressors.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/20/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Samuel J Dickerson"
