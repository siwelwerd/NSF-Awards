 "awd_abstract_narration": "New technologies for improving the safety of infrastructure during natural hazards are advancing through ongoing research in the United States (U.S.) and abroad. Locations that have been recently impacted by earthquakes, tsunamis and hurricanes form prime opportunities for multidisciplinary groups of graduate students from the U.S. to learn the lessons of how infrastructure protective systems performed during recent disasters so that these students can direct their current and future research in the most contemporary and productive directions to better prepare the U.S. for future natural hazards. The objective of this award is to engage U.S. advanced graduate students from various disciplines in embedded learning through research at the forefront of protective systems for natural hazards engineering on the Pacific rim and beyond, and to build a sustained research community between them and their overseas counterparts. The award will enable six Advanced Studies Institutes (ASIs), each in a different location, in which the U.S. students learn from local and U.S. faculty experts, initiate protective systems research in natural hazards engineering, and experience first-hand the effects of natural hazards on built environments. Through these activities, this award advances U.S. scientific capabilities in multidisciplinary components of natural hazards engineering, and trains a diverse upcoming cohort of the scientific workforce to preemptively advance new technologies to prepare for future disasters at home; collaborate with counterparts, senior and early career faculty; and establish a new multidisciplinary approach to engineering hazard resilience. The project will involve a total of 81 U.S. graduate students via the six ASIs in different sites around the world.\r\n\r\nThe PREEMPTIVE (Pacific Rim Earthquake Engineering Mitigation Protective Technologies International Virtual Environment) ASIs explore topics in disaster science and resilient infrastructure from a highly multidisciplinary perspective to train a diverse group of graduate students in the broad areas of protective systems and disaster mitigation. A series of six week-long PREEMPTIVE ASIs are planned over three years, each enabling a cohort of advanced graduate students and senior and early-career faculty from the U.S. with counterpart faculty and students from around the world to learn about global efforts in protective systems for natural hazards, establish new frontiers of multidisciplinary research, and form long-term global professional relationships. The ASIs will explore the Resilience of Aging Infrastructure, Tsunami Hazards and Infrastructure Resilience, Structural Control & Geotechnical Challenges, Extreme Earthquake & Tsunami Hazards, Hurricane and Multi-Hazards, and Interdisciplinary Disaster Science in Costa Rica, Thailand, New Zealand, Chile, Puerto Rico, and Japan. Each ASI will consist of 2-3 day workshops, 1-2 day cultural and technical tours to provide context to the performance of protective systems in recent natural hazards, and 2-3 day collaborative group projects providing guided experiential learning experiences in infrastructure protective systems. Through this award, U.S. graduate student researchers learn to be preemptive in: addressing current and future research needs in advanced hazards mitigation; collaborating with overseas counterparts; and establishing a new multidisciplinary approach to engineering hazard resilience. The U.S. graduate student participants are selected via rigorous application processes. Student learning outcomes will be assessed through a variety of modalities, analyzed and disseminated through a website and in conference and journal publications.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The five PREEMPTIVE institutes were: Resilience of Aging Infrastructure, COSTA RICA; Tsunami Hazards and Infrastructure Resilience, THAILAND; Structural Control &amp; Geotechnical Challenges, NEW ZEALAND, Interdisciplinary Disaster Science, JAPAN; and Monitoring and Control of Structures, SWITZERLAND. The project supported the international participation of 49 US graduate student participants; 16 US faculty mentors; and facilitated the engagement of 47 students and 23 faculty from Costa Rica, Thailand, New Zealand, Japan and Switzerland. Of the US students: 25 were female (51%), 8 from ethnic groups traditionally underrepresented in engineering (16%), 2 with a disability (4%), 2 military veterans (4%), and 4 from disciplines outside engineering (8%).</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">Students participated in technical presentations and discussions over a range of topics related to protective systems to improve structural resilience to natural hazards. Participants also attended workshops and professional meetings in the host countries and worked closely in interdisciplinary teams with US and foreign mentors to develop strong research proposal concepts with intellectual merits and broader impacts and presented their ideas to the ASI to receive mentor feedback and insights. Participants attended in-country conferences and workshops, including the New Zealand Society for Earthquake Engineering (NZSEE) 2022 annual conference and the 9th International Workshop on Structural Control and Monitoring (9IWSCM) in 2024. Technical tours included: a visit in Costa Rica to critical highway bridges damaged in the 1991 Limon Earthquake along with a tour Costa Rica's largest port, which is in Limon; the Khaolak and Phuket disaster areas in Thailand impacted by the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami; a geotechnical tour of rockfall protection and mitigation work around Kaikoura in New Zealand, a tour of central Christchurch reconstruction, and a visit to Blenheim to learn about earthquake impacts on NZ agriculture; and the Minami-Sanriku Disaster Prevention Center and Akashi-Kaikyo Bridge in Japan. Tours also included: the Christchurch Emergency Operations Centre in New Zealand; the Takenaka, Obayashi and Kajima Research Institutes, and the NIED E-Defense Shake Table in Japan; and the Swiss Seismological Service (SED) in Switzerland. The students visited museums including the Te Papa Tongareqa National Museum in New Zealand, the Hokudan Earthquake Memorial Park and Great Hanshin-Awaji Earthquake Memorial Museum in Japan, and the Irazu Volcano museum in Costa Rica. The participants toured research facilities at the Universities of Costa Rica, Canterbury, Auckland, Chulalongkorn, Kasembundit, Tohoku, Kobe, Tokyo, and ETH Zurich. To learn more about each country and its people, cultural visits included the Irazu Volcano and Manuel Antonio National Park in Costa Rica, the Swiss Alps, the ancient Siam capital of Ayutthay, in Thailand, and a Japanese baseball game in Tokyo and cultural trip to Himeji Castle in Japan.&nbsp;ASI student participant impact was assessed through pre- and post-trip surveys. A pre-to-post paired sample T-test was computed across ASI years (each three months post-ASI) to determine if differences in pre-to-post ASI participation were statistically significant. (Some survey data was incomplete, especially from in-country local students.) There was a statistically significant gain pre- to-post ASI participation: t(39)=4.62, p&lt;0.01, revealing significant gains in global preparedness three months post-ASI participation.
