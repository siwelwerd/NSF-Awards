The subject has long thrived in its connections with classical areas of mathematics such as harmonic and functional analysis and logic. Over the course of the last 25 years, however, a vast number of new interactions have opened up the field to novel and exciting directions. The semester long program will organize a number of activities in and around modern aspects of descriptive set theory and its links with other areas of mathematics. An important focus is to facilitate research on the structure of Polish topological groups, which recently has gathered momentum partially due to work in descriptive set theory.
