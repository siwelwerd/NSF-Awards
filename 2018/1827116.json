 "awd_abstract_narration": "Increasingly, science has become a \"team sport\" with projects less likely to be conducted by a single investigator or university group but with multi-institution collaborations spanning many universities and national laboratories.  As these collaborations have become data-intensive, highly-performant network links connecting their distributed science platforms have become increasingly important.  While true across all science, some collaborations, like those at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, transfer millions of gigabytes across global networks today and anticipate orders of magnitude increases within the next decade. Without performant networks and efficient data transfer and access services, the time to science will be greatly compromised.  In this context, high-speed, long-distance networks see their performance degrade surprisingly quickly in the face of modest error rates.  Accordingly, network engineers and researchers use sophisticated tools to monitor the network and transfer services.  Without a means to aggregate and correlate network tests, performance measurements, and application response, they at best can only reveal a small piece of the overall problem.  This project focuses on techniques that better combine, visualize, and analyze disparate network monitoring and service logging data, providing a comprehensive picture critical to the engineers and scientists relying on the network.  This will allow problems to be located and fixed more quickly, reducing the time to science. \r\n\r\nThe \"CC* Integration: Service Analysis and Network Diagnosis (SAND)\" project brings together an experienced team that has been working for more than a decade on wide area data transfers for large scale science.  The project develops a network monitoring archive and analytics platform, SAND-NMA, which integrates widely used data analytics tools (such as ElasticSearch, Kibana and JupyterLab) with infrastructure components (perfSONAR, HTCondor) and application sensors. Data from disparate sources are published to a messaging bus providing low-latency metrics describing the performance of research platforms on a global scale. Exploratory work is performed to provide engineers with pragmatic tools to identify and locate problems and perform analytics to understand the long-term evolution of network and higher level service performance.  Programming interfaces allow external cyberinfrastructure (such as workflow management systems) to incorporate the network monitoring feeds into their decision making engines.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nResearch &amp; Education networks are designed to move scientific data at high speeds across the continent; however, the performance of data transfers between two endpoints often falls short of the network's capabilities.  The key to understanding performance is an end-to-end understanding of the network.  It is essential to monitor and test not only individual network devices but also performance observed by the endpoints; further, one needs to have the ability to aggregate, analyze, and alarm based on a wide variety of such measurements.\nThe \"CC* Integration: Service Analysis and Network Diagnosis (SAND)\" project improved the NSF cyberinfrastructure community's ability to understand network performance by providing a platform which aggregated network monitoring data from both the networks themselves and the applications that used it; the intellectual merit was in providing a single platform which addressed multiple viewpoints of network data.  The platform includes a data aggregation pipeline which can be fed by several software products used within the community, such as the perfSonar toolkit, HTCondor, and XRootD; a database and data archive providing long-term access to the billions of testing datapoints recorded by the pipeline; and an analysis and query platform for system administrators, network engineers, and researchers.  The SAND platform even provided mechanisms for exporting data into other network monitoring infrastructures.\nHaving a flexible and data-rich platform allowed SAND to engage communities interested in understanding network performance.  Key communities included the OSG Consortium, which provides distributed high throughput computing services across the US, and the Worldwide LHC Computing Grid (WLCG), which provides the computing infrastructure necessary for the LHC experiments at CERN.  Both communities are heavy users of the nation's R&amp;E network capacity (both inside the US and transatlantic); both also have network working groups that are users of the platform built by SAND and the data covering their resources.  These communities provided several case studies for using SAND to spot and debug network performance issues that were otherwise difficult to spot; SAND was successful in providing measurement data across several networks.  SAND was able to disseminate the knowledge about the platform via presentations in community forums and workshops.\nTowards the project's broader impact, the SAND platform was used by students - including undergraduates - interested in network performance research.  The SAND team was able to engage and mentor students, both internally and through external collaborations, who helped design and build several visualization tools and assisted with the network performance alerting platform.\nSAND's outcomes led to significant improvements and new capabilities for the distributed high throughput computing community, including the OSG and WLCG.  It demonstrated the value of holistic network and application-level monitoring for understanding network performance; the platform developed from the project allowed it to engage students, users, and administrators in pursuit of improved network application performance for the nation's cyberinfrastructure.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/27/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Brian P Bockelman"
