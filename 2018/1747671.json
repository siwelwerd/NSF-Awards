 "awd_abstract_narration": "Advances in the science of atmospheric pressure plasmas have enabled breakthrough opportunities to improve our Nation's healthcare, economic prosperity and defense.  These science breakthroughs have resulted in the development of new technologies in green energy, environmental remediation, water treatment and cleaning, medicine, food processing, and agriculture. These are the core fundamental areas of science and technology to be addressed by the Center for High Pressure Plasma Energy, Agriculture, and Biomedical Technologies (C-PEAB). Drexel University (DU), University of Michigan (UM), and George Washington University (GWU), leading institutions in the scientific subject area, are synergistically collaborating with each other and with their industrial partners as the founding members of the C-PEAB.  This effort will support STEM education with focused recruitment of women and underrepresented minorities, produce an interdisciplinary workforce, and integrate novel breakthrough technologies with industry.  While having long-term collaborations in plasma science with GWU and UM, Drexel University's unique contribution to the C-PEAB team is based upon DU?s pioneering research achievements in plasma medicine and plasma agriculture as well as scientific and technological experience in scaling up atmospheric pressure plasma devices from laboratory to industrial scale.\r\n\r\nLow Temperature non-equilibrium Plasma (LTP) science is the base upon which many modern industries such as microelectronics and micro-fabrication have been built. Current breakthroughs in plasma-generating electronics have made it possible to widen the area of LTP applications to atmospheric and higher pressures. These application areas are the focus of the Center for High Pressure Plasma Energy, Agriculture, and Biomedical Technologies (C-PEAB). The C-PEAB will translate science breakthroughs in diagnostics, pulse power and modeling to optimizing industrial applications in energy, environmental remediation, food safety and food processing, and medical and bioengineering. C-PEAB will initially consist of a three-site IUCRC between Drexel University (DU), University of Michigan (UM), and George Washington University (GWU) with subsequent addition of new member universities who have strong industry collaborations in high-pressure plasma applications pertinent to the C-PEAB.  While having long-term collaboration experience in plasma science with GWU and UM, Drexel University site's unique contribution to the C-PEAB team is especially based upon DU?s core expertise in science and engineering of atmospheric and higher pressure (1) nanosecond and sub-nanosecond pulsed dielectric barrier discharges, and (2) non-equilibrium gliding arcs, stabilized in tornado flow.",
