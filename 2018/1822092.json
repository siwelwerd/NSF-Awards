 "awd_abstract_narration": "The US food and beverage industry employs 1.46 million individuals and is responsible for more than 10% of all manufacturing shipments. Even though sanitation is one of the food industry's biggest production expenses, inadequate sanitation remains one of the greatest threats to America's food safety and security due to the lack of modern technology and consistent application of sanitation policies.\r\n\r\nCAFSS will strive to integrate and streamline the entire food supply chain in the US from 'Farm to Fork' and supply safe (pathogen and allergen free), secure (uninterrupted and fully traceable sources), wholesome and plentiful supply of food to the US and Global consumers.\r\n\r\nCAFSS objectives will focus on addressing two grand challenges of national importance:\r\n\r\n1) Ensuring a stable and sustainable supply of affordable, safe, nutritious food not only for the US but also for the rest of the world.\r\n2) Equipping and empowering US food manufacturers and their supporting industries, to establish highly competitive manufacturing plants in the US and the world.\r\n\r\nThe US food industry adds commercial value to agricultural products and provides employment opportunities in both rural and urban areas and CAFSS will enhance the overall sustainability and profitability through automation and new private-public partnerships.\r\n\r\nThe proposed CAFSS will bridge technological gaps, which fall under the general theme of food safety, security and traceability of all raw materials throughout the entire supply chain from 'Farm to Fork'.  Bridging these gaps will require multidisciplinary collaborations among public and private enterprises and groundbreaking research and development within the following fundamental science and engineering platforms:\r\n\r\n1) Automation, control and robotics; IoT systems and data integration; \r\n2) New sensors; big data analytics and artificial intelligence; \r\n3) New functionalized surfaces, new materials / coatings  \r\n4) Novel food sterilization technologies. \r\n\r\nAutomation, control, and robotics minimize human contact with food and greatly enhance food safety. Newer sensors with data analytics enable the food companies to improve food safety, quality, and traceability. Novel functionalized surfaces enhance food sanitation efficiency thereby reducing production downtime, and energy and water requirements.  Novel food sterilization and pasteurization technologies improve food safety with minimal deterioration in food quality and they meet consumers' demand for minimally processed foods.\r\n\r\nResearch projects will be carried out at CAFSS hub facilities in Nebraska and Georgia and the resulting breakthroughs will allow the US food manufacturing industry to join other industries in terms of efficiency, automation, lower cost, predictability, safety and security of goods supplied.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project sought to complete the planning process to identify needs in the food industry that could be met with an NSF IUCRC.  The PI Team was trained in the NSF I-Corp customer discovery process to help the team ascertain the key needs among stakeholders in the food industry.  The PI team interviewed approximately 20 leaders from various aspects of the food industry to understand their unmet research needs which were common to the diverse group.  The list of needs was very broad, and the PI team did not come to a consensus on how to best unify them into a common theme for the IUCRC.  In the meantime, we were invited to submit a large NSF ERC proposal.  That effort put a pause on this planning grant.  During this time, some of key personnel changed jobs or job responsibilities. That, and several other constraints on the PI team, made the conducting of a planning meeting very challenging.  The team has decided not to hold a planning meeting and instead refocus efforts in other areas.  The team concluded that we are not best equipped to setup an IUCRC in this area.  Therefore, we froze our spending and decided to close this project. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/23/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jeyamkondan Subbiah"
