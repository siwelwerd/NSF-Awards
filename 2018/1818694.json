 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) through Targeted Infusion Projects supports the development, implementation, and study of evidence-based innovative models and approaches for improving the preparation and success of HBCU undergraduate students so that they may pursue STEM graduate programs and/or careers. The Geospatial Data Analytics (GEODATA) Certificate at Fayetteville State University (FSU) will expose students to new career opportunities, since geospatial technologies have recently experienced robust job growth and is rapidly gaining momentum in the industry, with wide ranging applications. The traditional and online courses will serve a broad range of students, including underrepresented minorities and non-traditional students who attend FSU.\r\n\r\nThe GEODATA Certificate program will educate undergraduate students in computational and data-enabled science in the context of geospatial applications. The proposed project is based on educational research that suggests Computer Science curricula can benefit from creating pathways built from contexts, which are application and domain areas that cover core knowledge by providing explanations and motivation for students. The interdisciplinary computing classes of the program are thus expected to aid in recruitment and retention and provide benefits for students seeking new career opportunities in STEM. The GEODATA program will add to the growing body of knowledge on how to motivate students in the study of computing, how to prepare them for the modern-day job market, and how to develop their core knowledge and skills by using the geospatial context. Proposed activities consist of course development and redesign, setting up the geospatial-computing infrastructure and equipment, implementation of the certification program and development of fully online counterparts of existing program courses.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The primary aim of the project was to create new courses and re-design some existing courses in Computer Science to teach core knowledge using the pathway and context of computer-based storage and analysis of geospatial data. Studies show that development of spatial analysis skills can enhance student abilities in computational thinking and that these skills can be developed. During the period of NSF funding the principal investigators of the GEODATA program have contributed scholarly articles to the growing body of knowledge on how to motivate students in the study of computing, how to prepare them for the modern-day job market, and how to develop their core knowledge and skills by using the geospatial context. Geospatial data is data any type ? image, passages of text, social media posts etc. which have a geospatial tag that makes it possible to find the locations where the data was created and modified. Geospatial data analytics is very useful in business operations and the functioning of the government. The interdisciplinary, computation-oriented classes of the program are providing the context in which computing students can apply their skills, and thus gain deeper knowledge of their discipline. Other non-computing students are learning additional skills to enhance abilities in their own disciplines. This program has opened up new career possibilities for all students, since geospatial technologies have experienced robust job growth in the recent years. The GEODATA program has educated and continues to educate undergraduate students in computational and data-enabled science in the context of geospatial applications. Existing or emerging businesses can be transformed by the knowledge and abilities of the student scholars of the program as they join the workforce. In particular, geospatial data analytics, which is a focus area of the program, is rapidly gaining momentum in the industry with wide ranging applications. The traditional and online offerings of courses from this program are benefiting underrepresented minorities along with non-traditional students who attend FSU, and this aligns well with the recommendations for HBCUs to modernize curricula and to make them available online. The time period of the NSF funded project overlapped with the devastating Covid pandemic which disproportionately affected minority communities. The GEODATA program was able to adapt to the significant challenges of these times by offering courses in online format and engaging students in research and extracurricular learning experiences in virtual mode. The efforts to recruit students into the program were negatively affected by university shutdowns and other emergency measures during the pandemic. The perseverance of the students, the investigators of the project, other department faculty and staff through these difficult times has successfully established the program and made it available for future students.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 07/23/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Sambit&nbsp;Bhattacharya</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1818694/1818694_10543346_1658601452935_nsf2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1818694/1818694_10543346_1658601452935_nsf2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Conference poster presentation by students\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1818694/1818694_10543346_1658601452935_nsf2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Conference poster presentation by students\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Students in the Geospatial Data Analytics Program presenting at a conference.
