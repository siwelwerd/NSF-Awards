 "awd_abstract_narration": "The crust-mantle boundary, or the Moho, is an ubiquitous structural discontinuity of the Earth. Lateral variations in Moho geometry, especially Moho offsets, are important to understand the origin and evolution of the crust, and have been the target of many regional and global studies. However, previous methods offer only either spot illumination of the crust or a smoothed Moho topography. Here we propose a scattering-based method to systematically map Moho offsets. Taking advantage of the dense data coverage from the USArray, this work will provide a complete map of Moho offsets over the contiguous United States.  The results will shed light on the tectonic evolution of the North American Continent and provide information on the material properties of the lower crust.  This project will also support the training of a postdoctoral scholar.\r\n\r\nThe proposed new method relies on surface waves scattered from incident teleseismic body waves. When teleseismic body waves hit a Moho offset, the latter serves as a strong secondary source. As a result, the surface waves are radiated horizontally away from the Moho offset. By back propagating the scattered surface waves with a proper velocity model, the Moho offset can be detected and located. The result of this work can potentially resolve the debate of whether Moho offsets are widespread or not. Regional differences (or not) in the distribution of Moho offsets will provide valuable information on the thick-skinned vs. thin-skinned deformation mechanisms and the effects of lower crust ductile flow in smoothing out Moho offsets.  The new method will be applied to USArray data to map Moho topography beneath the United States.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Compared to body waves, scattered surface waves propagate along the Earth?s surface with less energy loss and, thus, can be observed over a wider distance range. In this project, we utilize surface waves converted from teleseismic SH or Sdiff wave incidence to map strong lateral heterogeneities across the entire contiguous US. We apply array-based phase coherence analysis to broadband waveforms recorded by the USArray Transportable Array and other permanent/temporary networks to detect coherent signals that are associated with body-to-surface wave scattering. We then locate the source of the scattering by back-propagating the beamformed energy using both straight-ray and curved-ray approximations. Our results show that the distribution of scatterers correlates well with known geological features across the contiguous US. Topographic/bathymetric relief along the continental slope off the Pacific Border is the major source of scattering in the western US. On the other hand, sedimentary basins, especially their margins, are the dominant scatterers in the central US. Moho offsets, such as the one around the periphery of the Colorado Plateau, are also a strong contributor to scattering, but isolating their effect from that of other near-surface structures without any additional constraints can be complicated. Finally, we demonstrate the possibility of using scattered surface waves to constrain subsurface velocity structures, as complementary to conventional earthquake- or ambient-noise-based surface wave tomography. The methodology we have developed in this project for teleseismic SH and Love waves can be readily generalized to other data types or dense seismic arrays at smaller scales.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 01/07/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Zhongwen&nbsp;Zhan</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1829496/1829496_10572077_1610006213126_Outcome_Figure2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1829496/1829496_10572077_1610006213126_Outcome_Figure2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 2\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1829496/1829496_10572077_1610006213126_Outcome_Figure2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 2\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Composite back-projection results across the contiguous United States for curved-ray back-projections.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Chunquan Yu, Jorge Castellanos, Zhongwen Zhan</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Zhongwen&nbsp;Zhan</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 2</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1829496/1829496_10572077_1610006118132_Outcome_Figure1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1829496/1829496_10572077_1610006118132_Outcome_Figure1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1829496/1829496_10572077_1610006118132_Outcome_Figure1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">(a) The study area of this project.
