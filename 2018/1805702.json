 "awd_abstract_narration": "El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a events, collectively called El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), are the largest source of year-to-year climatic and environmental variability that affects people around the world. For example, El Ni\u00f1os cause droughts in Australia and Southeast Asia while producing damaging floods along the west coast of the United States, Ecuador and Peru. La Ni\u00f1as produce the opposite effects and both can have significant economic and natural hazard impacts. Recent studies have identified more than one type of ENSO event in the instrumental record, called Central Pacific, Eastern Pacific, or Coastal El Ni\u00f1o events based on the region with greatest rainfall. These different types of El Ni\u00f1os may explain why ENSO reconstructions from the western, central, and eastern Pacific do not always agree. Furthermore, questions remain whether or not this diversity of ENSO events occurred before the 20th century when temperatures were cooler, or occurred during prior warm periods. This project seeks to fill a gap in our knowledge of past ENSO behavior by providing a new record of ENSO variability in north-central Peru for the period 2800 to 2100 years ago, a critical area and time frame currently lacking records of ENSO variability. Our understanding of past and present ENSO is important for refining global climate models used to forecast future climate conditions and in planning for short and long-term impacts from changing climate.\r\n\r\nThis project leverages the expertise of paleoclimatologists and archaeologists while training students in a multidisciplinary approach that will develop a new reconstruction method that could be used in other locations with abundant shell material. The final product will be a new record of ENSO variability in north-central Peru spanning 2800 to 2100 years before present. The study sites are three Early Horizon (800 to 100 BCE) archaeological sites (Cayl\u00e1n, Huambacho, and Samanco), all part of an early urban society in the coastal Nepe\u00f1a Valley, Peru. The project uses shells from two short-lived bivalve species (Donax obesulus and Mesodesma donacium) excavated from several archaeological units within these three sites. These two species have different but complementary habitat preferences (warm vs. cold) that make them useful to capture El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a events; however, both species are short-lived (1 to 3 years). Instead of building a continuous record of individual ENSO events, this project will reconstruct seasonal temperature and salinity variability from modern and archaeological specimens for individual time slices from intra-shell oxygen isotope measurements, similar to the single foraminifer approach used in marine sediment cores. The integration of archaeological data will provide a crucial perspective on the resilience or vulnerability of coastal societies to ENSO variability on long time periods. The project will support two relatively early career faculty (one female), a graduate student, and one or more undergraduates who will work in the PIs' PAST laboratory (Paleoclimate and Anthropology Studies), which brings natural and social scientists together to foster interdisciplinary collaboration.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Understanding ENSO is an important goal for climate scientists because it is the largest driver of year-to-year climate shifts experienced globally. Questions scientists want to understand about ENSO include the changes in its intensity, frequency and duration of events, and changes in its geographic impacts. Answering these questions will lead to a better understanding of the impacts of ENSO on not only natural systems but human societies as well. Particularly important is understanding the uniqueness of recent ENSO variability compared to eariler times when ENSO was weaker, and when these uniquely modern patterns of ENSO began. Scientists use living organisms that contain annual layers, like tree rings, corals, and shells, to answers these questions by using the principle that living organisms record environment changes in their skeletal chemistry as they grow. Long-lived reef-building corals can record ENSO events, but these corals are geographically limited to warm, clear, nutrient-depleted waters that do not exist on the Pacific coast of the Americas where the water is too cold for corals, especially in countries like Peru, which is considered the traditional epicenter of ENSO and where El Nino and La Nina were named.</p>\n<p>Coastal Peru lacks long-lived marine organisms useful for understanding past ENSO thus creating the need for new methods to reconstruct ENSO. Short-lived (less than 5 years) clams are commonly found on beaches and archaeological deposits and therefore can provide snapshots of past ENSO variability, rather than continuous multiple year record generated from trees and corals. Previous studies have found success using the short-lived intertidal clam <em>Mesodesma donacium</em>. However, <em>M. donacium </em>are vulnerable to die-offs from the warmer sea surface temperatures associated with El Nino events and are today extinct in northern Peru thus limiting the possibility of modern studies for that region. In this project, we investigated the short-lived (1 to 3 years) surf clam, <em>Donax obesulus</em>, commonly found in northern Peru, for reconstructing ENSO. <em>Donax obesulus </em>populations are able to survive the warmer temperatures present during El Nino events although they are vulnerable to colder temperatures associated with La Ninas. Clam shells are made calcium carbonate (CaCO<sub>3</sub>) where the ratio of oxygen-16 to oxygen-18, two stable isotopes of oxygen, should reflect the water's temperature as the clam shell grows. We assessed the environmental drivers underlying the month-to-month oxygen isotope variability in shells collected in 2012 (a La Nina year), 2014 (an ENSO-neutral year), and 2016 (an El Nino year) from coastal beaches near the Nepena Valley in Peru. We confirmed the oxygen isotope variations are driven by temperature with some contribution from seasonally-varying changes in the oxygen isotope of seawater, where the clams are living, due to changes in ocean currents. Our results suggest that short-lived bivalves are useful for reconstructing ENSO in this region.</p>\n<p>We next apply this new short-lived bivalve method to older clam shells from archaeological sites in Peru where ancient peoples lived 2400 to 2200 years ago. Previous reconstructions of the ENSO suggest a decrease in ENSO intensity and frequency about 6000 years ago but those studies disagree as to when modern ENSO conditions began. Most studies report an increase in ENSO intensity beginning about 5000 to 3000 years ago. In this project, we reconstructed ENSO using the oxygen isotope ratios from two short-lived bivalve species, <em>Mesodesma donacium </em>and <em>Donax obesulus</em>, from Caylan, an archaeological site in coastal Peru dated to 2400 to 2200 years ago. Our findings indicate that ENSO variability about 2300 years ago was similar to the last 200 years, unlike the quiet period that occurred about 6000 years ago. We suggest strong El Nino events likely drove ENSO variability similar to the late 20th century but with a slightly cooler ocean temperature.</p>\n<p>The project actively collaborated with community organizations in the Nepena Valley, Peru to develop outreach and educational activities as well as train future paleoclimatologists and archaeologists and thus contributing to capacity building in the United States and Peru. In consultation with local community leaders including elected officials, schoolteachers, museum curators, professional archaeologists, landowners, and others, the project contributed to raising awareness about archaeology and prehistory, educating non-specialists, protecting cultural heritage, and stimulating an equitable and fair economic development. In Moro, the project partnered with the Peruvian non-profit organizations Asociacion Caminemos Unidos and its Museo Arqueologico de las Tecnologias Andinas in developing educational workshops and documentary videos. We delivered a series of classes at the local elementary school Colegio Santo Domingo de Moro. This project also trained a doctoral student, who attending several conferences and meetings as part of his training including an interdisciplinary early career workshops in Peru and Ecuador.</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 11/30/2023<br>\nModified by: Kristine&nbsp;L&nbsp;Delong</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1805702/1805702_10536796_1701319484190_IFA_SLB_Prob_Densityai--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1805702/1805702_10536796_1701319484190_IFA_SLB_Prob_Densityai--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Comparison of the Individual Foraminifer Analysis and short-lived bivalve methods.\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1805702/1805702_10536796_1701319484190_IFA_SLB_Prob_Densityai--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Comparison of the Individual Foraminifer Analysis and short-lived bivalve methods.\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Comparison of the Individual Foraminifer Analysis and short-lived bivalve methods.
