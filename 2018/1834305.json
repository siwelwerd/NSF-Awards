 "awd_abstract_narration": "New thermodynamic data and models are essential for optimizing the performance of conventional chemical processes and for developing new energy efficient and environmentally sustainable ones. Furthermore, thermodynamic data and models are central to scientific advances in designing and manufacturing advanced materials.  This grant will provide partial support for US-based junior faculty and young researchers from diverse backgrounds to attend the XI Iberoamerican Conference on Phase Equilibria for Process Design (EQUIFASE 2018). The conference will be held from October 22 - 25, 2018 in the city of Carlos Paz, in the province of Cordoba, Argentina. The goal of this international conference is to identify new opportunities in research and education and to promote international collaboration related to basic data for chemical process design and optimization. The conference is unique in the wide participation of researchers and students from South American countries, providing the only meeting that brings much of this community together with researchers from the international community.\r\n\r\nEQUIFASE 2018 will focus on improved thermodynamic data and advanced computational models to enable optimal design of processes related to energy conversion and storage, chemical processing, materials fabrication, to maximize energy efficiency and environmental sustainability. Intellectual merits of the conference include: (1) Identification of key challenges in conventional process industries and in new areas of process intensification related to processing of energy, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and bio-chemicals. (2) Development of a roadmap to address these challenges by promoting collaboration that integrates methods of experimental design, molecular modeling and computation, and modern approaches of machine learning. Education will be a key topic of the conference with focus on international collaborations in distance learning and open courses.  The young conference participants, many from underrepresented groups in STEM, will benefit from state-of-the-art reviews and presentations by leading experts, by exchanging the latest advances on frontier research subjects relating to molecular thermodynamics and chemical processes, and by debating controversial points with their peers. The conference will also provide an excellent opportunity for interaction and cooperation among academic and industrial researchers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe primary goal of this project was to promote scientific discussion, collaboration, and cultural exchange between young researchers from the United States with researchers and students in South America and leading researchers from across the world.  This was accomplished by partially supporting travel by young investigators to attend the XI Iberoamerican Conference on Phase Equilibria for Process Design (EQUIFASE 2018).  The EQUIFASE Conference provided an opportunity to share knowledge of new methods and models to enable breakthroughs in chemical, pharmaceutical, energy, and material design and manufacture.  To be specific, the conference focused on new thermodynamic data and models that are essential to increase energy efficiency and to reduce environmental impacts of conventional chemical processes and to develop new, efficient intensified processes.  Further, thermodynamic data and models are central to scientific advances in designing and manufacturing advanced materials.\n\n \n\nThe last time NSF supported a group of faculty to attend the EQUIFASE conference was 2002 in Brazil.  Similar to EQUIFASE 2018, NSF support enabled a high-level international program that attracted leading researchers from the Americas and Europe.  The broader impact was seen in numerous short courses, sabbatical leaves, and other collaborations between researchers in the U.S. and South America that can be traced to contacts made at that conference.  We expect similar impact to be generated from contacts established through EQUIFASE 2018.\n\n \n\nYoung faculty members and postdocs from the United States were invited to promote collaboration and identify new opportunities related to future developments in thermodynamic measurement, computational modeling, process and product design, machine learning, and education.  The Equifase 2018 conference introduced topics beyond chemical processing, including:  environmental remediation of the planet related to CO2, waste electronics, plastics, and pharmaceuticals as well as technologies related to the production of energy resources in South American countries that can improve every sector of an economy.\n\n \n\nThe direct impact of the project included:\n\n \n\nSharing research results with undergraduate students, graduate students, postdocs, and researchers from South America and from throughout the world\nDiscussions with students about potential graduate research opportunities in the United States\nDeveloping new ideas for research directions and collaboration\nExposure of U.S. researchers to the areas of bio-refining (e.g., chemicals from nuts, fruits, and plants) common in South America\nEducation of students and researchers in South America about chemical and energy related research common in the United States.
