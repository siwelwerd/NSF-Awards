 "awd_abstract_narration": "Agriculture lies at the heart of interactions among food, energy and water systems. It is an increasingly energy-intensive enterprise, but it is also a growing source of energy. Agriculture places large demands on water supplies while poor practices can degrade water quality. Each of these interactions creates opportunities for modeling, driven by sensor-based and qualitative data collection, to improve the effectiveness of system operation and control in the short term as well as investments and planning for the long term. The large volume and complexity of the data collected creates challenges for decision support and stakeholder communication. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award to Iowa State University will build a community of researchers that explores, develops and implements effective data-driven decision-making to efficiently produce food, transform primary energy sources into energy carriers, and enhance water quality.  The project anticipates training forty-eight (48) MS and PhD students, including twenty-four (24) funded PhD trainees, from agricultural and biosystems engineering, agronomy, industrial engineering, mechanical engineering and natural resources ecology and management. The project aims to prepare trainees for multiple career paths such as research scientists, bioeconomy entrepreneurs, agribusiness leaders, policy makers, agriculture analytics specialists, or professors. \r\n\r\nSustainable provision of food, energy and clean water requires understanding the interdependencies among systems as well as the motivations and incentives of farmers and rural policy makers. Effective innovation at the nexus of these food, energy and water (FEW) systems requires data-rich system modeling with analytic capabilities for diverse types of data. The traineeship has four key components. First, trainees will complete a new graduate certificate to build competencies in fundamental understanding of interactions among food production, water quality and bioenergy; data acquisition, visualization, and analytics; complex systems modeling for decision support; and the economics, policy and sociology of the FEW nexus.  Second, they will conduct interdisciplinary research on (a) technologies and practices to increase agriculture's contributions to energy supply while reducing its negative impacts on water quality and human health; (b) data science to increase crop productivity within the constraints of sustainable intensification; or (c) decision sciences to manage tradeoffs and promote best practices among diverse stakeholders. Third, they will participate in a new graduate learning community consisting of a two-year series of workshops that focus in alternate years on the context of the Midwest agricultural FEW nexus and professional development.  Fourth, they will have small-group experiences to promote collaboration and peer review. Each trainee will create and curate a portfolio that combines artifacts from coursework and research with reflections on the broader impacts of their work. \r\n\r\nThe NSF Research Traineeship (NRT) Program is designed to encourage the development and implementation of bold, new potentially transformative models for STEM graduate education training. The program is dedicated to effective training of STEM graduate students in high priority interdisciplinary research areas through comprehensive traineeship models that are innovative, evidence-based, and aligned with changing workforce and research needs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

With a focus on the impacts of agricultural practices in the Midwestern US, its goals were to foster interdisciplinary research based on data-intensive methods; educate STEM graduate students for a range of research, research-related and entrepreneurial careers employing data-driven modeling at the food, energy, and water system (FEWS) nexus; and prepare STEM graduate students to work effectively in multidisciplinary teams, communicate effectively with stakeholders, and identify economically sustainable innovations.\r\n\n\nThe major components of the traineeship program were:\r\n\n\n1) The students thesis or dissertation research on a FEWS issue;\r\n\n\n2) A graduate certificate in Data-Driven Food, Energy and Water Decision Making, which consists of 2.5 credits of core courses and 9 credits of electives;\r\n\n\n3) A graduate learning community that included a two-year series of monthly workshops, and weekly small-group activities designed to enhance the trainees interdisciplinary communication and collaboration skills;\r\n\n\n4) An e-portfolio that contains artifacts from research or coursework that demonstrate attainment of key competencies; and\r\n\n\n5) An annual symposium convening trainees, faculty advisors, and the external advisory board.\r\n\n\nFour cohorts of trainees completed the two-year program in overlapping cycles, with a new cohort being recruited each year.\r\n\n\nOne of the core courses for the certificate, Biosystems for Sustainable Development, emphasized case studies in which students collaboratively examined FEWS nexus issues. The other was a course on Communications in Science, which was revived by the Graduate College for our program and has since grown to enroll over two dozen students each year. Some of them are trainees in another NRT program but the majority are not. The elective courses were drawn from three topic areas: data acquisition, visualization, and analytics; complex systems modeling for decision support; and economics, policy or sociology of FEWS. The intent of the e-portfolio was to collect artifacts that would demonstrate proficiency in each competency area of the certificate. The monthly workshops included techniques in data science, panel discussions on current FEWS issues, professional development topics, and seasoned researchers perspectives on interdisciplinary research. Small-group sessions in the first years provided the trainees with opportunities to share skills and knowledge of relevant data sources.\r\n\n\nAs the program progressed, trainees were increasingly involved in leadership of the program. An elective representative from each active cohort joined the leadership team in monthly meetings. Student-faculty working groups were formed to plan the networking weekends, symposia, workshops, and learning community agendas, as well as to award travel/publication grants. Petitions for additional elective courses beyond the initial set proposed were considered and a required course on entrepreneurship was replaced by a workshop based on trainee feedback. Two different independent study projects were allowed to substitute for completing the FEWS core course.\r\n\n\nAt the beginning of their second year of the traineeship, the final cohort of trainees proposed an agenda for the weekly learning community meetings and an alternative way to complete their e-portfolio requirements. The twelve members of the cohort divided into four-member teams to collaborate on projects concerned with each of the three FEWS areas. The food team studied food systems in Iowa to assess inequality in access to nutrition. They combined production, distribution, consumption, and nutritional data at the county level to assess causes of poor health outcomes of state residents, and developed a data visualization tool to map locations of dollar stores and food pantries across the state. This team comprises students in agricultural and biosystems engineering, animal science, economics, and nutritional science. The energy team, combining three engineering disciplines (agricultural and biosystems, chemical, and materials science) analyzed data collected from a microgrid that combines solar photovoltaic generation and storage to power a livestock feeding facility. They assessed the economic viability for this system considering its capacity for emergency response and the production of carbon-neutral pork. The water team studied how climate change affects regional drought and flood conditions, with the objective to produce an online, interactive map linked to low-income communities. These majors in civil engineering, agricultural meteorology, and environmental science combined meteorological, climate, and demographic data to identify hot spots of vulnerability to water excess or deficit.\r\n\n\nThe DataFEWSion Traineeship program trained 31 students from 16 disciplines in engineering and agriculture. Twenty-seven faculty members served as their major professors, many of whom were also committee members for other trainees. At the conclusion of the program, two trainees were in tenure-track faculty positions, five were in other academic positions including postdoctoral training, two were working in industry, two in government, two in non-governmental organizations, and the remaining 18 were continuing in their graduate degree programs.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/30/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: SarahMRyan\n"
