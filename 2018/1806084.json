 "awd_abstract_narration": "Highly magnetized plasmas are implicated in accelerating charged particles to very high speeds in astrophysical systems as diverse as pulsar wind nebulae, accretion disk coronae, and relativistic jets.  Much recent progress has been numerical, but these large and complex simulations need to be connected to a coherent theoretical picture, which also requires updating theories which predate many of the insights gained from computation.  This is exactly what this project will provide, advancing our understanding of acceleration under various physical conditions, extending to space and solar plasmas closer to home, and thus helping to build intellectual bridges between plasma physics, astrophysics, and heliospheric physics.  The study includes training, support, and mentoring for a graduate student as well as varied research opportunities for undergraduates.  Visually arresting graphics presented through collaboration with the University of Colorado Fiske Planetarium will contribute to the public understanding of modern science.\r\n\r\nRelativistic charged particles with extended power-law energy distributions are inferred to exist in many astrophysical systems, but the mechanisms for non-thermal particle acceleration (NTPA) are poorly understood.  Only recently have first-principles kinetic particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations suggested that reconnection and turbulence in highly magnetized plasmas can efficiently cause relativistic NTPA.  The challenge of translating the accumulated numerical results into a coherent theoretical picture is exacerbated by the size and complexity of modern PIC simulations, and the fact that theoretical models predate the simulations and have not been updated.  Many theories of NTPA are tied to the Fokker-Planck (FP) equation, but without numerical confirmation.  This project will combine PIC simulations with analytical theory, determine whether the FP equation approach is applicable and measure the diffusion and advection coefficients, going beyond FP if necessary, and elucidate the deeper connections between reconnection and turbulence.  This project will advance theoretical understanding of relativistic NTPA in collisionless magnetic reconnection and turbulence under a variety of physical conditions, and contribute significantly to understanding the relativistic plasma environments around neutron stars and black holes.  By influencing thinking about NTPA in other space and solar plasmas, this work will help to connect plasma physics, astrophysics, and heliospheric physics.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Uzdensky (PI), M.C. Begelman (Co-PI), G.R. Werner (Co-PI)\n\n  The Universe is filled with high-energy X-rays and gamma-rays emitted by extremely energetic relativistic particles (usually, electrons) accelerated in exotic plasma environments of some of the most enigmatic astrophysical objects --- neutron stars and black holes. The observed radiation often features very broad power-law spectra spanning several decades in photon energy, implying wide underlying energy distributions of the emitting particles. Understanding the origin of these so-called nonthermal particle energy distributions and the corresponding physical mechanisms of particle acceleration to very high energies is one of the most outstanding problems in modern astrophysics.  It is broadly recognized that astrophysical nonthermal particle acceleration (NTPA) has to involve collective plasma processes, i.e., coherent motions of many plasma particles, generating macroscopic-scale coherent electromagnetic fields.  The most promising of such processes are plasma turbulence and magnetic reconnection (a process of rapid and violent reconfiguration of the large-scale magnetic field, accompanied by a powerful magnetic energy release) and these were focus of this study. \n\n To perform this investigation, the project team used a combination of analytical theory and state-of-the-art supercomputer simulations using the Particle-in-Cell (or PIC) numerical technique, in which the motion of huge numbers (hundreds of billions) of charged particles is computed self-consistently with the electric and magnetic fields these motions generate.  It was shown that both turbulence and reconnection, especially in the relativistic collisionless plasma regime, can be very efficient particle accelerators, capable of producing prominent nonthermal power-law tails of relativistic particle spectra extending over several orders of magnitude in particle energy.  The team elucidated the specific physical mechanisms of how the particles gain their energy and, in particular, demonstrated for the first time that the evolution of the particle distribution function can be accurately described as a combination of diffusion and advection in particle energy space. This result thus provided a firm, first-principles basis for various theoretical models of turbulent particle acceleration.  This study also yielded a concrete quantitative understanding of astrophysical particle acceleration processes by mapping out the dependence of the key resulting NTPA characteristics (such as the power-law index or the electron-to-ion heating ratio) on the turbulence or reconnection parameters.  Finally, using the unique radiative capabilities of their PIC code Zeltron, the team explored potentially observable radiation signatures of these processes, while simultaneously taking into account the radiative cooling effects on the particles? dynamics.  All these numerically obtained dependencies enable one to formulate simple and practical empirical prescriptions that can will be of great benefit for large-scale, global models of astrophysical systems, such as accreting black holes. \n\n In addition to the above intellectual merits, this project had substantial broader impacts. Thus, it enabled the training of a graduate student in theoretical plasma physics, high-energy astrophysics, and advanced scientific computing, including design, implementation, and analysis of cutting-edge super-computer simulations of astrophysical plasmas.  The student also obtained valuable oral and writing communication skills.  In addition, the team made their radiative-PIC code Zeltron public and freely available to the scientific community. Finally, the team established an ongoing long-term collaboration with a local planetarium aimed at producing real simulation-based video segments for planetarium shows highlighting this project?s research.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/01/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Dmitri A Uzdensky"
