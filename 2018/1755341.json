 "awd_abstract_narration": "Brain cells are of two types. Neurons are the most well-known; they communicate with each other by generating spikes of electrical activity. The second cell type, glial cells, play a variety of roles that are less well understood. In the awake adult brain, the overall spiking activity of neurons appears random. However, in deep sleep or under anesthesia, the spiking activity pattern becomes synchronized within and between various brain regions. During brain development, this type of synchronous spiking is thought to be necessary for the circuit maturation, and the establishment and maintenance of the functional organization of the brain. The focus of this research is to understand the role of one type of glial cell (astrocytes) in the emergence of synchronous spiking activity patterns in the developing brain. The main hypothesis is that astrocytes play a decisive role in the synchronization of neuronal activity in the brain. Preliminary data has demonstrated that astrocytes are necessary for synchronization of spiking activity; the proposed research will elucidate the molecular pathways within astrocytes that control the synchronization of spiking in surrounding neurons. The results of this research will identify fundamental mechanisms of astrocyte-neuron interactions that shape synchronous activity during brain development. This project is conducted at a Historically Black University, and will immerse minority students in cutting edge neuroscience research, and foster peer-mentoring based on interactions between undergraduate and graduate researchers.\r\n\r\nPreliminary data using mixed neuron and astrocyte cultures on multi-electrode arrays (MEAs) showed random spiking activity which synchronized over time, in comparison to astrocyte-free neuronal cultures, which only show random activity without synchronization. The main hypothesis of this research is that astrocytic release of glutamate mediated by the mGluR1 G-protein-coupled-receptor (GPCR) pathway mediates the effects of astrocytes on the development of neuronal synchronous activity. A model for the mechanism by which the astrocyte mGluR1 pathway mediates neuronal synchronization will be tested using several different dominant negative constructs. A dominant-negative mGluR1 receptor that blocks downstream signaling will be used to understand this signaling pathway's role in both population synchrony, and in the temporal relationship between calcium oscillations within astrocytes and the development of neuronal synchronous bursts.  A dominant-negative SNARE protein Vamp2/Syb2 will be used to block glutamate release from astrocytes. The role of the mGluR1 pathway and mGluR1 mediated glutamate release in the development of synchrony will also be examined in vivo. The strength of this project is the combination of multi-electrode electrophysiology, molecular dissection of the mGluR1 pathway in astrocytes, and computational analyses.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Traditionally, the synapse was considered to consist of the pre- and post-synaptic neurons only. In the past 20 years, evidence that the synapse is not just between neurons and that astrocytes are also present at the synapse and communicate with both the pre- and post-synaptic neurons has steadily accumulated. The tripartite synapse originally proposed by Dr. Phil Haydon at the University of Pennsylvania is now generally accepted in the neuroscience research community.

Using the developing chick embryo brain as our model system, we established pure neuronal cultures in the absence of glial cells by adding 5 flurodeoxyuridine (FUdR) a drug which kills the dividing astrocytes but spares the non-dividing neurons. We ensured survival of the neurons by supplementing the cultures with astrocyte conditioned medium which contains the necessary nutrients for neurons to survive (Figure 1).

We can keep the neurons alive long-term and record network activity. We have now been able to re-introduce astrocytes into these pure neuron cultures after removal of FUdR. These re-introduced astrocytes integrate into the neuronal network and we see that the network activity increases along with the return of synchronization in these cultures. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of neuronal network activity changing with the removal of astrocytes and returning with their addition. Our work is not complete &ndash; we are now ready to test our predictions that the mGluR pathway and the release of glutamate by astrocytes is indeed responsible for the development of synchronous neuronal network activity. We will introduce the mGluR and VAMP2 DN astrocytes (and normal astrocytes) into pure neuron cultures (Figure 5). We predict that normal astrocytes, but not mGluR or VAMP2 DN astrocytes will restore normal network activity.</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 02/07/2024<br>\nModified by: Murali&nbsp;Temburni</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1755341/1755341_10560160_1707347465333_mGluR_DN_blocks_calcium_flux--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1755341/1755341_10560160_1707347465333_mGluR_DN_blocks_calcium_flux--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 3: mGluRDN calcium imaging\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1755341/1755341_10560160_1707347465333_mGluR_DN_blocks_calcium_flux--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 3: mGluRDN calcium imaging\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Astrocytes expressing the mGluR dominant negative protein show very little calcium increase (red) compared to control astrocytes (green).</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">V.
