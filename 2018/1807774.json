 "awd_abstract_narration": "This RAPID project represents an ambitious effort to advance our understanding of Diablo wind dynamics and their impact on extreme fire behavior during the 2017 wine country fires by collecting field observations to help guide WRF-SFIRE modeling of the events. The key outcomes from this project are:\r\n(1) an enhanced climatological analysis to include sites near the wine country fires and including a pressure gradient criteria to climatological analyses,\r\n(2) a synoptic and satellite analysis of event evolution to determine large-scale forcing on fire spread,\r\n(3) high-resolution WRF modeling of Tubbs Fire event that led to the destruction of the Coffey Park neighborhood,\r\n(4) WRF-SFIRE simulations including a reconstruction of fire-front positions for the Tubbs Fire,\r\n(5) a test of firebrand transport modeling to emulate ember showers in extreme wind-driven wildfires, and\r\n(6) the development of a 1-day Diablo Wind Workshop conducted at SJSU with major stakeholders invited.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:\r\nThe RAPID project will potentially transform wildfire research by developing a first climatology of Diablo wind events and linking synoptic patterns to variations in the climatological wind characteristics. This will lead to a better understanding of how these winds can be forecasted during critical fire weather conditions. In addition, a reconstruction of the associated fire behavior patterns from the Tubbs Fire that destroyed nearly 5700 homes will lead to better understanding of how near-surface ember transport can result in rapid fire spread.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:\r\nThe expected broader impacts of the RAPID project include:\r\n- a greater understanding of critical fire weather conditions and fire behavior associated with Diablo wind events,\r\n- improved climatology and understanding of event frequency, and\r\n- the development of a Diablo wind workshop for stakeholders / fire managers to disseminate results from the 1-year study.",
