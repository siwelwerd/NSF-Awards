 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract  \r\nThe proposal supports an international workshop between researchers from the U.S. Japan, Norway, and India on the fundamental scientific issues related to power system resiliency and the integration of distributed energy resources like photovoltaic solar resources, wind energy resources and a variety of storage devices.  Unlike conventional fossil fuel, hydroelectric or nuclear fuel based electricity generation, distributed energy resources are inherently uncertain and could significantly affect power system resiliency. This workshop between researchers from four countries that have experienced significant penetration of renewable resources will examine the critical issues affecting power system resiliency due to the increased penetration of renewable resources and identify key areas of collaborative research to arrive at innovative solutions to enhance power system resiliency and reliability.  The Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Bombay, India, will host the two-day workshop.  The invitees to this workshop will be identified and invited by the workshop organizing committee.\r\n\r\nThe increasing integration of spatially distributed renewable resources and storage devices and the modernization of computing and communication systems have contributed to increasing the complexity of interactions between constituent cyber and physical layers of the power system. Nevertheless, the systematic utilization of large data sets to inform distributed decision making-notable opportunities attributable to the generational changes highlighted previously-can improve resiliency, economy, operational efficiency, power quality, and availability. The proposed workshop, will be organized in India in January 2019, will outline the foundational science for power system resiliency and distributed energy management systems. A unique feature of the meeting is that it will bring together researchers from the US, Japan, India, and Norway; in this regard, it is anticipated that technical discussions will result in solutions that have global impact.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
