 "awd_abstract_narration": "The REU program \"Investigations in Geometry and Knot Theory\" aims to further our understanding in two vibrant areas of mathematics:  Differential Geometry and Knot Theory.  In each of three summers, each of the eight participants will be presented with background material in each of these areas and given the opportunity to pursue open-ended research problems in the field of their choice.  The unsolved problems presented in the field of Differential Geometry range widely from determining efficient methods of expressing various sorts of curvature, to developing their own theories regarding the types of curvature that one might possibly encounter and even geometrically realizing these curvatures.  The other subject of study is knot theory, or the study of closed, knotted loops in space.  Knot and link complements provide excellent examples of three-dimensional manifolds, and the field of three-dimensional topology was revolutionized in the late 1970's and 80's following the discovery of deep connections with geometry.  The revolution was spearheaded by the work of William P. Thurston on geometric structures, for which he was awarded the Fields Medal in 1982.  The unsolved problems in knot theory will emphasize this interplay between topology and geometry.  As geometric applications to topology are some of the most subtle and significant discoveries in the last thirty years, these invariants are part of an active and vibrant area of mathematical research.  Overall, these questions are of interest to mathematicians since they generally seek to understand the structure of how the universe works, but they are also of interest to the scientific community because of the potential applications of our findings.\r\n\r\nThe Differential Geometry component of this project has two main goals.   On any smooth manifold, the Riemann Curvature Tensor is an object that encodes the surface's curvature at every poin.  It is known that this object can be expressed as a combination of other types of curvatures, and the aim is to understand the nature of how different curvature tensors could be expressed according to this decomposition.  Previous results present a deep relationship between this and the number of extra dimensions one might need to embed your manifold as a subset of Euclidean space. The second goal aims to collect the known work in a particular class of surfaces and attempt to unify the work in this area into one theory, complete with examples illustrating different aspects of this theory.  The Knot Theory component of this project focuses on hyperbolic links-links whose complements admit a hyperbolic structure.  The geometric revolution in three-manifold theory demonstrated that \"most\" links are hyperbolic, and Mostow-Prasad rigidity implies that geometric quantities are topological invariants.  Determining and understanding hyperbolic structures on link complements, then, becomes an important problem in knot theory. Knot theory projects will focus on the class of links called fully augmented links-links that have particularly tractable geometric structures, which can be understood by undergraduates from many perspectives.  Despite their geometric simplicity, fully augmented links are quite useful since they can be used to construct all links via Dehn filling.  Thus projects will further uncover the geometric structure of fully augmented (and related) link complements, and apply this knowledge to links in general via Dehn filling.  Overall, both fields are rich with a variety of questions to explore.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nEach year, 8 students come to the CSUSB campus for an 8-week research experience.  After some background presentations by the directors, each student is invited to select a research question or area to pursue.  The Summer 2020 program was done virtually because of the COVID pandemic.\n\n \n\nThe program is designed to offer a number of opportunities to disseminate the participants' research (broader impacts), while offering a comprehensive and realistic research experience (intellectual merit).  Each participant is expected to write a journal-style article about their research.  This paper is subsequently posted to our REU website, and all papers produced are freely available to anyone (see below about our publication record).  We also require each participant to give a formal 30 minute presentation of their results at the end of the program, and to participate in a poster session to which the entire campus and community is invited.  These activities prepare the student for a career in mathematics by giving them an authentic research experience about relevant problems, and broadly disseminate their results to a wide audience through a number of mediums.  Each of these experiences were done online in Summer 2020.\n\n \n\nThere are several other activities the students participate in that increase the visibility of their research, further trains these individuals for a career in mathematics, and also positively influences the community.  Each of our participants is encouraged to present their poster at the Joint Mathematics Meetings poster session in the following January, or to pursue conference participation or broader dissemination elsewhere.  During this 3-year grant, we have had 12 of our possible 16 participants present at this meeting (the JMM was cancelled in 2020).  Second, and more specific to our program, we have included the following activities in each year:\n\n1)  Each Summer, we plan a visit to the University of California, Riverside (UCR) campus to meet with current graduate students in mathematics, and various faculty in the leadership of that graduate program.  This was replaced with a virtual meeting of current mathematics graduate students in 2020, wherein these graduate students discussed their experiences in graduate school and answered questions about their careers in mathematics.\n\n2)  We train our participants in the proper use of online research tools.\n\n3)  We invite at least one speaker to our campus to both talk about a mathematical topic of expertise, but also to spend some time with our group to discuss the various factors that led that person into mathematics, and why this was a good choice for them.   Unfortunately, we were unable to secure a speaker for the Summer 2020 program.\n\n4)  We have a regular Wednesday Tea during the 8 weeks of our program.  This tea is shared by other groups on campus and is an excellent way to share experiences amongst these groups.  CSUSB is a Hispanic and Minority Serving Institution, and very many of the students our REU participants interact with are minorities.  In addition, 70 percent of our student population is female, and so very many of these interactions are with underrepresented groups in mathematics.  We were unable to continue this tradiation in 2020 because of the pandemic, but we look forward to continuing it when we return our program to campus.\n\n5)  Our participants interact with another group on campus more formally:  LSAMP is a program designed to encourage success in math and science, and our participants have an opportunity to share some of their experiences with these groups.  This meeting was done virtually in 2020.\n\nSummary of outcomes:\n\nThrough the life of the grant, we have had 12 women and 12 men.  Eight have been minorities, and 12 have hailed from institutions that otherwise do not offer any advanced research opportunities.  12 of 16 participants have presented their work at a major conference (our 2020 participants were not as able to present at such conferences because of the pandemic),  and at least 17 of our 24 total participants have gone on to graduate school in mathematics.  In sum, we had 661 applications, and of those 230 were female, and 184 were a minority of some other type.  These application numbers represent a dramatic increase in women and minority interest in our program as compared to three years ago.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/17/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Corey M Dunn"
