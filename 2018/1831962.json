 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this collaborative research project is to develop a novel Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) imaging system which can simultaneously image multiple areas of brain including deep brain structures in behaving animals. This will enable, for the first time, chronic imaging of fast neural activity for deep brain structures and neuronal networks with spatio-temporal resolution of 1 ms and 100 micrometer. The PIs will validate it in a neuronal network in deep limbic and brainstem structures, but once developed it could be used anywhere in the brain. This EIT imaging technology for fast neural activity could lead to radical advances in understanding brain function and enable quantitative mathematical modeling and analysis of neural systems. This could aid the development of new treatment for neurological disorders like schizophrenia, depression and epilepsy, as well as advancing cognitive and computational neuroscience. This interdisciplinary research project will also enhance research capacity and promote the participation of underrepresented minority (URM) students in STEM education. Overall, this project will implement new technology and approaches that support our goal of increasing the participation and contributions of URM populations in neural engineering and in STEM, in general. \r\n\r\nFunctional neural imaging is critically important to determine the group cellular events that are associated with the local neuro-physiological changes in neural networks. Recent functional neural imaging technologies have allowed the exploration of the brain at the cell-biological level for the understanding of the mechanisms of mentation and brain diseases. Despite various advances, no current neural imaging technologies meet the spatio-temporal resolution and imaging coverage required to measure functional connectivity and information processing across and between cortical and deep brain structures in behaving animals. The proposed system can perform functional imaging of group activity involved in functional networks. If successful, these efforts will produce a platform that will enhance fundamental understanding of underlying mechanisms in neuroscience. It is expected that the system to be developed can assess neural activity in various nodes of functional networks thereby bridging the gap between global process and individual cell activities and substantially extend our ability to probe functional networks in the brain. This project will address the challenges to the national competitiveness and sustained STEM global leadership that can be better met through the full utilization of all of the nation's talent and resources. Improving the state of diversity and inclusion in science and engineering will allow the full benefit of a well-educated and scientifically literate population in HBCUs. STEM and neural engineering research and education will prepare our URM students for the next generation of technology and will meet the strong demand from industry for a well-prepared work force and leaders equipped with the necessary scientific understanding of advanced technology.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The system will uniquely allow functional imaging of neuronal network activity between and among structures in behaving animals. We conducted research in the three focused areas and performed graduate student training and outreach activities, using an integrative and synergetic approach to achieve the project goal.</p>\n<p><strong>1. Research and development of Fast Electrical Impedance Tomography (f-EIT) technology to image neural network.</strong></p>\n<p>f-EIT is generally used to detect simultaneous ion channel activities of neuronal groups or ensembles in different sections of the brain. We successfully developed the f-EIT system including a data acquisition hardware with high-speed sampling rate and high resolution to capture the details of activities. We developed an algorithm for signal processing to reduce capacitive charging effects from multiplexing electrodes. By applying this algorithm to our hardware, we improved the signal-to-noise ratio and the reconstructed images were much better.We fabricated several head-shaped phantoms with different electrode configurations, which is necessary to validate the efficiency of our EIT system. We made the multi-layered head phantom that comprises four main steps: drawing 3D-design of the head phantom; 3D-printing of the designed model; molding, producing the outer container and skull structure; and attaching electrodes and electrodes and connector on the outer container.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Development of novel depth nano-electrodes for f-EIT imaging.</strong></p>\n<p>We designed an electrodes array platform for Ag/AgCl microwire electrodes using 3D printing technology. Using the Opposite Drive Method, eight electrodes were circularly placed with the diameter of 5 mm.&nbsp;We designed and developed an electrodes array with a smaller diameter to avoid bleeding issues. In this eight-electrode array design, two opposite electrodes namely electrode 1 and 5 are allocated as current injection pair and resulting potentials are measured across all the other electrode. In this configuration, a reference electrode and a ground electrode are separately allocated in the test. As this method allows current flow more uniformly to overall sensing domain, it is can be more sensitive to the change of conductivity around the center.</p>\n<p><strong>3.  Recording of neural activity in multiple regions of rat brain.</strong></p>\n<p>Neural network activities were recorded using microwire electrodes from BLA, HPC and mPFC in the brain of Wistar rats. Continuous LFPs signals were recorded in sleep cycles before and after fear conditioning and extinction processes of 24 hrs, 48 hrs, 7 days, 8 days after shock training.&nbsp; The signals were amplified with a head-stage pre-amplifier and delivered to main amplifier through a commutator to avoid any weight on the animal&rsquo;s head and allow free movements for the rat. Data acquisition was done in two parts. Continuous LFPs signals were obtained and recorded using the Experiment Edit Program from DataWave Technologies. Neural network activities from BLA, HPC and mPFC were recorded simultaneously from the respective electrodes to obtain LFPs signals.We implemented a cross-correlation algorithm in data analysis to measure neural network activities between multiple brain regions. The effects of fear memory to neural network activities during sleep cycles could be mapped by calculating cross-correlation and lead-lag values and the changes in neural connectivity pattern be visualized.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Graduate and undergraduate students training.</strong></p>\n<p>We developed the cleanroom training for graduate and undergraduate students. They were trained to use the cleanroom equipment (mask aligner, evaporator, RIE, profilometer, SEM, &hellip;) for nanofabrication, especially neural electrode fabrication. Graduate students were also trained for neural recordings in Eastern Virginia Medical School (EVMS).Some results from this project were used to teach in EEN 481/541 (Biomedical Engineering). This course introduces upper-level students to the concepts and theory of biomedical engineering devices, especially for sensing and modulation purposes.</p>\n<p><strong>5. Outreach activities.</strong></p>\n<p>We developed the summer research program for high school students. We provided the opportunities for high school students in nanofabrication activities. They were trained in lab and cleanroom safety, lithography lab, dry etching lab, and SEM lab.</p>\n<p><strong>6. Publication.</strong></p>\n<p>Results from research were published and presented at conferences such as The International Society for Optics and Photonics (SPIE), Annual Meeting of Society for Neuroscience, and others.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 12/19/2023<br>\nModified by: Hargsoon&nbsp;Yoon</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div
