 "awd_abstract_narration": "With funding from the Chemical Catalysis Program of the Division of Chemistry, Dr. Andrei Vedernikov of the University of Maryland College Park is developing novel platinum catalysts that convert methane from natural gas to high value-added chemicals. Oxygen from the air is used as a reactant and so these reactions avoid expensive and potentially toxic reagents  Water is the major reaction by-product, so there is little waste produced. Methane is known for its chemical inertness and the development of greener processes for its economically-viable conversion to high-value added products is a fundamental chemical challenge. To tackle this problem, Dr. Vedernikov is studying novel platinum catalysts and designing new catalysts. He is taking advantage of theoretical and computational chemistry to explore plausible reaction pathways and guide his catalyst designs and experimental work. Dr. Vedernikov is working with high school students from low-income families.  These students are interested in chemistry and have been selected by the local Washington D.C. section of the American Chemical Society (ACS Project SEED). The students intern in his lab, contributing to the experimental work in this project. \r\n\r\nDr. Vedernikov is studying Shilov-type systems wherein electrophilic Pt(IV)Me intermediates are generated using O2 as the oxidant. Two complementary experimental approaches are used in this work. One relies on the use of redox mediators, e.g., Cu(II), while another utilizes a ligand-enabled O2 activation by Pt(II)R intermediates. The electrophilic Pt(IV)R intermediates are then intercepted by various nucleophiles (carboxylic acids, amines, etc.) to form hydrocarbon derivatives, such as quaternary ammonium salts or esters, that are protected from further oxidation. Dr Vedernikov is developing a fundamental mechanistic understanding of how the ligand environment at the Pt(II) center enables and tunes its reactivity toward both the hydrocarbon C-H bonds, and O2 to generate the Pt(IV)R intermediates. The viability of both approaches has been recently demonstrated in Dr. Vedernikov's group. Density functional theory is being used to guide the design of these novel systems and to carry out mechanistic analyses. The development of more efficient and environmentally benign protocols for methane functionalization is transformative.  As a part of the broader impacts, Dr. Vedernikov is working with and training local high school, undergraduate and graduate students in this project.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Most of these reactions involve transformation of C-H bonds present in these organic compounds and allow to replace their hydrogen atoms with some functional groups. The reactions in Scheme 1, <em>a</em> represent a unique three-component oxidative CH imidation of alkylarenes and alkanes using our new reagents <strong>1<sup>Ar</sup></strong>. All three components can be varied. N-alkylimides occur as natural products, are used as bioactive substances, specialty plastics and find some unique applications in fine organic synthesis. The reactions in Scheme 1, <em>b</em> produce various benzylic trifluoroacetates, often in quantitative yields, using our new reagent <strong>1<sup>CF3</sup></strong>. Benzylic trifluoroacetates are unique electrophiles that find synthetic applications in fine organic synthesis. Reactions in Scheme 2 allow to selectively replace H atoms with deuterium atoms in some pharmaceuticals (<em>deuterium labeling</em>) using our novel soluble highly active catalyst <strong>2<sup>tBu</sup></strong>. <em>Deuterium labeling</em> of drugs is gaining an increasing attention by pharmaceutical industry. Thanks to the deuterium kinetic isotope effect, the metabolic stability of <em>deuterated</em> drugs is enhanced, and much lower doses of such drugs can be used to attain the same pharmacological effect, hence, leading to drugs&rsquo; lower side-effects. The reactions in Schemes 1 and 2 are catalytic, so that a small amount of catalyst allows to carry out the whole transformation.</p>\n<p>Some other reactions discovered by the Vedernikov&rsquo;s team are not catalytic yet but, hopefully, may serve as individual key steps of catalytic transformations of methane, the main component of natural gas, to produce value-added CH<sub>3</sub>-X &ndash; type compounds in the presence of specifically designed Pt catalysts. In particular, the individual reaction steps that were studied in this project involved Na<sub>2</sub>[Pt<sup>IV</sup>CH<sub>3</sub>Cl<sub>5</sub>] salt that is known to result from reaction of Pt(II) compounds with methane and suitable oxidants. In Scheme 3, Na<sub>2</sub>[Pt<sup>IV</sup>CH<sub>3</sub>Cl<sub>5</sub>] (<strong>3</strong>) solutions react with various amines to form derived methylammonium ions (X = ArN<sup>+</sup>Me<sub>2</sub>, pyridine<sup>+</sup>). Other reactions that were developed included newly designed Pt<sup>II</sup>CH<sub>3</sub> complexes such as <strong>4</strong> that are able to react with O<sub>2</sub> to form Pt<sup>IV</sup>CH<sub>3</sub> derivatives; the latter then react with water (X = OH) in aqueous CF<sub>3</sub>COOH solutions to afford CH<sub>3</sub>-X &ndash; type products (Scheme 4; X = OH, O<sub>2</sub>CCF<sub>3</sub>). The reactions in Scheme 4 can be viewed as &ldquo;green&rdquo; since they utilize O<sub>2</sub> as the only oxidant so allowing to achieve an overall methane &ndash; to &ndash; CH<sub>3</sub>-X transformation according to a net reaction equation: CH<sub>4</sub>&nbsp; +&nbsp; HX&nbsp; +&nbsp; 0.5O<sub>2</sub>&nbsp; --&gt;&nbsp; CH<sub>3</sub>-X&nbsp; +&nbsp; H<sub>2</sub>O.</p>\n<p>The key approach used in the Professor Vedernikov group when developing novel catalytic reactions is to perform a detailed mechanistic analysis of each of their steps and use this mechanistic understanding to attain desirable reactivity. In particular, the use of novel sulfonated CNN-pincer ligands in Scheme 4 allowed to control the reactivity of a Pt center in both a Pt<sup>II</sup>&#8209;CH<sub>3</sub> &ndash; to &ndash; Pt<sup>IV</sup>CH<sub>3</sub> oxidation with O<sub>2</sub> and subsequent formation of CH<sub>3</sub>-X products in the reaction of Pt<sup>IV</sup>CH<sub>3</sub> species with suitable donors of X. The use of theoretical (DFT) calculations helps drive the reaction discovery and achieve a detailed mechanistic characterization of the reactions.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The research results originating from this NSF-funded project have been presented at several National and international venues: National ACS Meetings (2018, 2021, 2022), Tel Aviv University, Israel (2022).</p>\n<p>Since 2010, Professor Andrei Vedernikov and his graduate students have been the active supporters of the Project SEED administered by the American Chemical Society for economically disadvantaged high school students.
