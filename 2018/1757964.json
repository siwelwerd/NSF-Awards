 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project extends the BigDataX program, a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT) and the University of Chicago (UChicago). The BigDataX site focuses on undergraduate research in both the theory and practice of big data computing at extreme scales. BigDataX includes a diverse group of 10 undergraduate students, who will conduct research over a 10 week period, in the area of big data and how it will impact the design, analysis, and implementation of run-time systems and storage systems to support big data applications. This research will make extreme scale computing more tractable, touching every branch of computing in high-end computing and datacenters. These advancements will impact scientific discovery and economic development at the national level, and they will strengthen a wide range of research activities enabling efficient access, processing, storage, and sharing of valuable scientific data from many disciplines. The proposed work will place students in the middle of a technological revolution which will revolutionize the computing domain. \r\n\r\nThe primary objective of this proposal is to promote a data-centric view of scientific and technical computing, at the intersection of distributed systems theory and practice. This proposal includes 6 mentors, with a variety of complementing expertise from theory to systems, distributed systems, storage management, and data science. The mentors have extensive experience in mentoring undergraduate students, collectively having worked with over one hundred students in research activities, publishing dozens peer-reviewed workshop/conference/journal papers at top venues together with undergraduate students. The students that will be part of the BigDataX program will be exposed to big data applications, large data sets, and various distributed systems such as the Mystic reconfigurable testbed at IIT, Chameleon cloud and Theta supercomputer at Argonne National Laboratory, the XSEDE national cyberinfrastructure, and the Amazon Web Services cloud.",

This work included a comprehensive educational plan integrating 30 undergraduate students with senior PhD students with incremental manageable goals, aimed at allowing undergraduate students to achieve publishable results within the ten-week summer program. The REU students were immersed in a thriving research laboratory that has a large number of other students from high-school, undergraduate, master, and PhD students participating in funded research work related to big data and distributed systems in one of two interdisciplinary laboratories: 1) the DataSys Lab at Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT) or 2) Globus Labs at University of Chicago. The PIs aimed to recruit most of the students from outside of the host institutions (only 1 of the 30 students was from IIT), focusing on recruiting students from institutions without research opportunities as well as women and minorities; as a result.</p>\n<p>This REU program hosted 30 students from 2018?2021, which produced 9 publications, which included 11 students (36% of REU students), and 10 students attended conferences (33% of REU students). We want to highlight that 10 of the 30 students have attended at least one major conference, with some having attended multiple; all these students? travel were either funded by this REU award or by student travel grants that the students/mentored applied for.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We were fortunate to have multiple REU students win prestigious undergraduate research awards in every single year of our program. These students competed through their poster presentations, followed by oral presentations, and a question &amp; answer session from an audience of one hundred people. They emerged victorious from hundreds of undergraduate research student submissions each year. In 2018, Luann Jung &amp; Brendan Whitaker won 1st place in the ACM Undergraduate Student Research Competition (SRC) at IEEE/ACM Supercomputing/SC 2018 conference for their work on ?Measuring Swampiness: Quantifying Chaos in Large Heterogeneous Data Repositories?. In 2019, Kathryn Leung won 2nd place in the ACM Undergraduate SRC at IEEE/ACM SC?19 conference for her work on ?Walking the cost-accuracy tightrope: balancing trade-offs in data-intensive genomics\". In 2021, Kevin Gao won 3rd place in the ACM Undergraduate SRC at IEEE/ACM SC?21 conference for his work on ?Regulating Traffic in a Crowded Cache: Overcoming the Container Explosion Problem\".&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The program was comprised of 30 students (16 were women, 5 were minorities, 6 were from institutions without research programs, and 9 were first-generation college students). The BigDataX cohort was enhanced through alternative sources of funding which increased the average cohort size from 10 undergraduate students per summer to about 20 students per summer, for a total of 62 students participating in summer research in the past 3 summers funded by this award. The program received 317 applications, of which 23% were female and 22% minorities. 20% were 1st generation college students, and 43% had applied from primarily teaching only institutions. The average GPA was approximately 3.7/4.0. The program had an overall 9% acceptance rate.

We accepted a representative number of 1st generation college students, from teaching only institutions, and with good GPAs.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Every year, we conduct a yearly survey to find out where all the past REU students are in their academic careers, or careers in general. The response rates of these surveys is not great, with about 50% of the students responding, although this last year were able to account for 84% of the REU students. Unsurprisingly, we found that some of the students (18%) are still working on their undergraduate degrees. And of those who did complete their undergraduate degrees, there was a 2:1 ratio between those who took jobs in industry compared to those who continued to graduate school. 36% decided on continuing their education with a masters degree, while 27% decided to continue to a doctorate program (one of whom has joined PI Chard?s group).</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified:
