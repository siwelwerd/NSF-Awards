 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-technical: \r\nSensing of gas-phase compounds is essential for monitoring industrial processes, detecting military and security threats, ensuring air quality, and, most recently, aids medical diagnosis. Small, unobtrusive, and low-cost sensors can be deployed throughout an area or a building and incorporated into wearable electronics. Organic semiconductors (OSCs) are attractive for use in vapor sensors as they can be incorporated into simple devices such as resistors or transistors and are compatible with mechanically flexible substrates and low-cost fabrication processes. The chemical properties of OSCs can be tuned to optimize the response to target gases and control the electronic responses of sensors. One major drawback of OSC-based sensors is the tendency of the output current or voltage to drift over time due to environmental effects such as temperature and humidity or in response to non-target gases (interferents). This project will use chemically stable OSCs and employ them in circuit layouts that minimize the influence of interferents and environmental effects. Progress will be made by combining material synthesis with device fabrication and simulation of devices and circuits. Circuits will be developed that preserve sensitivity while minimizing environmental drift; arrays of these circuits will provide increased selectivity. The project will include multiple outreach efforts. Computer modeling opportunities will be offered to undergraduate and high school students from the underserved Appalachian region anchored by Frostburg State University. A related class will be developed and a summer camp for high school students will be held at Frostburg State University. High school interns will be recruited to Johns Hopkins University from a local high school that serves an underrepresented community. \r\n\r\nTechnical: \r\nSensing of gas-phase compounds is essential for monitoring industrial processes, detecting military and security threats, ensuring air quality, and most recently as a tool in medical diagnosis. The smallest, least intrusive, and lowest cost options can be used for widespread deployment throughout a building or geographic zone or incorporated into wearable electronics. Organic semiconductors (OSCs), including molecules and polymers, have multiple advantages for vapor sensors, as they are compatible with simple sensing circuitry, mechanically flexible substrates, and low-cost fabrication processes. They also have well understood chemical tunability and interactions with gaseous analytes for optimal design and control of the electronic responses to the analytes. They may be incorporated into simple resistive devices, or organic field-effect transistors for cascading in logic circuits. One major drawback of OSC-based sensors is the tendency of the output current or voltage to drift over time, related to their responsiveness to interferents and environmental perturbations, such as humidity and temperature change. This proposal will demonstrate the advantages to be gained by using OSCs with greater chemical stability and employing them in circuit layouts that minimize the influence of interferents and make the responses to analytes more pronounced. Progress will be made by combined efforts in material and device fabrication and in simulation of devices and circuits. The combined material sensitivity to analytes and stability against environmental influences will be optimized. Circuits will be developed that preserve analyte signaling while minimizing the environmental drift. Arrays of these circuits will provide increased selectivity. This work will provide an enabling solution to performance requirements for the adoption of OSC-based sensors in commercial technologies. Electronic device simulation opportunities will be offered to undergraduate and high school students from the underserved Appalachian region anchored by Frostburg State University. Undergraduate students will learn semiconductor device physics, develop computer programming skills, and learn modern device simulation software. High school interns will be recruited to Johns Hopkins University from predominantly female-minority Western High School in Baltimore City.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThere are many situations in which it is important to know the composition of a mixture of gases.  Some examples are knowing whether it is safe to breathe air in a certain enviornment, whether air being breathed out by a person indicates a health issue, or whether an industrial process that produces or emits gases is proceeding correctly.  The detection and measurement of gas quantities requires several features in the equipment being used.  The equpment needs to provide a signal when it detects gases that are of interest to the user (have sufficient sensitivity) and that are in the expected concentration range. That signal needs to be specific for the gas of interest and not falsely indicate the presence of a different gas that is not relevant to the intended measurement.   The equipment must stay stable during the time that gases are being measured. The active component in gas detection equipment is called a sensor.   The most convenient way that a sensor can provide a signal is to have it change an electrical property (for example, the voltage or the resistance) in the presence of the gas of interest.\n\nIntellectual merit.  The materials that respond to gases in sensors are often mineral-like materials.  They have the advantage of being stable and sensitive, but not necessarily selective.  This project explored an alternative technology in which the sensor materials are made from large molecules related to plastics, called polymers because they have large numbers of molecular units that are assembled in chains.  The polymers have molecular structures that interact differently with different gases so their selectivity can be adjusted. \n\nIn the past, these molecules have not been sufficiently stable.  This project explored  the use of new polymers made from molecular units that are more stable than those used before.  The polymers were used in circuits that decreased the amount of signal change when the sensor was not exposed to a gas of interest, increasing the stability of the sensor and the time during which it could provide a recognizable signal of a gas of interest.  The project also introduced new polymers that interact with gases in different ways, to add selectivity.  The selectivity was further improved by studying the responses of a group of sensors made from different new polymers and analyzing the combination of their responses to gases.  Even though it may not have been possible to identify which gas would have caused an individual material response,  it was possible to be highly confident about which gas would have caused a certain combination of responses. \n\nThere were many innovations from this project, including the design of the molecular structures of the materials to recognize certain gases more than others, ways to connect the materials in sensor circuits so the undesired signals that would be produced by the ordinary environment were made as small as possible, and the use of probability and statistics calculations to increase the confidence that the correct gas was being identified.  New details were identified about how the gas interaction with the sensor produces changes in voltage and resistance, and how a prior measurement could affect a new measurement by the same sensor.  This was done by a combination of experimental work and computer simulation of how the sensor can operate.  The computer simulation used the principles for ordinary silicon chip devices and applied them in a new way to the polymer sensors of this project.\n\nBroader impacts.  The project focused on identifying three gases, nitrogen dioxide, ammonia, and acetone, that can be air pollutants from transportation, industry, and household activities.  Ammonia and acetone can also indicate health issues if they are breathed out at certain concentrations.   The project increased the options for making sensors to produce alarms about toxic or dangerous atmospheres or help diagnose medical disorders.  The computational work opened up new possibilities for how sensor circuits can be designed without needing to make the effort of producting a large variety of sensors in an experimental laboratory.  Students at many educational levels from high school to post-Ph.D,, including some from underrepresented groups in science and engineering, had the opportunity to learn about and contribute to this project.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/14/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Howard E Katz"
