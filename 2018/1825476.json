 "awd_abstract_narration": "Due to their fractal nature, nanofibrillated dendritic polymer particles have enormously increased surface area compared to regularly shaped nanoparticles. These particles exhibit high adhesive or \"sticking\" behavior. Their functional uses are in coatings, gels, textiles, nonwovens, personal care, agricultural and biomedical products. This award introduces a new nanomanufacturing method, where a multitude of polymers used in industrial and consumer products are converted into this novel nanomaterial. The introduction of processes for efficient manufacturing of nanofibrillated polymer particles could have a transformative impact on the fabrication of numerous high-volume and high-value products made by large and mid-sized U.S. companies. The introduction of such a capability to manufacture advanced polymer nanomaterials greatly impacts the nation's prosperity, health and security. The novel nanomanufacturing process involves turbulent liquid shear and is simple, efficient, and scalable. This project develops fundamental understanding of the complex mechanisms of nanofibrillar polymer materials formation under turbulent liquid shear and provides the scientific basis for their large-scale continuous manufacturing. The project also serves as grounds for nanofabrication and innovation training of graduate and undergraduate students. It fosters student entrepreneurship and soft skills in an exciting environment combining innovative science, manufacturing technology and industrial collaborations. Related hands-on experiments provide the basis for visually impressive undergraduate projects and enable numerous science outreach activities.\r\n\r\nThe new process for making of dendritic particles by polymer precipitation under shear is simple and versatile. However, it poses many fundamental scientific challenges. The complexity of the process of multiphasic polymer precipitation requires systematic experimentation and characterization, supported through modeling.  The comprehensive research plan includes two complementary thrusts. The first thrust generates understanding of the physical mechanisms by which polymer precipitation in turbulent liquid flow leads to the formation of the dendritic particles. The team elucidates the role of interfacial mass transport, solvent-solvent and solvent-polymer interactions, polymer precipitation rates, and turbulent liquid shear rates on the morphology of the precipitated nanofibrillated particles. The second thrust applies these fundamental insights to design and test efficient and scalable nanomanufacturing processes. The research and process modelling enable controlled scalable fabrication of dendritic nanofibrillar particles at present, and potentially of numerous other polymeric nanomaterials, including nanosheets, nanoribbons and nanorods, in the future. Overall, the liquid-based shear nanomanufacturing can become a platform technology for efficient manufacturing of polymeric nanomaterials with extraordinary properties.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The results prove that the new technology can be used for manufacturing of numerous novel (bio)polymer morphologies with high tunability, efficiency, and scalability. The research activities included interpreting the role of interfacial mass transport, solvent-solvent and solvent-polymer interactions, polymer precipitation rate, and laminar to turbulent liquid shear flows on the morphology of the precipitated polymer nanomaterials. By characterizing and analyzing the mechanisms of nanomaterial fabrication, the team gained knowledge on the process fundamentals that enable scalable manufacturing of soft nanomaterials. These insights allowed the team to achieve the manufacture of many key polymer materials morphologies including spherical particles, rods, fibers, ribbons, and sheets by gaining insight into the interplay of these experimental parameters. These results prove that the team has achieved highly tunable and scalable nanomanufacturing processes. Concurrently, the studies on the dendricolloids identified their unique characteristics and high value to a number of industries. Since the morphology of these polymeric micro- and nanostructures is critical for their applications, it allows us to obtain new polymer functionalities by simply controlling structure instead of polymer chemistry. The data show that the soft dendritic polymer colloids have many extraordinary properties, including ultra-high adhesivity (&ldquo;gecko leg effect&rdquo;), formation of superhydrophobic, superhydrophilic and icephobic coatings, gelation of any liquid at very small volume fraction and formation of nonwoven materials with high cohesivity. The results also showed that the dendricolloids have great potential as &ldquo;micro-cleaners&rdquo; of microplastics and oil spills in water, this addressing a major societal problem. Finally, the team showed that the soft dendritic colloids can find application in advanced separators for Li-ion batteries. The project provided ground for training in nanofabrication, product design, and entrepreneurship of five Ph.D. students (three of whom have graduated), three MS students, and three undergraduate researchers. This project also contributed to the vibrant outreach activity of the group of the PI by providing opportunities for three senior design projects and enabling hands-on experiments for microplastic remediation at Science House Summer camps.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 03/06/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Orlin&nbsp;D&nbsp;Velev</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1825476/1825476_10567490_1676869069099_SDC_Confocal_image_Velev_1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1825476/1825476_10567490_1676869069099_SDC_Confocal_image_Velev_1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Soft Dendritic Colloids Micrograph\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1825476/1825476_10567490_1676869069099_SDC_Confocal_image_Velev_1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Soft Dendritic Colloids Micrograph\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Confocal fluorescence microscopy image of the structure of the new class of hierarchical polymer structures named soft dendritic colloids developed to nanomanufacturing level in this project.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Orlin Velev research group</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Orlin&nbsp;D&nbsp;Velev</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Soft Dendritic Colloids Micrograph</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1825476/1825476_10567490_1676869215773_SDC_applications_Velev_2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1825476/1825476_10567490_1676869215773_SDC_applications_Velev_2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"SDC Applications Summary\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1825476/1825476_10567490_1676869215773_SDC_applications_Velev_2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"SDC Applications Summary\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Summary of some of the major areas of application of the soft dendritic colloids which were manufactured as a result of this research.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Orlin D Velev research group</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Orlin&nbsp;D&nbsp;Velev</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">SDC Applications Summary</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1825476/1825476_10567490_1676869367232_Big_picture_Velev_3--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1825476/1825476_10567490_1676869367232_Big_picture_Velev_3--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Summary of the liquid nanofabrication outcomes\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1825476/1825476_10567490_1676869367232_Big_picture_Velev_3--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Summary of the liquid nanofabrication outcomes\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Summary of the rich variety of morphologies that have been produced by analyzing and adjusting the role of the liquid-liquid nanofabrication process parameters.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Orlin D Velev research group</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Orlin&nbsp;D&nbsp;Velev</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Summary of the liquid nanofabrication outcomes</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1825476/1825476_10567490_1676869552477_Superhydrophobic_coating_Velev_4--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1825476/1825476_10567490_1676869552477_Superhydrophobic_coating_Velev_4--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"SDC Superhydrophobic Coating\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1825476/1825476_10567490_1676869552477_Superhydrophobic_coating_Velev_4--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"SDC Superhydrophobic Coating\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Artist\ufffds image fused with experimental micrograph of water droplets being repelled by the superhydrophobic coating made by producing and depositing SDCs from polystyrene.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Orlin D Velev research group</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Orlin&nbsp;D&nbsp;Velev</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">SDC Superhydrophobic Coating</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
