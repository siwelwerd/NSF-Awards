 "awd_abstract_narration": "This  award develops knowledge required to design cutting tools and select flow parameters for minimum quantity lubrication (MQL) machining. MQL is known for its advantages of significant reduction in water waste, energy use, and overall costs as compared to traditional wet processes. This research project will investigate the science behind MQL machining and rapidly implement the results into production-level operations through the collaboration with Ford Motor Company. Since the project has broad applicability to automotive, aerospace, electronics and defense industries, it directly and positively impacts American economic welfare and national security. Additionally, the project includes plans for hands-on training and research experience on advanced machining processes for undergraduate students via course integration, summer internship, and Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) programs. By leveraging an on-going Research Experience for Teachers (RET) program at Texas A&M, this project also includes outreach activities to high schools on design of modern cutting tools to promote STEM field. The close collaboration with the industrial partner also provides a unique environment to align these plans with the needs in the manufacturing industry.\r\n\r\nThis research incorporates experimental and numerical approaches that address the fundamental science of minimum quantity lubrication. Drilling is the target process as it is common in manufacturing, whereas drilling is complex and cannot be observed visually. The project has three main objectives: Objective 1 characterizes the flow out of internal channels based on geometrical, system, and machining parameters. An MQL flow testbed will be used to emulate the mist flow in machining and allow visual access to the cutting zone with a high-speed camera. Objective 2 addresses interactions between flow structure and drill-workpiece motion and thus will predict the fluid coverage on the tool edges and faces. The flow test results will be compared with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) using both single- and dual-phase flow analyses.  Objective 3 will determine the effects of mist flow on drilling performance, including torque, thrust force, built-up edge, and wear, on production systems at the Ford AME MQL laboratory. The knowledge generated will enable MQL-specific tool design and selection, adaptive MQL systems, and process development. The broader impacts include improved MQL implementation in the manufacturing industry and collaborative activities between the industry and academia for the workforce development.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This technology can save water waste and associated energy consumption by 20% or more. MQL has been implemented for decades with advanced equipment and machines and had many successful examples. However, it is challenging when lubrication becomes less, but the cutting tools are not adequately designed for it. Drilling is one of the most sensitive processes to MQL because of its closed-form configuration, where the oil flow can hardly reach the cutting area. Improper MQL supply can lead to tool failure and workpiece damage. For this, this project partnered with Ford, the largest MQL user in North America, to look into a fundamental question: How do the through-tool channel geometry and drill spinning affect the oil flow? This project contained three main tasks: flow visualization, simulation of the flow, and flow-tool-workpiece interactions. On flow visualization, a computer tomography (CT) method was developed to reconstruct the oil distribution in the flow and found non-uniform distributions due to channel geometry and helical angle. The computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation unveiled the two-phase behavior of the flow (i.e., oil droplets in the air) and showed that larger droplets (5 micrometers and larger) escape from the flow stream and collide with the channel wall in the spiral and spinning channel. This phenomenon explained the non-uniformity of the flow. Lastly, a uniquely designed lab-scale drilling platform was developed to directly monitor the flow at the drilling interface using a high-speed camera. The experiment confirmed the simulation that the oil flow could hardly reach and cover the entire cutting edge of a drill; proper drill channel design or MQL configuration are necessary. These findings are important to industrial MQL users and tool designers as they continue to develop new products. On the other hand, this project also raises awareness of sustainability issues in the manufacturing industry and the benefits of working with academia on the fundamental aspects, especially since industry decarbonization is becoming a top priority nationwide.

Technical skills and techniques developed throughout the project were also shared with students through REU programs, PI-led courses, and independent studies to prepare them for the future manufacturing workforce.
