 "awd_abstract_narration": "Murder is the most serious criminal offense, and murder sentencing entails the most consequential punishment decisions in society.  There has been long-standing concern about disparity in these most consequential decisions, most prominently, disparity based on the race/ethnicity and gender of defendants and victims.  In addition, differences in case outcomes related to legal representation raise issues of adequate and fair representation for indigent defendants.  Variation between locales in punishment outcomes are also central to a major recent direction of social science research; how discretion in the criminal justice system is shaped by larger socio-political environments.  This proposed research presents a unique opportunity to delve deeper into these important theoretical and criminal justice policy concerns.  This study's findings would be of interest across several disciplines, especially criminology/criminal justice studies, sociology, and legal studies.  For cases charged with first, second, or third degree murder, this proposed project will examine:  1) patterns of disparity in charging, conviction, and punishment outcomes related to defendant and victim race/ethnicity, victim gender and age, and type of defense representation; 2) between-county differences in murder case outcomes and patterns of disparity in relation to court sociopolitical contexts; and 3) qualitative differences between counties in their formal and informal norms shaping murder case processing, focusing on charging and plea bargaining, prosecutorial decisions to seek the death penalty and to retract the death penalty if sought, and sentencing decisions.\r\n\r\nThe project will compile statistical data from court and prosecutor files on cases charged with first, second, and third-degree murder in 18 Pennsylvania counties that account for 79% of the criminal homicide charges from 2000-2010.  These data will be used to examine individual-level differences in murder case processing outcomes, and between-county differences in murder case outcomes relative to court sociopolitical contextual features.  Analyses will focus on the following dependent variables:  charging decisions, mode of conviction (conviction or not, and conviction by guilty plea or trial), and sentence.  For first degree murder charges, analyses will examine whether prosecutors seek the death penalty and whether they retract that filing, and whether defendants receive the death penalty.  Three classes of statistical models will be estimated:  1) propensity score weighting and/or matching models to examine individual-level differences between groupings of defendants; 2) inverse propensity score weighted regression (IPSWR) models to examine between-county differences in individual-level outcomes on the dependent variables above; and 3) hierarchical logistic and linear models to examine the effects of county contextual variables on the dependent variables.  In addition, open-ended, in-depth interview data will be collected to examine qualitative differences between counties in their formal and informal norms, policies, and practices shaping their murder charging, conviction processes (especially plea bargaining), prosecutorial decisions to seek the death penalty and to retract the death penalty if it is sought, and sentencing decisions.  Forty to fifty individuals will be interviewed in the five counties with the most criminal homicide cases; interviews will include judges, prosecutors, public defenders, and private defense attorneys.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThe goals of our project were to study broader discretionary decisions by prosecutors and courts in homicide cases, and how they may be shaped by local contexts.\n\n\n1) We examined in more depth the discretionary decisions of prosecutors, judges, and juries in first degree murder conviction cases, including examinations of how race and gender of victim affects prosecutorial and court death penalty decisions. \n\n\n2) We examined patterns of disparity in overall murder case processing for a larger group of cases and counties.We compiled data not only on first degree murder convictions, but also on cases charged with second and third degree murder. \n\n\n3) We used these data to examine between-county differences in murder case outcomes relative to court and prosecutors' office organizational contexts. \n\n\n4) We collected qualitative interview data and examined differences between counties in their formal and informal norms and practices shaping their murder case processing, with a focus on conviction processes (namely plea bargaining), prosecutorial decisions to seek the death penalty and to retract the death penalty if it is sought, and sentencing decisions.\n\n\nThe major findings of our research are as follows.\n\n\nFirst, we did not find that black defendants, or black defendants who kill white victims specifically, were more likely to have the death penalty sought or imposed. Instead, we find that those who killed white victims, regardless of defendant race, were more likely to receive the death penalty. We further found that black defendants, and blacks who killed black victims, were more likely to have a death filing retracted by prosecutors. Finally, patterns of death penalty race disparity varied greatly depending on the county in which a case was prosecuted and sentenced.\n\n\nSecond, research has inquired into the effects of defendant race, and to a lesser extent victim race in capital punishment. However, there is much less research on how victim gender influences capital punishment decisions, and even less research on how victim gender and race might influence such decisions. We examined the role of victim gender and race in: prosecutors decisions to seek the death penalty, prosecutors decisions to retract death filings, and jury or judge decisions to sentence defendants to the death penalty. We found that the gender and race of victims conditioned each of the death penalty outcomes. In addition, whether the victim had children conditioned the effects of victim gender/race. We did not find that defendants who killed women victims, or white women victims, were more likely to have the death penalty sought or imposed. Instead, cases with white male victims, especially those with children, were the most likely to see a death penalty filing and sentence. Cases with black women victims were the least likely to have a death sentence imposed.\n\n\nThird, analyses demonstrated large differences between counties in prosecutorial decisions to seek the death penalty, and to retract those filings. We also found differences in the likelihood of defendants being sentenced to death across counties. Little evidence exists that county partisan composition accounts for differences between counties in death penalty outcomes, and some limited evidence points to county size as a factor that shapes death penalty outcomes. Overall, however, results point to the idiosyncrasy of specific counties in their likelihood of exposing and sentencing defendants to the death penalty.\n\n\nFourth, prosecutors offices also vary in their propensity to reduce death-eligible charges to second or third degree murder through plea bargaining. Furthermore, data from DAs Office case files from two time periods show that local prosecutors react quite differently to the factual presence of specific statutory aggravators. Our interview data from DAs and their assistants in five counties illuminate how local prosecutors interpret death penalty law, in four ways. First, they interpreted the meaning of specific aggravators. That is, prosecutors exercised judgement in determining what counts as an instance of an aggravator and what does not. Second, prosecutors were concerned with downstream strategic considerations and anticipated social interactions around proving specific aggravators to juries. Furthermore, these strategic considerations were the site of negotiations with defense attorneys. Third, prosecutors evaluated whether it was appropriate to file aggravation on a case-by-case basis. DAs Offices differed in the influence that social interactions with victims families had, and how these influenced decisions to seek the death penalty. Crucially, prosecutors also evaluated the moral value of victims, and they differed in how they did so. The characteristics and perceived moral worth of victims conditioned negotiations with defense attorneys as well. Fourth, prosecutors evaluated the legal value of the statutory aggravators themselves. The DAs interviewed had definite opinions on the value of different aggravators, typically referring to some as strong and others as weak. Variations in their opinions of the statutory aggravators as strong or weak directly translates into between-county variation in the filing of those aggravators.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/16/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: JefferyTUlmer\n"
