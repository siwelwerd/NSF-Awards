 "awd_abstract_narration": "A temporary organization refers to a set of organizational actors working together on a complex task over a limited period of time. As the world has become more dynamic and interconnected, temporary organizations have been increasingly employed across diverse industries like construction, film-making, shipbuilding, software development, advertising, biotechnology, and fashion. Yet despite their increased prevalence, temporary organizations are struggling to foster and maintain coherent social norms. As opposed to traditional, long-term organizations, most members of temporary organizations possess different organizational backgrounds and a relatively short tenure. This project will investigate how employees' behaviors can be better aligned with desirable social norms through the reconciliation of multiple foci of organizational identifications in temporary organizations. The researchers will use construction workers' safety behavior as a case study of employee behavior in a temporary organization. The construction industry provides a particularly useful site for inquiry due to its central role in our economy, its wide use of temporary organizations, its status as among the most dangerous industries in the world, and the pervasiveness of accidents caused by workers' unsafe behaviors.\r\n\r\nThe project will extend theories on temporary organizations and organizational identification by characterizing the mechanisms through which desirable social norms are translated into organizational members' behaviors with the help of organizational identification. The project will incorporate diverse empirical data collection methods (e.g., survey, behavioral economic experiment, and behavior sampling) and analyses to investigate the role of multiple organizational backgrounds and social norms in shaping employee behavior in a temporary organization. In addition, working with the industry partners, the researchers will conduct quasi-field experiments to develop and test a series of one-time, short-term managerial training that can promote employees' social identification with the umbrella organization and ultimately to elicit desired changes in improving employees' behavior. The results will greatly contribute to the advancement of social identity theory and organization studies. Further, by identifying effective managerial actions/strategies to increase workers' project identification, the project will contribute to the development of organizational actions/strategies that can overcome heterogeneous organizational backgrounds and short tenure issues in a temporary organization, which will eventually improve employee behaviors like safety. Finally, this project will provide career development opportunities for diverse groups of students. The effective education of students and professionals for social influence-based management approaches will increase the competitiveness of U.S industries.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Given that employees&rsquo; behaviors are influenced by how others think and behave (i.e., social influence), establishing positive social norms and group identity is critical for facilitating the internalization of organizational values. Researchers have found social influence theory (SIT) to be a useful theoretical ground for explaining how social influence occurs and affects individuals&rsquo; behaviors in organizational contexts&mdash;knowledge which has brought useful, practical insights to many organizations. However, most research was conducted with long-term organizations and assumes that interactions between individuals and organizations are stable and continuous. Resultingly, there is a notable paucity of studies investigating the role of social norms and organizational identification in temporary organizations despite the prevalence of temporary organizations in many industries (e.g., construction, oil and gas, software, management consulting, and film production). Therefore, it is imperative to understand how social norms and organizational identification affect employees&rsquo; behavior in &nbsp;temporary organizations.</p>\n<p class=\"Body\">Based on an in-depth literature review and preliminary studies, we identified three major specific knowledge gaps. First, previous studies do not consider the mix of heterogeneous social norms in temporary organizations. Particularly, coexistence of different organizational backgrounds in temporary organizations (e.g., trades in construction projects and managers/workers) may cause inconsistencies in social norms between workgroups (e.g., manager vs. workers) but has not been studied well in the literature. Second, there is limited understanding about organizational identification in temporary organizations. Specifically, current literature too heavily focuses on organizations&rsquo; cognitive aspects. In contrast, social identity scholars have developed&nbsp; comprehensive conceptualizations of social identification including affective, evaluative, and behavioral dimensions. Third, there has been less attention on practical guidance for promoting organizational identification among temporary workers. As a result, there is a lack of empirically grounded practical guidance for how organizations may intervene when employees&rsquo; tenures are relatively short and continuous interactions may not be possible. To fill these knowledge gaps, we proposed and empirically validated a theoretical model of organizational identification under short-term tenure and for multiple employee backgrounds. In addition, we developed and tested a one-time, short-term intervention that can effectively improve these employees&rsquo; organizational identification via quasi-field experiments. In this research, we focused on a construction project because it is a representative example with a large portion of temporary workers from different backgrounds (e.g., trades, manager/worker, and subcontractors).

The significant findings are fourfold. First, the multi-dimensional model of project identification allows for comprehensive conceptualization of organizational identification in project-based organizations. Specifically, we identified and validated various antecedents and consequences of project identification. The antecedents include five latent variables under two major categories: transformational leadership, perceived organizational support, communication climate (management factors), and project distinctiveness and perceived organizational prestige (project factors).

Our findings extend theories on organizational identification by proposing and empirically validating the comprehensive conceptualization of project identification.

From a managerial perspective, a project could be part of a department in one&rsquo;s company which is a long-term organization. Construction workers, however, may not work with the same general contractor on a future project, and thus construction workers could have difficulty perceiving a long-term relationship with their current project. Particularly, we found significant differences in the affective dimension of project identity, which implies that there is much room to improve the affective dimension of workers' project identity compared to other dimensions (e.g., cognitive and evaluative). Third, project identification has an important mediating role in promoting safety compliance and participation. Knowledge of the mediation effect is significant because it explains psychological dynamics through which project (e.g., project distinctiveness) and management factors (e.g., transformational leadership and communication climate) influence safety behaviors (i.e., safety compliance and safety participation) and reduce occupational accidents at construction sites.
