 "awd_abstract_narration": "Proof-of-work (PoW) is an economic tool used to deter network attacks by requiring participants to perform verifiable work, typically by solving computational puzzles. Unfortunately, there is a significant barrier impeding wide-spread applicability: PoW is expensive. This project aims to significantly reduce the cost of PoW schemes, and thereby broaden their utility.  Our general model concerns a distributed system consisting of good and bad identifiers (IDs).  The good IDs have two goals: (1) ensure fair sharing of a limited resource; and (2) securely perform distributed computations.  The bad IDs are controlled by an attacker who possesses a constant fraction of the computational resources, and tries to subvert these goals. An important security objective is to develop mechanisms that preserve these goals while incurring bandwidth and computational costs that scale with the magnitude of an attack. That is, when there is no attack, costs are low; conversely, when there is an attack, the good IDs' cost grows commensurately with the attacker's cost.  \r\n\r\nThis project focuses on the design of distributed algorithms for: (i) tolerating large attacks while having good IDs spend asymptotically less than the attacker; (ii) handling a setting where participants are selfish but rational; and (iii) designing fast and robust diffuse protocols via attack-resistant overlays with low state and bandwidth costs. The project provides research experience for undergraduate and underrepresented students, incorporates state-of-the-art results into course development, and establishes a workshop venue for cybersecurity researchers to share their findings.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\n\nAll key research outcomes of this project are algorithms that defend distributed networks in such a way that the defender uses asymptotically no more resources than the attacker.  Such algorithms are called \"resource-competitive\".   Specific resource-competitive algorithms designed in this project are three-fold.  \n\nFirst, we designed the first resource-competitive algorithms to solve the celebrated Byzantine agreement, leader election and committee election in the challenging dynamic network model where nodes' names are not known a priori.  Our algorithms are resource-competitive in the sense that the number of messages sent by the nodes following the protocol grows only linearly with the number of messages sent by an attacker.  Results on these algorithms were published in the paper \"Scalable and Secure Computation Among Strangers: Resource-Competitive Byzantine Protocols\", which was accepted to the prestigious DISC conference in 2020.\n\n\nThe second main resource-competitive algorithm we designed defends against the Sybil attack.  The Sybil attack problem assumes an adversary has a minority of the computational power in the system, but is attempting to attack the network by creating a majority of fake IDs.  Our algorithm ensures that (1) the adversary always only controls a minority of the IDs in the network; and (2) that the resources consumed by the good IDs is always O(sqrt(BJ) + J) where B is the resources consumed by the attacker and J is the join rate of good IDs.  Thus, when the adversary spends a significant amount - i.e. B is large - the good IDs spend asymptotically less than the adversary. Results on this algorithm were published in the paper \"Bankrupting Sybil Despite Churn\", which was accepted to the prestigious ICDCS conference in 2021. \n\nThe final resource-competitive algorithm from this project addresses the problem of distributed denial of service attacks or DDOS.  These attacks occur when an adversary creates a large number of jobs for a server in an attempt to monopolize the resources of the server, so that good clients are not able to access the server's resources.  We designed an algorithm to defend against such attacks that makes use of an \"estimator\" which provides a - possibly inaccurate - estimate of the number of good jobs in any given window of time.  This estimator incorporates the idea of using machine learning within a defense system.  Our defense algorithm has a resource cost that grows slowly with both the amount spent by an attacker, and also the inaccuracy of the estimator.  Notably, our algorithm does not require any a priori information about the accuracy of the estimator.   A paper on these results is currently being written up and will soon be under submission.\n\nBroader impact of this research included two major thrusts: education and research workshops.  First, in education, the award enabled funding two PhD students who have graduated: Diksha Gupta, currently at IBM Labs in Singapore; and Abhinav Aggarwahl, currently at Amazon Labs in Seattle; and one student, Abir Islam who has recently started the PhD program at UNM.   Additionally, analytic techniques used to achieve the research results were incorporated into one graduate class on algorithms,  and another class on Blockchains.\n\nSecond, two major workshops were organized under this award: a joint workshop with Sandia Labs that focused on Economics of Distributed Security; and a workshop colocated with the PODC conference that focused on security in Blockchain systems.  Both workshops were attended by between 30-50 researchers and graduate students, and included both invited, regular and \"lightning\" talks for students, as well as a round-table discussion.\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/29/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jared C Saia"
