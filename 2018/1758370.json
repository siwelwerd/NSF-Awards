 "awd_abstract_narration": "Future Urban STEM Educator (FUSE) is a Capacity Building Project at Davenport University (DU). FUSE will institute plans to increase the number of STEM students who pursue and become prepared for teaching urban youth. The main goal of the FUSE project is to create a STEM educator pipeline through DU's Certificate in Urban Education program. The project aims to produce a plan for increasing the enrollment and diversity of students pursuing STEM teaching careers within DU's computer science and biological laboratory science bachelor's degree programs. FUSE will accomplish this objective by (1) establishing new dual enrollment pathways for high school and community college students to enter DU's computer science and biological laboratory science degree programs on an accelerated schedule and at reduced cost; (2) creating future teacher clubs at diverse high schools that expand opportunities for high school students to participate in teaching experiences and develop an early interest in a STEM education career; (3) creating service-learning opportunities within the computer science and biological laboratory science programs that provide teaching experiences; and (4) developing a new education course and capstone internship experience to prepare computer science and biological laboratory science majors to enter STEM education and prepare for the Michigan Test for Teacher Certification. \r\n\r\nDU's College of Urban Education will collaborate with existing and new school partnerships (Hope Academy, Eaton Regional Education Service Agency, and Grand Rapids Community College). These partnerships will support the establishment of middle college and dual enrollment programs with a curricular focus on computer science and biological laboratory science. Additionally, service learning programming will be developed in partnership with the Expanded Learning Opportunities (ELO) network. ELO provides afterschool and summer programs for 67% of African-American children and 41% of Latino children within the project's geographic area. DU has campuses throughout Michigan's urban areas where shortages of STEM educators exist. FUSE will support the ability of the College of Urban Education to establish the partnerships and infrastructure necessary to implement a new STEM education pathway throughout the state. Students will benefit from the new curricular elements developed through the FUSE project, including a foundational teacher education course, education-based service learning, and a capstone internship experience in education. FUSE responds to the national call for change in STEM teacher preparation as well as Michigan's need for effective teachers to serve students in urban schools. Through the FUSE Capacity Building project, the College of Urban Education will have the potential to develop STEM teachers who can foster equity, creativity, and opportunity for urban youth.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
