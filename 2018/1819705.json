 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is through providing a sensitive, robust, room temperature operating magnetometer.  Magnetometers are among the most widely used instruments in a variety of applications including healthcare, transportation safety, food contamination monitoring, and homeland security. In fact, the growing need for magnetic field sensors manifests itself in the $1.6 billion global market with a fast-growing medical segment. As for today, the maximum sensitivity is provided by the Superconducting Quantum Interference Devices. The high sensitivity is critically important for medical applications.  However, this high sensitivity can be achieved in the superconducting devices only at cryogenic temperatures.  The proposed magnetometer based on spin wave interferometer combines high sensitivity with room temperature operation. This combination provides a great improvement in healthcare by reducing the cost of equipment, in transportation safety enhancement by providing more accurate traffic control, and in food safety monitoring by detecting small concentrations of heavy metals.  It will be of great benefit to society to have a magnetometer combining the high sensitivity of superconducting devices and room temperature operation.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the need for sensitive and room temperature operating magnetic field sensors by providing a magnetometer based on spin wave interferometer.  There are different types of magnetic sensors available on the market. As of today, the maximum sensitivity up to attoTesla is provided by the Superconducting Quantum Interference Devices. However, this high sensitivity can be achieved only at cryogenic temperatures. The latter makes superconducting magnetometers expensive and limits its practical application. The proposed magnetometer is based on spin wave interference and free of constraints inherent in superconducting devices. The research objectives encompass the development and demonstration of a compact, non-expensive magnetometer with up to attoTesla sensitivity operating in a temperature range from cryogenic to 560 K.  The outcomes of the proposed research will have an impact on commercial, defense and homeland security applications that need increasingly precise and robust magnetic sensors. The development of compact and high-sensitive magnetometer will be relevant to bio-sensing and bio-medical applications as well.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

It is a millimeter-size solid state device converted magnetic signals into voltage pulses, which can be further transmitted by regular Wi-Fi devices (e.g., smartphones). Such magnetometers are of great demand in a variety of biomedical applications including Magnetocardiography, which allows alerting the patient about the coming heart attack and provides valuable information for the treatment.</p>\n<p>The team has assembled and tested several prototypes as shown in Fig.1. All prototypes are based on Y<sub>3</sub>Fe<sub>2</sub>(FeO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub> (YIG) cross junction. This material was chosen due to its low spin wave damping and reliable room temperature operation. &nbsp;In order to verify the quality of the sensing element, the team has carried out a set of tests including magneto-optical Kerr-effect (MOKE) microscopy and Magnetic Force Microscope (MFM). The tests were conducted in the Nanoscale Science &amp; Engineering Nanofabrication Cleanroom facilities University of California - Riverside. &nbsp;The results of MOKE measurements of the YIG sensing element are shown in Fig.2. &nbsp;The multiple curves of different color show the Normalized Hysteresis Curves from the selected location of the sensing element. &nbsp;All tested YIG-based sensing elements have shown high uniformity which is critical for MSWI operation. Next, the team has carried out a set of tests of measurements aimed to verify MSWI sensitivity. &nbsp;In Fig.3., there are shown the output characteristics of MSWI along with the results of noise measurements. The transfer function of MSWI exceeds 5000V/T with the noise level of nV at room temperature. The team further increased MSWI sensitivity by applying the phase lock-in technique for periodic signal detection. In addition to the experimental tests, the team has developed a physical model of MSWI operation. The operation of the magnetometer has been simulated in different regimes. The results of numerical modeling are in good agreement with experimental data. &nbsp;&nbsp;Based on the obtained data, the sensitivity of MSWI is confirmed to exceed 100fT at room temperature, which is sufficient for heart rhythm monitoring.</p>\n<p>The BEAM-CA team spent a significant amount of time and efforts on product commercialization during Phase I of the project and developed a business model.
