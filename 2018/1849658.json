 "awd_abstract_narration": "Social cybersecurity is an emerging scientific area aimed at understanding and forecasting changes in human behavior, social, and economic outcomes that might arise from threats enabled by online communication platforms.  These threats range from increasingly realistic deceptive messages, such as spear-phishing or simulated but realistic videos, to manipulation of systems for creating and distributing content in social networks.  This project will conduct a two-day workshop that brings together social and computer scientists interested in information dissemination with the goal of going beyond current work that focuses on labeling the veracity of particular information or actors, or encouraging information consumers to consider veracity.  Instead, the workshop will take a broader theoretical lens that (a) analyzes how current models of information diffusion, rumor, social influence, communication, and so on need to adapt to novel and rapidly changing socio-technical environments and (b) focuses on the impact of these systems, identifying what is needed to characterize, measure, and affect the impact of information with different, and not necessarily consensus, credibility evaluations on the diverse consumers of that information, a problem of great import in domains ranging from news to health to crisis response.\r\n\r\nThe workshop organizers will invite participants from a large variety of institutions, representing a broad range of both intellectual backgrounds and participant demographics, to increase the diversity of perspectives on the problem.  After an opening plenary session where participants can pose key challenges, questions, and gaps, the main part of the workshop will be devoted to breakout groups organized around those challenges; a closing plenary session will develop plans for moving forward.  These sessions will be structured to produce three main outcomes.  The first is a set of challenge descriptions that define forward-looking problems in the space of information diffusion and manipulation, characterize what different scientific disciplines can provide toward them, and identify the next steps needed to address these challenges.  The second is a plan for developing a larger conference in the area of social cybersecurity for information diffusion that brings together researchers from different backgrounds and communities around the challenges identified.  The third is a longer term road map describing a scientific path toward addressing these challenges, with the goal of illuminating how stakeholder communities can coordinate to make progress toward them.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe objective of this project was to convene a diverse set of faculty from disparate disciplines to define the state of the art in social cybersecurity as it relates to information authenticity and to develop a list of basic scientific issues that need to be addressed so that progress can be made in this area. Thus, discussions were oriented around two questions: How does the unprecedented scale of false information and its spread impact human activity? What are the mechanisms that enable or contain the spread of false information? \n\n \n\nThis convocation led to the following:\n\nThe recognition that most fields had theory or methods of use. However, existing theories were insufficient as they tend not to scale, do not consider the affordances of the technology, and make assumptions about information veracity and actor authenticity that do not hold in the digital environment.  Hence, there is a need for new transdisciplinary theory. Further, existing methods are also insufficient.  They tend to be addressing simple issues and not the core problems.  They make assumptions about human social behavior that are not true.  Hence, there is a need for social scientists to lead method development in this fundamentally social space.\nAn agenda for needed basic science.  This agenda identified 7 basic areas:\n\n\nSocial Cyber-Forensics: New ways to track information and people in the cyber-media landscape, so that we can better answer \"Who is conducting social cybersecurity attacks?\".\nInformation Maneuvers: Improved ability to detect &amp; warn people that an attack is underway.  In particular, it is important to understand, what are the strategies used to conduct an attack.\nIntent Identification: Improved ability to understand why an attack occurred and so answer \"What is the perpetrators motive?\".\nDiffusion: Improved ability to monitor the spread of false or misleading information.  This includes being able to trace the attackers, the information, and the impact of the attack across multiple social media.\nEffectiveness of Information Campaigns: Improved ability to measure the impact of a false information campaign.  This means developing techniques to quantify the effectiveness of the social cyber-security attack in real time that go beyond measuring reach.\nMitigation:  Techniques for helping communities be resilient including developing guidelines for how to stop or mitigate a social cyber-security attack.\nGovernance:  Principled government and policy response is needed; thus, we need to ask what policies and laws are needed?  What can be enforced? And, how should governance in this space be done and by whom?\n\n\n3. Three follow on meetings, one of which was held at Howard University.\n\n4. Two new research collaborations that resulted in successfully funded project, and both of which involved under-represented minorities.\n\n5. An increase in collaboration among researchers in this area as evidenced by an increase in co-authored papers among new collaborators.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/08/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Kathleen M Carley"
