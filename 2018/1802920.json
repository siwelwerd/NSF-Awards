Algebraic combinatorics uses tools from algebra - like symmetries - to aid in the counting (and deeper understanding) of discrete structures. I engaged in research in algebraic combinatorics during my NSF Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowship (MSPRF) postdoc at the University of Minnesota. I was particularly focused on a further connection of algebraic combinatorics with dynamics, which is the mathematical study of change. Over the past several decades there has been a great deal of research on certain dynamical systems, defined on objects coming from algebraic combinatorics, that have remarkably regular, predictable behaviors. These particular examples of \"good dynamics\" are treasured because they can be completely understood due to their high degree of symmetry. It is a challenging problem to find further examples of good dynamics, and so as part of my MSPRF research I developed a heuristic which helps us find such examples. It says that these good dynamical examples can be identified by their also having a certain good enumerative property, which a priori has nothing to do with dynamics. This heuristic lead to the discovery of both new examples of good dynamics, and new examples of good enumeration. During the course of my postdoc I wrote 6 articles that have since been published, 4 further articles which are in various stages of peer review, and made numerous presentations at conferences and workshops across the country and the world. I engaged in collaboration with at least eight other mathematicians. And despite all this work, there is still much more to be done regarding my heuristic: for example, we lack a good understanding of why these two properties are somehow linked. It will take future research, by myself and others, to make this seemingly mysterious link of dynamics and enumeration more transparent.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 09/02/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Samuel&nbsp;F&nbsp;Hopkins</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1802920/1802920_10535862_1662175997512_reiner_students_alt--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1802920/1802920_10535862_1662175997512_reiner_students_alt--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Vic Reiner students\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1802920/1802920_10535862_1662175997512_reiner_students_alt--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Vic Reiner students\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Photo of my postdoc mentor Victor Reiner with me and many other mathematicians he has mentored</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">G.
