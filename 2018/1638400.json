 "awd_abstract_narration": "Neuroscience research on a full range of animals is essential for long-term progress in understanding the brain.  The tremendous diversity in the animal kingdom has given scientists almost endless opportunities to address fundamental questions about brain and behavior. In addition, exploration of the many unique nervous system specializations of organisms will expand perspectives how the nervous system works and, in turn, inspire new designs in engineering. Lastly, an evolutionary framework is essential for interpreting the relationship of structure to function. By building a neuroscience community around research in non-model organisms, one that shares ideas and resources, this research coordination network is expected to advance research in non-model systems broadly, even in ways that reach beyond neuroscience. By leading discussions of key topics for the future of neuroscience, the network is expected to provide expert scientific perspectives to the neuroscience community, policy makers, and others. Communication beyond the scientific community is certain to enhance the public's excitement about neuroscience. Educational opportunities, including lab exchanges, will provide essential training for established scientists and trainees. The development of a network website and outreach programs ensure that network resources and efforts are widely accessible.\r\n\r\nThis research coordination network aims to advance neuroscience in diverse organisms with four main goals: 1. To establish a network that includes broad diversity in the participant scientists, in the taxonomic research systems studied and in institutional location and type. 2. To advance strategic thinking about critical directions for neuroscience performed outside of the five traditional genetic model organisms. Specific topics to be explored include connectomics and the development of reference species. 3. To support and encourage the development and adoption of breakthrough technologies and approaches, including computation, in diverse species and research contexts. 4. To communicate products from both goals 1 and 2 broadly. So as to accomplish these goals, a large, open network of scientists and a website for communicating information and for supporting discussion is being established. Network workshops will bring members together to discuss critical topics in comparative neuroscience. The included educational opportunities aim to facilitate adoption of new techniques outside of the traditional models and encourage collaboration among labs, through workshops and lab exchanges. Products from workshops and other activities are shared widely via the website, publications and other mechanisms. This Research Coordination Network is co-funded by the Modulation Program in the Neural Systems Cluster (NSC) of the Division of Integrative Organismal Systems (IOS), and the Division of Emerging Frontiers (EF).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
