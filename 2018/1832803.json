 "awd_abstract_narration": "NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: Emerging applications in the broad area of energy systems require new materials that have high ionic conductivities, chemical and thermal stability, and are composed of environmentally benign and inexpensive materials. This project is focused on developing an understanding of the relationship between the oxygen conductivity of bismuth-containing ceramics and the local atomic structure that controls the mobility of oxygen. This research will involve the synthesis of a number of ceramic compounds, measurement of their ionic conductivity, and characterization of their local structure using neutrons and X-ray scattering. With improvements in the properties guided by these findings, there are many energy-related applications that can be considered such as intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells, which have great potential as a cost-effective, clean power source. The research in this four-year project adds valuable expertise in the development of new energy materials and forms the basis of two doctoral theses, one in chemistry and the other in materials science. In addition, the project incorporates a high-impact K-12 outreach activity by hosting two high school students into the laboratory as part of an existing program, the Summer Experience in Science and Engineering for Youth (SESEY) at Oregon State University (OSU).  This project also explores commercialization activities through a professional development program called Lens of the Market (LoM) which is supported at OSU through an National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award in Innovations in Graduate Education (IGE).\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL DETAILS: This project builds upon recent developments on the defect chemistry and structural analysis of bismuth perovskite materials with an aim to develop a fundamental understanding of the dominant ionic conduction mechanisms in two bismuth perovskite systems, sodium bismuth titanate (NBT) and barium titanate-bismuth zinc titanate (BT-BZT). Both of these material systems have recently been shown to exhibit ionic conductivity values comparable to yttria-stabilized zirconia at temperatures below 600 degrees C.  The overarching objective of this project is to identify the unique local structural distortions in bismuth perovskites that enable high oxygen conductivities in these materials. The specific research activities include the following objectives: (i) to systematically synthesize and process NBT and BT-BZT-based ceramics to control the level of oxygen stoichiometry, (ii)  to characterize the electronic properties of NBT and BT-BZT-based materials, with a focus on the ionic conductivity, and (iii) to characterize the local structure, average structure, and oxygen non-stoichiometry of NBT and BT-BZT-based materials, with the focus on how doping and processing conditions influence this behavior. A greater understanding of the oxide ion conduction mechanisms will help guide the development of new materials for emerging energy applications.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nFollowing the recent discovery of a new class of oxygen conductors based on bismuth-containing perovskites (e.g. Li et al.), the goal of this project was to develop a fundamental understanding of the dominant mechanisms that underpin the ionic conduction in Bi-based perovskite materials. The perovskite structure is extremely versatile and many current and emerging applications exploit its inherent structural flexibility, including ultrasonic materials, capacitors, catalysts, magnetic sensors, and photovoltaics. This project was focused on understanding the role of the local structure on the oxygen conductivity in perovskite materials. Achieving this goal will help guide the development of perovskite materials for emerging energy applications, such as fuel cells, electrolytes and energy storage systems.\n\nThe initial focus of this project was on the perovskite solid solution BaTiO3-Bi(Zn1/2Ti1/2)O3 (BT-BZT). Ceramic specimens were synthesized using conventional solid state processing techniques resulting in highly dense ceramics. The composition was modified by adding Mg as an acceptor dopant which would be expected to enhance the oxygen conduction. Analysis of the electrical properties of the samples revealed a p-type conductivity of around 1 mS/cm at 600C. To establish the conduction mechanism, electromotive force measurements were conducted which suggested that the oxide ion was the dominant charge carrier. A combination of synchrotron x-ray diffraction, neutron diffraction, and x-ray absorption experiments were conducted on the BT-BZT specimens as well as sodium bismuth titanate as a reference material. Interestingly, no systematic trends were observed that showed any relationship between the local structure and the conduction mechanism, including data at elevated temperatures at the onset of ionic conductivity.\n\nOverall, the magnitude of the conductivity in BT-BZT was well below other similar systems, especially at lower temperatures (which would be more amenable to applications). Higher levels of acceptor doping could be effective at enabling higher conductivities, however the addition of Bi had the effect of destabilizing the perovskite structure. It was observed that acceptor doping beyond 3 mole percent resulted in the formation of multiple secondary phases.\n\nThe final phase of the project explored an alternative means of designing perovskite compounds with higher levels of acceptor doping with the aim of realizing higher oxygen conductivities. Using a chemically similar structure with Pb on the A-site, a range of acceptor doped compositions were prepared base on Pb(Zr,Ti)O3 (PZT). While it was possible to achieve higher levels of doping (for example with Fe doping, solubilities approached 6 mole percent), electronic compensation dominated resulting in negligible oxygen conductivity.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/18/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: DavidPCann\n"
