 "awd_abstract_narration": "Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium (LUMCON) proposes to support technical services on R/V Pelican, a 116-foot, general purpose research vessel operated by the consortium as part of the Academic Fleet which is scheduled by the University National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS).  LUMCON requests support for basic services only; they will provide one technician on each seagoing research project. In addition, the technical services group will maintain, calibrate and provide for qualified users items from their pool of shared-use research instrumentation. The budget in this proposal is for the first year of a 5-year continuing grant.\r\n\r\nThe Program received the annual report on 2/1/2018. As required, the report provided information regarding 2017 operations as well as outlining plans and a proposed budget for 2018.  Research vessels in the Academic Fleet provide support for researchers from a variety of federal and state agencies, as well as some private sponsors. All users (or the appropriate funding agencies) share support for basic technical services on the vessel equally, via a day-rate, with each paying a share of the costs based on fractional usage of the vessel. The rates are negotiated annually with the NSF Program Manager\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nThe principal impact of the present proposal is under Merit Review Criterion 2 of the Proposal Guidelines (NSF 13-589). It provides infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF).  The acquisition, maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This is in part due to the small crew size but also due to the marine techs unique skill set. Onshore, techs are involved with maintenance of equipment, preparation for future cruises, and any other tasks deemed necessary to support the Vessel Operations department.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nLUMCON maintained a six year Cooperative Agreement (CA) with the National Science Foundation from 2018 thru 2024 for the operation of R/V Pelican (NSF Award OCE-18227654) and included a Rapid Response Research Grants (RAPID) cruise aboard another vessel (R/V Point Sur).

Forty-three discrete cruises were included in the 413 operational funded days by NSF which averaged 10 operational days per project. NSF-funded cruises consisted of 30 operational days aboard R/V Point Sur, a vessel owned by University of Southern Mississippi but managed and operated by LUMCON. Of these 30 operational days, the RAPID cruise days were primarily focused on research activities involved in sampling oceanographic conditions associated with Hurricane Harvey. This RAPID funding was utilized during the winter of 2018. Additionally, 20 operational NSF days were employed by Dr. Li of LSU aboard RV Acadiana, a 58 ft. research vessel owned and operated by LUMCON. This vessel was used to deploy buoys near offshore oil platforms.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/06/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: JosephDMalbrough\n"
