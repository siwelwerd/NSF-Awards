 "awd_abstract_narration": "The amount of digital information being generated doubles every two\r\nyears. As a result, storage systems have to handle an ever increasing\r\namount of data each day. Data is often stored on solid state\r\ndrives(SSDs)for good performance. Unfortunately, SSDs have a limited\r\nlifetime and will fail after a certain number of writes. Anticipated future\r\nstorage technologies such as Intel 3D XPoint also have limited\r\nlifetime. Unfortunately, current storage systems have high\r\ninput/output (IO) amplification: 100 gigabytes written to the\r\nwidely-used RocksDB key-value store will result in 2.7 terabytes (28x)\r\nwritten to storage. Solving the problem of storage failure due to IO\r\namplification is crucial to building storage systems of the future\r\nthat can handle the exponentially increasing amount of data.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to build IO-Efficient systems\r\ninfrastructure that drastically reduces the amount of writes to\r\nstorage without compromising on performance. To achieve this goal,\r\nthis project contributes new data structures, techniques, and designs\r\nof storage systems. Taking an end-to-end approach, this project\r\nredesigns each layer of the storage stack, including key-value stores,\r\ntransactional stores, and file systems, while tuning the underlying\r\nstorage device to reduce IO amplification.\r\n\r\nThis project will significantly impact academia by advancing the\r\nstate-of-the-art, industry through technology transfer, students via\r\ncourses and projects, and the general public by providing better\r\nopen-source storage systems. Undergraduate and graduate students will\r\nbe trained in the careful analysis and building of advanced storage\r\ninfrastructure. This project will encourage the participation of women\r\nand other under-represented minorities in research.\r\n\r\nAll software artifacts related to this project will be maintained at\r\nthe project website\r\n(http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~vijay/io-efficient-infra.htm) for the\r\nlifetime of this project. All storage systems developed as part of\r\nthis project will be open-sourced, with sufficient documentation to\r\nenable ease-of-use. Other tools and benchmarks developed\r\nduring the course of this project will also be made publicly available\r\nin text form for easy processing.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
