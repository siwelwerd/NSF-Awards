To realize that connectivity, this project proposes to deploy CyNet wireless networks to\r\nconnect experimental science testbeds to high-performance cloud computing infrastructures.\r\n\r\nThe CyNet project will:\r\n1) deploy Predictable, Reliable, Real-time, and high-Throughput (PRRT) wireless networking solutions using the standards-compliant, open-source Open Air Interface software framework and commodity Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP) hardware;\r\n2) integrate these wireless networks with software defined networks to seamlessly integrate outdoor cameras, sensors, and autonomous vehicles, and connect these components to high performance cloud computing systems;\r\n3) implement an infrastructure virtualization system that partitions CyNet into programmable, isolated experiments; and\r\n4) create an infrastructure management system that performs admission and access control and establishes specified resource allocation policies.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
