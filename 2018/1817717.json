 "awd_abstract_narration": "All animals contain complex communities of bacteria and other microbes, known collectively as the microbiome. These microbes perform many important functions for their host, including defense against infection by parasites and pathogens. To accomplish these functions the microbes must interact closely with both host and parasite cells.  Increasingly, scientific evidence suggests that these interactions occur through the production of chemical messengers that allow communication among the bacteria in the microbiome, the host and the parasite.  This research project advances understanding of the microbiome by devising a model honey bee gut system. Such a system has significantly fewer bacterial taxa and performs the same functions as other gut microbiomes, including playing a role in host defense against parasites. In this honey bee system, both network models and experimental manipulations of the gut microbiome are used to further understanding of the microbiome and its role in host defense. The knowledge derived from the project would be important for manipulating the microbiome for host health, including, ultimately, that of humans.  A computer science and biology-based outreach module for elementary school students is being developed. Students and teachers are guided through the building of Raspberry Pi clusters, which are then used for student-driven projects based on the research datasets. \r\n\r\nGrowing evidence points to the critical role that the microbiome plays in host health and defense against parasites via interspecies cellular signaling. This research uses a systems biology framework to advance understanding of interspecific cellular signaling in host-microbiome-parasite interactions. The model system is the honey bee gut microbiome which consists of less than ten bacterial taxa. Three objectives collectively address the role of the microbiome in host defense against parasites, assess functional redundancy in the microbiome in relation to parasite resistance, and experimentally test network predictions. Bees with a common gut parasite provide data to generate interaction networks for bees that are parasite-infected and for bees that are resistant to infection. Within these networks, specific gene modules and bacterial taxa, important for parasite resistance, are identified within the gut microbiome. In this way key interactions among the host, parasite and bacteria are elucidated. Next, an alternative, complimentary approach to building microbiome networks for this system is developed. For this approach whole genome sequences of dominant bee gut bacteria are collected from apiaries that vary in parasite infection prevalence. The importance of strain-level variation in these dominant bacterial taxa are explored in a large set of computationally-derived networks. Shifts in network topology, including changes in the empirically-derived resistance modules, are assessed. Finally, based on the empirical and computational networks, predictions are made about microbiome community structures that are most likely to result in parasite resistance. These predictions are tested by creating bees with synthetic gut microbiomes that are predicted to be parasite-resistant or susceptible. This project will significantly advance knowledge of the mechanisms by which the microbiome impacts host health.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Growing evidence points to the critical role that the microbiome plays, through interspecies cellular signaling, in determining the outcome of host-parasite interactions. Unraveling the complexities of signaling in host-microbiome-parasite interactions is a major undertaking that has seen recent advances from the use of network theory and systems biology approaches. The goal of our collaborative research was to use the relatively simple honey bee gut microbiome system to unravel the genetic interactions among the honey bee, the bee gut microbiome, and an invading gut parasite called Nosema, and how these interactions could impact host disease outcomes.\r\n\n\nWe first completed an experiment that exposed honey bees to Nosema parasites at either a high or low dose and examined the genes that were activated in response to those exposures in both the honey bee and in the collection of gut bacteria. We developed a new computational network approach to identify the key genes involved in these three-way interactions. This new computational tool is a key contribution of our work, as researchers continue to try to find ways to model and understand these types of interactions across many different systems. One key specific finding of this project was that we identified 22 promising candidate genes that may reduce infection loads in the host following parasite exposure.\r\n\n\nA second study involved working with bee keepers to collect honey bee samples from 13 different apiaries in an east-west transect across the United States, from Virginia to Washington. We are using these samples to apply and test our network-building approach on a much larger scale. These data will also be used to understand spatial variation in the honey bee gut microbiome in terms of both changes in the presence of different bacterial species and strains, and in the functions of those bacteria. As a part of that analysis, we are developing a new machine-learning approach to assess how the differences in the gut bacterial community structure and function impact host health. This machine learning model is an additional computational tool that our research has developed that will aid researchers in a variety of systems to answer important questions concerning the functional contributions of the microbiome to the host. \r\n\n\nThe data generated from the continent-wide survey have also been used to assess the presence of antibiotic-resistance genes in the honey bee gut. Antibiotic resistance of bacterial pathogens has become a major issue for both human and wildlife health in recent years, and these genes are now commonly found in bacteria dwelling in a range of environments. We detected bacterial resistance genes in honey bee guts in hives from across the entire United States, with genes present that confer some resistance to 14 different antibiotics. The most prevalent genes were those conferring resistance to tetracycline, a commonly used human and animal antibiotic that has been used by beekeepers in past decades to control several honey bee bacterial diseases in managed hives.\r\n\n\nDuring the course of our work, we also compiled a set of over 450 bacterial isolates from our experimental bees. We have completed whole genome sequencing for a set of 51 of these bacterial isolates, which provides important information on strain-level genetic variation that may be critically important for variation in function across hives and apiaries. One of the bacterial families we have focused on for this research is the Lactobacillaceae family. This is a very important family of lactic acid bacteria that includes species that are critical in fermentation for food and beverage production, but also includes species that are resident in the gut bacterial communities of both invertebrate and vertebrate animals, including humans. These bacterial genomes will, therefore, not only provide insight into the importance of strain-level genetic variation in honey bees, but contribute more broadly to our understanding of this important family.\r\n\n\nThe broader impacts of our research included both training of students and postdocs, and outreach to local elementary schools and a childrens science center. Ten undergraduate and five graduate students at Eastern Washington University and one post-doctoral research associate and five graduate students at Virginia Tech were involved in this project and received diverse training in microbiology, experimental design, and how to analyze large, complex datasets using computational tools. In addition, we developed a module for elementary school students based on building Raspberry Pi computers from kits and then learning how to complete basic programing with these units and explore biological data. In two different semesters, we completed 8 in-class sessions with students to develop and test our modules, which can now be used by other teachers to incorporate computational skill building into their classroom instruction as part of their STEM curriculum.\r\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/27/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: JeniferBWalke\n"
