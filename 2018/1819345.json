 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the ability to sustainably produce more food with fewer water and energy resources. To feed nine billion people on this planet by 2050 we need to develop new systems of agriculture. Indoor agriculture has the potential to transform the way we grow and source our food, enabling locally-sourced crops at higher yields. Food crops can be grown sustainably year-round near all major urban centers if the energy and water consumption of greenhouses could be reduced. This research will lead to the creation of a suite of water management products and services for indoor farming applications thereby making indoor agriculture environmentally sustainable and economically viable.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will commercialize a novel metal organic framework (MOF) material that enables a new class of compact, energy-efficient cooling and dehumidification systems for greenhouses. Recent discoveries at MIT have revealed a novel MOF material with unprecedented water adsorption capacity. Moreover, the MOF material may be readily synthesized from low-cost, bulk commodity chemicals. A dehumidifier operating with this material can harvest waste heat to provide optimal temperature and humidity conditions for controlled environment agriculture. To translate the MOF material from research lab into large scale production, the material must demonstrate sufficient durability under cycling conditions, be designed to afford low cost processing and be integrated into a cost-efficient climate control system that takes advantage of its unique properties. The goal of the proposed R&D is to accelerate durability testing, design a process chemistry to enable low-cost manufacturing and develop system-level models to\r\nanalyze lifecycle performance and cost sensitivity in an indoor farming application.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

MOF materials have attracted considerable attention recently due to their high porosity which enables the adsorption of various gases and vapors at record capacity. The material that we investigated can capture more water than any other material in this class.  Furthermore, because of the way it traps the water vapor, it can release it quickly using very little energy. This makes it an ideal candidate for applications such as atmospheric water generation, dehumidification and cooling.    \n\nOur research plan was designed to identify and address key questions associated with the technical and commercial feasibility of the material along with its applications in air conditioning devices.  The MOF material was successfully produced for the first time outside the university lab.  In-depth characterization and comparison with commercial desiccants demonstrated that the MOF could adsorb twice the amount of moisture of a similar, high-performance zeolite material specially commercialized for water adsorption.  Furthermore, the MOF could adsorb and desorb the moisture twice as fast as compared to the zeolite. \n\nThe material is an ideal candidate for dehumidification applications which were also investigated during this project.   High humidity is the bane of building and home owners worldwide. If not properly controlled, it can lead to molds and bacterial diseases that affect our health.  In greenhouses and indoor farms, it can be catastrophic to plants and profits alike.  Vertical farming is a fast-growing segment of indoor farming that represent an increasingly important sector of the overall food chain.  Vertical farms are sealed buildings where plants are grown in precise environmental conditions using artificial light.  The lights generate heat while plants naturally produce a lot moisture and maintaining the optimal growing conditions requires a lot of energy.  With the use of this material the process of removing the moisture becomes much more energy-efficient, thereby reducing energy costs and improving profit margins.  The ultimate result is enabling more sustainable and environmentally conscious commercial indoor farming. Innovations in indoor farming are enabling locally sourced, delicious produce with efficient use of natural resources and decreased environmental footprint.   \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/30/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Sorin Grama"
