 "awd_abstract_narration": "NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis award supports fundamental research and education on understanding and controlling quantum properties of materials. Fundamentally, everything on Earth is governed by quantum mechanics. Yet, while quantum theory is essential to understanding the gross properties of materials, for example the existence of both metals and insulators and the phenomena of magnetism, it rarely manifests itself directly in the more macroscopic world. This project aims to bridge this gap by investigating materials in which quantum effects are unusually apparent in laboratory-scale observations. These quantum materials offer new functionalities that could not be achieved in more classical substances.\r\n\r\nThe project has three main thrusts. The first targets materials that are topological and magnetic. Topological materials have a kind of internal \"twist\" that leads to novel conducting properties. By combining this with magnetism, control over those properties may be achieved. The second thrust focuses on emergent \"quasiparticles\"--objects that behave like fundamental particles of nature but modified in essential ways--with the unusual property that they are confined to fewer than the usual 3 dimensions. The third problem addressed is how to modify the properties of materials using powerful laser light. The forces from such powerful light can reorganize the electrons in a material, giving them new and interesting properties.\r\n\r\nThis research involves a combination of development of theoretical techniques, numerical and analytical calculations, and close interplay with experimental studies. Graduate and undergraduate students will be involved in an essential way in the research, and will be trained broadly in analytical reasoning, mathematical methods, computation, and scientific communication, which form the basis for many careers in STEM fields, both in and out of physics.\r\n\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThe award supports fundamental research and education towards understanding and controlling quantum correlations in solids. In the long term, there are two goals to the program: to develop new materials and structures with useful functionality not currently available, and to extend the basic scientific framework to understand matter in new regimes and new phases. There are three main topics: 1) Interplay of real space and momentum space topology in itinerant magnets; 2) Sub-dimensional dynamics; 3) Driven dynamics of Mott insulators. The research will be carried out using a diverse set of theoretical techniques: phenomenological modeling, statistical mechanics, field theory, ab initio simulations, many-body numerics such as Monte Carlo methods and variational wavefunctions, and symmetry analysis.\r\n\r\nIn general, the intellectual merit of the research is in developing and bringing deep theoretical ideas in the theory of quantum matter to fruition in real materials. The first topic on momentum and real space topology is a next step after the maturation of the field of topological band theory, and opens the door to a rich interplay of phenomena bringing together topological aspects of electronic structure and frustrated magnetism. The second subject is both related to the frontier of topological phases and qualitatively new forms of three-dimensional matter, and also is a point where powerful theoretical techniques from one dimension can be brought to bear on difficult problems of dynamics. The final area of driven dynamics is a nascent field, in which a rapid growth of new theoretical ideas surrounding Floquet many-body problems, combined with experimental advances in ultrafast technology, offers opportunities for new physics in the solid state.\r\n\r\nGraduate and undergraduate students will be involved in an essential way in the research, and will be trained broadly in analytical reasoning, mathematical methods, computation, and scientific communication, which form the basis for many careers in STEM fields, both in and out of physics.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nAll materials are built from atoms, which themselves are composed of nuclei and electrons.  It is the motion of these electrons between different atoms that determines a material's electrical characteristics, its optical properties, and its magnetism.  The electronic motion, moreover, must be described using quantum mechanics, the theoretical framework which describes the ultra-small. Due to the strange features of quantum mechanics -- electrons can behave like waves instead of particles, and can be simultaneously in two apparently different \"states\" -- remarkable and unexpected properties of materials may arise.  This project uncovered some surprising new examples of such \"quantum materials\", and developed the theoretical models which allow their behavior to be predicted and understood.  Learning to control these properties may enable new electronic technologies.\n\nOne of the main thrusts of the project concerned the interplay of two aspects of electron motions: the flow of electric currents through a material, and the formation of magnetic \"textures\" in it.  A magnetic material may be visualized as composed of many microscopic sized bar magnets.  These tiny magnetic units may orient their north and south poles along different directions.  Often nearby units align parallel to one another, forming regions within a sample called domains.  The global pattern of domains is an example of a texture.  Electrons moving through the material adapt to the texture and this affects the current flow.  Consequently the electrical characteristics of the material may be controlled magnetically, or the magnetism may be controlled electrically.  Several striking examples of this type were discovered and explained in this project, in the materials Mn3Sn, CeAlGe, and in twisted bilayer graphene.\n\nThe other major direction of the project was to understand the limits of \"quantumness\" of electronic solids.  That is, to ask the question: how much of the quantum weirdness of individual electrons can be preserved at the macroscopic level of a material with many electrons?  Such extreme quantum materials are the natural venue for exotic applications like quantum information technologies.  The project developed the theory of extreme quantum magnets known as quantum spin liquids, which respond entirely differently to light and magnetic fields than do ordinary magnetic solids.  New methods were developed to study layered two dimensional solids rotated relative to one another and subjected to applied magnetic fields.  Together the field and the rotation/twist angle control the electron's quantum state, and thereby stabilize more extreme quantum behavior of the material as a whole.\n\nThe research provided on-the-job training of next generation scientists who learned the skills to carry out independent and collaborative research in STEM disciplines.  Four postdoctoral scientists and two PhD students were involved in the research and published peer-reviewed journal papers, attended conferences and delivered lectures, and in the latter case completed portions of their PhD theses as part of the project.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/29/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Leon M Balents"
