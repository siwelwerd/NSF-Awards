 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides partial funding for the Brookings Conference on Economic Activity and the accompanying conference volume, the Brookings Papers on Economic Activity. The conference is designed to bring together economic scientists to focus on the scientific analysis of economic policy issues. These issues include the changing labor market, financial institutions, global economic policy, heath care, data improvement, inequality, and long run economic growth. The papers presented at the conference are available online to the public. They develop empirical analysis, employ a wide range of research methods, and focus on real world problems that affect the US economy, including the future of growth and productivity in the U.S. and abroad, challenges facing the labor market, improving economic data, and scientific examination of the effects of economic policies on trade, financial markets, health, taxes, energy, and regulation. The award promotes the national interest by improving the quality of the economics used in making policy decisions, and provides better evidence for policies that contribute to the competitiveness of the U.S. economy.\r\n\r\nThe BPEA conferences are marked by a high degree of interaction among the organizers, researchers, discussants, and attendees. Each researcher invited to present engages in an intensive process of three rounds of review, criticism, discussion and editing. BPEA encourages scientists to apply the best knowledge of the profession to pressing policy issues and uses policy concerns to point the profession's way toward new science.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
