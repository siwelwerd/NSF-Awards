 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) through Targeted Infusion Projects supports the development, implementation, and study of evidence-based innovative models and approaches for improving the preparation and success of HBCU undergraduate students so that they may pursue science, technology, engineering or mathematics (STEM) graduate programs and/or careers. The project at the University of the District of Columbia (UDC) seeks to improve students' preparation and success towards an engineering career or an advanced degree by infusing interdisciplinary risk and resilience training into undergraduate engineering education, especially in civil engineering. Undergraduate students are involved in the project as researchers, and outreach activities to high school and community college students are part of the project.\r\n\r\nThis project has the objectives to: update the educational experiences in civil engineering and related STEM programs at UDC by integrating interdisciplinary knowledge and skills development in risk and resilience;  enrich the undergraduate research experiences through creation of an interdisciplinary summer research program for resilient built environment; and increase the enrollment and retention rate in engineering programs through engaging students and outreach to local high schools and community colleges. This project will contribute to a diverse engineering workforce in the area of built environment. It is expected that at least 600 students will be directly impacted by this project.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Under the support of this project, three interdisciplinary courses were successfully developed and implemented at UDC including: Introduction to Risk and Resilience in Engineering, Reliability and Optimization Methods in Engineering, and Sensing and Data Analytics for Infrastructure Systems. These courses have enriched the course offering at UDC and prepared the students for employment and advanced studies in the emerging field of risk and resilience. This project also provided valuable research training for undergraduate students at UDC and allowed UDC faculty and student to be actively involved in the research field of risk and resilience. The project facilitated the establishment of a successful engineering ambassador program that engaged over 20 student ambassadors from undergraduate programs of Civil Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences. The ambassadors have conducted more than 20 virtual outreach activities for students at local high schools and community colleges. In these outreach events, the ambassadors shared their UDC experience, delivered presentations about UDC activities and each of the engineering and computer science programs at UDC, and conducted various hands-on activities related to risk and resilience in engineering to engage students in the STEM fields. Three Summer Risk and Resilience Academy Workshops were offered to student participants from high schools and community colleges, which attracts students to the STEM fields and trains a diverse workforce for a hazard-resilient built environment.
