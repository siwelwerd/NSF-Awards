 "awd_abstract_narration": "Quantitative reasoning (QR) involves the use of mathematical skills, such as algebra and statistical analysis, to understand and interpret data.  The field of biology has become increasingly reliant on the use of quantitative reasoning to interpret large datasets, such as those gathered in genomic analysis and population studies.  This project is designed to improve quantitative reasoning skills in students at community colleges preparing to transfer into biology majors at four-year institutions.  These students are often underprepared to successfully complete biology majors and to continue to graduate education or to enter the STEM workforce.  To achieve long-term gains in students' abilities to apply QR in biological contexts, this proposal seeks to leverage a university/community college partnership to expand and deepen the QR content in core biology courses across the major.  The program aspires to provide a model for how consortia of community colleges and universities can facilitate course awareness and alignment to improve student gains in QR.  This project will test the hypothesis that this type of collaboration enhances pedagogy and transfer student success at four-year institutions.  Further, repeated interaction with QR modules within the core biology curricula are hypothesized to positively impact the success of all students in upper-level coursework.  These efforts are designed to strengthen the course performance measures of all students, including both direct entry and transfer students.  Improving student success and retention in STEM majors such as biology supports the goal of improving access of all students to scientific and technical careers.\r\n\r\nThe focus of the project will be on enhancing the QR skills of undergraduates through the creation of active learning modules focused on quantitative skill development, verified with validated assessment instruments.  Three scholarly communities will be established: 1) a Curricular Alignment Team, which will review curricula in four core courses (Introductory Biology: Cells and Molecules, Introductory Biology: Ecology and Evolution, Genetics, and Cell Biology) at the community colleges and the four-year institution in the collaboration, and identify areas for action, with emphasis on the development of QR abilities in biology majors; 2) the NEXUS Institute in Quantitative Biology, which will involve teams of faculty from each institution developing, piloting, and assessing QR modules for the core biology curricula and assessing the impact on student performance and retention; and 3) a Faculty Development Community, which will involve a series of shared faculty development workshops on evidence-based teaching approaches, to include the use of the created QR modules, and a common teaching certificate program.  These three communities will come together annually at a regional symposium, where the consortium products (QR modules) and findings (student assessment data) will be disseminated.  Taken together, this work will shape intra- and inter-institutional perspectives and practices relating to the importance of QR in the success of undergraduate biology majors.  By developing faculty collaborations through the scholarly communities described above, this project will provide training in modern pedagogical methods and module development for biology faculty at community colleges and four-year institutions.  The project will map the processes involved and disseminate the project findings widely to ensure that it serves as a model for other institutions that wish to take this approach to improve transfer student success and better prepare all biology majors for the modern STEM workforce.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The grant had three primary objectives. Curricular Alignment, Development of Quantitative Modules and Faculty Professional Development.\n\n\nObjective One: The curricular alignment team was composed of biology and math faculty. The four core biology courses which included General Biology I (Cells and molecules), General Biology II (Ecology and Evolution), Genetics, and Cell Biology. The team reviewed and compared various curriculum metrics from the participating institutions four core biology courses.\n \n Objective One Outcome: T The largest discrepancy among the participating institutions was in the mathematics prerequisite requirements which in the case of CCBC is a developmental math course, Intermediate Algebra. CCBC did not change the math prerequisite required for our General Biology I (Cells and Molecules) course. The courses were in alignment for the most part, so it was determined that there was no need to make any changes to our curriculum.

Each team met monthly to work on the development of the quantitative reasoning modules. Some subgroups were formed to work on the modules at additional time periods. CCBC does not offer the Cell Biology Course but did participate in the Cell Biology team for the initial 3 years of the grant. Four additional biology faculty from CCBC participated in the development of modules for the General Biology I (Cells and Molecules) team. The structure of the quantitative reasoning module teams changed as the grant progressed.\n\n\nObjective Two Outcome: Quantitative competencies were scaffolded across the four courses with the level of difficulty increasing as students progressed through the four-course sequence. To create a larger n, the data for all institutions was combined. In comparing data from the Pre-Assessment and Post-Assessment, the data supported an increase in quantitative reasoning skills upon completion of the modules. The validity of the data was either Moderate and Strong or Strong and Strong for all modules except the Population Growth Module (Ecology and Evolution) which was Weak and Strong.\n\n\nThe Biology I team developed six quantitative reasoning modules. CCBC fully implemented Introduction to the Scientific Process, Cell Structure and Size, and Solute Concentration with 674, 527 and 409 students participating respectively. The Osmosis and Cell Cycle Mitosis was piloted with 23 participants. After a module was piloted, the module and the associated assessments were evaluated and revised as needed. CCBC implemented the modules into approximately 50% of the sections that have a recitation hour associated with the lecture.

This was done to see if there was an increase in quantitative reasoning skills for students who completed the modules versus students who did not complete the modules. The results of this data were inconclusive. One possibility is that the modules are not effective. However, the overall results of pre and post assessment questions for students completing the modules and both assessments showed an increase in quantitative reasoning skills. Another possibility is that since the quantitative reasoning concepts are still taught to all CCBCs students but in various formats, the students still learned the quantitative reasoning skills that were assessed.\n\n\nThe Biology II Team developed five modules. Natural Selection, Hardy-Weinberg, and the quantitative reasoning modules were fully implemented with 65, 55 and 93 students participating respectively. The Population Growth, and the CO2, Climate Change and Stomata modules only reached the pilot stage with 23 participants.

The data supported a growth in quantitative reasoning skills.\n\n\nObjective Three: The third part of the grant was the design and implementation of professional development workshops and an inter-institutional teaching certificate.\n\n\nObjective Three Outcomes: UMBC has come up with a simple professional development opportunity plan that the UMBC Nexus institute For Quantitative Biology website will host.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/29/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: ChristineDe Stefano\n"
