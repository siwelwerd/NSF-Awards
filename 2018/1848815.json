The purpose of the workshop is to catalyze the creation of a community whose expertise is at the interface of two of NSF's 10 Big Ideas: Harnessing the Data Revolution and Windows on the Universe. Domain experts attending this event will inform the design of a roadmap of future collaborations to accelerate convergence between these two disparate frontiers of science and technology to fully realize MMA.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
