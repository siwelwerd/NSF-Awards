 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funding for US participation for the conference \"Texas Analysis and Mathematical Physics Symposium (TexAMP)\", which will be held at Baylor University in Waco, TX on Octobert 26-28, 2018.  This will be the 6th annual TexAMP meeting, and will feature talks by eight prominent researchers in the fields of mathematical physics, with specialties in spectral theory, geometric analysis,  harmonic analysis, integrable systems, random matrix theory, asymptotic analysis, partial differential equations, geometric measure theory, functional analysis, microlocal analysis, scattering theory, and semiclassical methods.\r\n\r\nThe conference focuses on recent developments in Analysis, especially in the field of mathematical physics.  A number of distinguished mathematicians have agreed to attend and speak at this conference series.  This award gives early career researchers, members of underrepresented groups, researchers not funded by NSF and the like an opportunity to attend and participate in this conference.  The organizing committee will strive to make this funding opportunity known to target groups through a number of different activities. More information will be made available at the conference webpage: https://sites.google.com/site/texamp2018/home.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
