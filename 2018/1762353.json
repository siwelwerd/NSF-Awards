 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project will study the fundamentals of laser and chemical processing methods to create functional surface textures on metal alloys. The fabricated surfaces have random micro- and nanoscale surface structures that promote superhydrophobic (repels water), and highly anti-reflective characteristics that are favorable for drag reduction, anti-icing, self-cleaning, and light absorption applications. The processing method can both be applied to many critical engineering materials including steel, aluminum, titanium and magnesium alloys, and offer a high-throughput process chain capable of treating large surface areas. By this method, the laser processing time will be significantly reduced from hundreds of minutes per 6.5 cm^2 (square inch), as currently required, to a few seconds. Realization of these potential manufacturing gains will advance the national prosperity and welfare by increasing U.S. advanced manufacturing competitiveness, and will find application across many manufacturing sectors including aerospace, energy, and defense. The award will also facilitate training of the future workforce as students across all levels will gain experience in advanced manufacturing and surface science fundamentals. Additional educational opportunities will be made available for underrepresented freshman from rural areas of Iowa through the Rural Scholar Research Program.\r\n\r\nThe research objective of this project is to understand the underlying fundamental mechanisms driving the nanosecond Laser-based High-throughput Surface Nanostructuring process. The process comprises two steps: (1) water-confined Nanosecond Laser Texturing, during which a high-energy, nanosecond pulse laser scans a metal surface submerged in water, using a large spatial increment and a fast processing speed: and (2) Chemical Immersion Treatment, during which the laser-textured surface is further treated by immersion in a chlorosilane reagent. Specific tasks are aimed at the following; 1) verifying that the increased laser power intensity generates the desired surfaces via surface chemistry and microstructural changes, 2) verifying that the competing mechanisms of chemical etching, and surface silianization occurring during the chemical immersion treatment drive the formation of the nanostructures, 3) determining the long-term endurance of surface attributes in high-temperature, corrosive, and/or abrasive environments, and 4) identification of the functional effects of random surface nanostructure size, shape and variation on superhydrophobicity, capillary adhesive forces, and anti-reflection characteristics.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

However, these surfaces are expensive and resource-intensive to manufacture. This project developed a novel nanosecond laser-based high-throughput surface nanostructuring (nHSN) process that can simultaneously create random nanostructures and attain desirable surface chemistry over large-area metal alloy surfaces. Extreme wettability including superhydrophobicity and superhydrophilicity was assessed for multiple engineering metal alloys including aluminum, steel and titanium alloys. Compared with existing ultrashort laser-based surface-texturing methods, the nHSN process?s nanosecond laser scan time represents a significant reduction in processing time, from hundreds of minutes per square inch to a few seconds per square inch, which will enable large-area processing of engineering alloys for practical throughput. The advantages of this process are flexibility, speed, precision, repeatability, cost-effectiveness, contactless process, versatility and automation possibilities.</p>\n<p>nHSN consists of two sequential steps: (1) nanosecond laser texturing (NLT) and (2) chemical immersion treatment (CIT). An experimental analysis and characterizations of nHSN surface morphology and chemistry showed that surface nanostructuring with proper chemical attributes results from a combined effect of chemical etching and attachment of functional groups during the CIT phase of nHSN. Based on the processing principle, a design methodology was developed for the nHSN process to achieve extreme wettability. A proper silane reagent can be selected for the CIT phase to achieve the desired surface wetting behavior, while laser parameters can also be adjusted during the NLT phase to finely tune the nanostructuring mechanism. nHSN nanostructures with fluorosilane chemistry repel water, while those with cyanosilane chemistry attract water. The effects of chemical immersion treatment for superhydrophobic functionalization of laser textured surfaces were also evaluated using a spectroscopic approach to quantitatively measure surface coverage. The research showed a strong relationship between the solution concentration, chemical treatment time, and the water contact angle on the superhydrophobic metal surface. Compared with traditional chemical treatment methods, these results show that shorter chemical immersion treatment times and lower chemical solution concentrations are sufficient to achieve superhydrophobicity. Our innovation of surface wettability patterning is the first known laser-based surface engineering method which decouples extreme surface wettability from surface topography. Surface topography patterning, from low-roughness, isotropic, random nano-structured texture to highly structured texture, can be accurately achieved by adjusting the laser parameters.</p>\n<p>The developed high-throughput surface texturing method is anticipated to achieve practical treatment of macroscale metal part surfaces. The nHSN process can be applied to critical engineering metal alloys in order to improve surface functionalities, including superior anti-wetting and anti-reflective abilities.
