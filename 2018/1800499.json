 "awd_abstract_narration": "With funding from the Synthesis Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Jeremy May of the University of Houston is designing and synthesizing catalysts, especially carbon-based catalysts (i.e., \"organocatalysts\"), that increase the efficiency of carbon-carbon bonds forming reactions with the necessary control of three-dimentional structure. This research is transformative in that the use of such organocatalysts avoids many problems associated with metal-containing catalysts, including toxicity and the expense of precious metals. In addition, this research is providing fundamental insights into the mechanisms of organocatalyzed reactions.  Some of these reactions are biologically relevant. Dr. May's new reactions replicate and improve upon natural products that have antibacterial, anticancer, neurological, or immune system-stimulating activity. In addition, the Professor May is partnering with KIPP Sharpstown Junior High to introduce students to experimental chemistry and other physical sciences.  The May lab works with disadvantaged and at-risk students to bolster their scientific understanding and desire to prepare for college.\r\n \r\nProfessor May is designing and synthesizing asymmetric organocatalysts that can promote the conjugate addition of vinyl and aryl boronates to alpha, beta-unsaturated ketones for the synthesis of carbon-carbon (C-C) bonds efficiently and with high levels of stereocontrol. This project is advancing fundamental knowledge of organocatalysis, the reactivity of boronate reagents, and stereoelectronic effects in C-C bond formation. The reagents and intermediates involved are highly tolerant of sensitive chemical functional groups, allowing great diversity in the substrate scope and access to atomic arrangements commonly found in bioactive molecules.  The synthesis of sterically encumbered C-C bonds that are otherwise difficult to form is an aim of this project. This research is transformative as the use of organocatalysts and boronates avoids many of the problems associated with transition metal catalysts including a lack of tolerance of  heterocycles or heteroatoms.  The synthesis of targets and analogs of the indolyl propylene glycol class of natural products, which have been shown to exhibit antibacterial, antimetastatic, acetocholinesterase blocking, and immune system stimulating bioactivities is also being developed. The supported research effort has a broad educational impact at all levels (Graduate, Undergraduate, and High School). Professor May continues to support a partnership with KIPP Sharpstown Junior High to introduce the students to experimental chemistry and other physical sciences.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This project focused on designing catalysts, especially carbon-based catalysts (organocatalysts, which were the subject of the 2021 Nobel Prize), to synthesize carbon-carbon bonds efficiently with all the needed three-dimensional control. This has transformed the use of carbon/boron reagents (central orange/green molecule in Figure 1). These reagents are neutral, only react when activated by an appropriate catalyst, and are highly tolerant of atomic functionality in molecules. In particular, we found compatibility with heterocycles, which are of vital importance to natural product synthesis (see below), medicinal chemistry, carbon-based materials, and organometallic catalysis. While transition metal catalysts have used these reagents powerfully in the last several decades, these metals are often very expensive, non-renewable, and toxic. In this project we have explored many organocatalytic reactions that do not need metal catalysis and avoids those issues. Figure 1 shows the philosophy of this approach, where easily handled non-toxic carbon/boron reagents are reacted with a variety of reaction partners (blue molecules, Figure 1) to form a diverse array of molecules that have incorporated both pieces. This structural diversity is important to access many biological activities and other physical properties in drug development. Over the course of the grant period, we have discovered and reported nine new reactions, shown in Figures 1 and 2. We have also studied the mechanisms of how these reactions proceed to expand our fundamental understanding of the reactivity of carbon/boron reagents and develop new ideas for reactions. These principles will help to drive this field forward. In general, the ability to form these complex chemical bonds accelerates humanity?s ability to access key structures with important physical or biological properties.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Molecular syntheses of natural products (naturally produced molecules) and analogs thereof, which have been shown to exhibit antibacterial, anticancer, neurological, and immune system stimulating bioactivities have been developed. We have completed the synthesis of three of these compounds. First, the building of an all-carbon ring has allowed us to rapidly construct the molecular core of the cannabinoids (Figure 2A), which are highly desired molecules for study given their diverse biological activities. We have reported one of the shortest reaction sequences to catalytically synthesize tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) with selectivity for the correct three-dimensional structure. While these compounds are readily available naturally, the modular nature of our synthesis will allow us to alter the orange, blue, or purple portions selectively to enhance desired bioactivity, reduce undesired side effects, and improve biophysical properties. The second natural product synthesized was penienone (Figure 2B), which utilized a novel electrophile and tandem reaction sequence to make a highly sought-after cyclic synthetic building block (penultimate molecule in Figure 2B). Previous efforts to synthesize this building block would require 10?12 reactions, so our three-reaction strategy is a drastic improvement to increase efficiency and minimize waste. Again, the modular nature of the synthesis will allow us to synthesize structural analogs for bioactivity studies, which will have a positive impact on the study of disease and pharmaceutical development.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This research will also have a significant impact on other fields. For example, we have established a synthesis of an important carbon-based framework to hold reactive metal atoms for catalysis (Figure 3). Importantly, this represents a heretofore inaccessible evolution of this framework that breaks its symmetry to allow asymmetry in the reactions it catalyzes. The novelty in this catalyst complex is anticipated to lead to new reactions that provide three-dimensional structural control in the formation of new chemical bonds.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The supported research effort has had a broad educational impact at all levels, including support for a partnership with KIPP Sharpstown Junior High, which provided direct contact with disadvantaged and at-risk students to bolster their scientific understanding and desire to prepare for college. This was done through a ?Science @UH Day? that included hands-on experiments, presentations from May group undergraduate and graduate students, and a tour of UH research facilities (Figure 4). This effort will influence future educational and career directions and inspire underrepresented candidates for the physical sciences.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Fifteen graduate students and four undergraduate students were supported for some portion of their career by this grant. This support has thus far allowed seven of these students to graduate with their doctoral degrees and two with Masters degrees. Two more doctoral students from this group will graduate next year, and all three of the undergraduates are headed to graduate school to pursue their doctoral degrees. These students have been trained during this research to be mentors, write and present scientifically, generate new proposals, solve problems, and perform advanced laboratory techniques, such air-, oxygen-, and/or water-free reactions.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 07/14/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Jeremy&nbsp;A&nbsp;May</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1800499/1800499_10556244_1657831604351_Figure1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1800499/1800499_10556244_1657831604351_Figure1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1800499/1800499_10556244_1657831604351_Figure1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">New Reactions</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Jeremy May</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Jeremy&nbsp;A&nbsp;May</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 1</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1800499/1800499_10556244_1657831689403_Figure2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1800499/1800499_10556244_1657831689403_Figure2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 2\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1800499/1800499_10556244_1657831689403_Figure2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 2\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Molecular Synthesis</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Jeremy May</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Jeremy&nbsp;A&nbsp;May</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 2</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1800499/1800499_10556244_1657831812321_Figure3--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1800499/1800499_10556244_1657831812321_Figure3--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 3\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1800499/1800499_10556244_1657831812321_Figure3--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 3\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">New Catalysis</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Jeremy May</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Jeremy&nbsp;A&nbsp;May</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 3</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1800499/1800499_10556244_1657832299017_Figure4--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1800499/1800499_10556244_1657832299017_Figure4--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 4\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1800499/1800499_10556244_1657832299017_Figure4--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 4\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">KIPP Science Day at UH</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Jiun-Le Shih, Jirong Luo, Jeremy May</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Jeremy&nbsp;A&nbsp;May</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 4</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
