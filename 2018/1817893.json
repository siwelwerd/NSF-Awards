 "awd_abstract_narration": "Proteins are molecular machines that drive the processes underlying biology. The function of proteins are frequently regulated by a wide-variety of reversible chemical modifications, such as acetylation of lysine residues. While numerous such acetylations have been identified on various human proteins, their role in biology remains unclear. Many human proteins are acetylated at multiple different sites, but how these individual modifications contribute to regulation remains poorly understood. The current inability to generate target proteins homogeneously acetylated at a set of chosen sites is a major challenge. This limitation will be overcome by establishing a novel technology. This technology will allow direct modification of a target protein during its synthesis in human cells. This will enable systematic elucidation of how multi-site acetylation regulates protein function. A cross-disciplinary summer research program will be developed to train and motivate high-school students from the greater Boston area. \r\n\r\nIn the last two decades, rapid advances in analytical techniques have identified numerous human proteins that are acetylated at multiple sites. However, the daunting challenge of producing recombinant proteins in a homogeneous state of acetylation been a major roadblock. The genetic code expansion technology offers a powerful strategy to overcome this limitation, by allowing co-translational site-specific incorporation of N (epsilon)-acetyllysine (AcK) into recombinant proteins using an engineered nonsense suppressing aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase/tRNA pair. However, it is currently challenging to incorporate more than one AcK residue per protein in mammalian cells. To address this limitation, systematic engineering of the components of the mammalian translation system that limit the incorporation efficiency of AcK, will be carried out. A novel directed evolution platform for engineering these components based on their performance in live mammalian cells will be developed. The enhanced AcK-incorporation system will be used to interrogate how the function of HMGCS2 is regulated by the acetylation of three different lysine residues. Outreach efforts include a summer research program targeted to local high school students. This program called \"You Evolve a Protein!(YEP!)\" highlights the use of laboratory evolution to engineer proteins with desired properties. Starting from a fluorescent protein that emits green light, the participant will create engineered variants with altered color.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

These heterologous nonsense suppressor tRNAs often have poor intrinsic activity in mammalian cells, due to their suboptimal interaction with a non-native translation system.

However, performing directed evolution in mammalian cells has been challenging due to many technical limitations and, when we started, no established strategy was available to engineer tRNAs in mammalian cells. With the support from NSF, we have developed a strategy called virus-assisted directed evolution of tRNAs (VADER) in mammalian cells, which uses a double-sieve selection scheme to facilitate single-step enrichment of active yet orthogonal tRNA mutants from naive libraries. VADER couples the activity of the heterologous suppressor tRNA to the proliferation of adeno-associated virus, a human virus. Using VADER, we have developed improved mutants of Methanosarcina mazei pyrrolysyl-tRNA and a bacterial tyrosyl-tRNA, which are commonly used for Uaa incorporation in mammalian cells. We have further demonstrated that the improved activity of the enhanced tRNA mutants is specific for mammalian cells, likely suggesting a better interaction with the unique mammalian translation apparatus, and further highlighting the need for performing such directed evolution experiments in mammalian cells, instead of in a lower organism. The improved tRNAs were shown to improve the incorporation efficiency of a broad range of unnatural amino acids, and facilitate challenging applications, such as the site-specific incorporation of two distinct Uaas. The higher efficiency of the suppressor tRNAs also make it significantly easier to develop stable mammalian cell lines, wherein the engineered Uaa-specific aminoacyl-transfer RNA synthetase?tRNA pairs are genomically integrated. This would significantly facilitate the scale-up of this technology for commercial applications. The technology we have developed would not only expand the scope of the Uaa incorporation technology, but can also be applied for the directed evolution of biological parts in mammalian cells.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/22/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Abhishek&nbsp;Chatterjee</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImage\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation onePhoto\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1817893/1817893_10551856_1671758446970_Finaloutcomefigure--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1817893/1817893_10551856_1671758446970_Finaloutcomefigure--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"VADER selection scheme\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1817893/1817893_10551856_1671758446970_Finaloutcomefigure--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"VADER selection scheme\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">VADER couples the activity of a nonsense suppressor tRNA to the proliferation of adeno-associated virus.
