 "awd_abstract_narration": "Evaporation from tiny nanopores, owing to its high mass/heat transfer fluxes, has found widespread applications in electronics cooling, membrane distillation, solar steam generation and materials synthesis. To further improve performance of these nanopore-evaporation-associated applications, it is essential to understand the ultimate transport limit of evaporation from nanopores. This has been a long-lasting challenge because experimental investigation based on existing nanoporous membranes cannot provide much insight due to difficulty in measuring important parameters. This project will solve this big challenge by directly measuring and studying evaporation from single nanopores. New insights gained from this project will deepen our understanding of evaporation at the nanoscale and shed light on developing optimized evaporative structures. This project includes education/outreach activities for students at various academic levels. Cartoon animations and hands-on lab kits will be developed for K-12 students. Research opportunities will be provided for K-12 students and undergraduates, especially those from underrepresented groups.\r\n\r\nThe research objectives of this project are to understand the kinetic-limited evaporation from nanopores and to achieve the ultimate performance of evaporative nanoporous structures. A novel hybrid nanopore-nanochannel device design will be developed for evaporation measurements and the dependence of the kinetic-limited evaporation flux on nanopore dimension, surface properties, and operating conditions will be systematically investigated. To further understand the separate contributions of the effective evaporation area and the evaporation coefficient on kinetic-limited evaporation, evaporation from atomically thin nanopores will also be investigated. Experimental results of these studies will be compared with MD simulations to gain a complete understanding of the observed dependence. Finally, nanoporous membrane based bi-porous evaporator with optimized pore dimension and porosity will be created and the ultimate evaporation performance of such membranes will be explored.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The ultimate performance of these nanopore-evaporation-based processes is dictated by evaporation kinetics at the liquid-vapor interface, which has yet to be experimentally studied down to the single nanopore level [1].</p>\n<p>&nbsp;In this project, we have systematically studied the effects of nanoconfinement, surface wettability and operating conditions on kinetically-limited water evaporation from single nanopores. We first solved the challenge of directly measuring evaporation rate from single nanopores using a hybrid nanochannel-nanopore device design [2] (Figure 1). This device design transforms the challenging mass transport measurement (i.e. measuring evaporation rate down to ~ 0.1 fL/s) into a simple optical measurement of the receding meniscus in a 2-D nanochannel.</p>\n<p>We used this strategy to study evaporation from hydrophilic silicon-nitride nanopores with diameters down to 27 nm and found that the evaporation flux shows a strong diameter dependence with an exponent of nearly -1.5, reaching up to 11-fold of the maximum theoretical predication provided by the classical Hertz-Knudsen relation [2] (Figure 2). We then discovered that such ultrafast diameter-dependent evaporation mainly stems from evaporating thin films outside of the hydrophilic nanopores. To exclude contribution from the outer surface, we created hybrid nanochannel-nanopore devices with hydrophilic silicon-nitride nanopores but hydrophobic outer surfaces. Our results show that the true kinetically-limited evaporation flux from silicon-nitride nanopores (i.e. no contribution from outer surface) is smaller than the H-K prediction but still increases with the decreasing pore diameter [2] (Figure 2). We attributed this confinement dependence to the change of evaporation coefficient (varying from 0.08 to 0.66) in different nanoconfinements, where the nanopore surface charges can change the local proton concentration and thus change the evaporation kinetics.</p>\n<p>After studying evaporation from silicon-nitride nanopores, we explored evaporation from graphene nanopores as graphene is the thinnest and strongest material and the interactions between graphene and water can facilitate water evaporation. We created hybrid silica-nanochannel-graphene-nanopore devices (Figure 3) and measured true kinetically-limited evaporation from graphene nanoporous membranes with different pore diameters, porosity and operating temperature (Figure 4) [3]. Our results show that, despite a wide variation, the kinetic-limited water evaporation flux from graphene nanopores is larger than that from&nbsp;silicon nitride nanopores and there are linear relationships between the evaporation flux/coefficient and the reciprocal of nanopore diameter for both graphene and silicon-nitride nanopores (Figure 4). What's more, the diameter-dependent evaporation flux/coefficient from graphene nanopores does not change with the porosity and temperature, indicating the larger evaporation flux from graphene nanopores mainly results from the unique edge-water interactions and minimum contaminant accumulation at the liquid-vapor interface.</p>\n<p>Besides these studies on evaporation kinetics (for which we carefully designed the hybrid nanochannel-nanopore devices such that the evaporation menisci are nearly flat), we have also studied the effects of surface charge and confinement on the evaporation area/flux when the evaporation meniscus is fully extended. A new expression for the electrostatic disjoining pressure, which includes surface charge densities of the nanopore wall and the liquid-vapor interface, was derived for the first time. By numerically solving the governing mass/heat transport equations in the continuum limit, we unraveled four key parameters, namely the surface charge densities of the nanopore wall and the liquid-vapor interface, the pore radius, the temperature, and the relative humidity, that play important roles in determining the meniscus profile. Our results suggest that an increase of evaporation flux up to 121% can be reached when considering extended meniscus in charged nanopores with charged liquid-vapor interface (Figure 5). Consequently, we can further improve the evaporation performance from nanopores by tuning the surface charge density and hydraulic resistance for liquid transport.</p>\n<p>In addition to research, the project also provides significant training opportunities to students at graduate, undergraduate, and high-school levels. We have partnered with several education/outreach programs at BU to provide research and summer internship opportunities to female and underrepresented undergraduates and high-school students in the areas of nanoscale heat/mass transport. Specifically, we have trained 4 high school students (2 females), 1 female and 2 male underrepresented undergraduates over the course of this project. We have also trained 3 middle school teachers (1 female) through BU's RET program during the course of the project.</p>\n<p>References:</p>\n<p>[1] J. Zhong, M.A. Alibakhshi, Q. Xu, J. Riordon, Y.
