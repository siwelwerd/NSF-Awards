Reactions of elements in molten metal fluxes take place at temperatures above those used for reactions in water, and below those used in traditional solid state synthesis. This unusual temperature range promotes the discovery of new materials. Metal flux reactions also facilitate the growth of new compounds as large crystals, which allows for the use of advanced characterization techniques such as single crystal X-ray diffraction to determine atomic positions, and oriented magnetic and transport measurements to explore the directionality of magnetic and electronic behavior. The principle investigator's research group explores the synthesis of new magnetic materials using low melting mixtures of lanthanide and transition metals as a flux. Reactions of silicon with other elements in molten magnesium alloys are carried out to synthesize complex semiconducting compounds that may be useful for applications such as solar cells. Further understanding of metal flux chemistry is crucial to the advancement of synthesis science and the discovery of the next generation of magnetic and semiconducting materials. Students involved in this interdisciplinary research gain valuable experience in synthesis, a variety of characterization techniques, and critical thinking. They interact with scientists in the chemistry, physics, and materials engineering fields.    \r\nPART 2:\u00a0\u00a0 TECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\nThis project, funded by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry Program in the Division of Materials Research at NSF, investigates the synthesis of new intermetallics from metal fluxes comprised of two elements, a method that enables the formation of new metastable phases and their isolation as large crystals. Crystal structures are determined using X-ray and neutron diffraction, and magnetic and electronic properties are studied. Two areas are explored: the synthesis of a) magnetic intermetallic phases in lanthanide/transition metal eutectic fluxes, and b) semimetallic phases in magnesium-rich flux mixtures. The former produce new compounds with magnetic properties stemming from the combined contributions of both the lanthanide and the transition metal element. Developing the synthetic ability to control the formation of transition metal building blocks allows tailoring magnetic properties and improved understanding of complex phenomena such as spin glass behavior and long range magnetic ordering. Magnesium-based fluxes are proving to be fruitful growth media for metal silicides, which have potential as thermoelectric materials. Reactions of divalent metals (Ca, Sr, Ba, Eu, Yb) with silicon in Mg/Al melts yield charge-balanced semiconducting or semimetallic phases complex structure types, which are potential alternatives to telluride thermoelectrics. Additionally, researchers explore effects of varying heating profiles in order to isolate intermediate phases before their conversion to more thermodynamically favored products, as well as trends in reactivity, effects of element substitution on formation of common structural building blocks, and structure-property relationships. Furthermore, this work expands the understanding of metal flux chemistry, with the goal to control the process of these reactions and target desired compounds. Students gain valuable experience in synthesis, a variety of characterization techniques, and critical thinking. They are exposed to the interdisciplinary nature of modern science through interactions with scientists in the chemistry, physics, and materials engineering fields.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

These are of interest because of the potential for useful magnetic properties stemming from both the lanthanide and transition metals, as is seen in the strong magnets such as Nd2Fe14B that are used in electric motors and hard drives.  Our work has produced new compounds such as Pr21Fe16Te6B30, Pr21Fe8Si7C12, and La15Fe4C24H which have complex structures featuring clusters of transition metals surrounded by lanthanide cations (see figure 1).  The magnetism depends on the size of the transition metal cluster as well as the distance between the lanthanide cations. \n\nThe second class of materials that were investigated were metal silicides, grown from reactions of silicon with divalent metals (A = Ca, Sr, Ba, Eu, Yb) in magnesium-rich molten mixtures.  We have made dozens of new compounds using this method, including Eu2Yb1.11Mg10.89Si7, Ba5Yb2.26Mg16.73Si12, Eu6.7Ca1.3Mg16Si12, and Ba20Yb4.70Mg61.30Si43.  All of the compounds have related structures featuring similar building blocks (silicon surrounded by 9 metal cations; see figure 2) connected in different patterns.  The transfer of electrons from the metals to the silicon atoms lead to semimetallic behavior.  The complex structures and semimetal character make these compounds possible thermoelectric materials.  Thermoelectrics can create a voltage if they are placed in a thermal gradient, and are of great interest as a way to use the waste heat that is given off by most energy production processes. \n\nBroader impacts\n\nIn addition to advancing knowledge of magnetic materials and thermoelectric compounds, this project also provided valuable training for scientists.
