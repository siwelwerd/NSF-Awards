 "awd_abstract_narration": "More than 6000 years ago, small regional polities emerged for the first time in what is now northeastern China. These Hongshan societies represented the early stages in the evolution of forms of organization that integrated the people of different local communities into networks of social, political, and economic relationships. They thus represent the very beginnings of the much larger-scale, highly integrated societies in which most of the world's population now lives. These regional societies were still very small; each including only 1,000 people or so in a territory about 10 km across. Some families clearly enjoyed more social prestige and influence than others, attributable primarily to their special religious and ritual roles. Dozens if not hundreds of such small regional societies were connected with each other through a common focus on a complex of extraordinary ceremonial structures in which very highly prestigious individuals were buried. This complex at Niuheliang seems to have functioned primarily as a religious pilgrimage center, with a relatively small community of permanent residents, who lived in a hilly region with very little agricultural potential. Under the direction of Dr. Robert Drennan, doctoral candidate Weiyu Ran will carry out fieldwork at the nearby Hongshan-period village of Shangchaoyanggou to investigate how the provisioning of this pilgrimage center was organized. Several villages, of which Shangchaoyanggou was one, were located a few kilometers from the ritual facilities of Niuheliang  in much more favorable locations for farming and may have specialized in producing food to sustain the nearby pilgrimage center. If this is the kind of organization that had emerged in Hongshan times, it represented a major step toward more highly developed economies and greater interdependence between households and local communities than ever before.\r\n\r\nMr. Ran will evaluate this hypothetical reconstruction of early Hongshan economies and the organization that sustained the pilgrimage center at Niuheliang by collecting data on the cultural remains left behind thousands of years ago by the inhabitants of Shangchaoyanggou. The parts of this refuse that have been preserved for so long are mostly fragments of broken pottery vessels and stone tools. If Shangchaoyanggo focused heavily on agricultural production then the data Mr. Ran collects will show high proportions of agricultural tools and low proportions of the elaborate pottery vessels that signaled social prestige (when compared to the artifacts of ordinary Hongshan communities or to those remaining at residential locations near the most important ritual structures). If this is what the research results show, it will be clear that in at least some instances  a very early focus on religion and ritual as a principal means of social integration can lead to the development of the more advanced economic systems upon which even larger-scale political integration eventually was based.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
