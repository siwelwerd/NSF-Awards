 "awd_abstract_narration": "Understanding extreme climate events like floods and droughts, which have major impacts on society and ecosystems, has become particularly important in light of potential future changes in climatic extremes.  Paleoclimate data have played a critical role in placing recent hydroclimate extremes within a longer-term context, but biases in paleoclimate proxies remain a major challenge for the reconstruction and interpretation of past climate extremes. This is particularly applicable to the North American West Coast where a limited number of seasonal extreme precipitation events account for a large proportion of annual precipitation totals. This research will integrate historical climatology and dendroclimatology to address pre-instrumental capture of extremes through a focus on the 1800s, a time period including a range of climate extremes that are not represented in the instrumental record. \r\n\r\nSpecifically, the aims of this project are to: (1) extract 19th century historical data from archives and repositories to derive subseasonal precipitation and snow frequency reconstructions; (2) use tree-ring data to assess the ability of existing records to capture hydroclimatic extremes (with a focus on atmospheric river events) and seasonally-specific precipitation on the West Coast; and (3) integrate historical and tree-ring data to create spatial climate surfaces for extreme events in the 1800s and use reanalysis data, gridded paleoclimate reconstruction data, and paleoclimate model output to assess synoptic climate drivers of those extremes.\r\n\r\nThe potential Broader Impacts (B.I.) include improved understanding of extreme climate events at a seasonal level has broad societal implications, as these extremes are costly hazards with implications for agriculture, water supply, power generation, fire, and other sectors of society. The information derived from this research is potentially useful to water managers, climate modelers, and others who are interested in the characterization of past extreme events, including impacts and driving mechanisms, as well as future hydroclimate extremes. \r\n\r\nFurther impacts of this project include: (1) education and training of graduate students in research methods and dissemination, science communication, and educational outreach; (2) involving undergraduates in hands-on research experiences, allowing them to work through the scientific process; (3) contribution of new, spatially explicit climate reconstructions to the NOAA Paleoclimatology repository; and (4) capitalizing on the excitement of our research themes to engage future generations of scientists through K-12 educational outreach activities involving a partnership with the Morehead Planetarium and Science Center.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Human&#8208;caused climate warming may already be increasing the frequency and severity of these types of extremes. To understand the changes that are occurring, recent climate extremes must be compared to climate extremes that have occurred in previous centuries. One particularly relevant time period is the end of the Little Ice Age in the mid-1800s. This time period appears to have had a range and sequence of climate extremes that are not represented in the recent instrumental record. Sources of information available to study climate in the mid-1800s include paleoclimate data such as tree-ring records, observed and modeled climate data, and historical records, which are widespread on the USA West Coast in the 1800s and include fort records, settler diaries, and ship logs. Through our research for this project, we extracted 19th century historical climate data from archives, assessed the ability of trees to capture precipitation extremes, created new monthly and seasonal reconstructions of West Coast precipitation, and brought our different data sources together to create spatial climate surfaces of extreme events in the 1800s so that we could assess what may have caused these extremes.</p>\n<p>We used the extensive tree-ring data available for western North America to establish the extent to which existing tree&#8208;ring records capture precipitation extremes and evaluate climate factors that might cause uneven extreme capture. We found that while many trees record dry extremes more often than wet extremes, this is not universal and varies by location, season, and year. This information was then used to design and implement alternative tree-ring reconstructions to improve seasonal records and extreme capture, and we were able to create reconstructions of precipitation and runoff at both seasonal and monthly time steps for river basins throughout the west coast of the USA. We found that these monthly records more accurately identified the very wet and very dry years in most watersheds. We also used a model that \"grows\" tree cells based on temperature, precipitation, and other environmental data to experiment with extreme precipitation scenarios and test how tree growth is affected by changes in timing and intensity of precipitation. Our experiments with increased precipitation concentration and those that used projections of future climate change consistently caused tree growth to decrease. This is important because it could affect future tree growth expectations (since fewer, stronger storms and higher temperatures, both likely in a warming climate, were shown to reduce growth in our modeled scenarios).</p>\n<p>Through multiple trips to historical archives, as well as accessing online collections such as whaling logs, a substantial amount of new historical information about western USA weather and climate in the 1800s was collected and transcribed. We compared our tree-ring and historical data with a reanalysis (combination of model and observations) dataset that extends into the 1800s. We found that our tree-ring and historical data tell very similar stories about climate extremes at the end of the Little Ice Age, while the reanalysis data are often not in alignment with the tree ring or historical data in the mid-1800s. We were able to use our historical and tree-ring data to estimate the climate conditions (for example, El Nino) that likely caused the climate extremes for each year in the 1840s-1860s.</p>\n<p>This increased understanding of extreme climate events at a seasonal level has broad societal implications, as these extremes are costly hazards with implications for agriculture, water supply, power generation, fire, and other sectors. We made all of our new monthly and seasonal tree-ring reconstructions publicly available online, and we also posted open-source code to screen tree-ring records for extreme capture. Several undergraduate students were able to be involved in hands-on research working on both the tree-ring science and historical archive transcription parts of this project. A graduate student worked as a research assistant on this project and was trained in computer coding and tree-ring science. We also engaged future generations of scientists in K-12 educational outreach activities through a partnership with the Morehead Planetarium and Science Center (MPSC). The researchers on this project completed the MPSC Inspiring Meaningful Programs and Communication through Science program. The goal of this program is to train scientists in public communication and ready them to communicate their passion for science to diverse audiences across North Carolina. We worked with MPSC staff to create laser-cut \"tree-ring cores\" based on actual data from a Sierra Nevada snowpack reconstruction, which was then turned into a puzzle game for K-12 students.&nbsp; We used these materials to conduct a variety of educational outreach activities, including multiple SciMatch classroom visits in 6th-8th grade classrooms, a STEMville Family Science Night expo and a presentation for the STEMville Science Symposium.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 11/15/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Erika&nbsp;K&nbsp;Wise</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1802024/1802024_10558173_1667936377737_TRgphSmallMulti--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1802024/1802024_10558173_1667936377737_TRgphSmallMulti--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Tree-ring reconstructed atmospheric pressure patterns\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1802024/1802024_10558173_1667936377737_TRgphSmallMulti--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Tree-ring reconstructed atmospheric pressure patterns\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Departures from normal atmospheric pressure during the 1840s-1860s, reconstructed using tree-ring records.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Erika Wise</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Erika&nbsp;K&nbsp;Wise</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Tree-ring reconstructed atmospheric pressure patterns</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1802024/1802024_10558173_1667936941966_PercentEXT--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1802024/1802024_10558173_1667936941966_PercentEXT--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Tree-ring records of precipitation extremes\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1802024/1802024_10558173_1667936941966_PercentEXT--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Tree-ring records of precipitation extremes\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Percentage of dry (top) and wet (bottom) water&#8208;year precipitation extremes captured in western North America tree rings sites.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Erika Wise</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Erika&nbsp;K&nbsp;Wise</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Tree-ring records of precipitation extremes</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1802024/1802024_10558173_1667939112423_SeasonalStatsLS--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1802024/1802024_10558173_1667939112423_SeasonalStatsLS--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Monthly tree-ring records of precipitation and runoff\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1802024/1802024_10558173_1667939112423_SeasonalStatsLS--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Monthly tree-ring records of precipitation and runoff\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">New tree-ring records of precipitation and runoff in watersheds along the U.S. West Coast at a monthly timescale improved records of past dry (left) and wet (right) extremes in precipitation (top) and runoff (bottom).
