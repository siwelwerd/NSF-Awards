 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Planning Grants for Engineering Research Centers competition was run as a pilot solicitation within the ERC program. Planning grants are not required as part of the full ERC competition, but intended to build capacity among teams to plan for convergent, center-scale engineering research.\r\n\r\nThis project will explore approaches for the organization of a large engineering center focused on next-generation energy storage and harvesting, advanced structural materials, and improved water filtration membranes. The work is organized around two workshops, the first of which will invite stakeholders from industry, nonprofit organizations and charities, and venture capital firms to establish a value-proposition for the potential Center. This will help establish skills and knowledge that are needed to maximize the efficiency of the Center. Potential team members will then be identified with a focus on individuals with established records in needed areas. A special emphasis will be assigned to individuals whose expertise include multiple areas as potential \"bridge-builders\" to create an interconnected expertise network. A second workshop will then focus on team-building exercises that promote education of team capabilities, align goals and expectations, and identify any remaining skill or knowledge gaps. Assessment efforts will focus on addressing the hypothesis that a value-centered strategy and team analytic approaches will promote alignment of team and individual goals and expectations.\r\n\r\nRecent breakthroughs in the self-assembly of polymers and composites provide an opportunity to address many of today's grand challenges.  Self-assembled materials may lead to next-generation devices for energy storage and harvesting, structural materials with multifunctionality and enhanced mechanical properties, and improved water filtration membranes.  A new approach to simultaneously sinter ceramics and organics near 100 C termed cold sintering provides opportunities for new compositions and control of microstructure not previously possible.  Translating these scientific advances to products that impact society will require a deep integration of expertise from different disciplines.  As such, developing a \"convergent\" approach for an Engineering Research Center is crucial to accelerate the implementation of scientific discoveries for the benefit of society.  By documenting and assessing efforts, the community will be informed of best practices and project outcomes, and thereby this project will help address the need for research on teams that make up large engineering centers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

In particular, the intellectual merits of the work focused on hosting workshops and meetings to (1) refine the value proposition of our center with the help of industry practitioners, (2) promote convergence between faculty working on different fields, including business management, sociology, materials science, mechanical engineering, aerospace engineering, architectural engineering and energy engineering, (3) promote convergence between academic and industrial researchers, (4) align goals and expectations of researchers from multiple institutions, including minority-serving institutions.  Furthermore, we recruited the help of a consulting firm, the Nexight group, to facilitate workshop planning and execution, as well as documenting results. \n\nIn addition to various small-group meetings with industry and faculty from various institutions, three workshops were run as part of the activities of this project.  Funding from this Award supported the PIs, various participants, and an undergraduate student who carried out literature reviews and basic calculations to identify various opportunities in waste reduction of composites.\n\nThe initial workshop focused on refining the value proposition for a future Engineering Research Center.  A panel was hosted at Penn State\u2019s Materials Day focused on the grand challenges of polymers and composites.  The overall topic was left vague to encourage new ideas and discussion.\n\nHaving identified an overall theme for the center with the help of industry practitioners in the first workshop, a second workshop was held to refine the vision and begin to develop goals and proposed activities.  Attendees included faculty from Northwestern University, Penn State, University of Pennsylvania, Rowan University, and the University of Houston, for a total of about 20 faculty.  Participants included faculty from business, sociology (labor relations), chemical engineering, mechanical engineering, aerospace engineering, and materials science. \n\nA third workshop was held to help further integrate faculty from various disciplines and further refine activities to be proposed for a new ERC.  About 30 participants included faculty from business, sociology (labor relations), chemical engineering, mechanical engineering, architectural engineering, engineering science and mechanics, aerospace engineering, and materials science.  This workshop was also crucial to integrate faculty from two minority-serving institutions (CCNY and Clark Atlanta) and a collaborator from a foreign university (University of Sheffield).  In addition to Sheffield, CCNY and Clark Atlanta, participants included faculty from Northwestern University, Penn State, University of Pennsylvania, Rowan University, and Columbia University.\n\nA broader impact of the work was the education of various faculty at multiple institutions in a variety of areas, including convergence and transdiciplinarity, team formation, challenges and opportunities in diversity and inclusion, opportunities for leveraging industrial collaborators to promote workforce development, leadership and management, and team science. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/13/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Enrique D Gomez"
