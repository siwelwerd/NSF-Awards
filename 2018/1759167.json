 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will advance efforts of the Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program to better understand and promote practices that increase middle school girls and minorities motivations and capacities to pursue careers in STEM fields. By developing digital mathematics and engineering-based challenges, the project is designed to motivate students to pursue STEM fields. Students participate in teams to create and pitch entrepreneurial ideas. Using a personalized avatar, students will navigate a learning map, develop a portfolio of work products, ideas and experiences, identify peer partners and form a team, and collaboratively prepare for an entrepreneurial start-up competition.\r\n\r\nThis project leverages an entrepreneurial sprit to explore STEM careers through project-developed Innovation Challenges. The research component will investigate the project's effect on the motivation of middle school girls and minorities to persist in STEM courses with the overall goal to improve the participation of women and minorities in STEM careers. Specifically, the project will investigate how engaging underrepresented (STEM) students in carefully designed innovation challenge tasks that leverage an entrepreneurial spirit will affect student orientation and achievement outcomes such as self-efficacy, socio-emotional learning, and academic growth along learning trajectories. The proposed digitally-based mathematics challenges are framed within two distinct approaches. First, the project-based STEM activities are connected to improvement in academic competency. Second, the project uses avatars to encourage positive student-self-perception and collaboration as well as to bring the learning experiences closer to middle grades interests. This study has the potential to strengthen the existing knowledge base on the effect of digital learning systems on student learning and motivation based on its theoretical foundation, focus on meaningful measures, and connections to previous STEM projects.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The framework positions students as entrepreneurs, tasking them with inventing innovative and entrepreneurial viable solutions to a real-world, math-focused challenge. Students work collaboratively through a design cycle (see Figure), iteratively brainstorming, researching, prototyping, testing, refining, and ultimately pitching their solutions to a panel of judges. As they work, students are frequently asked to explain and defend their thinking to their teachers and external &ldquo;experts&rdquo; and practice judges, creating opportunities for students to iterate on their solutions. Through this iterative process, students identify and seek out support to fill gaps in their mathematical knowledge that are preventing them from building viable prototypes. At the end of the process, students participate in a final pitch competition, delivering five-minute entrepreneurial pitches to a panel of external judges.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\" dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"><br /></span></p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\" dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Middle School Math-Focused Design Challenges and Support Materials: </span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">To focus students&rsquo; entrepreneurial thinking and elicit specific standards-aligned mathematics, nine math-focused entrepreneurial design challenges were developed.

The set of nine challenges (see Figure) created through this project address a range of real-world contexts and middle school mathematics concepts, including, food waste (ratios and percents), rating and ranking algorithms (functions), and smartphone addiction (statistics and data representation), among others. Each challenge also includes a set of materials to scaffold students&rsquo; solution building. These include a set of curated resources to jumpstart and guide students&rsquo; research; a Key Business Proposition to help students describe how specific features to their solution create value for consumers; a technical brief and rubric for describing the specifics and underlying mathematics of the solution; a math resource to help students learn the math needed to prototype their solution; a set of technological tools for building their prototype; and pitch resources for building a convincing pitch.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\" dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"><br /></span></p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\" dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Community Engagement:</span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"> 679 students and 46 teachers engaged directly with the D&amp;P Challenges in STEM framework and challenges during the project through in-house studies, local classroom implementations, NCSU-led pitch virtual and district-wide pitch competitions, and professional learning workshops. 696 teachers serving approximately 45,000 students accessed project materials through the JASON Learning website. These implementations shed light on how entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial pitch competitions can support student engagement and center targeted mathematics learning within STEM design challenges. Specifically, by allowing students the autonomy to identify and solve personally and socially relevant problems, the framework empowered them to draw on their out-of-school interests, take ownership of their solutions, self-monitor their progress, go beyond the minimum requirements, and defend and justify their solutions, even when questioned by adults and STEM professionals. The math-focused criteria of the challenge, the support materials, and the prototyping requirements provided an authentic way to bound the mathematics students needed and used when prototyping their solutions (Belcher, 2020). The final pitch competition established external accountability that promoted sustained engagement and continual reflection and iteration on both the entrepreneurial and mathematical specifications of their solutions. Lastly, the project shed light on how entrepreneurship can be a flexible and effective way of connecting in-school STEM learning, especially mathematics, to career opportunities. By highlighting a diverse set of STEM professionals and encouraging students to draw on their out-of-school interests, the D&amp;P Challenges in STEM framework presented students with concrete examples of possible STEM careers.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\" dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"><br /></span></p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\" dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">In conclusion, the development and implementation of the D&amp;P Challenges in STEM framework represents a significant advancement in math education.
