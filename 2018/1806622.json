 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the discovery of a Higgs boson at the LHC, the Standard Model appears to be complete although profound questions remain unanswered. One such mystery is the origin of the matter-antimatter asymmetry of the universe (baryogenesis) and the nature of dark matter. This program of research is centered on the CMS experiment currently running at the proton-proton Large Hadron Collider (LHC)at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland. This research will deepen our understanding of the Higgs boson using data from the CMS experiment to elucidate the connection between the physics of Higgs bosons and new physics beyond the Standard Model. This work will also support the upgrade of the CMS forward pixel detector for the high-luminosity LHC, with a focus on the design, selection, and testing of a read-out chip. In addition, a study will be carried out to understand the reasons why students decide to leave or remain in a physics major at UIC.\r\n\r\nIn the Standard Model, about one out of sixty Higgs boson events produced at the LHC is produced in association with a Z boson. Measuring this rare process will be potentially sensitive to the influence of new physics. Further, this final state can be produced by the decay of an additional, heavier Higgs boson with different symmetry properties from the observed one. Such particles are predicted by many theories and can potentially answer the question of baryogenesis. Dark matter particles may also be produced at the LHC, but their experimental signature would be ambiguous. Associated production of a Higgs boson may be a unique way to flag these interactions and discover this elusive particle. This effort will develop new experimental tools and analyses for a decay channel of the Higgs boson, and will have other applications in collider data analysis. The second aspect of this research is to upgrade the CMS forward pixel tracker, focusing on readout chips that exceed current capabilities for high bandwidth, low threshold, and radiation tolerance. The work will focus on testing prototype chips and contributing to the design of the CMS pixel readout chip, so that the new detector will be ready for construction. In addition, through data collection, interviews, and comparison with other universities, understanding of the reasons affecting students' decision to stay with or leave the physics major will be improved.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis award funded the research in experimental high energy particle physics by the group lead by Prof. Corrinne Mills at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC).  Our work aims to understand the fundamental laws of Nature by exploring particle interactions at the highest attainable energies, and smallest attainable distance scales.  We work at the best place in the world to do that: the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in Geneva, Switzerland, where we are members of the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment.  CMS is simultaneously a scientific collaboration of over 3000 scientists (including students) and engineers, and a multipurpose particle detector capable of recording in detail the features of the proton-proton collision events produced every 25 ns by the LHC. \n\nMy research focuses specifically on Higgs bosons as a tool to search for physics beyond the Standard Model.  The Standard Model describes nearly all observed particle phenomena with stunning accuracy, but profound questions remain outside of its scope.  One that especially motivates me is baryogenesis ? the fact that the matter and antimatter produced in the Big Bang did not all immediately recombine and annihilate moments afterwards.  This is in essence a demand for a new law of nature, because the Standard Model does not allow enough matter to survive annihilation after the Big Bang and for the universe to therefore exist. \n\nOne candidate for solving the problem of baryogenesis is additional Higgs bosons.  These also appear as an element of many theories for physics beyond the Standard Model.  Part of my approach is to search directly for these new particles, which can have spectacular signatures in the CMS detector.  A project in progress, that this funding helped launch, is a search for two very heavy Higgs bosons.  They are so heavy that the lighter of the two decays to a pair of top quarks, the most massive known fundamental particle.  My group also searches indirectly for new Higgs bosons or other new particles by studying in detail the Higgs boson that was first observed in 2012.  We recently completed, partially supported by this funding, a measurement of the Higgs boson in a rare final state. \n\nMy Higgs boson measurement and search program focuses on rare processes and will be fully realized only in the larger dataset of the high-luminosity LHC (HL- LHC). Scheduled to start in 2027, the HL-LHC will bring an order of magnitude more integrated luminosity relative to what we have now. To identify and record the rare events of interest among the expected 140-200 interactions per bunch crossing, for ten years, will challenge the limits of detector technology. Nearly every part of the detector will be upgraded. The charged-particle tracker will be completely replaced to improve its granularity, expand its geometrical acceptance, and to tolerate a radiation environment unprecedented in collider physics.\n\nSupported by this award, my group has had a major role in testing sensors for the pixel tracking detector.  These thin (250 microns) rectangles of silicon are finely segmented with implanted electrodes that can detect the passage of particles.  The pixel tracker consists of layers of these sensors and their readout electronics immediately surrounding the particle collision point.  As such, they are crossed by a tremendous number of energetic particles, which gradually damages the sensor.  Our detectors are designed to be resilient to this damage, but my group confirms the robustness of the design by measuring their performance before and after firing an intense beam of protons through them, using facilities at Fermilab.  During this grant, we have demonstrated that sensors can still function well after being crossed by a number of particles comparable to what is expected from the HL-LHC. \n\nA key broader impact of this work is the training of graduate and undergraduate students and postdoctoral researchers in cutting-edge data analysis and instrumentation.  This broad education prepares them for jobs inside and outside of academia that require technical competence as well as the ability to tackle open-ended problems.  Supporting students from underrepresented and minoritized backgrounds is integral to our group?s mission, aided by the fact that UIC is an urban, broad-access, minority-serving Research 1 university.  The research group directly supported by this grant consisted entirely of women, and the test-beam team, which is drawn from several NSF-supported universities contributing to the tracker upgrade, is about 50% women and included people from a broad range of racial and national backgrounds.  Finally, this award has supported me in learning the factors affecting undergraduate success in physics, and prepared me to join a small group of colleagues to study this in detail at UIC and follow through with any needed changes. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/29/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Corrinne Mills"
