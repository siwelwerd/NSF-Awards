 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports participation of graduate students, postdocs and junior faculty from the US in the International Conference on  Computability, Complexity and Randomness (CCR 2018) 17-21 December, 2018,  Universidad Andres Bello, Santiago de Chile. This conference is the 13th in a series of conferences run as Computability, Complexity and Randomness (CCR), which deal with problems at the interface of mathematics and computer science where the notion of randomness plays a central role. Although randomness is a primitive notion in probability theory, this alone does not help to determine when an individual mathematical object can be considered as random for a given application. It does not help either to understand how applications will behave on individual random inputs. Also one may require the notion of randomness relative to different models of computation, and possibly consider randomness in a grey scale down to notions of anti-randomness. Another main question is how to define, and perhaps construct, explicit instances of random objects. These problems meet at classical computability theory, computational complexity theory, probability theory, information theory and the theory of dynamical systems.\r\n\r\nThis CCR conference will continue to disseminate the expertise that has been rapidly developing in the area and foster new collaborations. CCR 2018 will be held at the Mathematics Department of Universidad Andres Bello, which is associated to the internationally recognized Center for Mathematical Modeling (CMM) of the University of Chile.  CCR 2018 is sponsored by the Association for Symbolic Logic.
