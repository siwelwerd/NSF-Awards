 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is still unknown when brains first appeared during the early history of life. The ways in which major brain parts that are structurally distinctive have changed over evolutionary time are also poorly understood. These knowledge gaps are partly due to the fact that fossil brains are rare and have been difficult to study. This project features scientists from three collaborating laboratories who will pool their resources to identify a set of invertebrate brain centers that mediate learning and memory. Structural and functional similarities and differences among these areas will be established across modern insect and crustacean species. The major question this research is answering is whether these brain centers share common genetic and computational attributes due to the brain?s fundamental organization being inherited by the descendants from a common ancestor; or, because brains that have arisen independently in different invertebrate groups are not able to perform certain functions unless brain areas that give them these same abilities have also arisen independently. These questions will be answered by precisely measuring the brain structures in fossilized invertebrate animals and comparing their basic arrangements with modern counterparts. The broader impact of this research will be to identify invertebrate proxies of the learning-and-memory brain centers found in vertebrate animals alive today, including humans. Identification of such proxies will inform us about how brains have evolved, and will contribute to a broader understanding of how memory centers are organized. The results will impact theories of, and research on, neural networks and artificial intelligence, and at the same time the scientists carrying out this research will develop novel strategies for identifying genealogical correspondence of brain structures across a very broad range of species. Brains analyzed for this research will be digitally reconstructed in 3D and uploaded to an open-source database for education and research purposes. The research will also provide advanced neuroscience structural analysis and genomics training to students from diverse backgrounds.\r\n\r\nThe neuronal organization and circuit properties of insect mushroom bodies are well known, as are their functional properties for learning and memory. While the existence of mushroom-body-like centers exist across arthropods, it is not known whether these phenotypically or genotypically correspond to the centers in insects. The planned research will identify mushroom body-like centers across a broad range of species, analyze their discrete neural arrangements, circuit organization, and molecular attributes. These comparisons will identify the species within and outside Arthropoda that possess functional and morphological correspondences in these structures. Transcriptomics will address whether phenotypically-corresponding centers share common genomic attributes, and whether there are unique genetic networks that define arthropod mushroom bodies or whether these networks differentiate mushroom bodies in different groups of arthropods such as in insects and crustaceans. The identification of broad phenotypic and genotypic homology of these centers across a broad phyletic spectrum would suggest an ancient origin of these learning and memory centers. Equally intriguing would be results suggesting convergent evolution of learning and memory centers across taxa.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

All of those relate to the brain and central nervous system. While a handful of researchers have looked at a few of the more obvious crustaceans, our general knowledge has until now been dismally poor. For example, several much-cited studies in the 1970s and&rsquo;80&rsquo;s omitted that part of the crustacean brain situated in the eyestalk, missing the visual centers and learning and memory centers that exist only there. Brain regions that correspond to those in insects such as for learning and memory, sensory integration, decision-making was simply written as absent.</span></p>\n<p><span>The present project clarifies such omissions and relates the detailed circuit and chemical anatomies of those crucial and elaborate centers (Fig. 1, 2) to the phylogenetic position of the total group Crustacea (Fig. 3). The project&rsquo;s principal investigator, students and trainees studied every available group of crustaceans to explore four questions addressed to those nervous systems. 1) do crustacean and insect brains correspond? The answer is that across insects&rsquo; brain organization is tightly conserved: hardly any major innovations other than those leading to divergences ascribed to local synaptic connectivity. 2) do crustaceans have the same kind of centers that characterized insect brains? The answer is that the more basal groups (meaning those closer to ancestral lineages) have many similarities with insect brains, particularly the mushroom bodies of mantis shrimps whereas the more derived (&ldquo;advanced&rdquo;) groups such as hermit crabs and &ldquo;real&rdquo; crabs show fascinating novelties associated with their learning and memory centers, as well as centers entirely unknown in insects. 3) Were crustacean brains more complex than those of insects? The answer is that brains of pelagic crustaceans occupying the open ocean, an almost uniform ecology, show considerable simplification as do certain species of &ldquo;pill bugs&rdquo; and &ldquo;sand hoppers&rdquo; that lived in featureless ecologies on the seabed or shore. The question whether crustaceans living in very different habitats have brains that reflect those divergent scenarios became ever more obvious as our research progressed from more &rdquo;primitive&rdquo; taxa to more recent ones, &ldquo;recent&rdquo; being indicated by molecular phylogenies constructed by other researchers. It became clear that crustaceans that negotiated highly complex ecologies, such as mantis shrimps that hunt and ambush prey, possessed the most elaborate of brain and sensory systems. 4) did we resolve distinctions of brain organization across different crustacean species that told us anything about brain evolution. The answer was an obvious affirmation (Fig. 3). However, although some spectacularly divergent brain centers denote the most &ldquo;intelligent&rdquo; groups, the crabs and their imitators, the hermit crabs, there is still much to discover with regard to matching the ensemble of divergent centers in, say, different species to their ecologies. Brains have evolved to filter critical features of their ecology that support their host&rsquo;s survival. What the project achieved was to reveal the fascinating, and esthetically complex brains of this group (Figs. 1, 2) in the context of their behaviors and habits. Crustaceans are mainly hidden from us, yet the health of the oceans, and hence the planet, and thus our survival, depends on their existence and protection.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 01/24/2024<br>\nModified by: Nicholas&nbsp;J&nbsp;Strausfeld</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1754798/1754798_10549658_1706132518966_Figure_3--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1754798/1754798_10549658_1706132518966_Figure_3--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"phylogenetic organization of learning and memory centers in crustaceans\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1754798/1754798_10549658_1706132518966_Figure_3--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"phylogenetic organization of learning and memory centers in crustaceans\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Figure 3.
