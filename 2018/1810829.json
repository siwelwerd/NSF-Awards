 "awd_abstract_narration": "Science faces significant challenges in relation to replicability of studies. These challenges affect prediction models used in a broad spectrum of business, scientific, and social activities. The investigators have identified underutilized opportunities to make most prediction modeling techniques more likely to produce replicable results by training them on multiple studies, and rewarding good replicability in this training phase.  Recent work indicates that this novel and general strategy provides insight into the replicability of predictions, and is a promising venue for systematic improvement.  As many areas of science and technology are becoming data-rich, multiple datasets are more commonly available for training, and it is also more important that they be simultaneously considered and systematically used for improving replicability. Steps towards more easily replicable predictions would increase public confidence in the scientific process, facilitate dissemination of results, and robustify public engagement with science and technology. \r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to make progress in the area of cross-study replication of predictions. The investigators have identified two fundamental and underutilized opportunities: 1) to train on multiple studies; 2) to leverage ensembles of prediction models, each trained on one, or a subset, of the studies. The combination of these two elements can be used to design robust prediction algorithms that are trained to incorporate replicability across different contexts and populations. In this project, the investigators propose to implement and evaluate specific prediction techniques within this paradigm; to investigate their statistical properties theoretically and empirically; to compare them to existing alternative multi-study statistical methods; and to build free, open-source software to implement the successful strategies.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Scientific predictions are more valuable when their accuracy is stable across similar studies. In this project (NSF-1810829), we proposed and investigated a novel and general strategy for multi-study prediction. It uses collections of related studies to train robust prediction algorithms that incorporate the aim of replicability in different contexts and populations. Our approach is to utilize and combine multiple prediction models, each trained on a single study, and weight them to reward those that perform well outside their training study. We call this approach multi-study ensembling. \n\nOur work resulted in four categories of scientific outcomes: \n\n1) we designed a variety of specific prediction techniques within this paradigm;\n\n2) we investigated their statistical properties theoretically and empirically;\n\n3) we systematically benchmarked them against existing alternative multi-study statistical methods;\n\n4) we built free, open-source software to implement the successful strategies.\n\nThese have resulted in 17 papers / preprints, 8 conference presentations, 2 software packages and additional free code. One of the papers (Yang et al NAR Genomics and Bioinformatics 2020), is currently listed as the most cited in the journal\u2019s history.\n\nOverall, we offered strong evidence that multi-study ensembling can bring substantial progress in replicability and stability of prediction performance.\n\nBroader Impacts \n\nEducational: All funded activities were carried out in conjunction with training postdoctoral fellows,Ph.D., master, and undergraduate students, through hands-on research experience, participation/presentations in lab meetings, and participation in professional conferences where appropriate. The PIs served as advisors or mentors for trainees. All trainees contributed directly to accomplishing the award's goals, although for most we were able to leverage support from other mechanisms, and thus amplify the impact of the funding we received from the NSF. Several of these training activities took place in collaboration with other colleagues, involving a total of 5 institutions (Harvard, MIT, Smith, Boston University, and Brown). Also, PhD students were involved in mentoring of undergraduates. In total, we supported 6 PhD theses, 1 master thesis and 2 undergraduate honors theses. 7 of the students where female and one from an underrepresented minority. These steps will contribute to development of a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce. \n\nSocietal: Science faces a significant challenge in regard to replicability, highlighted in recent high-profile reports from the NAS.
