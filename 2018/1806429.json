 "awd_abstract_narration": "PART 1\r\nThe 2018 Conference of the National Society of Black Physicists is a combined professional scientific meeting and a student development conference.  Open to all, the NSBP conference provides more than 300 undergraduate and graduate students opportunities to participate in research seminars, research presentations and professional relationship building across various subfields of physics.  In addition to participating in seminars and sharing their research, participants are provided specific academic and career advising and strategies for persisting in the field of physics today.  The NSBP conference offers support for women and under-represented minorities in technical fields; it is one of America's most recognizable annual broadening participation STEM events. Support for the conference is provided by the Directorate for the Mathematical and Physical Sciences, the Directorate of  Geosciences, and the Directorate of Educational and Human Resources.  \r\n\r\nPART 2\r\nThe National Society of Black Physicists (NSBP) and the Associated Universities, Inc. (AUI) are collaborating to present the 2018 Annual Conference of the NSBP.  The conference is both a professional scientific meeting and a student development event whose main goal is to increase the numbers of under-represented minorities involved in the physics academic pipeline, as well as the broader US STEM workforce pipeline.  Based on the understanding that socialization among seasoned members of a field and early career workers increases the chances for younger persons to develop career identities and success skills, the meeting aims to promote the participation of African Americans in the physical sciences. The influence of professional scientific meetings on the outcomes of broadening participation of underrepresented minorities is of particular interest at the conference.  The conference's unique attendee pool will facilitate the development of student-professional mentor pairings.  An external evaluation of the proposed project will provide the framework for longitudinal data collection by integrating data collection methods into the conference communications and planned activities.  An external evaluation will focus on judging the value of the conference in terms of its ability to achieve the goals related to both broader impacts and intellectual merit criteria.  The intellectual merit of the awarded work rests in discerning features and practices that are relevant to interactions, both tangible and intangible, that may contribute to career identity formation, workforce development and career success in URMs in physics.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The annual scientific conference is part of NSBP's plan to increase the pool of African American physicists available in the academic pipeline and physics workforce. The 2018 NSBP Conference, theme Scientific Passion and Progress: Meeting the Challenge, was held in Columbus, Ohio from Nov. 4 - 7th. The meeting was planned and conducted jointly by NSBP, AUI and Strategic Partnerships International. The 411 conference attendees consisted of 289 students, 84 faculty and post-docs and 38 vendors/recruiters.</p>\n<p>The 2018 Conference provided mentorship opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students and early career researchers, increased participant access to recruiters, offered networking opportunities and informed the broader physics community on best practices. The 2019 conference also provided an opportunity for students to have close interactions with professional physicists and exposure to ongoing scientific research. In addition to being a meeting that promotes the persistence of physics students in the academic-workforce pipeline, the conference hosted high-level research talks, and provided opportunities for peer-to-peer interactions and allowed students the opportunity for exposure to the broader science and engineering community.</p>\n<p>External conference evaluation conducted by USC Rossier shows conference participants shared numerous positive experiences. They appreciated the intimate nature and size of the conference and felt it fostered more genuine and natural connections, as compared to larger professional meetings. Major themes that emerged included an appreciation for (1) the co-location of meals,&nbsp;events and exhibition spaces, (2) NSBP as a conference home, and (3) key elements that made the&nbsp;conference effective for networking. Holding the opening reception and coffee breaks in a shared space with the exhibition was an&nbsp;effective way to encourage attendees, specifically students, to interact and engage with the exhibitors.&nbsp;The conferences small size was mentioned as a key factor in community-building. In terms of&nbsp;specific conference elements, the initial opening reception, the&nbsp;networking luncheon as well as the supportive nature of sessions, workshops and posters contributed&nbsp;to participants experiencing NSBP as a conference home. Also, many students spoke about a unique ease they experienced in forming&nbsp;connections at the NSBP Annual Conference, often noted as an atypical quality in comparison to other major conferences in the physics field. This environment made it easier to explore areas of common interest, network with other conference attendees, and learn about internships and research opportunities.</p>\n<p>Finally, the 2018 NSBP Conference provided an opportunity to explore next steps toward improving future conferences as well as addressing key issues facing African Americans in physics today. Areas for improvement in future conferences centered around pre-conference communication with attendees. In addition, findings indicate future activities should work to facilitate additional conversation around race and embracing intersectional needs. Student&nbsp;attendees reported that it was important for them to have someone who understood how their background&nbsp;(race, gender, ethnicity) affected their experiences in the field: 32% reported that it was extremely important, and 41% reported that it was very important. Additional areas to focus on moving forward include, (1) development of a more structured mentorship program, (2) opportunities to connect physics to community, (3) and multi-level professional development programs.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 07/26/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Timothy&nbsp;Spuck</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1806429/1806429_10539126_1564186887927_IMG_3256--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1806429/1806429_10539126_1564186887927_IMG_3256--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"NSBP 2018 Exhibitors\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1806429/1806429_10539126_1564186887927_IMG_3256--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"NSBP 2018 Exhibitors\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Meeting attendees had numerous opportunities to engage with exhibitors throughout the program.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Tim Spuck/AUI/NSF</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Timothy&nbsp;Spuck</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">NSBP 2018 Exhibitors</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1806429/1806429_10539126_1564187098755_IMG_9604--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1806429/1806429_10539126_1564187098755_IMG_9604--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"NSBP 2018 Lunch Talk\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1806429/1806429_10539126_1564187098755_IMG_9604--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"NSBP 2018 Lunch Talk\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Invited speakers presented during well-attended group lunches.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Tim Spuck/AUI/NSF</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Timothy&nbsp;Spuck</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">NSBP 2018 Lunch Talk</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1806429/1806429_10539126_1564187957733_IMG_9624--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1806429/1806429_10539126_1564187957733_IMG_9624--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Dr. Aziza Baccouche Presents at NSBP 2018\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1806429/1806429_10539126_1564187957733_IMG_9624--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Dr. Aziza Baccouche Presents at NSBP 2018\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Speaker Dr. Aziza Baccouche talks with NSBP President Dr. Willie Rockward and Dr. Elaine LaLanne following her presentation at the NSBP 2018 Conference.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Tim Spuck/AUI/NSF</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Timothy&nbsp;Spuck</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Dr. Aziza Baccouche Presents at NSBP 2018</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1806429/1806429_10539126_1564188553177_IMG_9676_s--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1806429/1806429_10539126_1564188553177_IMG_9676_s--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"NSBP 2018 Poster Session\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1806429/1806429_10539126_1564188553177_IMG_9676_s--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"NSBP 2018 Poster Session\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The NSBP meeting provided opportunities for students and career physicists to discuss current research.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Tim Spuck/AUI/NSF</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Timothy&nbsp;Spuck</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">NSBP 2018 Poster Session</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
