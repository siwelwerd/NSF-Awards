 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study is focused on applying fundamental principles to design and develop materials that can successfully capture and destroy gaseous pollutants from various industrial sources.  The use of novel materials that can reduce pollutants in a single integrated unit has the potential to reduce the energy consumption compared to current processes.   Results of this study will guide the design and manufacture of high-performance materials for use in industrial pollution control processes that convert toxic compounds to benign products while meeting the environmental standards.\r\n\r\nThis experimental and modeling effort will be focused on both material and process design and development. Specifically, the PIs will synthesize hierarchical mixed-metal oxides (MMOs), deposited with mono and bimetallic nanoparticles (noble and transition metals), using atomic layer deposition (ALD) techniques. The ALD-designed hybrid adsorbent-catalyst materials with hierarchical pore structure are used in the removal of aromatic hydrocarbons, such as benzene, toluene, and xylene, known as BTX compounds, from air in a TSA system. Such hybrid materials will act as a selective mass sink for the adsorbate to create favorable concentration profiles for the oxidation reaction, which will in turn provide heat to regenerate the hybrid materials during the desorption step, thus effectively conserving energy through efficient heat integration. The PIs will also address the design, configuration, process modeling and optimization of the TSA process to improve capture-oxidation efficiency and enable significant reductions in the abatement cost through synergistically exploiting the inherent advantages of each technology. The educational and outreach plan will serve as a platform for graduate, undergraduate and high school students, especially from underrepresented groups, to develop interest in cutting-edge scientific research. The PIs will develop an integrated education and outreach program to incorporate research outcomes into existing coursework and provide research experiences to high school students from Missouri through the Summer Research Academy program.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
