 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry Division supports the project by Professor Ramesh Jasti. Professor Jasti is a faculty member in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at the University of Oregon.  The research being pursued is developing new synthetic methods and strategies to access a wide array of aromatic molecular ?belts?, structures that have eluded synthesis for decades. These targets are of fundamental interest for their structural, photophysical and electronic properties, supramolecular chemistry, as well as their potential to lead to the uniform synthesis of carbon nanotubes (CNTs). This research program, deeply rooted in organic synthesis and new synthetic methods, is also relevant to the fields of materials science, biology, and physics. The PI?s choice of challenging synthetic targets provides graduate and undergraduate students with a thorough background in synthetic organic strategy, methodology development, and reaction mechanism. In addition, these targets provide students with opportunities to collaborate with physicists, engineers, and theorists to measure, utilize, and understand the physical properties of the newly created nanomaterials.  \r\n\r\nMolecules with radially oriented pi-systems have been appreciated by chemists for decades, but have recently undergone a renaissance in that new developments in synthetic methodology have rendered what were previously mostly theoretical curiosities into now accessible structures. In this project, the Jasti research group aims to push the synthetic boundaries to the next logical class of structures in this intriguing field ? aromatic molecular belts. These structures are also molecules with radially oriented pi systems, but they are distinguished from their predecessors by the presence of upper and lower edges that are conjugated but never coincide. As opposed to the rotational freedom associated with previous structures in this class, these molecules are rigid and conformationally locked, features that are anticipated to lead to new optoelectronic and host-guest properties. In addition, these aromatic belt compounds are envisioned as suitable templates for chemical vapor deposition or Diels-Alder growth of carbon nanotubes, thus potentially leading to single chirality CNTs. The PI also partners with the UO Summer Science program to provide educational experiences that highlight interdisciplinary research and hands-on science to groups of students that are traditionally underserved in the state of Oregon.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nCarbon nanotubes (CNTs) have remarkable properties that depend upon their exact diameter and atomic arrangement.  For example, some carbon nanotubes can be metallic with conductivities far superior to copper, whereas other carbon nanotubes can behave like semiconductors with varying band gaps depending on the exact structure.  Therefore, controlling the precise structure of carbon nanotubes is essential to realizing their possible applications.\n\nThe Jasti group approach to this problem is to use organic synthesis to prepare short fragments of carbon nanotubes and then study the structure-property relationships of these unusual pi-conjugated molecules.  The ?bottom-up? precision synthesis allows for the probing of properties of the structures in an unprecedented manner.  In this grant period, one of the main goals of the project was to extend these nanohoop structures along the long axis of the CNT. In other words, we aimed to synthesize larger fragments of carbon nanotubes using functionalized versions of cycloparaphenylenes.   With this in mind, we developed two new methods in which functionalized CPPs undergo late stage reactions that then would convert a CPP into a larger pi-extended CNT fragment.  We also surmised that the development of methods to prepare functionalized CPPs would also allow for investigations of these structures for various applications.  For example, the functionalization of the CPPs allowed for the first water-soluble versions of these structures to be made and allowed for their use in biological imaging.  Moreover, our investigations into nitrogen-doped nanohoops also allowed for us to investigate their use as new types of non-innocent ligands.  \n\nFrom a broader impacts perspective, one of the central missions of this grant was to provide educational experiences that bring interdisciplinary science and nanoscience to a broad range of students.
