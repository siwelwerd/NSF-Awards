 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a Workshop on Opportunities, Challenges, and Best Practices for Basic Plasma Science User Facilities to take place on May 20-21, 2019 at the University of Maryland, College Park, MD.  The Workshop will bring together representatives of the plasma physics and scientifically related communities to discuss the opportunities and challenges associated with establishing and operating university-based basic plasma science user facilities across the spectrum of plasma science sub-fields.  A variety of user facility management models will be considered, including facilities in a physically contiguous laboratory environment and centrally-coordinated but geographically distributed instrumentation networks, as well as both the open user facility and collaborative shared-use facility management models.\r\n\r\nThe Workshop will distill what are considered to be the premiere intellectual opportunities and challenges in plasma physics that necessitate mid-scale or major user facilities. This will be a needed, important, and timely community discussion. The Workshop will aim to address the following questions:\r\n1) What are the science questions that require establishment and operation of plasma science user facilities and cannot be addressed on smaller scale single-PI experimental facilities?  Are there compelling plasma science questions of such value and interest to the global scientific community that may warrant establishment of new user facilities? If so, what are they?\r\n2) Under constrained resources, what are the upsides and the downsides of investing in the operation of user facilities in each of the relevant sub-fields?\r\n3) What may be the limiting factors, e.g., the size of the community of potential users or the flexibility and ease of operation, in establishing an experimental facility as a user facility?\r\n4) Are there particular challenges to transparent and effective operation of user facilities specific to plasma science or any of its sub-fields?  If so, what are they and what modes of operation may be used to overcome such challenges? \r\n5) What are the best practices for managing transparent and effective operation of mid-scale and major user facilities for plasma science?\r\nThe workshop presentations will be webcast with the opportunity for online commentary and Q&A with offsite participants. The Workshop will produce a publicly available report addressing the above questions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
