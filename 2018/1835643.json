 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project makes contributions to the ease of annotating, sharing, and searching heterogeneous data sets.  It focuses upon undergraduate training, emphasizing data science capabilities applied to a range of science problems.  \r\n\r\nThe project enables aggregation, search, and inference with heterogeneous datasets using a structured framework allowing data and metadata to be linked by encoding the framework as a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) for Linked Data (JSON-LD) document.  The approach builds on existing developments such as the Scientific Data (SciData) framework and associated ontology that has been developed by the PI, and Shape Constraint Language (SHACL) shapes to provide efficient searching, browsing, and visualization of data.  The result extends existing approaches to link data and metadata and make data easily discoverable.  The activity emphasizes Research in Undergraduate Institutions (RUI), training more than 30 undergraduates, graduate students and a post-doctoral student in the application of data science techniques to an array of science problems.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

In addition, the data converted into this format and the software/tools (Python) developed are freely available and promote the idea of making scientific data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR). Research focused on how to convert data into the SciData format, how to manage versioning of JSON-LD data files, approaches to integrating semantic chemical substance metadata (SciData ChemTwins representation), and conversion of SciData JSON-LD files into RDF and storage in a graph database. In addition, the project supported 29 undergraduate research students in chemical informatics/ data science and facilitated teaching 99 undergraduate students in a chemical informatics course, both of which support workforce development that is vital in digital chemistry.\n\nIntellectual merit\nThis work supports conversion of scientific data from any format into a single, semantic, archivable format that can be integrated with other data in the same format to support aggregation of scientific data and subsequently the areas of artificial intelligence and machine learning. The SciData format also supports federated data queries (using SPARQL) meaning that different research groups can publish their data in this format, and it can then be searched and integrated with other research data published anywhere online. Finally, the specification has great potential for use as a data storage format for capturing data semantically from scientific experiments as research is being done (e.g. by use of a digital research notebook).\n\nBroader impacts\nIn this project we showed that data from many different domains (e.g. crystallography, solution chemistry, thermochemistry, analytical chemistry (mass spectrometry, infrared), renewable energy, and organic chemistry) can be converted to the SciData format. Researchers in other areas have expressed interest in SciData as the scientific community is still trying to grapple with how to make data FAIR and open so that it can be reused in future research. The project personal, including undergraduate research students, presented over 25 papers and posters at both national and international conferences, to a variety of organizations and disciplines.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/29/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: StuartJChalk\n"
