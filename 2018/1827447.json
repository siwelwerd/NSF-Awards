The meeting will allow young investigators to network with establish researchers to discuss cutting edge research about new ideas and future concepts of how to harness or mimic designs and the methods used in nature to achieve them. This GRC in Biomineralization will focus on discussions of a the fundamental and applied aspects of biomineralization, bringing together chemists, physicists, biologists, geologists, medical doctors, and engineers who would otherwise not overlap on the conference circuit, in a setting that allows new ideas and insights to be shared and applied across interdisciplinary boundaries. \r\n\r\nThe conference will include a broad range of researchers, from graduate students and post-doctoral trainees to world leaders in this area, to disseminate the latest advances and develop connections to advance this key field of research moving forward. Award funds will be used to support students and trainees so that they can present their research and develop the research network necessary to advance both science and their careers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
