 "awd_abstract_narration": "An award is made to Skidmore College to acquire a Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FESEM) for support of multiple ongoing research projects and the development of new research initiatives in the life and physical sciences. The FESEM will significantly enhance student-faculty collaborative research at the College, provide a powerful new tool for science courses requiring high resolution surface imaging, and will directly contribute to active collaborations between Skidmore scientists and researchers from around the world. This instrument will also be used to enhance early student engagement in science and technology via the Skidmore Scholars in Science and Mathematics (S3M) and the Higher Education Opportunity Program (HEOP), and for community outreach programs, including the Johns Hopkins Center for Talented Youth and the annual Skidmore Science and Math Open House. \r\n\r\nFESEM is a powerful tool in high-resolution imaging of surfaces and the capabilities of this instrument will be directly applied to active and planned research in such diverse areas as plant cell biology, the development of water contamination assessment technologies, animal developmental biology, environmental chemistry, organic matter decay, plate tectonics, fossil ultrastructure and archaeology. Its versatility in imaging a wide variety of samples ranging from hydrated biological samples to airborne particles to archaeological artifacts makes it powerful instrument with application in wide ranging research programs. This instrument will allow for the development of new and sophisticated experiments in the study of plant cell wall polymer interactions, microfluidics, fly ash chemistry, fish ionocytes, fossil deposits, crustal evolution and archaeological artifacts. The Energy Dispersive Spectrometry attachment (EDS) will provide a high-throughput and high-sensitivity tool for chemical and materials analyses. Data and utilization protocols generated through the multidisciplinary use of the FESEM will be employed in research-based laboratory projects in advanced courses such as Biological Electron Microscopy, Inorganic Chemistry, Advanced Analytical Methods in Art, Archaeology and Forensics, and Physical Chemistry II.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This instrument provides modern technology for multiple specimen viewing options (e.g., high vacuum, low vacuum, environmental SEM) as well as for elemental analysis/mapping via Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS). The microscope has directly benefited research in plant cell biology, animal physiology and atmospheric chemistry. The FESEM was used to analyze the fine structure of plant cell wall polymers, such as pectins and cellulose, and to elucidate critical modulations to architecture and function of these polymers that occur during cell expansion and development.&nbsp; The EDS component of the instrument provided a rapid and easy means for identifying and mapping cations like calcium that are integral to plant cell structure. The FESEM was used to monitor changes in the ultrastructure of the surfaces of gills and bladder tissue in fish transiting from freshwater-to-marine ecosystems and back. This information contributes significantly to our understanding of the biology of commercially-important fish. The instrument was also used to obtain precise architectural and elemental mapping of fly ash in the atmosphere. Fly ash particles are key indicators of air pollution and may affect respiratory health of humans. The research from this project was disseminated via peer-reviewed publications and highlighted for the general public via the Skidmore Microscopy Imaging Center website (https://www.skidmore.edu/smic/). The research also included active participation of undergraduates during both academic year and summer collaborative research periods. Two research collaborations with scientists from Cornell University, University of Vermont and Skidmore College that dealt with tomato cuticle formation and the biophysics of fern sporangia employed the instrument as the major analytical tool for imaging and other relevant data acquisition. The microscope was also used extensively in multiple courses from various science disciplines and was a centerpiece for part of the summer Skidmore Scholars in Science and Mathematics (S3M) Program, a program that provides need-based financial aid to talented students from underrepresented groups interested in the STEM disciplines at Skidmore College.
