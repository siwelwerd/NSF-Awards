 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award would advance the capabilities for UV remote sensing by targeting a laboratory goal, which is centered on the determination of the UV emission cross sections (Qem) needed for remote sensing observations of the Earth's dayglow. In the dayglow a unique signature of the O/N2 density ratio, from satellite-based UV observations, comes from measuring the intensity ratio of the OI (135.6 nm (3P2-> 5So2)) and N2 Lyman-Birge-Hopfield (LBH) band (125-250 nm) emissions. This O/N2 density ratio is a key to understanding the ionosphere and thermosphere composition changes on a global scale under all geomagnetic conditions. However, the total emission cross sections of these two sets of spectral transitions have not been measured. Each of these two total emission cross sections is a sum of a direct excitation emission cross section and a cascade cross section. The cascade cross sections are about 30-50% of the total cross section. As the column density ratio O/N2 plays a key role in Space Weather studies, accurate absolute measurements  of Qem for both OI and LBH emissions are vital for explaining both the magnitude and temporal evolution of thermosphere composition (O/N2) changes. Similarly, the energetic proton (H+) and H atom impact laboratory measurements of Qem needed for auroral remote sensing are inadequate. The main focus of this is two-fold. One graduate student (UCF) and one undergraduate student would be supported in this effort.\r\n\r\nThe first goal of the award project would be to measure the absolute direct electron, H+, and H impact Qem for both the LBH band between 125 nm to 250 nm and OI (3P2-->5So2) at 135.6 nm from their emission thresholds to 500 eV by electron-impact, to 50 keV by H+ and H atom impact, using the team's experimental facilities located at Caltech/JPL.  The team would also measure at the University of Colorado the cascade processes from these upper states.  Aeronomers at the University of Central Florida (UCF) and Computational Physics Inc. (CPI) would model the remote sensing data using two classic particle transport codes that are paramount to the US space mission: AURIC and GLOW.",
