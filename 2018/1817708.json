 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biotechnology promises to provide access to many of the things that society needs, such as medicines, materials and fuels from renewable resources.  This project aims to accelerate these efforts by providing tools to make biological production from microbes more efficient.  Microbes and other biological systems naturally produce a wide range of chemical compounds, though not all are useful for human needs.  Many of these compounds are essential for microbial growth, and their production decreases synthesis of target molecules of interest.  The tools developed in this project will allow for the dynamic control of pathways that are essential for growth and that lead to target molecules.  These control mechanisms will not require a person to make any alterations to the system to switch pathway function, so the system will operate autonomously.  This research will significantly advance the ability to dynamically control metabolic pathways.  In addition to the scientific advancements, this project will facilitate training of one graduate student through the end of her doctoral studies along with at least one undergraduate student.  The PI will also engage in outreach activities with K-12 students, undergraduates in summer research programs in residence at MIT, and female graduate students and post-docs in the \"Path of Professorship\" program.  \r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to develop multiplexed Metabolite Valves to enable the independent control of two or more genes in a cell without the need for exogenous inducers.  Coupled and independent quorum-sensing systems will be used to construct the circuits.  Multiplexed circuits will initially be characterized using fluorescent reporters, and configurations will be developed that enable both OFF-to-ON and ON-to-OFF switching. Two target pathways have been identified for validating the approach, providing the test cases necessary to demonstrate broad utility of the constructed devices.  Finally, the circuits will be interfaced with CRISPRi actuation to achieve an even higher order of control.  These valves will contribute to the advancement of efforts at the intersection of metabolic engineering and synthetic biology.  The device toolkit will be (i) well-characterized with respect to common variables employed in microbial cultivation and (ii) generalizable across many pathways.  The development of valves to both independently and autonomously control two or more genes will represent a new level of complexity in the design of synthetic gene circuits for metabolic engineering.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual merit:  This project extended research funded by the National Science Foundation in two previous cycles on the broad topic of dynamic metabolic engineering.  The overarching goal is to develop biological devices that enable the control of flow (or \"flux\") of chemical substrates through different metabolic pathways.  We have termed these devices \"metabolite valves,\" following the nomenclature used to describe mechanical devices that direct the flow of fluid streams based on opening and closing of said valves.  We previously demonstrated that these valves could be designed to operate autonomously, that is, without user intervention, by co-opting the naturally-occurring quorum-sensing (QS) systems in microbiology, particularly those that utilize AHLs to trigger a change in gene expression.  By implementing the QS valves, we could switch cells between a growth-favored state and a product-favored one, resulting in increases in productivity and yield of target compounds.  The current work was motivated by the knowledge that in natural biological systems, control of flux through metabolic pathways frequently involves multiple regulatory points.  We thus endeavored to incorporate at least two different QS-based control points into the same cell in order to regulate metabolic flux and increase product formation.  We achieved this by integrating Lux and Esa QS systems into a single cell.  Both use the same AHL signaling molecule, but differences in their regulatory mechanisms result in only partial coupling of the responses.  QS control was also applied to a CRISPR-based repression system to facilitate control (in this case, downregulation) of multiple genes from a single regulatory cassette.  This dual-switching system was used to achieve a 140% increase in titers of the model compound naringenin when compared to a single point of control.  The same system was then applied to a co-culture, in which QS regulation was used to modulate the relative amounts of two cell types, each expressing a different part of the naringenin metabolic pathway, by reducing the growth rate of one cell type.  Cell-to-cell communication was also employed to couple transcriptional regulation across cells.  Together, these changes resulted in a 60% improvement in product titers.  In ongoing work, we have investigated pairwise combinations of all known AHL-based systems.  Our results confirm previous observations on the lack of orthogonality for most AHL systems, while also pointing to impacts of vector architecture on the resulting profiles in some cases.  Overall, this work demonstrated the continued utility of dynamic metabolic engineering, and highlighted the challenges encountered with establishing truly orthogonal behavior in QS-based regulatory systems.\n\n \n\nBroader impacts:  This project provided partial or full support for two graduate students, both female, who have completed their doctoral studies and are currently employed full-time.  One female undergraduate student was also trained, earning co-authorship on a manuscript.  She is currently pursuing her graduate studies at Stanford University.  Finally, one male graduate student who joined the project mid-way through continues to work on advancing the project\u2019s goals.  The main completed work arising from this project was published in two journals:  Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA (2019) and ACS Synthetic Biology (2020). Two review papers were also published (Current Opinion in Biotechnology (2020), Annual Review of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering (2021)), outlining advances in and providing perspectives on the state of the field.  This work has been presented at several university seminars and conferences over the period of performance, being well-received each time.  The funded research has highlighted the impact of work in the area of dynamic metabolic engineering, resulting in a significant impact on the broader science and engineering community.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/02/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Kristala L Prather"
