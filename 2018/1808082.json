 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-Technical Description:\r\n \r\nFunctional magnetic materials can have outstanding properties. Magnetic shape memory alloys change from one shape to another with the application of a magnetic field, and can potentially replace mechanical actuators that currently need several moving parts that are difficult to assemble and might break easily. Magnetocaloric materials have a characteristic that allows them to cool or heat when exposed to a magnetic field, and might be used as cooling devices without the need of liquids and compressors currently required in refrigerators. Presently, it is difficult to fabricate complex parts of functional magnetic materials. Advanced, laser or electron beam manufacturing techniques offer the ability to print very complex shapes, but create challenging microstructures that result in non-functional parts.  This award supports research that will establish a fundamental understanding between advanced manufacturing parameters, composition, microstructure and properties, and enable advanced manufacturing of magnetic materials with a targeted set of functions, or behaviors. The approach employs an innovative combination of rapid cooling and solidification processing and small-scale experiments, with extensive computational modeling, and validation experiments and characterization. The gained knowledge is expected to reduce barriers for further adoption of functional magnetic materials beyond prototypes in a large variety of fields and currently out-of-reach applications, e.g. printable actuators, pumps and solid cooling devices. The combination of functional materials, computer modelling, and advanced manufacturing will be used to create experience-based STEM outreach activities for K-12 students, their teachers and parents. These demonstrations and hands-on experiments will take place at local schools, summer schools and outreach events which serve especially economically challenged and underrepresented students populations. The training of undergraduate and graduate students in this multidisciplinary research environment will enhance the students' preparedness for fast-changing, multifaceted and collaborative work place. The results of this research will be presented in research journals and conferences, but also through blog-posts, social media and openly accessible videos.\r\n\r\n\r\nTechnical Description:\r\n\r\nFunctional Heusler alloys such as magnetic shape-memory alloys or magnetocaloric materials induce up to 10% strain under an applied magnetic field and actuate nearly as fast as piezoceramics, or enable solid-state cooling with up to 30% better efficiency than traditional technologies. Presently, the fabrication of complex shaped parts with good functional properties is very limited, compromising a broad application of these materials. Advanced, laser and electron beam manufacturing techniques enable complex build design, but create challenging microstructures due to rapid heating, melting and solidification, and result in non-functional or low functionality parts. This award supports an integrated experimental and computational research that aims to improve our fundamental understanding between composition, microstructure and functional properties in Ni-Mn-Ga based Heusler alloys subjected to rapid solidification and cyclic heating in layer-based advanced manufacturing and post-processing. Research efforts pursue the following goals:  (A) Identify fundamental relations between alloy composition, microstructure and properties under far-from-equilibrium rapid solidification and cyclic heating conditions, (B) develop CALPHAD-based predictive models for nonequilibrium phase formations, micro-segregation behavior and magnetic properties, and (C) establish composition and grain size control in layered deposits of functional Heusler alloys through targeted rapid solidification processing and post-heat treatment. The outcome of this research will enable laser-based deposition of Heusler alloys and permit functional, complex shaped, self-limiting actuator components (magnetic shape-memory alloys) and highly efficient solid-state cooling devices (magnetocaloric materials).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The deformation or magnetization changes can be achieved extremely quickly as the samples do not require heating or cooling like other shape memory alloys. This combination of functional properties enables magnetic shape memory alloys to be used as very fast and precise actuators or energy harvesting devices that produce energy from vibrations occurring on machines, in buildings or transportation. While these properties are very promising, manufacturing of functional MSMAs is very difficult since they show the best properties as single crystals (materials with very few defects and very high atomic order). The growth of single crystals is time consuming. In addition, traditional machining of Ni-Mn-Ga (so far, one of the best performing MSMA compositions) single crystals to produce more complex structures needed for applications is very difficult due to its high brittleness. Additive manufacturing which produces structures in a layer-by-layer manner may be a solution to produce complex shaped magnetic shape memory alloys.

The elemental composition, their distribution through the samples and formed microstructures in rapidly solidified Ni-Mn-Ga were also characterized (Fig. A). These findings were then compared to the microstructures in laser-melted and resolidified tracks of single crystalline Ni-Mn-Ga and of layer-by-layer additively build small samples. The resolidified microstructures have been characterized not only in 2-dimensional cross-sections but also in three dimensions using advanced x-ray synchrotron experiments at national laboratories. With these experiments, the researchers were able to show that for a certain range of printing parameters, the rapidly resolidified microstructures are the same (epitaxial) as the surrounding substrate material, while other printing parameters do not result in the single crystalline structure of the substrate (Fig. B). It was also found that increasing speed of resolidification (i.e. how fast the molten metal is cooling), increases the composition changes in Ni-Mn-Ga alloys.</p>\n<p>In combination with the experimental work, thermodynamic modeling was used to improve predictions of microstructures, especially phase stability, at the whole composition and temperature ranges even for alloy compositions that have not been investigated experimentally.
