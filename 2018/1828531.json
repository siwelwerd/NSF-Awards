 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is supported by the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI), the Chemistry Research Instrumentation (CRIF) Programs and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).  Professor Igor Rubtsov from Tulane University has developed a dual-frequency two-dimensional infrared, attenuated total reflectance (2DIR ATR) spectrometer.  The spectrum which is obtained measures structural features of molecules in thin films including monolayers. The spectrometer uses three infrared beams to probe a sample.  The reflectance mode of operation (ATR) and addition of special nano-antenna provides higher sensitivity than usually obtained with 2D-IR spectrometers. This enables measurements of small thin samples such as membranes, surfaces and thin films which are heretofore inaccessible. One area of research is directed at understanding how the physical properties of the membranes change with their composition and structure. Changes in membrane properties are important for a range of neurodegenerative disorders. Training of graduate students in instrument development occurs. Undergraduates from Tulane and Xavier University (LA) are trained in the technique.  \r\n\r\nThis spectrometer provides deeper insights in fields such as biophysics and heterogeneous catalysis. The structure and dynamics of self-assembled monolayers that have various applications ranging from light-harvesting to sensing is studied as well as  monolayer stability.  Breakdown process in composites for energy storage are probed to understand what causes the breakdown. The mechanism of how a metal adheres to a polymer surface (double-layer formation) is studied to understand the process. Carbon dioxide activation using enzymes found in in aerobic soil-dwelling bacteria is investigated.  Research with self-assembled monolayers (SAMS) is conducted. This is a model system to understand the possible role of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in cancer metastasis.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The technique was first implemented to interrogate structures and dynamics in bulk samples (solutions of solid films of tens of microns thick) but was recently applied to molecules at interfaces. The measurements at interfaces are more challenging as the number of molecules interrogated is greatly reduced compared to those in bulk samples. Moreover, no commercial instruments are available for surface-enhanced 2DIR measurements. The objective of the project was to design and construct a novel instrument for 2DIR measurements at interfaces. The instrument operates in an attenuated total reflection (ATR) mode (Fig. 1), where the laser pulses are reflected at the interface of an ATR prism and the sample, but an evanescent wave propagates into the sample interrogating a thin layer of the sample, thus reducing its effective thickness down to ~2 micron (Fig. 2). To reduce the thickness of the interrogated layer further we use plasmonic arrays of nano-bars lithographically manufactured at the top of the ATR prism (Fig. 2A), resulting in effective sample thicknesses of less than 10 nm. In addition, plasmonic enhancement provided by the nano-array increases the sensitivity of the measurements up to 10<sup>6</sup> fold (Fig. 2A,B).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Novel, fully automated 2DIR ATR spectrometer was designed, built, and tested (Fig. 3). A software to control each part of the instrument and overall performance of the instrument was developed and tested. The instrument consists of the following blocks (Fig. 1). 1. Fs Yb laser operating at 100 kHz repetition rate and optical parametric amplifier generating laser pulses in the mid-IR spectral range. 2. Beam direction stabilization schematic (Fig. 4). 3. Pulse shaper (Fig. 5). 4. Delay and phase matching unit. 5. Sample cell unit. 6. Detection unit involving optics for heterodyned detection, monochromator, and array detector.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Exceptional precision of &lt;20 urad was achieved for the dual-channel beam direction stabilization unit (Fig. 4). Several important operation regimes were implemented for the pulse shaper, including high-frequency chopping at half the repetition rate, narrow band spectral selection, phase cycling, pulse delaying, and generating a pulse pair (Fig. 6). The described functionality was tested successfully in the pump-probe settings. A diffraction efficiency exceeding 75% was achieved.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Several regimes of dual-frequency 2DIR operation were implemented, including pump-probe in the frequency domain, pump-probe in the time domain, and three-beam heterodyned echo 2DIR. The three-beam heterodyned echo 2DIR is the most sensitive approach, but the phase matching conditions have to be satisfied at the sample requiring changing the angle between the beams attaching the sample depending on the beam wavelengths. A novel schematic was implemented to change the directions of the three mid-IR beams interacting with the sample. &nbsp;The most sensitive three-beam noncollinear schematic (often called boxcar) was implemented and tested, now for the ATR mode. The ability of tuning the incidence angle to the ATR surface was implemented, allowing to use ATR prisms made of different materials. The results show an exceptional sensitivity of the three-beam dual-frequency ATR approach compared to 2-beam 2DIR with a pulse shaper. Spectral acquisition, performed at 100 kHz repetition rate is exceptionally efficient. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The instrument is unique and has no analogs in the world. The instrument opens opportunities of making sensitive 2DIR cross-peak measurements for molecules at interfaces. Applications in assessing structures and dynamics of molecules at interfaces, including those under applied potential, will be useful for a range of research fields, including surface science, sensors, electrochemistry, and energy conversion fields. The use of ATR regime of measurements, resulting in small pathlength of laser beams in the sample, will help performing structural measurements in water, useful for biochemistry. The project involved training of new generation of physical chemists capable of designing, constructing, and using novel modern instrumentation, which is of great importance for science and technology.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/01/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Igor&nbsp;V&nbsp;Rubtsov</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1828531/1828531_10565582_1638383784146_PXL_20211124_174045706--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1828531/1828531_10565582_1638383784146_PXL_20211124_174045706--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Fig. 3.\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1828531/1828531_10565582_1638383784146_PXL_20211124_174045706--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Fig. 3.\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Photograph of the instrument with opened sample compartment.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Artem Sribnyi</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Igor&nbsp;V&nbsp;Rubtsov</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Fig. 3.</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1828531/1828531_10565582_1638381450398_Fig4--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1828531/1828531_10565582_1638381450398_Fig4--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Fig. 4.\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1828531/1828531_10565582_1638381450398_Fig4--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Fig. 4.\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Beam direction stabilization schematic.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Artem Sribnyi</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Igor&nbsp;V&nbsp;Rubtsov</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Fig. 4.</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1828531/1828531_10565582_1638381510196_Fig5--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1828531/1828531_10565582_1638381510196_Fig5--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Fig. 5.\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1828531/1828531_10565582_1638381510196_Fig5--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Fig. 5.\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Schematics of the pulse shaper.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Junhan Zhou</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Igor&nbsp;V&nbsp;Rubtsov</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Fig. 5.</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1828531/1828531_10565582_1638381621208_Fig6--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1828531/1828531_10565582_1638381621208_Fig6--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Fig. 6.\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1828531/1828531_10565582_1638381621208_Fig6--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Fig. 6.\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Pulse Shaper operation regimes.
