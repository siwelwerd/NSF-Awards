 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to characterize the physical processes contributing to the entrainment of deep and benthic waters into the surface layers of the South Georgia Island (Southern Ocean) and to assess their sensitivity to climate variability. South Georgia (SG) hosts some of the largest chlorophyll blooms of the Southern Ocean. Observations suggest that the ocean circulation drives these blooms, but the nature of the physical processes underlying the fertilization process are unknown. A process-oriented modeling program will seek, on the one hand, to identify the sources and dynamical mechanisms underlying the fertilization of the SG region and, on the other hand, to evaluate their sensitivity to climate variability and climate change. The research is relevant to the climate and marine ecosystem community research.Understanding of SG's fertilization processes will not only contribute to the forecast of the impact of climate change on the regional ecosystems but also to anticipate the potential feedbacks that those ecosystems will have on the changing climate. Any change in the circulation in the SG, nutrient and iron input to the euphotic zone, continental margin discharge and biological activity will have a substantial effect on the balance of outgassing of natural CO2 and uptake of anthropogenic CO2. Furthermore, this study will provide some insight on which processes and on which scale the climate community model will have to resolve them. This research will also help in the design of field campaigns to address the unresolved questions of primary production in the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean and target sites where observations will provide answers to these questions. Graduate training will be an important component of the research.\r\n\r\nThere are very few studies on the physical mechanisms sustaining SG's extraordinary blooms and, in particular, on its regional circulation. This is a matter of concern because observations suggest that South Georgia's blooms, which are an important component of the climate system, are primarily driven by physical processes. There are, for example, few studies on SG's shelf circulation and virtually none on its mass exchanges with the Southern Ocean. A pilot study, however, shows that shelf processes and its interaction with the deep ocean are critical to bio-geochemical balance of this region. The numerical experiments to be analyzed by this project are the state-of-the-art for this region. It is hypothesized that SG high productivity is based on vigorous water exchange between the shelf and the deep ocean and a persistent, albeit still under-appreciated, coastal upwelling system. Further, it is posited that SG fertilization is strongly dependent on wind forcing and the expected strengthening of the SO winds will also amplify the fertilization processes leading, therefore, to a negative feedback for climate change.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

South Georgia is a small island surrounded by the swift and cold flow of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (Fig. 1a-b). Although a small speck of land in the immensity of the Southern Ocean, South Georgia host some of its most exceptional chlorophyll blooms, which are the single and most important mechanism for carbon sequestration in the Southern Ocean. The goal of this project was to identify the physical processes sustaining South Georgia's primary productivity and assess their sensitivity to climate variability including climate change. To achieve this goal we conducted a series of experiments using a state-of-the-art computational model. Our study concluded that South Georgia's chlorophyll blooms are sustained by a continuous flow of nutrient rich waters that are drawn from the deep portions of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and injected into the upper layers of South Georgia's shelf. This fertilization process is driven by winds, tides and shelf/open-ocean interactions (Fig. 1b). Our experiments also show that wind forcing generates an important (and hitherto unrecognized) upwelling regime in the northwestern portion of the island.</p>\n<p>Our analysis also concluded that low-frequency fluctuations of South Georgia's circulation are dominated by inter-annual changes while annual and semi-annual changes are insignificant. A substantial portion of South Georgia's variability is related to the local wind forcing, where the term <em>local</em> refers to the winds over the shelf region. In fact, correlation analysis indicates that approximately 40% of the variability of the surface circulation and volume transport around the island is related to the local winds. With regard to the remote forcing, which encompasses the entire Southern Ocean region, ancillary calculations show no significant correlation between South Georgia's circulation and the Antarctic Oscillation Index but a relatively strong anti-correlation between sea surface temperatures (SSTs) over the South Georgia region and the Southern Oscillation Index. ENSO conditions are inversely correlated with South Georgia's SST anomalies, which are part of a large-scale dipole linking the polar and tropical climate variability. Prior studies show that during ENSO events SSTs changes in the southwestern Atlantic region are inversely correlated to sea ice concentration in the southeast Pacific. Warming over the equatorial Pacific strengthens and contracts the Hadley cell in the Pacific and weaken and expand the Hadley cell in the Atlantic. This causes an equatorward displacement of the subtropical jet stream in the Pacific and a poleward displacement in the Atlantic, while the Ferrel cell intensifies and expands in the Pacific and weakens and contract in the Atlantic. These changes triggers a decrease of the poleward surface heat flux in the South Georgia region. To assess the potential impact of climate driven changes on South Georgia's marine ecosystems we did an ancillary suite of process-oriented experiments focusing on the impact of changes of the wind stress magnitudes over South Georgia's circulation.
