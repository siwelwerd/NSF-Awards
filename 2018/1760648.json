 "awd_abstract_narration": "Understanding how extreme events, like hurricanes, impact coastal ecosystems and the cycling of elements like carbon and oxygen, is important for improving our ability to predict how the global carbon cycle will respond to climate. This team of investigators, who have already been working together on understanding the carbon cycle in the Gulf of Mexico continental shelves, have important recent data against which to measure the effects of the passage of Hurricane Harvey in August, 2017. They will sample the waters and sediments of the northwestern Gulf of Mexico in September, October, and January to assess Harvey's impacts on a timescale of weeks to months. \r\n\r\nThe researchers pose three specific questions: 1. Will the region become a major source of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, releasing carbon accumulated in the bottom water and sediments, and will this potential impact be faster and greater than during normal fall and winter mixing events? Will this process acidify the surface water and for how long? 2. Will the metabolic balance be substantially pushed toward net heterotrophy as a result of the storm in comparison to other years? 3. Can the amount of material delivered or redeposited across the continental shelf by a tropical cyclone be considerably larger than that related to winter storm systems? The PIs will measure water column nutrients, oxygen, organic carbon, and inorganic carbon system parameters; determine water column and benthic metabolic and nutrient flux rates; and sediment organic matter deposition rates. They will also collect end member river samples. They will compare the immediate (mid-Sept) but limited post-hurricane data and one-month post-hurricane, more detailed data with those collected in July and April to study the impacts of the storms. they will also compare 2017-2018 seasonal data to seasonal data over the same region collected in the past (2006-2008 and 2009-2010). They will also compare the impacts of Hurricane Harvey to those of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita (2005) and Tropical Storm Cindy (June 2017). The project will involve graduate and postdoctoral research and work to communicate results to the public.",

In the shallow shelf of the northern Gulf of Mexico, storms can also resuspend sediments from the seafloor and redistribute them. To determine the magnitude of new and resuspended sediment deposited in the continental shelf due to Hurricane Harvey, sediment cores were collected from the Louisiana and Texas shelf immediately after the hurricane from approximately 20 stations. These sediment cores were imaged using X-ray radiographic technique. Radiometric analysis for 7Be and 234Thex in the sediments, as well as grain size analysis were also carried out to estimate the newly deposited and redistributed sediments on those cores.  The presence of 7Be and 234Thex indicate that about 6 -10 cm of sediment was deposited up to 50m isobath after the passage of hurricane Harvey. Higher disposition of new and/or resuspended sediment was observed near the coast and along the path of the hurricane. The ratio of 234Thex to 7Be in sediments which reflects new vs redistributed sediment, ranged from 0.1 to 8.4 with a gradual increase from shallow coastal to deeper shelf water. This indicates that new deposition was dominant in the continental shelf with 20 m depth and resuspended sediment was dominant in the deeper and farther stations. Assuming a uniform 4 cm thick post hurricane deposition layer across the shelf upto 50m isobath, we estimate that 8.5x109 metric tons of sediment was mobilized shelf wide after the hurricane. This translates to 4.2x107 metric tons of particulate carbon being ejected into water column using the average sediment total organic carbon content of 0.5%. This estimate is of the same order of magnitude as the total particulate organic carbon delivered by the Mississippi and Atchafalaya river on an annual scale and found to impact water column O2 demand, plankton communities and CO2 dynamics in the region.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/16/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Kanchan Maiti"
