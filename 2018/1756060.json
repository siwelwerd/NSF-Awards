 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funding for US participation in the conference \"Troy MathFest Undergraduate Conference\" that will be held at Troy University, April 6-7, 2018 in Troy, Alabama. The conference focuses on undergraduate research; its purpose is to provide an accessible forum for undergraduates to present their work on mathematical projects.   A distinguished mathematician will provide a keynote lecture.   It will also facilitate the introduction of attending students to various local, regional, and national graduate programs. The goal is to give students a sense of the next steps in pursuing a career in the mathematical sciences.  Of special focus is providing opportunities for woman and members of underrepresented groups to attend and participate in this conference. \r\n\r\n\r\nThis award gives early career researchers, members of underrepresented groups, researchers not funded by NSF and the like an opportunity to attend and participate in this conference.   The organizing committee will strive to make this funding opportunity known to target groups through a number of different activities.   More information will be made available at:\r\nhttps:/troy.edu/mathfest/\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
