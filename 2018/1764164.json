 "awd_abstract_narration": "The chemical transformation of biomass into fuels is a process that provides a renewable source of energy, decreases dependence on fossil fuels, and provides new markets for agricultural products and bioproducts. A major challenge in the reforming of biomass is the removal of oxygen, which decreases the long-term stability of biomass derivatives.  New catalysts are needed to facilitate the conversion of biomass into useable fuels, as well as high-value chemicals. In this research project, Dr. Donna A. Chen of the University of South Carolina and Dr. Graeme Henkelman of the University of Texas at Austin are studying catalysts composed of two different metals that target specific chemical reactions associated with the different functional groups in biomass derivatives.  Both researchers are also engaged in outreach activities that promote the scientific education and training of students of all levels.  In conjunction with local elementary schools, Dr. Chen is developing hands-on chemistry tutorials and demonstrations that fit directly into the students' science curriculum.  Dr. Henkelman leads an initiative that recruits freshman college students into active research programs and targets students who are from backgrounds that are historically underrepresented in science. \r\n\r\nWith funding from the Chemical Catalysis Program of the Chemistry Division, Dr. Donna A. Chen from the University of South Carolina and Dr. Graeme Henkelman from the University of Texas at Austin develop selective catalysts for the conversion of highly functionalized molecules derived from cellulosic biomass reforming. Oxide-supported bimetallic catalysts such as Pt-Sn are investigated for the selective hydrogenation of furfural for the subsequent production of adhesives, cements, and coatings. The bifunctional nature of the Pt-Sn surfaces should allow selective hydrogenation of the C=O bond with high activity while inhibiting other hydrogenation pathways. On the other hand, strong interactions between Pt and the oxide support are expected to improve selectivity and prevent carbon fouling. Dr. Chen studies model, well-defined Pt-Sn/titania surfaces prepared in ultrahigh vacuum (UHV). These model surfaces are characterized using a variety of surface science techniques. Catalytic activity studies are conducted in a microreactor directly coupled to the UHV chamber. Dr. Henkelman models the supported bimetallic particles using density functional theory to understand activity, selectively and stability, and to predict which bimetallic combinations are expected to exhibit desirable properties.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

These well-defined alloy surfaces were prepared by depositing one monolayer (ML) of Sn on Pt(111) and then annealing to 1000 K to drive the Sn atoms subsurface. The resulting Sn-Pt alloy surfaces had low energy diffraction patterns that were a mix of the ordered c(2x2) and (3x3), which are known to have surface Sn coverages of 0.25 and 0.33 ML, respectively. Low energy ion scattering (LEIS) experiments show a 88% loss of Pt signal after annealing at 1000 K, and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) images also demonstrate the diffusion of Sn into the surface upon annealing. For furfural hydrogenation on Pt(111), furan and tetrahydrofuran (THF) were the main products detected, as well as propane. However, the furfural conversion was relatively low at 10-15% under these reaction conditions (0.1% furfural/99% H2/He, 160 C), and no furfuryl alcohol was produced. On the Sn-Pt(111) alloy surface, the furfural conversion was much higher at ~50%, and the selectivity for the desired furfuryl alcohol product was initially ~80%. Furan and THF were also formed as minor products. Thus, the alloying of Sn into the Pt(111) significantly promoted overall activity for furfural hydrogenation and shifted the selectivity to the desired unsaturated alcohol. \n\n\nThe growth of Sn and Pt-Sn clusters on TiO2(110) were studied by STM, LEIS, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and density functional theory (DFT). At low Sn coverages (0.02 ML), single-layer high clusters of SnOx are formed with a narrow size distribution and uniform spatial distribution. XPS experiments indicate that these clusters consist of oxidized Sn, and a corresponding reduction of the TiO2 substrate is observed. As the Sn coverage is increased, the number of three-dimensional clusters increases, and the ratio of Sn:SnOx increases, suggesting that SnOx and reduced TiOx form at the cluster-support interface. When Pt is deposited on top of the Sn/SnOx clusters, the relatively mobile Pt atoms diffuse on the surface and become incorporated into existing Sn/SnOx clusters. Furthermore, the addition of Pt to the Sn/SnOx clusters causes the reduction of SnOx to metallic Sn and the oxidation of Ti3+ to Ti4+; this behavior is attributed to the formation of Pt-Sn alloy clusters, which results in the diffusion of Sn away from the interface with the TiO2 support. In contrast, when Sn is deposited on an equal coverage of Pt clusters, new Sn/SnOx clusters are formed that coexist with Pt-Sn clusters. However, the surfaces of both Pt on Sn and Sn on Pt clusters are Sn-rich due to the lower surface free energy of Sn compared to Pt. DFT calculations demonstrate that M-TiO2 bonding is favored over M-M bonding for M=Sn. Furthermore, the substantial charge transfer from Sn to TiO2 leads to dipole-dipole repulsion of Sn atoms that prevents agglomeration into the larger clusters that are observed for the mid-late transition metals. DFT studies also confirm that addition of Pt to a Sn cluster results in strong Pt-Sn bond formation and diminished Sn-O interactions. Furfural hydrogenation on the PtSn/TiO2 clusters did not produce furfuryl alcohol, but instead the presence of Sn at the cluster surfaces decreased hydrogenation to furan and THF compared to pure Pt clusters.\n\n\nEducational activities for this project include training of graduate and undergraduate students to carry out research at the interface of surface science and catalysis. In addition, hands-on science modules were designed for fifth grade students in conjunction with a local elementary school.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/11/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: DonnaAChen\n"
