 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Association for Computing Machinery's Special Interest Group on Computer Science Education (ACM SIGCSE) Symposium is the largest annual gathering of computer science educators, with over 1500 attendees in recent years.  Although the SIGCSE Symposium is an excellent venue for educators to disseminate their findings after a project has been completed, faculty who are currently working on projects often need to find collaborators to further their research.  Still other faculty have a research idea but are unsure where to start or how to best apply for funding from the National Science Foundation.  The NSF Showcase at the SIGCSE Symposium will provide a venue for current NSF grant recipients to present their work in progress, receive feedback, and recruit collaborators. The NSF Showcase will help NSF program officers provide information and guidance to help new researchers identify appropriate funding opportunities.  Over the past decade, hundreds of faculty members have presented at NSF Showcases, reaching thousands of computer science educators.  It is expected that this experience has helped them move their projects forward and disseminate their results.\r\n\r\nThe core purpose of the NSF Showcase is to provide an opportunity for grant recipients from the National Science Foundation's Division of Undergraduate Education to present their projects at other times and in different ways than when final results are ready. The NSF Showcase is a cooperative effort between NSF and SIGCSE. NSF drives the project by providing a list of potential presenters, while SIGCSE ensures that the NSF Showcase has a prominent position at the SIGCSE Symposium. The NSF Showcase is designed to allow grant recipients to circulate their ideas as interactive presentations and demonstrations. Each project included in the showcase will be offered a presentation-ready mini-booth to use for a 90-minute session. Through informal interactions, principal investigators will be able to solicit feedback from peers and program officers as well as recruit collaborators and adopters. The NSF Showcase will also set space aside for program officer \"office hours\" throughout the symposium. The office hours are intended to provide occasions for potential grant writers and current PIs to consult with program officers early in the project cycle, and gain crucial insights that can improve the likelihood of the projects succeeding and findings being disseminated. The NSF Showcase has become a staple in the computer science education community over the years that it has been running at the SIGCSE Symposium.  Participants in the NSF Showcase routinely report that the Showcase had a significant impact on their work and helped them move their research forward.  Attendees of the Showcase see firsthand the work currently supported by NSF DUE. The Showcase strives to continue to provide a valuable service to the computer science education community and the SIGCSE Symposium through these opportunities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The goal of the NSF Showcase is to improve upon the quality of proposals that are currently submitted. It achieves this by allowing showcase attendees to see the existing grants that have been funded, as well as speak to the NSF program officers about their individual funding ideas.\n\nThe NSF Showcase has run for over 15 years at the ACM SIGCSE Technical Symposium - the premiere conference for computer science education.  Attendees at the conference come from many different backgrounds and schools.  Consequently, some attendees may be interested in performing CS education research, but don't know how to form their idea into a research project, nor how to appropriate funding.  At the NSF Showcase, attendees can be exposed both to current ongoing projects and to NSF program officers that can answer their questions.\n\nIn the years of doing the NSF Showcase, we found that there are significant benefits for all parties involved.  Attendees find out about projects and funding opportunities.  Presenters get to desseminate their work and to recruite new participants and parterns.  NSF program officers get to answer questions from individuals looking to get involved in research and also from existing researchers that need to talk to their current program officer.  The NSF Showcase has served as a faciliator for all of these interactions and will continute to do so under a new principle investigator in 2023.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/22/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Mark S Sherriff"
