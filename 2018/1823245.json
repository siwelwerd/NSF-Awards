 "awd_abstract_narration": "The global community is increasingly exploring underground environments for sustainable and resilient solutions to societal problems. New opportunities and challenges in water access, quality, and storage, geothermal energy, and carbon sequestration collectively point to underground environments as the next frontier. Underground environments are, however, notoriously hazardous for humans; accordingly, inspecting underground environments and performing rescues during underground catastrophes is essential to achieve this new underground frontier. The proposed infrastructure will support research in human-robot teaming, networking, planning, and human-robot interaction, as well as collaborative research with other researchers in other fields and application-driven research into underground information collection, monitoring, surveying, rescue, and crisis management. The proposed infrastructure will also be used for community outreach programs, through workshops, presentations, and partnerships with area K-12 after-school programs.\r\n\r\nThe proposed infrastructure will provide a team of heterogeneous robots for deployment in underground environments, as well as sensors, networking equipment, and augmented reality headsets to facilitate their effective use. This infrastructure will support the institutional theme of research on underground environments, including underground inspection and search and rescue applications. This infrastructure will include amphibious, ground, and aerial robots; robotic arms and grippers to be mounted on ground robots; augmented reality headsets designed for safety-critical domains; visual, range, and audio sensors; and networking equipment. These hardware elements will be integrated together and deployed within the Edgar Mine, an underground research and evaluation facility owned and operated by the Colorado School of Mines.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

It is hard to express just how large of an impact the equipment provided by this grant has had on robotics research at the Colorado School of Mines. Through this grant, we have been able to acquire a wide range of ground robotics platforms, drones, robot heads, robot arms, AR and VR equipment, and networking equipment. Together, this has enabled the PIs, both individually and in collaboration, to pursue a wide range of successful research projects, funded not only by NSF, but also by AFOSR, ONR, ARL, and NASA, and has helped Mines to successfully launch MS and PhD programs in robotics.\n\n\nHere, I will briefly highlight some of the research enabled through the equipment.\n\nThe equipment enabled experiments in robot networks, in which we consider how robot motion during exploraiton and monitoring behaviors can affect robot network communication and overall team performance.  As part of this work, we developed planning and optimization methods to design the robot network and plan the motions and communication (data transmissions) in such scenarios.\nThe equipment enabled development and evaluation of new methods for robot kinematics.\nThe equipment allowed us to create a comprehensive library that lowers the barrier to entry into the field of UAV research, reduces the risk of expensive mistakes, and makes interfacing with leading flight and networking simulators simpler. \nWe also used this tesbed to plan for and deploy a team of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to collect data from wireless sensors while minimizing collection latency. \nAnd, we used this drone testbed to investigate how to plan efficient paths that minimize mission completion time for UAV data collection, where the UAV must rendezvous with a moving ground vehicle that cannot stop and wait for the UAV. We also addressed the limited onboard energy storage issue by adapting UAV speed.\nThe AR and VR equipment acquired has enabled us to pursue a range of experiments investigating robot gestures visualized through augmented reality. Using the equipment, we have explored how AR can be used to visualize a variety of robotic phenomena, explored the tradeoffs between different types of AR gestures, explored the tradeoffs between physical and AR gestures, and explore the effects of different types of AR gestures on different types of cognitive load.\nThe robot heads acquired have been allowing us to consider the role that psychological models of memory can play in robots' cognitive architectures,  and the ways that robots can generate more effective referring language to pick out entities in their environment. More recently, PI Williams' team has begun to create an entirely new open-source robot cognitive architecture, the exploration and development of which was fundamentally enabled through these robots.\nBoth the ground robots and heads have also allowed us to explore new areas of robot ethics, including exploration of how robots can reject unethical commands, and how they can generate explanations in those command rejection scenarios. \nFinally, the equipment was used to support PI Zhang\u2019s research on robot navigation, multi-robot collaboration, and multi-robot teaming.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/14/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Thomas Williams"
