 "awd_abstract_narration": "The emerging field of ancient microbiome research is providing crucial baseline data for understanding the role of agriculture and social organization in shaping the human oral microbiome over the past several thousand years. However, additional transitional historical data are needed to enhance our understanding of how oral microbial ecology has responded to recent sociocultural change in the last 125 years. This dissertation project will investigate changes in the human oral microbiome from 1890 to the modern day, to provide insights into recent evolution and diversity of the oral microbiome, and sociocultural influences on microbiome structure and function. The project will support training and mentoring of students, including those from groups underrepresented in STEM research, and may also inform clinical microbiome research. Research findings will be shared across disciplines through peer-reviewed publications and presentations, and communicated to the public through outreach at participating natural history museums. \r\n\r\nThrough both wet and dry laboratory methods, our research objectives are to 1) characterize the oral microbiome of diverse early 20th century Americans and 2) investigate ecological changes in microbial communities and their metabolic functions over time. To achieve these objectives, dental calculus (tartar) will be collected from geographically and ethnically diverse Americans housed in natural history skeletal collections and living populations residing in the NY metropolitan area. Microbial DNA recovered through shotgun sequencing will be used to reconstruct taxonomic and functional diversity of the oral microbiome. Providing this historical context to the modern microbiome will contribute to our understanding of microbiome ecology, human health and disease in the modern era.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nA modern innovation in biological anthropology has been a shift into microbiological anthropology: the study of the microbes that coexist with humans.  The oral microbiome is intensively studied in modern humans because it causes disease (cavities, periodontal disease) in a majority of humans.  By sequencing the preserved DNA in dental calculus (tartar, the mineralized plaque that forms during life and persists after death), we can see how much the oral microbiome has changed over time.  We sequenced the preserved DNA in calculus from Americans who lived in New York City, Cleveland, in the Washington DC area and on Kodiak Island, Alaska and died from 1897-1950.  We found major differences with modern American oral plaque microbiomes both in the major types of bacteria found and our historical microbiomes had a large component of archaeal genes (average 14.7%) ? a kind of life not normally found in the mouths of modern Americans.  One Archaeal species in particular (Methanobrevibacter oralis) was detected in 41 of the 43 analyzed samples, and we were able to assemble whole genome sequences of this species from three different samples.  It is clear that the technological and cultural changes of the last century have had a strong effect on the microbiomes of our mouths.\n\nThe calculus sampled for the study came from remains identified as coming from Americans of European, African and Asian ancestry.  We did not find systematic differences in our data from samples from humans of different backgrounds or from different geographic locations. Our data suggest that the dental health of Americans from the recent past were similar to each other.\n\nAs all studies of historical oral microbiomes sequence DNA from dental calculus and all modern studies use DNA from plaque, we also conducted an important control analysis using modern humans.  We sampled and sequenced the microbiomes of both plaque and calculus from ten volunteers.  Modern calculus microbiomes were more similar to the supragingival plaque samples from the Human Microbiome Project (HMP) than those from other sites in and on the human body. The microbiomes of each individual?s plaque and calculus were more closely related to each other than those from the HMP, but were not identical to each other (92.42%-94.1% overlap in detected species).  Our results justify the comparisons of modern plaque microbiomes and historical calculus microbiomes.\n\nThis project contributed to the professional development of a graduate student in the nascent field of evolutionary medicine and introduced an undergraduate to computational microbiome research.  This study is also the first to look at oral microbiomes from historical samples from non-European and non-European-descended human remains.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/28/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Siobain M Duffy"
