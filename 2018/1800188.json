 "awd_abstract_narration": "The supply chain, or logistics, industry continues to grow in the Midwest region of the United States. Jobs in this industry are also becoming more dependent on technologies such as predictive analytics, artificial intelligence, and robotics. Nearly 15,000 transportation and warehousing businesses are located across the cities of Columbus, Ohio; Dayton, Ohio; and Chicago, Illinois. The ongoing growth helps support and strengthen the logistics industry in this regional economy. As a result, there is an increasing need for logistics engineering technicians in the region. In this project, a grouping of community colleges who are leaders in the logistics field in this Midwest region will be formed. The project will be led by Columbus State Community College, Oakton Community College, and Sinclair Community College. It will seek to build career pathways in logistics engineering technology for students, encourage more students to complete degrees in this field, develop faculty experience on the latest technologies, and improve the technical skills of graduates. The goal will be to provide highly-skilled logistics engineering technicians to support the regional and national needs of the supply chain sector. \r\n\r\nThe project will aim to improve technician education to support the increasingly complex technology needs of the supply chain sector while connecting graduates to employment opportunities in a variety of logistics industries. This project will work with employers, industry experts, and colleges to establish an innovation network. The network of partners will identify and create educational resources for emerging skills and technologies within the sector. The existing logistics curriculum at Columbus State Community College combines technology applications with engineering systems and integrates them with supply chain operations. This curriculum will be enhanced to integrate new topics in data-driven analytics and networking systems. The adapted curriculum will also be implemented and tested at the partnering institutions. The network infrastructure will inform and regularly evaluate efforts in curriculum and career pathway development; in providing professional development material and trainings for high school and college faculty; and on the use of prior learning assessments for adult and returning learners, particularly veterans and recent graduates in need of new skills for the ever-changing logistics job market. Results will be widely disseminated through an interactive project website, through publications, and at regional and national conferences.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Teams at these colleges collaborated with universities, high schools and industry partners to expand pathways for next-generation logistics engineering technicians in the region. The following project objectives were developed to meet this goal.: 1. To expand current logistics engineering technology curriculum and establish replication framework. 2. To develop an innovation network that focuses on LET emerging technologies in logistics. 3. To lead a professional development initiative for high school and college faculty about LET programming and careers. 4. To create a best practices protocol for returning learner outreach and use of prior learning assessment. Accomplishments: Each of the 3 key partner community colleges primarily focused on a particular aspect of the work while supporting the efforts of the others. Columbus State Community College focused on building an O-SCAN network to bring together industry, academia, and government agencies to inform this work. Oakton Community college focused on developing and offering professional development related to emerging logistics technologies. Sinclair Community College worked on developing prior learning assessment processes to help military veterans earn MTAG credits towards earning a degree or certificate in logistics. All three colleges educational content whether modules, courses, or degree programs to further opportunities for learning relted to emerging technologies in the field. Columbus State Community College &ndash; The team at Columbus State established the Ohio Supply Chain network (O-SCAN) as a means to connect the supply chain industry with higher education. A website was developed for the network to serve as a hub for content and resources. Resources developed by the team at Columbus State include virtual field trips (video) to the DSW Fulfillment Center, and the Rickenbacker International Airport/Norfolk Southern Rickenbacker Intermodal Terminal, to highlight the processes, departments, and technologies involved in getting products to the consumer. Lesson plans and other content will be developed to support these virtual field trips. The existing LET curriculum at the college was updated using new modules to build industry relevant competencies in students. Five new Excel based data analytics modules were developed in collaboration with faculty from the IT department funded through a different NSF grant. These modules were incorporated into a capstone course for college students but were also used by themselves to upskill incumbent workers. An ERP module was also added to the redesigned curriculum for another logistics course. Impacts: COMPLETE is bringing together the best practices related to logistic technician education developed by some of the lead community colleges in the Midwest. Sinclair has created a network similar to O-SCAN to serve as an industry advisory organization to educational institutions in their region. Faculty from all 3 colleges ae working together on setting up a National Center for Next Generation Manufacturing. Columbus State is working with Sinclair to develop strategies for veteran involvement. Additionally, Amazon has selected Oakton Community College as an education partner to their Career Choice program that provides employees with tuition free access to some of Oakton&rsquo;s programs including the Supply Chain Automation program. This grant has thus served to strengthen the industry pipeline for careers in logistics.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 11/22/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Jeremy&nbsp;Banta</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"></div>\n</div>",
