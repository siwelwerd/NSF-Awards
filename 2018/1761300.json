 "awd_abstract_narration": "Acoustic waveguides - structures that guide sound waves - are ubiquitous and found in nature (for example, the ear canal) as well as in engineered consumer, industrial, and military products (for example, mufflers in automobiles).  In this research, investigators will explore how a network of sensors, actuators and amplifiers can be used to improve control over transmission of sound, leading to highly directional acoustic waveguides.  The target applications are in electronics, such as in cell phones. The process will involve a rigorous design-model-build-test process combining state-of-the-art theoretical and numerical modeling with new experimental techniques.  Outreach to underrepresented students in engineering from the Atlanta University Center-Consortium of Historically Black Colleges and Universities will be realized through a two-summer internship in the Michigan Summer Training in Acoustics Researcher (M-STAR) program. Interns will team with PhD students to develop Cool Acoustics demonstration projects and take part in the project research.\r\n\r\nThis new approach to waveguide design will require new analysis tools for a variety of purposes.  This is due to the generation of a spatial delay differential equation (DDE) resulting from feedforward of the field and gradient information (unlike the time domain DDE, these equations are seldom studied). In order to fix the design space, Floquet-Bloch of these spatial systems will be modified.  The analysis of stability, robustness, and effectiveness of the designs will be identified allowing for the most promising designs to be realized in hardware.  The outcome of work is a new approach that has the potential to radically change how one-way wave propagation is achieved enabling new classes of acoustic systems and devices.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

achieve one-way, non-reciprocal wave propagation; 2) To use the theoretical relations to design and build two such systems:&nbsp;(a) an acoustic (airborne sound) and (b) an elastic system (structure-borne waves); 3) To test the systems to determine their effectiveness.&nbsp;&nbsp;We achieved these three objectives.&nbsp;&nbsp;Metastructures are those whose active features are smaller than a wavelength of sound. &nbsp;Our results not only demonstrate highly one-way (unidirectional) propagation over a broad range of frequencies, this frequency range is electronically tunable, meaning that the device can be changed with our any hardware alterations, thereby adapting to changing conditions if needed.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;In doing so, we identified a new mechanism for achieving nearly one-way wave propagation in acoustic and structural acoustic systems.&nbsp; While we applied our nonlocal active approach to two model systems, one nondispersive (acoustics) and the other dispersive (an elastic beam), the concept can be applied to any wave-bearing system where an active sensor can feed the controlling electrical signal nonlocally to an actuator.&nbsp; This holds the potential to change how noise control and filtering of acoustic (vibrational) signals is done in a wide variety of applications ranging from audio frequencies (e.g., automotive, architectural, and HVAC systems) to ultrasonic frequencies&nbsp;(e.g., surface acoustic wave and bulk acoustic resonators, devices that are in every cellphone).&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, the commercial applications of our work
