 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, from the University of Alabama (UA), extends their initial I-Corps Site award for scale up to their next phase of support for innovation and entrepreneurship. Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors. This is a Type II I-Corps Site project. Type II proposals are submitted by institutions that have already received a Type I award.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this I-Corps Type II Site is to build on, extend and expand the local innovation ecosystem, and to nurture STEM faculty and students to transition their ideas into the marketplace so these early stage teams can build sustainable companies, create new jobs, attract investment, and benefit society. Boosting the local innovation ecosystem by nurturing STEM faculty and students propelled the University of Alabama Site into a formal, active, local innovation ecosystem contributing to the national network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors. The UA Site provides infrastructure, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or become I-Corps Team applicants. In 2016 the US Site became partners with the  regional I-Corps Node, I-Corps South, at the Georgia Institute of Technology. The UA Site, which has been successful in activities that increase inclusiveness, will also continue to improve and expand Lean Launchpad curriculum and training programs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nNSF Project Outcomes Report\r\n\n\nNSF I-Corps Site Award at The University of Alabama\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nThe University of Alabama had the privilege of participating as a Site in NSFs I-Corps program in the most recent grant from 2018 through 2024. The Universitys goals for participating in this program were to (1) provide training to as many members as possible of our regional community who were interested in launching businesses based on advanced technologies, where that training would give them the opportunity to go on to receive national training and improve their learnings further; (2) emphasize our focus on UAs graduate students in these efforts, as they prepare to launch their professional careers with an understanding of how they might translate future inventions and discoveries into marketplace successes; and (3) increase participation of UAs own faculty in these training efforts for the betterment of the countrys economy and standard of living.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nOver the course of the grant, we were successful in training over 900 students, over 40 faculty members, 278 teams, and sent 17 teams for national training.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nLooking to the future, at least three exciting opportunities exist for our University community related to growing our capability to move discoveries and technologies into the marketplace. First, in late 2024 along with eight other universities in the southeastern United States, we received an NSF I-Corps Hub award. With the Hub concepts increased focus on collaboration between great universities we believe our faculty and graduate students will have expanded opportunities to learn skills and tools for commercializing their technologies. Second, the University is participating in the NSF Accelerating Research Translation (ART) program. The faculty and grad student teams involved in UAs ART activities are alums of UAs NSF I-Corps training and have participated in national training. We are excited about this opportunity and believe the I-Corps-ART connection will be quite successful. Third, the University is also participating in NSFs Regional Innovation Engines program in collaboration with partner schools Mississippi State University and the University of Georgia. Like the ART grant, the Regional Engine grant will provide us an even stronger community of participants for I-Corps training, and all participants will benefit from the added strength of the I-Corps Hub.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nThe opportunity for our faculty and students to participate in the NSF I-Corps programs has been a great benefit to commercialization in our state.\r\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/17/2025\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: RobertMMorgan\n"
