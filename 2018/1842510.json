 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Graduate Research Fellowship Program (GRFP) is one of the oldest and most prestigious fellowship programs for the National Science Foundation (NSF). The program's reputation derives from the high level of success achieved by students receiving the fellowship as well as those receiving honorable mention. As such, it is important to ensure that students from traditionally underrepresented groups in engineering are aware of the value and process of applying for graduate fellowships. Addressing access to advanced degrees is critical to the nation's ability to recruit and retain high achieving engineers and scientists within the U.S. STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) workforce. Formative issues for many GRFP applicants who are underrepresented in engineering include formal and informal training in scientific writing and communication, professional development training, and access to mentors and role models engaged in innovative research. \r\n\r\nThis workshop connects engineering and science students from underrepresented populations to a currently funded NSF Engineering Research Center. This project builds on a working hypothesis that underrepresented and women students motivated by researchers working on socially relevant, convergent research will build capacity to develop competitive fellowship applications. This hypothesis is tested through the development and delivery of a workshop that incorporates introductions to researchers, professional development, and informal training in scientific writing. This activity, led by a principal investigator from an HBCU, directly supports the NSF ERC goal of developing a culture that is diverse and inclusive.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

These students also received monthly mentorship with a potential future ERC partner (Cell-Met ERC at Boston University).
