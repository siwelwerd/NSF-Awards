 "awd_abstract_narration": "Alternative energy systems based on oscillating motion of hydro- or aerodynamic foils hold promise for future development of both large- and small-scale renewable energy resources that currently remain mostly untapped, such as tides, rivers, and small wind farms.  Oscillating systems offer important advantages over rotary turbines because they can operate at relatively low frequencies, are environmentally friendly, and their designs can be more aerodynamically efficient due to lower blade stress.  One key fundamental challenge associated with the development and optimization of these energy harvesters is the need for a better understanding of nonlinear fluid dynamic mechanisms that significantly impact device performance. The goal of this project is to combine experimental and computational analyses to investigate critical underlying flow physics and to develop low order theoretical models which can accurately predict the power extraction potential of these devices.  The project will engage K-12 outreach through the Oregon State University SMILE and SEYES programs, which bring pre-collegiate students to the OSU campus for research experiences.  In particular, hands-on wind tunnel demonstrations, created with the help of university URISE and STEM fellowships to undergraduate students, will expose elementary and high school students to aerodynamics research. Finally, an open access textbook, largely based on the elements of this project, will be made available to a national network of over 50 universities. \r\n\r\nSpecific goals of this project are to develop a thorough understanding of how large-scale, low Reynolds number viscous flows can be accurately and efficiently evaluated using a global impulse-based model. This model will be developed through careful scaling of experimental and computational flow field data to account for kinematic oscillatory motion. The derivative moment transformation technique will be applied to phase-averaged flow dynamics to arrive at transient force predictions. The methodologies to be used include phase-resolved particle image velocimetry and advanced hybrid RANS-LES computational modeling to provide detailed time-dependent flow analysis. The primary technical objective is to elucidate the ?life cycle? evolution of large-scale vortical structures inherent in these flows and to correctly model their dynamics. In addition to improving fundamental understanding of the complex dynamics of oscillating foil systems, the low order models will be developed for a wide range of oscillating foil kinematic conditions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The use of oscillating foils for future power production may have many advantages over rotating turbines in that they can operate with significantly less induced stress, at lower operating frequencies and may scale better for both low and high power demands.  \n\nIn this study several aspects of the operating conditions were investigated, including the influence of leading edge and trailing edge induced motion on overall performance. Specifically the effects of the leading and trailing edge vortex field dynamics were studied in order to advance the low order model capabilities. An accurate low order model would allow more efficient design development of oscillating foils and the determination of the optimal oscillating kinematics to obtain highly efficient power production.\n\nTo achieve these goals the following were identified and accomplished.  A highly accurate experimental PIV study was used to map the flow and vorticity fields which were then applied to impulse-force calculation methods to obtain transient lift force and power production results for a range of oscillating kinematics.  Using this model it is shown thye dominating role of vortex dynamics on power production.  A discrete vortex model using the transient panel method was also developed which includes a leading-edge separation model, a trailing edge correction and accounted for the effect angle of attack as influenced by both leading and trailing edge motion.  The corrections were developed based on a critical shear layer requirement for flow separation.  This correction was based on a nondimensional scaling of the shear during the cycle using a time scale based on the kinematic motion and the foil characteristic thickness.   In addition, an empirical model of the separated leading edge vortex convection as a function of oscillating reduced frequency is shown to improve the low order model results (compared with experimental and CFD predictions).  The impact of the foil geometry was studied to show that the output power can be significantly enhanced using thicker foils due to the effect on the leading-edge separation.\n\nResults of this study show that a computationally inexpensive low-order model, using the unsteady panel method provides very good results on the transient force and output power coefficient during a cycle.  Mean values of power production are shown to increase with reduced frequency, with the potential to increase power production particularly at higher reduced frequencies by using a passive trailing edge motion on the airfoil.  In addition, foil geometry (foil maximum thickness) is shown to affect vortex separation and growth and impact the power output with increasing output with increasing thickness.  \n\nThis study reveals that further work needs to be carried out to investigate very large Reynolds number effects that may impact leading-edge vortex formation.  The leading-edge shear velocity is shown to be critical in defining the flow separation and vortex growth and at much higher Reynolds numbers may be influenced further by very thin boundary layer dynamics during the oscillating cycle.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/29/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: James A Liburdy"
