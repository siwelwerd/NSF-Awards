 "awd_abstract_narration": "Organic compounds that contain chlorine or fluorine (halogenates), are remarkably difficult to degrade.  To improve their degradation, the investigators will modify an enzyme that demonstrates the correct capability but currently lacks the ability to recognize these pollutants.  Halogenated phenols will be the model compounds used. If successful, this approach will enable the decontamination of compounds previously found impossible to treat. Graduate students will learn to combine experimental and theoretical approaches to generate new enzymes.  Undergraduate students will help design enzymes using an educational game to simulate protein folding and conformation. Underrepresented minorities will be actively recruited to participate in every aspect of the project.\r\n\r\n\r\nMethods for removing halophenol contaminants from our environment are available but unsatisfactory.  Strong chemical oxidants can be used in waste water but their residue adversely affects downstream processes.  Alternatively, organisms can be used degrade the halophenols, but they require anaerobic conditions.  In contrast, the enzyme iodotyrosine deiodinase has the potential to degrade halophenol using a reductive process that is uniquely compatible with atmospheric oxygen.  A number of natural examples of this enzyme have been examined, but all are specific for tyrosine derivatives.  Consequently, our goal is to develop new variants that accept a broader range of substrates.  Three parallel computational approaches will be tested for predicting the necessary mutations to generate stable enzymes with active site geometries favoring halophenol substrates.  The highest ranked variants will be expressed and screened for the desired activity.  Further optimization will rely on directed evolution using methods of random mutagenesis and gene shuffling.  This research effort should define a general approach for modulating active site lids to accommodate chosen substrates in addition to providing a testable product, engineered enzymes for halophenol decontamination.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nHalophenols accumulate in our environment due to their use in agriculture and their resilience against natural methods of decomposition.  To date, halophenols can only be degraded by harsh chemicals and these too harm the environment.  The biological realm offers a few approaches for their degradation but none have yet been satisfactory for application in the field.  Another solution that had not been considered previously relies on a natural enzyme that consumes related halogenated tyrosines but not the target compounds.\n\nWe combined experimental and computational strategies to redesign the region of this enzyme  that acts as a gate keeper for what materials can be processed and what cannot.  Initial studies began using a parent system from mammal sources.  During the first round of design, the Rosetta program suite created and analyzed 100 variants in silico and ranked their potential for success.  Expression and characterization of the top candidates identified a top performer that switched specificity for binding as desired from halotyrosine to halophenol.  The increase in binding affinity, however, did not lead to an increase in the more difficult feat of catalysis.  Total turnover remained unsatisfactory.  Ultimately, a homologous enzyme from a thermophilic bacterium was selected as a new parent for adapting specificity.  This choice was extremely attractive for a variety of reason including its minimal size and robust stability at elevated temperatures.  The new parent had previously been predicted to act like the mammalian enzyme even though it was very much an outlier within the family of related species.  We generated the natural enzyme and confirmed its anticipated activity.  This finding was very useful for refining our ability to use protein sequence to predict function.  New strategies for replacing the gate keeper region continues as we develop a highly stable and broadly acting catalyst to help rid our surroundings of toxic halophenols.\n\nThis research contributed to the training of 10 graduate students.  Many of these student gained skills in both the experimental and theoretical approaches of creating new catalysts.  Such skills are essential to the green revolution for preparing industrial and pharmaceutical materials by environmentally benign procedures.  Four undergraduates of diverse background gained their first experience with independent research by joining various aspects of this project.  Their enthusiasm for science grew tremendously from their experience in the laboratory and all are now either pursuing advanced degrees in STEM or are currently applying to such programs.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/08/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Steven E Rokita"
