 "awd_abstract_narration": "Quantitative models for decision making under uncertainty continue to attract intense effort across natural sciences and engineering. With the advent of ever more sophisticated models in applications, computational demands continue to outpace what is feasible and the premium on efficient numerical approaches remains high. The investigators will explore synergies between the latest machine learning techniques and control paradigms, arising in applications as diverse as finance, energy storage and security, and the epidemiological modeling of infectious diseases. The developed \"smart\" algorithms will deliver performance upgrades essential for using simulations in tackling large-scale/complex settings. The project will also contribute to inter-disciplinary training in mathematical sciences across undergraduate, graduate and post-doctoral levels. \r\n\r\nThe investigators will investigate statistical learning techniques for modeling, analysis and control of nonlinear dynamic stochastic systems. Through developing algorithms and statistical models for complex stochastic simulators, and active learning strategies for autonomous data acquisition, the project will achieve enhanced capabilities and efficiency in mathematical analysis of dynamic random phenomena. The approach hinges on the use of high fidelity approximate Gaussian Process surrogates to adaptively allocate computing resources in order to maximize the learning rate of the input-output relationship for modeling objectives or of the input-control map for dynamic programming. By connecting stochastic simulation with machine learning and non-parametric statistics, and integrating with the computational implementation, the project will enhance knowledge discovery in large-scale simulation and optimization settings.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nMany scientific phenomena are investigated through simulation, as opposed to physical or field experimentation.  Simulation is vital in engineering projects, where the cost of building a physical apparatus is prohibitive.  It is also common in areas of science where the desired experiment is unethical, such as studying the evoluition of a novel disease as it spreads through a popuilation.  in such cases it is common to virtualize the system with a computer code.  Often those codes are computationally intensive to run, and therefore gathering data about the behavior of the (virtual) system can be taxing.  You might want to know how it behaves in a variety of input configurations/scenarios, or to discover a range of emergent behavior, or to calibrate to physical/field data, but the ability to do so is limited by the expense of a simulation campaign.  Surrogate models were developed to help with statistical modeling of such campaigns toward many of the aims highlighted above.  Yet even those models have limitations ranging from fidelity to their own computational bottlnecks.  This funded reseach centered on a new wave of approximate methods based on local modeling.  So-called local Gaussian process surrogates have been able to handle larger experiments with more flexible modeling constructs, but doing so required limiting global scope and a clumsy approach to handling noisy simulations.  By borrowing ideas from machine learning (inducing points) and operations research/queuing theory (a so-called Woodbury trick), we were able to recoverer much of that lost capability while furnishing a fast and accurate high-fidelity surrogate.  These methods have proved to be among the most accurate of predictors in a wide range of examples from inventory management, epidemiology, atmospheric and space science, as well as on an array of synthetic problems engineered to stress-test and benchmark the framework.  A new open source software package for R, called liGP, has been released for publish use and scrutiny on CRAN.  Several peer-reviewed journal articles have been published, or are currently under review. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/26/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Robert B Gramacy"
