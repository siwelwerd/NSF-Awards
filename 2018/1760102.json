 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will contribute to the advancement of science and will benefit the national prosperity and welfare, by enhancing manufacturing system monitoring and quality control. Expensive high-tech manufacturing processes require early detection of process disturbances and accurate yield prediction. Early detection allows for faster diagnosis of the nature and cause of the disturbances and their correction in order to improve quality and reduce production costs. This project will devise and test new prediction methods for diverse applications that exhibit spatial and/or temporal dependencies.  By exploiting these dependencies, this project is expected to enhance quality and reduce production costs in manufacturing.  The project also has relevance to other domains that exhibit spatial and spatio-temporal dependencies, such as control of the spread of communicable disease and enhanced protection of individuals on social networks by detecting patterns of adverse link behavior, such as spam. The fundamental concepts of this work and the new outlooks on prediction approaches will be incorporated into educational course materials. Both undergraduate and graduate students will be involved in the research and implementation in the areas of manufacturing and health care.\r\n\r\nThis project utilizes graph theoretic optimization techniques to explicitly incorporate spatiio-temporal dependencies in problems of  prediction and estimation.  The graph-theoretic approach employs a separation-deviation model where the objective is to minimize a penalty function involving deviation functions associated with nodes and separation functions associated with edges.  Efficient parametric cut algorithms for convex deviation and bilinear separation will be extended and improved.  Separation functions for integrated circuit manufacturing yield prediction based on priors from actual wafer defect data will be examined.  This work will make fundamental contributions to the theoretical development of models and computational algorithms for extensions of the basic separation-deviation model, which is used extensively in Bayesian estimation, machine learning, and isotonic regression.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe project generalized the use of adjacency clustering as pairwise  similarities that are used in graph-based algorithm for the tasks of  classification and machine learning.  Unlike most machine learning  methods that utilize the labels of training data to guide the task of  classification, or regression, the research here developed methodologies  that incorporate information from pairwise relationships, including  relationships between unlabeled objects.   We investigated a number of  specific applications of the use of pairwise similarities.  These  include: A highly competitive algorithm called HNCcorr for neuron  identification in calcium-imaging movies of live brain activity;  Detecting \"spam\" or aberrant agents, based on linking (pairwise)  behavior in a network; Fast scalable algorithms for k-clustering with  domain knowledge in the form of pairs that must-link (should share the  same cluster) or cannot-link (that should belong to different  clusters);   and devising faster algorithms for various classes of the  isotonic regression problem (used in function smoothing or signal  detection);\n\nWork in progress that relies on the foundations  developed in  this project includes advancements in resiliency of  machine learning to noisy training data with the goals of enhanced  fairness and unbiasedness originating in the ``ground truth\" labeling.   Another work has already resulted in a substantial speed-up in methods  to solve the diversity, or collaboration problem.\n\nThe  intellectual merits in the outcomes lie in the unique integration of  graph theoretic framework with problems of prediction and estimation in  the presence of pairwise similarities information.   The combinatorial  optimization methodologies introduced are a significant departure from  the existing state-of-the-art statistical techniques, and have led to  more effective and accurate approaches for prediction and estimation, as  well as were adapted to the development of more efficient algorithms  for known problems in machine learning.\n\n\nThe broader impacts  of the work are in improving system monitoring, early detection of  process limitations and yield prediction in the semi-conductor industry;  in generating highly accurate methods for neuronal cell detection;  in  novel methodologies for spam detection based on behavior of nodes in the  network; in improving the quality of clustering when partial expert  domain knowledge is provided; as well as generating better isotonic  regression algorithms and new types of machine learning techniques.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/18/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Dorit Hochbaum"
