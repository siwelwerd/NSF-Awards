 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award to the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory will support a workshop for directors operating Research Experiences for Undergraduate (EU) sites.  Site directors will share best practices in implementing undergraduate research programs and discuss issues faced by program directors of REU Site programs.  The primary focus of the workshop is student assessment of the research experience and long-term tracking of participants. BIO-funded REU program directors will be invited to the 3-day workshop, that starts on April 4th, 2019. It is expected that 140-150 participants will attend the workshop, which will occur at the Holiday Inn Rosslyn in Arlington, VA.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the grant will implement updates to the existing BIO REU website (bioreu.org), migrating the website to a new content management system that allows for increased capacity to manage content. The website is a primary means for REU students and PIs to share resources.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\nThe REU program is one of the primary mechanisms NSF has to support broader participation in the sciences.  The workshop will make REU programs more effective through sharing of best practices.  Additionally, the US Congress has mandated longitudinal tracking of student participants.  This workshop will discuss ways so that the intent by Congress is appropriately met.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\nThe REU program helps support the research activities of 1,000+ scientists, generating hundreds of scientific publications.  Under the supervision of a scientist, undergraduates perform their own research projects.  This complements the work of their mentors, and advances our fundamental understanding of biology.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThis grant supported improved communications among directors of NSF-funed Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) programs as well as assessment of student participation, providing insights into how to improve programs.\n\n\nA critial function of the National Science Foundation (NSF) is to train the next generation of scientific leaders. The REU program, which matches undergraduate students with a scientific mentor in the context of conducting independent and original research, provides one of the primary mechanisms at the undergraduate level by which NSF supports a pipeline of scientific talent to maintain the nation's economic vitality. Within the Biology Directorate of NSF, NSF supports approximately 135 REU programs, each supporting on average 10 students.\n\n\nThis grant provided support for directors of the 135 funded programs, including funding an in person meeting April 4-6, 2019, to discuss and share best practices. Attended by 119 participants, the meeting generated a series of recommendations, including ideas on how to improve communications among programs and how to implement longitudinal tracking of student participants.\n\n\nIn addition to the in person meeting, the grant funded transition of the community's website to a new platform, improving the ability of program directors to share information beyond in person meetings. Additionally, the grant supported a virtual meeting in December of 2020, as well as provided support for a platform to assess student outcomes.\n\n\nIntellectual Merit\n\n\nThe biology REU program directly supports independent research by approximately 1300 undergraduates each summer, across all levels of biological organization. In maintaining and improving the quality of student research activities, these activities directly support the quality of the nation's research.\n\n\nBroader Impacts\n\n\nThe REU program has been one of NSF's primary mechanisms for ensuring that the scientific community broadly captures and represents the nation's diversity. In supporting best practices around recruitment, admissions, and extended mentoring, these grant activities promote an inclusive approach to science.\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/29/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: IanCBillick\n"
