 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study will obtain a high-resolution three-dimensional map of the internal structure of the underwater Axial Volcano, which is located about 450 km offshore of Washington State. These data will address the age-old question, \"How do volcanoes really work?\".  Axial Volcano is an ideal location to obtain information on the underground magma chamber because a lot of other data have already been collected there.  The surface features of Axial Volcano have been mapped in detail and the volcano is monitored in real-time through the Ocean Observatory Initiative Seafloor (OOI) Observatory.  Obtaining an image of the magma chamber structure will complement existing data and the real-time data being provided by OOI, and allow a much better understanding of how Axial Volcano works and when it might erupt. This study will advance understanding of volcanoes both on land and underwater world wide. The project provides training for graduate students and early career scientists. Access to the data will be open. \r\n\r\nThis project will complete a comprehensive 3-D multichannel seismic survey of Axial Volcano and associated rift axes aboard the R/V Marcus Langseth.  In addition, eight 15-km-long source-receiver offset 2-D reflection profiles will be collected to look at deep-seated structure of magma delivery. A sophisticated set of seismic imaging tools focused on multichannel seismic data collected in underwater volcanic terrains has been developed. This algorithm approach has been used in a number of marine environments in 2-D, with the greatest success thus far at Axial Volcano, where the roof and floor of the underlying magma chamber have been clearly imaged, along with fractures/conduits in the upper crust connecting the magma chamber to nearby hydrothermal vent fields. Despite this success, Axial Volcano is inherently 3-D in nature, thus requiring a 3-D approach to map the complex connections between the magma plumbing system at depth with eruption dynamics at the seafloor. For example, this approach is needed to understand (1) how 3-D fracture sets are associated with magma inflation/withdrawal, rifting, and gravitational spreading/collapse in the upper crust; (2) the geometry and interconnection of complex magma bodies of varying amounts of melt/mush; (3) the relationship between internal structure and seafloor observables such as hydrothermal fields and lava flows.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Historically, the monitoring and systematic surveying of volcanoes was land focussed but the study of marine systems has advanced rapidly in recent decades due to technological progress and now some aspects of volcanoes are more easily studied under water. Marine seismic methods better resolve the magmatic plumbing as many millions of paths probing a volcano can be collected efficiently using multichannel seismic (MCS) systems.&nbsp; &nbsp;Axial volcano, located on the Juan de Fuca ridge about 200 km from Oregon coast, is the latest volcanic center of the Cobb-Eickelberg hotspot chain, and currently the most intensely studied underwater volcano on the planet. As part of the Oceans Observing Initiative (OOI) it is continuously monitored in real-time via a fiber-optic cable. Axial seamount is also the most active volcano in the north-eastern Pacific with 3 eruptions since 1998. The central plateau of Axial volcano, lying at ~1.4 km depth, is disrupted by a prominent horseshoe shape caldera that separates northern and southern rift zones (Figure 1). The recent eruptions were focussed in the caldera and along these rifts. Axial seamount is estimated to be up to 0.5 Myr. old but the caldera is thought to be much younger &lt;60 kya. &nbsp;A creative synthesis of older seismic data resolved a main magma reservoir (MMR) linking the rift zones, a possible secondary reservoir (SMR), and produced a 3D tomography model encompassing the plateau.The 2019 MCS experiment collected a 3D reflection dataset covering the plateau and a series of long-offset profiles studied in this project. After compute-intensive, full waveform inversion, the long-offset profiles produced detailed, high-resolution velocity models with coverage down to 2-3 km beneath the seafloor. The only existing model with broad coverage to this depth is the 3D tomography model. Although the broad features from the lower resolution tomography model are discernible in the new models, Figure 2, the higher resolution prompts a revised interpretation.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The 3D tomography model was originally interpreted as showing the MMR sitting near the top of a a laterally-continuous gabbro section, that is seismic layer 3 with velocities &gt;6.5 km. A dominantly layered structure is the typical situation for crustal formation along the axis of the JdF ridge. In this context, the low velocity anomaly to the NE of the plateau, Figure 3c, was interpreted as a secondary magma reservoir. The new models indicate a much more strongly 2D structure with a high velocity axial core, considerably narrower than the plateau, flanked by unusually low velocities down to 4 km depth. Velocities within the core are lower than typical gabbro, while the flanking velocities are lower than those typically associated with seismic layer 2B and sheeted dike complexes. The signature of sheeted dike complexes as seen on profiles that cross the active rift zone is velocities &gt; 5 kms, Figure 3, which is consistent with measurements elsewhere along the JdF ridge. The flanking region is likely comprised of eruptive volcanic material while the core has likely been built upwards by repeated intrusion of magma sills and the assimilation of older volcanics, resulting in a modified seismic signature. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;There are a number of higher velocity bodies as the top of layer 2B and just below the base of higher gradient layer 2A in Figure 2d. Velocities in these bodies are comparable to those seen at the top of the sheeted dikes in Figure 3. Theoretical considerations suggest that diking should preferentially occur at about a change in velocity gradient, so it is possible that these bodies are dike swarms but with more limited vertical extent than along the rifts.Mapping of the axial core at 3.2 km depth is limited by the profile coverage particularly near the northern rift zone, but its shape is nevertheless suggestive, Figure 4. It is elongated in a direction closer to the absolute plate motion than to the axes of the caldera and MMR. The axial core region appears to enclose the centers of active magma supply as determined from the companion 3D reflection dataset with the tops of both deepening to the southeast, consistent with the ideas that hotspot magma supply is migrating that way and that core is built gradually through assimilation. Although the SMR interpretation is not supported by this data there is active magma supply at depth in this region.&nbsp; &nbsp;One area where the core is broader than the imaged magma supply is the wing extending towards the abandoned southwest rift zone, Figure 4. Both could be relics of an earlier phase of Axial history concentrated in this region when closer to the hotspot center.</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 11/29/2024<br>\nModified by: Alistair&nbsp;J&nbsp;Harding</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1658018/1658018_10540623_1725835846936_Fig4_axial_plateau_map--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1658018/1658018_10540623_1725835846936_Fig4_axial_plateau_map--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Axial plateau with core outlined\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1658018/1658018_10540623_1725835846936_Fig4_axial_plateau_map--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Axial plateau with core outlined\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Axial plateau showing the outline of the high-velocity core which is elongated in the same directions as the plateau and subparallel to the plate motion and spreading directions.
