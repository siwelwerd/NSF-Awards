 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project establishes an I-Corps Site at Colorado State University (CSU). NSF Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors.\r\n\r\nThis Site leverages CSU's innovation ecosystem to accelerate entrepreneurship across the CSU system and along the Colorado Front Range.  The overall CSU Site objectives are to stimulate the translation of research, train faculty and students to understand innovation and entrepreneurship, and contribute to the National Innovation Network.  Specific goals of the CSU Site are to dramatically increase the number of students and faculty exposed to the Lean Launchpad training methodology, engage a wide range of regional stakeholders, increase the number of CSU-affiliated start-ups over ten years, and unite CSU and other regional research universities around an entrepreneur recruitment and start-up development process coupled to both industry and the investment community and supportive of women and minorities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nCSU operated a National Science Foundation (NSF) Innovation-Corps (I-Corps) Site (Award #1829248) from late 2018 through mid-2023 through a $255K initial grant and $50K supplemental award. The Site developed and implemented regional lean launch-pad / business model canvas training programs for university faculty and students across Colorado.\n\n\nThe CSU Site trained over 150 teams who conducted over 2500 customer discovery interviews and formed or accelerated 23 CSU-affiliated start-ups whove raised more than $5M in nondilutive follow-on funding. The CSU Site included 11 cohorts totaling 400 individuals of which over 20% were women and over 20% underrepresented minorities. From the outset, the CSU Site was collaborative effort and focused on building Colorados innovation ecosystem. Of the 150 teams supported by the program, 110 were from CSU, 5 were from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), 3 were from the Colorado School of Mines, 32 were from the University of Colorado  Boulder/Anschutz/Denver Campuses, and one was from the University of Denver. Since the University of Colorado-Boulder and Colorado School of Mines migrated to the West Hub in 2022, CSU ran three CSU-only regional training cohorts (Spring and Fall 2022 and Spring 2023) and sent 3 teams to the I-Corps West Hub regional training program led by CU-Boulder in the Fall of 2022 and Spring 2023.\n\n\nThe CSU I-Corps Site catalyzed new and important collaborations between CSU Strata the CSU College of Business Institute for Entrepreneurship, nonacademic research entities including the Energy Institute, and our eight academic colleges through their Council of Research Associate Deans. Several faculty who participated in I-Corps regional programs reported that the concepts and principles taught in the program were incorporated into their teaching methodologies. The Colorado Office of Economic Development and International Trade adopted CSUs I-Corps Site course methodology and encourages all university teams receiving state funds to participate in the training. The methodology and participation in the NSF I-Corps added an additional competency to the toolkit of both the faculty and student participants. In post-surveys completed by participating teams, every single team response noted that they had improved their knowledge of entrepreneurship, customer discovery, business model canvas and lean launchpad methodology. CSU Strata is now utilizing the NSF I-Corps methodology to vet the potential of various technologies, ideas, and materials created on campus. From the university tech transfer perspective, CSU had several teams that became eligible for further follow-on funding post-CSU NSF I-Corps participation. The program, in combination with other tech transfer touchpoints and offshoots, has enabled several teams to launch and grow companies.\n\n\nThe Site impacted other colleges and disciplines across CSU including engineering, natural sciences, and natural resources by integrating elements of the Sites business model canvas and customer discovery programming into several courses, minors, majors, and certificates now offered to graduate and undergraduate students.\n\n\nIn addition to the above direct outcomes, several broader impacts have resulted, in part, from the Site. For example, CSU, in collaboration with Innosphere Ventures, acquired a $1.25M cooperative agreement from the U.S. Department of Energy to run the Rockies/Plans Energy Accelerator for Commercializing Hardtech (REACH). In REACH, Innosphere and CSU accelerated 27 early-stage startups originating from 20 universities across a 14-state region in 2022 and 2023 that: a) raised $20.6 million in capital which included $5M in grants and $15.6M in equity, saw revenue grow by $3,904,000, created 33 new jobs, and authored 11 new patents. 22 of 27 companies received corporate traction by the end of program and launched several new products (11 prototypes; 2 MVPs; 10 commercialized products; and 8 demonstration/pilot projects). More recently, CSU acquired an additional $650K from the U.S. Department of Energy to operate the Rockies/Plains Food Energy Water Accelerator to support CSU-affiliated founders through 2026. CSU is also a key partner in the recently awarded NSF CO-WY Climate Resilience Engine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/28/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: BryanDWillson\n"
