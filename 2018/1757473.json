 "awd_abstract_narration": "The sound systems of human languages differ widely, as any student of foreign languages knows. One way in which languages differ is their use of stress and tone. English is a language which uses stress to distinguish word meanings: compare the word \"record\" when used as a verb (\"to rec\u00f3rd\") and as a noun (\"the r\u00e9cord\"). Other languages use stress to mark the edges of words. Similar patterns are found with tone: in Tokyo Japanese, for instance, the meaning of the word \"hashi\" depends on the pitch melody with which it is spoken (with a high-low melody it means \"chopsticks\", and with a low-high melody it means \"bridge\"). Languages which use just one of these features are very common. Less common, and less studied, are languages which use stress and tone together. Until such languages are studied in greater detail, we will not have a complete picture of the sound systems of human languages and the ways in which they can vary.\r\n\r\nThis project investigates stress and tone in Uspanteko, a highly endangered Mayan language spoken by approximately 1000-3000 people in the central highlands of Guatemala. Uspanteko uses tone to distinguish word meanings, as in \"s\u00edip\" (high tone, means \"tick\") vs. \"siip\" (no high tone, means \"gift\"). Alongside tone, stress is used in Uspanteko to mark the edges of words. The primary aim of this project is to document and analyze the acoustic structure of stress and tone in Uspanteko. As the sound system of Uspanteko is typologically unusual, this project has the potential to contribute substantially to our understanding of cross-linguistic variation in the areas of stress and tone. One product of this research will be a large, annotated corpus of spontaneous speech in Uspanteko. The project also involves a substantial training component for linguistics students in the U.S. and Guatemala.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Other research goals included the documentation of phrasal prosody; the collection of narrative texts and associated audio recordings; the phonological analysis of prosodic patterns; and the development of computational tools for processing Uspanteko texts and audio. We also hosted a series of workshops with Mayan linguists and educators in Guatemala which helped develop local capacities in practical phonetics, phonetic analysis, corpus linguistics, and pedagogical methods for teaching Indigenous languages. We also carried out collaborative activities with local organizations in Uspant?n promoting bilingualism in Mayan languages, and providing information about COVID-19 in Mayan languages.<br /><br />We recorded elicitations with over 50 Uspanteko speakers during the grant. Some elicitations included electroglottographic recording to study the activity of the vocal folds during vowels in spoken Uspanteko. We recorded and transcribed 57 spontaneous spoken narratives in Uspanteko, about 7 hours in length. These recordings and associated annotations continue to be archived at the Archive of the Indigenous Languages of Latin America (https://ailla.utexas.org/islandora/object/ailla:254558), as well a user-friendly website focusing on spoken narratives (https://bkeej.github.io/TextosUspantekos/#/). We extended this user-friendly platform to publish spoken narratives in Kaqchikel, another Guatemalan Mayan language, which we collected prior to this grant (https://bkeej.github.io/TextosKaqchikeles/#/). Additional grant products, including materials from our community-oriented workshops in Uspant?n, are available at https://www.panteko.us/. We developed computational tools to help enrich the annotation of Uspanteko texts, including a morphological parser, dependency parser, and a forced alignment model.<br /><br />This research has resulted in three journal articles, one book chapter, and three conference proceedings papers. These publications are available to the public at no cost, as open-access publications or as preprints on our websites. We presented grant-related research at 19 prominent national and international venues, including presentations in Japan, Australia, Mexico, and Guatemala. <br /><br />Much recent research on tone systems investigates how word-level tonal contrasts are maintained (or not) under the influence of sentence-level prosody, particularly intonation. In an article in Language &amp; Linguistics Compass (https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/lnc3.12467) and a chapter in a volume from Oxford University Press (https://doi.org/10.1093/oso/9780198869740.003.0007) we've shown that some kinds of sentence level prosody (e.g. boundary tones) can obscure tonal contrasts in Uspanteko, while others, like focal prosody, may heighten such contrasts. This differs from what's been reported for other Mesoamerican languages with denser tonal systems, in which tonal contrasts are preserved across intonational contexts. Our work thus enhances knowledge of how tone behaves in human languages, and Mesoamerica specifically. We also suggest that tone systems may be more sensitive to sentence-level prosodic factors when tone is sparsely specified or has a low functional load.<br /><br />An article on vowel deletion in Uspanteko, accepted at Language, argues that vowel 'deletion' is grammatically-controlled gestural overlap: vowels are acoustically masked by the articulation of flanking consonants, but not actually deleted. While past research suggests that gestural coordination is controlled by speakers, the specific details of vowel 'deletion' in Uspanteko -- such as resistance to deletion in prefixes -- imply that gestural coordination belongs to the same phonological grammar that regulates standard phonotactic patterns.<br /><br />In a paper in Language &amp; Linguistics Compass (https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/lnc3.12467), we describe the phonetics of glottal stop and ejectives/implosives in Uspanteko. These topics are of substantial interest within Mayan phonetics, phonology, and historical linguistics, as well as phonetic and phonological typology. We also present more general phonetic observations about Uspanteko, which have consequences for understanding sound change in Mayan languages.<br /><br />An article published in Tlalocan (https://doi.org/10.19130/iifl.tlalocan.27.2.010087X94) presents a linguistic and cultural analysis of an Uspanteko text narrative concerning Xoqoneb', a sacred site in the Uspanteko region. While similar narratives are told in other highland Mayan communities, the version we analyze in Uspanteko includes details which illuminate the social and cultural fabric of Uspant?n and its status in the Guatemalan highlands. We use grammatical patterns in this narrative to suggest that Uspanteko has been shaped by historical contact with more distantly-related Mamean languages.<br /><br />In four workshops in Guatemala we provided training in practical phonetic methods, language documentation, and language teaching to dozens of Indigneous linguists and educators speaking a range of Mayan languages (Uspanteko, K'iche', Mam, Sakapulteko, Kaqchikel, Q'eqchi, and Poqomchi'). We spearheaded a local radio and poster campaign which publicized the many benefits of raising children to be multilingual, to encourage parents to pass Mayan languages on to their children in the Uspanteko region. In collaboration with local organizations we produced informational materials regarding COVID in three Mayan languages, Uspanteko (https://covid-no-mb.org/?page_id=1922&amp;fbclid=IwAR1FDTxSnPrJw-hb3eDZ01hnWZC2GYKzWzOnoOr-3jpxDMo_yXtHDP4qi2M), K'iche' (https://covid-no-mb.org/?page_id=2009&amp;fbclid=IwAR2RBvm0N9yddHEZR8_lORWk9zOg65LYejat8vGR8GOFRjLdlkNO1NKUASA) and Kaqchikel (https://covid-no-mb.org/?page_id=1694&amp;fbclid=IwAR0dVlWLQCaCl5EWwhS__YalUx2jiuTQJgAi4-zajv6VopZMTTNIA0O1hyE).<br /><br />Five undergraduates at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and three at the University of Arizona, received training in phonetic annotation and Mayan linguistics as part of this grant.
