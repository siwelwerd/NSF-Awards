 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is targeted at making a fundamental breakthrough in understanding of the dynamics of the solar atmosphere by conducting the first detailed observational characterization of the Sun's internal gravity waves. These waves are likely playing a significant role in the dynamics of the Sun?s atmosphere (that affects Earth's \"space weather\"), but little is known about them because of difficulties observing their oblique paths and small vertical wavelengths. \r\n\r\nThis project will radically change this situation by determining the role internal gravity waves play in the energy balance of the solar atmosphere - both the \"traditional\" gravity waves with frequencies below the Lamb frequency and the recently discovered \"anomalous\" gravity waves with frequencies above the Lamb frequency. This will be accomplished by combining the data from two high sensitivity and stability Doppler magnetographs deployed to the Antarctic South Pole Station along with the data collected by the Helioseismic Magnetic Imager instrument on-board the NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) in space. The project will be imaging \"line-of-sight\" solar plasma velocity fields with high spatial resolution at three separate heights in the solar atmosphere. These images will provide the basis for the first detailed characterization of the properties of internal gravity waves as a first step towards developing suitable diagnostic tools for probing the solar atmosphere from the ground. \r\n\r\nSolid science, collaborative effort, and the Doppler magnetographs' deployment to Antarctica provide an ideal opportunity to achieve excellent education and outreach goals. By providing undergraduates and college students with Antarctic research experience, the proposal demonstrates how a future generation of researchers can make meaningful contributions to the cutting-edge science.",

These waves play an important role in mixing material and transporting energy and momentum in planetary atmospheres, oceans, and the interiors and atmospheres of solar-type stars. IGWs play an essential role in the coupling of the Earth's lower atmosphere to the ionosphere. While in the oceans, IGWs power the overturning meridional circulation that affects pollutant disposal, marine productivity, and global climate. Outside of Earth, IGWs are found on Mars, Venus, and Jupiter. They also exist on the Sun, where they are randomly excited by overshooting convection at the top and bottom of the Sun's convection zone. The IGWs generated at the top of the convection zone, near the Sun's surface, have been proposed as agents for heating the Sun's outer atmosphere. They are also likely to play a significant role in this region's dynamics. However, their oblique paths and small vertical wavelengths have made them challenging to observe; consequently, IGWs in the Sun have not garnered the same level of attention they have in other disciplines. This project's primary goals were to make the first detailed measurements of the IGWs in the Sun's atmosphere, characterize their properties, and take an initial step toward capitalizing on their potential as a diagnostic tool for probing the solar atmosphere.</p>\n<p>To acquire the necessary data for our studies, we upgraded two instruments that we built for an earlier seismology program in 2007, designed to use acoustic waves to probe the Sun's interior and atmosphere.

The approach was motivated by similar techniques used in time-distance helioseismology and seismic interferometry.
