 "awd_abstract_narration": "High-temperature gas-phase chemistry, such as the chemistry responsible for powering engines and supplying electricity from power plants to homes, is complicated. But it is critical to understand these chemical processes to make advancements in energy efficiency and pollution reduction. Few experiments exist that can get a full chemical picture of the chemistry occurring in complex reacting systems, since many of the critical molecular species formed are unstable with very short lifetimes. This work focuses on the development of new micro-reactors that can probe the chemistry on the order of microseconds to directly measure the fundamental chemistry of gas-phase reactive systems. When coupled with other diagnostics, these micro-reactors will give a nearly full chemical picture of the chemistry that occurs. If successful, these proposed micro-reactors will be a valuable research tool that will significantly enhance the ability of the field to measure the chemical products of gas-phase reactions, leading to more accurate kinetic models with wide ranging applications from engine design to air quality modeling.\r\n\r\nThe objective of this proposed work is to design and fabricate a novel micro-reactor for advanced chemical diagnostics for combustion and gas-phase reactive flows. While micro-reactors have been used to study pyrolysis (thermal decomposition) reactions previously, these reactors are limited in their experimental capabilities due to the reactive nature of the base material, silicon carbide (SiC) with oxygen and uncertain pressure and temperature conditions in the reactor. To directly address these issues, computational analysis will be employed to redesign the geometry of the reactor to produce stable thermodynamic fluid properties within the reactor, leading to accurate determination of reaction temperature and pressure. Then, these reactors will be fabricated using a combination of 3-D printing, casting, and micro-drilling methods. Two sets of reactors are planned: one set will be made of SiC for comparison to existing pyrolysis reactors and a second set will be made of non-reactive materials, such as quartz or sapphire, for fuel oxidation study. Performance characterization of these reactors will be completed through a series of experiments that probe the temperature and pressure behavior of fuels in a reactive environment. This powerful new instrument has the potential to help unravel still unanswered questions such as how soot is formed and destroyed, what are the dominant reaction paths for ignition, and how do pollutants interact with ozone in the upper atmosphere.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

These experiments are typically designed to identify the products of pyrolysis produced during a short residence time of 100 -125&micro;s. This makes micro-reactors ideally suited for use with infrared spectroscopy and photoionization mass spectroscopy.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>While micro-reactors are useful experimental tools, the fabrication of small geometry reactors that can withstand the high temperatures (often at or above 1700 K) necessary for these experiments can be a significant challenge. The reactor design we sought to improve upon are straight tubes manufactured using silicon carbide with an inner diameter of ~1 mm and length of 28 mm. While these reactors have been successfully used to probe the pyrolysis chemistry of a range of fuels and fuel surrogates, pressure change throughout the length of these tubes is a problem for kinetics experiments.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In this work, our primary goal was to develop new ways to manufacture silicon carbide to create new reactors that minimize pressure drop. Computational fluid dynamics was used to design the modified reactor geometry. The ideal reactor geometry incorporates a tapered section upstream of the reactor. This constriction creates a uniform pressure distribution through a majority of the reactor length, coupled with a stabilized velocity distribution accompanied by a well distributed temperature profile.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The biggest challenge with this project involved the significant challenges in working with silicon carbide. High hardness and great brittleness make the process of manufacturing small scale, high aspect ratio geometries complex. To mitigate these complexities, two concurrent routes of manufacturing the reactor were investigated: conventional manufacturing processes and additive manufacturing.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Squeeze casting was the conventional manufacturing process initially chosen. This technique is a liquid material forging process, in which the material in the liquid state solidifies when closed dies are positioned between the plates of a hydraulic press. The combination of the pressure applied and the contact between the liquid metal and the die surface produces an environment that is ideally suited to produce a pore free, fine-grain structure. Despite initially promising results, the squeeze casting process was deemed unsuitable to manufacture the reactor due to the extremely low wall thicknesses (&lt;400 micron) which caused localized cracking and fracturing.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Additive manufacturing was also explored as it presents a highly flexible process which can be used to make quick, iterative changes. To test the applicability of these processes in manufacturing the reactor geometry, existing 3D printing resources at the CU Boulder were utilized. However, reactors produced through this process were shown to have defects such as cracks, localized deformations, and improper binding of the resin. The geometry of the reactor along with the associated tolerances were deemed too complex to be manufactured using conventional SLA printers. Powder-bed inkjet printing was also explored. This process involves layering a binder phase into a bed of ceramic powder. This technique can be used to create complex geometries with high aspect ratios. For this process to be successful, stable ceramic inks would need to be developed which can dry sufficiently fast enough for the process to be viable.

An isostatic pressing technique was created to fabricate the reactor. Isostatic pressing is a conventional manufacturing process which is routinely used to create hollow/thin walled cylindrical ceramic and metallic structures. The process involves compacting a dry or semi-dry powder in an elastomeric mold submerged in a pressurized fluid environment. This technique was used with a mandrel, which was designed to incorporate the internal contours of the reactor (including the taper).
