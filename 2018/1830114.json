 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is funding to support participation by about 10 U.S. graduate students and 5 senior mentors in the Doctoral Colloquium workshop held in conjunction with the 2018 ACM Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing (CSCW 2018), which will be held in Jersey City, New Jersey, USA on November 3-7, 2018. The annual CSCW conference is a leading international forum for the presentation and discussion of research, design and practice of collaboration, collaborative systems and social computing. The goals of the workshop are to provide feedback and advice on current research and future careers to students who are nearing graduation; to foster creativity, communication, and collaboration across diverse topics of interest in CSCW; and to build a cohort of leading student social computing researchers. The organizers will make a particular effort to reach students from groups traditionally underrepresented in CSCW (and more broadly computer and information science and engineering) in order to broaden the impact of the workshop.\r\n \r\nThe workshop will take place November 3-4, 2018 with follow-up events during the conference's main technical program. Participants will be recruited with a wide net, with an emphasis on broadening participation and diversity of institutions, topics, and fields (including but not limited to  from a variety of fields such as computer science/engineering, information science, psychology, cognitive science, and social psychology). The format includes oral and poster presentations by student attendees, a hands-on breakout session, a panel discussion, and an informal dinner and one-on-one conversations with mentors. This format enables students to share and receive feedback on their research while learning from senior and junior researchers in the field.  Workshop participants will also gain knowledge of current research conducted by their colleagues, awareness of diverse interdisciplinary methodologies, and an understanding of emerging themes in CSCW.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

(Prior to the workshop each mentor was &ldquo;assigned&rdquo; to five students and was directed to read that students&rsquo; materials &mdash; i.e. a research proposal and personal statement &mdash; to prepare to give detailed feedback to their assigned students). In the afternoon, there were two rounds of small group discussions and feedback, where 2-3 students met with an assigned mentor to talk in more depth about their work and career goals.
