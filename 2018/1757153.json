 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award funds a series of conferences and workshops in game theory and applications of game theory. The conference, follow-on workshops, and lectures are held each summer as a coordinated program designed to bring together a distinguished group of senior scientists from around the globe with junior faculty and graduate students from across the U.S. Topics include new developments in game theory, areas in the intersection between game theory and computer science (such as Computation and Privacy), and applications of game theory to business and public policy. The activities advance science by giving young scholars the opportunity to form new research collaborations and present their work to a distinguished audience. \r\n\r\nTopics include cooperative game theory, The Interface of Economics and Computing, Machine Learning and Data Science, Strategic Communication and Learning, Mechanism Design, Agents with Mis-specified models, Pricing in Complex Markets, Learning, Contagion, and Coordination in Networks, Delegation as an Economic Phenomenon, Game Theory and Computation, Matching Theory and Applications, Game Theory in Operations Research, Decision Theory, and Advances in Learning Theory.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
