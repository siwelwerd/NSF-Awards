This research addresses new hardware-oriented capabilities and mechanisms for protecting Internet of Things (IoT) devices. This research has the potential to significantly enhance the security capability of today and emerging applications, particularly those that can benefit from reliable authentication using hardware features. \r\n\r\nThe project concerns a hardware-based authentication framework using strong physical unclonable functions (PUFs) for enhanced security for Internet of Things (IOT) devices.  It focuses on new authentication techniques, incorporating lightweight cryptographic primitives with PUFs, and novel pre-boot authentication and storage encryption functions for trusted platform modules (TPM). The project will evaluate the proposed techniques against a threat model, including model-building, replay, and probing attacks.",
