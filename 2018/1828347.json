 "awd_abstract_narration": "Producing graduates with science, technology, engineering and mathematics competencies continues to be a national concern and priority. Research has suggested the United States workforce may suffer a deficit of one million STEM graduates over the next decade. Annually, less than half of the three million students who enter U.S. colleges intending to major in a STEM field persist in STEM until graduation. The situation is worse among groups (i.e., African American, Hispanic, and Native American) traditionally underrepresented in STEM. For example, in engineering, underrepresented groups account for just 16% of all undergraduate students; those who decided to major in engineering switch to non-STEM fields before graduation twice as often as White students. The representation of Black males particularly continues to be a challenge. Each year, about 64% of White males earn a bachelor's degree in engineering, compared to about 5% of African American males. At the graduate level, Black males only account for 3% and 1.7% of STEM master's and doctoral degrees, respectively. Moreover, Black males account for 3.6% of the engineering workforce and a dismal 2.5% of engineering faculty. This collaborative research focuses on understanding the factors that influence the decisions of Black males to pursue advanced engineering degrees, uncovering the assets/strengths that Black males possess who persist or plan to continue in engineering beyond the baccalaureate degree, and determining the role of academic self-concept and engineering identity in the intent to pursue advanced engineering degrees. This study includes Black male engineering students, advanced degree holders and faculty from a Predominantly White Institution (University of Connecticut), a Hispanic-serving institution (University of Houston), a Historically Black University (Prairie View Agricultural & Mechanical University) and from members of the National Society of Black Engineers. \r\n\r\nThis project pursues three research questions: 1) What factors influenced Black males to pursue graduate degrees in engineering? 2) What assets/strengths do Black males possess who persist or plan to continue in engineering beyond undergraduate studies? 3) What role does academic self-concept and engineering identity play in the intent to pursue advanced degrees among Black males? To answer these questions, the project employs a mixed-method approach. Data sources include formal semi-structured interviews and surveys. This project uniquely contributes to research literature on cultural capital, anti-deficit achievement, and engineering identity work. The evaluation uses a values-engaged, educative approach. This work stands to influence the recruitment and retention of engineering graduate students and give insight into creating a pipeline for Black male engineering faculty. This work will be leveraged to create a national Black male engineering colloquium devoted to sharing relevant research along with career development and graduate school opportunities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Broader Impacts: To answer this question the project was divided into three phases: one in which we interviewed 16 participants who were pursuing or who had recently earned their advanced degrees, one in which we interviewed 20 engineering undergraduate students about their graduate aspirations, and one in which we interviewed 26 Black male engineering faculty from across the country to glean insights into best practices for recruiting and retaining Black men in engineering graduate programs. Shared in the four publications which are a part of the NSF record and two conference presentations that have resulted from this work, we found that Black men pursued advanced degrees in engineering despite challenges because of their love for knowledge, the future financial implications of obtaining an advanced degree, and because of the support of mentors and family. Undergraduate student participants indicated that a love for their disciplines, early exposure to what it means to be a graduate student, and the support of mentors contributed to their future graduate school aspirations. Last, Black male engineering faculty indicated that if institutions were serious about recruiting and retaining Black men in engineering degree programs, piecemeal approaches will not work. Institutions should; however, implement concerted efforts such as the ?STEP Forward Approach? that we developed from participants? own words which include: supportive environments for retaining, targeted recruiting, early exposure to mentors and research opportunities, and pathway approaches to recruiting that must start earlier than college. Broader Impacts: Beyond journal publications, we have mentored eight graduate and undergraduate students and one postdoctoral research associate on this project and have engaged 51 research study participants in assets-based discussions about engineering advanced degree seeking among Black men.
