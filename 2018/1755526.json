 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides core support for capacity building, communications and information technology activities of the US Hub of Future Earth Secretariat. The Future Earth program seeks to coordinate international global change research to help accelerate transformations to sustainability through research and innovation. In this role, the US Hub of Future Earth serves as a convener that helps US researchers engage in research based on the co-design and co-production of knowledge and tools designed to help develop solutions to global environmental challenges such as fresh water security, coastal vulnerability, disaster risk reduction and resilience. The program is supported by major U.S. agencies, under the interdisciplinary auspices of the U.S. Global Change Research Program. Over the past several years, the US Hub has taken on activities that directly support the USGCRP and its member agencies. These funds will be used to further engage the US research community in these developing efforts. \r\n\r\nThe Future Earth program is organized around three major themes: Dynamic Planet; Global Development; and Transformations toward Sustainability. Under the auspices of these three themes, the US Hub of the Future Earth Secretariat will support workshops and other efforts to foster the co-design of research to enhance transdisciplinary efforts to help develop solutions for many challenging societal issues. The US Hub will also develop programs and initiatives to educate the next generation of inter-disciplinary researchers and professionals on how to integrate global sustainability with human prosperity and will actively engage the public through an extensive communication and outreach effort.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
