The conference will focus on recent advances in automorphic forms and automorphic representations, particularly those related to covering (metaplectic) groups. Participating researchers are from the US, Israel, Europe, South Korea, and Singapore.\r\n\r\nAutomorphic forms and automorphic representations are topics with historical origins in number theory, but recent advances have led to new and surprising connections with mathematical physics. A particular theme of the conference will be the uses of small automorphic representations in both number theory and string theory. The web site for the conference may be found at https://www.math.ethz.ch/fim/conferences/friedberg.html.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
