 "awd_abstract_narration": "The growth and maintenance of the brain require substantial investments of energy, most especially for organisms which have evolved very large and complex brains. One of the most defining characteristics for the human species and the other primates is large brain size relative to body size. Yet, despite having larger brains than most other mammals, human and nonhuman primates do not show an increase in their basal metabolic rate (a measure of energy utilization by the body) compared to other mammals, raising the question of how the high energetic cost of such large brains is met. This trend suggests that there is an energetic trade-off with another energy-demanding tissue in the body when brain size increases; if we are not using more energy overall, then energy that could be invested in another part of our body is instead likely being utilized to fuel our large brains. Preliminary research shows that primates have low muscle mass when compared to other animals, and humans, who have the most notable increase in brain size, show a 50% reduction in overall muscle mass when compared with other mammals. This research therefore tests the hypothesis that skeletal muscle is in direct competition with the brain for glucose and oxygen, such that the high energetic demands of large brain size are met through constraining muscle mass, constituting an energetic tradeoff between skeletal muscle growth and maintenance, and brain growth and maintenance.      \r\n\r\nIf the brain does constrain muscle mass, then 1)larger brains should be associated with decreased skeletal muscle mass; 2)the percentage of type I muscle fibers (a type of muscle cell that uses energy [glucose, a type of sugar] in a similar fashion to brain cells) should show a relative decrease in relation to larger brain size; and 3)muscle mass development should be suppressed until brain growth is complete, and once complete, there should be an increase in muscle mass development. To test these predictions, muscle tissue samples will be collected from a diverse array of primate specimens, comprising a range of brain sizes and representing all developmental stages. The generated muscle energy use profiles for each species will then be analyzed in relation to variation in brain size, with the results applied to understanding the interaction between brain size and evolved metabolic strategies. \r\n\r\nReducing muscle mass may have predisposed primates such as humans to certain metabolic disorders (e.g., type 2 diabetes); thus, understanding if there is such a constraint has important health implications. Ultimately, the data collected can be incorporated into studies of growth and development, as well as biomechanics, and the results may encourage development of biomedical gene therapies. The research also will provide a rich database for scientists in other disciplines focusing on animal anatomy and physiology, facilitating and expanding future research. The collaborative project brings together international researchers, and will support the training of multiple undergraduate and graduate students from three US universities. As two of these universities are in EPSCoR states, and one is a historically minority-serving institution, the project will foster research advancement for underserved and underrepresented populations.",

Yet the brain is energetically expensive to grow and maintain.  Understanding the price our order Primates, which includes humans, has paid for our large brain size was central to this project?s research objectives.  Despite having larger brains than most other mammals, humans and non-human primates do not show an increase in energy usage ? basal metabolic rates.  This trend suggests that there is an energetic trade-off with another tissue as brain size increases.  Meaning, if our bodies do not use more energy, then we must save energy from one part of our body to fuel our brains.  Extensive research on ?expensive? organs, like the digestive organs (stomach and intestines), show no correlation with brain size and thus our project set out to search for correlations with another system that consumes lots of energy: the muscular system.  We found that primates have low muscle mass when compared to other animals.  Humans, who have the most notable increase in brain size show a fifty percent reduction in overall relative muscle mass when compared with other mammals.  This suggests that muscle may be an expensive organ.\n\n \n\nOur research explored the relationship between skeletal muscle and brain size.  We hypothesized that, because both are high energy consuming systems, the brain constrains muscle mass.  We explored this question at the gross anatomical level (muscle mass vs brain volume), microscopically (muscle fiber type vs brain size), and developmentally (infant brain size and muscle mass vs adult brain size and muscle mass).  Hundreds of primate specimens were dissected, and muscle tissue samples collected to create a muscle energy use profile for each species. The sample includes animals of all developmental ages and species of primates from across the whole order. \n\n \n\nWe found that there was a significant negative correlation between skeletal muscle mass and relative brain size in primates ? primates with large brains have small muscles and vice versa.  We also found that primate infants uniformly have large brains relative to body size and significantly less muscle than fully developed primates.  In our study, we defined fully developed primates as those that have reached adult brain size (e.g., ~8 years in humans). \n\n \n\nOur microscopic study also yielded interesting results.  We predicted that there would be a significant negative correlation between the percentage of type I muscle fibers (a type of muscle cell that uses energy [glucose, a type of sugar] in a similar fashion to brain cells) and relative brain size.  Our research did find that the percentage of type I muscle fibers did negatively correlate with muscle mass.  Muscle is made of two types of fibers, and if one fiber type correlates negatively with brain size, you would assume the other positively correlates.  That pattern was not observed. Future work will evaluate how cell volume may need to be consider when determining how the brain has constrained muscle in primates.\n\n \n\nThese findings and our raw data have been published in well-respected journals and books and we have shared data and specimens with other researchers and students.  Since we dissected so many important specimens during the course of this data collection, we have also published many papers about pieces of musculoskeletal anatomy that did not directly relate to these original hypotheses but were extra valuable findings that were made along the way.  This project has directly supported undergraduate and graduate students, but it has also indirectly contributed to the academic training for dozens more.  Undergraduate educational modules for anatomy and physiology were created and implemented and shared regionally.  This project could not be accomplished without the collaborations of our foreign collaborators.  We will continue to disseminate our findings from this study to others interested in growth and development, biomechanics, and muscle physiology.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/14/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Adam Hartstone-Rose"
