It also addresses novel materials such as oxide semiconductors, organic semiconductors and aspects of heterogeneous integration, e.g. of compound semiconductors with Si-based technology.\r\n\r\nThe conference is expected to be attended by approximately 300 attendees. All types of research institutions (academia, government research institutes and industrial laboratories) will be represented. The conference will also feature for the first time a focused session on the important topic of Ga2O3.\r\n\r\nThe 2018 Compound Semiconductor Week Conference ISCS/IPRM will allow participants to gain exposure to the new advances in semiconductor growth, fabrication technology, device physics, and entrepreneurship in electronics and optoelectronics. The timing of the conference is ideal for the new generation of students in science and engineering to learn about semiconductor technology development. The outcome of the conference will be widely accessible through the electronic and printed Conference Program, the workshop website, as well as a special Journal Proceedings Volume.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
