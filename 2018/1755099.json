 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports history of science research at the interface of science and religion. The research explores the relationships between the science of vision, images, and the optical-psychological practices with images at a critical juncture of western civilization. Specifically, it focuses on relationships between understandings of optics and violent European religious iconoclasms that occurred during the early modern period. The researcher will show that common beliefs about the ways vision and visual psychology worked, and the different uses of that knowledge by artists on the one hand and theologians on the other, set religious art on a collision course with the Reformation understandings of the image. The connections between science, religion, and society that are to be revealed in this study will serve to create scholarly exchanges among those in the natural sciences, social sciences, visual arts, and several fields within the humanities. The results of this study will be integrated into curricular development at the undergraduate and graduate levels, and they will be disseminated in professional journals and conferences. Finally, there will be a conference to extend the trajectories of the main lines of inquiry of this research.\r\n\r\nThe overarching research question of this study addresses what the science of vision can teach us about iconoclastic violence. The researcher will engage in this study first setting out the understandings of optics in this period among different levels of society, then comparing textual evidence in Latin and vernacular religious texts alongside visual and text evidence from the artists. Scientific understandings today recognize vision, perception, and memory storage as physical processes that create both temporary and long-term changes to the brain. Early scientists also recognized the power of vision, especially when focused on images, to alter the mind physically. Those who urgently called for immediate destruction of religious images repeatedly point to the fact that the devout had confused the material image with the holy figure portrayed, and were treating the material object as though it were alive. As the Reformers point out, the optical habits of daily meditation on images, especially on images that appeared alive, caused the images to become physically part of the person's memory, and shaped the person's identity. The iconoclasts understood their image destruction to be destroying a deeply ingrained psychological part of the individual that was considered religiously pernicious.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual Merit. This award was made to research and write an academic book examining the question, Did knowledge of vision and visual psychology inadvertently promote the violent destruction of religious images in early modern Europe?  Many rationales for the widespread iconoclasms have been demonstrated, but this question had never been asked. \n\nThis question was divided into three: 1) What was the understanding of vision and visual psychology as it was known through popular textbooks and the works of the great scientists?  2) What did the producers (artists and patrons) of the religious images use from this science to advance their goals in making images? 3) What did those who preached either the defense of the monuments or their destruction use from the science as rationales for their positions?  I will address my contributions in these three areas.\n\n1) Previous scholars have focused primarily on one of two aspects of vision. Those who are most interested in light radiation and its mathematics have studied what happens in the distance between the surface of the object of sight (in this case a religious image) and the arrival of a replica (copy, imago) of the original external object at the forefront of the brain. Other scholars have focused on the ways the brain worked with that incoming replica. My study is unique in explaining, in detail, how early modern readers understood a replica of the external object to be carried via rays of colored light physically through the media, what happened to that imago when it moved through the eyes, optic nerves, and then was processed within the brain.  In the early modern period the brain\u2019s processing was thought to occur via a lower Sensitive Soul associated with brute animals, and by the higher and uniquely human Intellectual Soul.  At the end of this process the now highly refined imago was physically installed in the person\u2019s memory.\n\n2) The uses that artists made of mathematical perspective has long been studied. While the artists may have used the optical treatises for the creation of mathematical perspective, I find their primary interest was not, per se, in the mathematical construction of perspective, but rather in how this was useful for obtaining their larger goal.  It was their goal to create an emotional bond between the religious image and its viewer.  To this end, they used techniques that were drawn from texts on the psychological processing of the image in the Sensitive Soul.  The goal was ultimately to transform the viewer, creating a devotion that would involve the emulation of the deeds shown, and would be retained in visual memory&mdash; known to be much more secure than any verbal memory.\n\n3) The leading defenders and destroyers among the theologians and preachers were highly educated.  They had all gone beyond a basic university education where vision and its relation to the psyche/soul was part of the basic curriculum.  Their rationales for defense or destruction are drawn from the psychology of vision, notably that found throughout the Aristotelian De anima tradition. Noting the emotional bond between viewers and the religious object, those who preached destruction insisted that the viewer had become animal-like, using only the Soul attached to the physical senses (the animal-like Sensitive Soul).  Their emotional attachments to the religious images had confused these viewers at several levels. They treated the objects like people, kissing them and bringing them gifts.  Their \"love\" was an addiction, habit-formed by the ways the imago moves through the eyes and Soul(s). This habit-formation was directly related to emotional and repetitive viewing of the object.  Some of the reformation theologians warned against the destruction of the images, but most felt that the only way to break the addiction was to destroy the images.  In fact, since the image was physically ensconced in the memory, this second \"idol in the heart\" had to be removed as well.  Violence would further this second removal, using many of the techniques of the ancient damnatio memoriae. \n\nThe defenders of the religious artworks believed that the emulation of the represented people and deeds portrayed was elevating human nature beyond its bestial state.\n\nBroader Impacts.  A draft of this book has been finished, and is under editorial review. Its publication will broaden the dissemination of this research.  Further, I have incorporated this work into my teaching at a regional state university, where I focus on interrelations between art and science.  This project has resulted in a new course on image destruction in a twenty-first century context.  My initial study indicates that much of the old science still lives in the present.  Those who love the monuments and those who are angered by them make the same or very similar arguments as those found in the texts written 500 years ago.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/29/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Mary Quinlan-Mcgrath"
