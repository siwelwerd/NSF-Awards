 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site is at the University of Puerto Rico - Rio Piedras, located in San Juan, PR, and is lead by Arthur Tinoco. It supports the training of 10 students for 9 weeks during the summers of 2018-2020. At this site, supported by the Division of Chemistry in the Mathematical and Physical Science Directorate, students engage in fundamental studies of materials and biomolecules for potential applications in water purification, energy storage, sensing, drug design, and drug delivery. Students further develop their skill sets for the biotechnology and pharmaceutical fields through seminars and hands-on workshops. Alongside scientific research, students take part in professional development seminars on topics including ethics in research, strategies for producing high quality research and public presentations, and funding opportunities for graduate work. Students also engage in discussions with professionals in academia and industry about their respective job fields.  The participants are recruited from a diverse pool of students with an emphasis on students from two and four-year institutions with limited access to research opportunities. \r\n\r\nStudents who participate in this nine-week program engage in fundamental exploratory efforts using state-of-the-art technology for chemical and/or computational characterization and for engineering materials and biomolecules for potential applications in the areas of water purification, energy storage, sensing, drug design, and drug delivery. The students work directly with advanced graduate students or postdoctoral researchers who serve as co-mentors alongside experienced faculty. Students also participate in workshops on topics such as high-resolution NMR spectroscopy, chromatography, peptide synthesis/purification/identification, X-ray characterization, electrochemistry, nanoparticle characterization and surface analysis. Participants take part in a series of seminars and develop science communication skills through oral and poster presentations on their research. Ultimately this site prepares students for graduate school and careers in Puerto Rico's pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Also, this program offered information about the Puerto Rican academic, biotechnology, and pharmaceutical job markets as viable career options. A diverse set of research laboratories participated in PR-CLIMB, focusing on fundamental studies on the engineering of materials and biomolecules for potential applications in water purification, energy storage, sensing, drug design, and drug delivery. All participants or PR-CLIMBers, as we like to call them, received mentorship from the principal investigator of the laboratories and a co-mentor in the form of a senior graduate student or postdoctoral researcher. The faculty mentors include the program?s director Dr. Tinoco, the University of Puerto Rico (UPR) Rio Piedras campus professors Drs. Vilmali Lopez, Marvin Bayro, Kai Griebenow, Jorge Colon, Liz Diaz, Carlos Cabrera, Zhongfang Chen, Jose Rivera, Zhongfang Chen, Jose Rodriguez Martinez, and Eduardo Nicolau, UPR Medical Sciences professors Drs. Torsten Stelzer, Abel Baerga, UPR Mayaguez professors Enrique Melendez and Juan Lopez Garriga, and UPR Humacao professor Dr. Mirna Rivera.</p>\n<p>The 2018 and 2019 cycles of the program ran in the traditional summer, 9-week modality on the UPR Rio Piedras campus. The PR-CLIMBers participated in workshops with hands-on experiences on modern chemical instrumentation. The workshops focused on topics in cell culturing, MALDI TOF TOF, high resolution NMR, chromatography, x-ray characterization, electrochemistry, nanoparticle characterization, and surface analysis. The participants also engaged in a seminar series in which presentations on scientific writing, ethics in research, communication and presentation skills, online resources, professional development, graduate studies and research fellowship opportunities were offered. As part of this series, the students presented their research plans via a flash oral presentation designed for a general scientific audience. The participants had the unique opportunity to the local pharmaceutical company Lilly del Caribe. Due to the COVID19 pandemic, the 2020 cycle was modified into a hybrid format, taking place during the academic semester. A all seminars and workshops were virtual but research was maintained in person. The virtual component of the program enabled a wider network of scientists to participate resulting in additional professional development opportunities (i.e. scientific figure making session) and research seminar lectures from professors outside of Puerto Rico. During the Closing Ceremony Research Symposia, the participants presented their research results and were evaluated by a panel of judges. The participant earning the highest evaluation each cycle was awarded full support to attend a national conference. Professionals from diverse STEM sectors are invited to the symposia to provide further insight into the PR-CLIMB mission and inspire participants to pursue a STEM career.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Broader Impact</strong></p>\n<p>The PR-CLIMB program has attracted an ethnically, socioeconomically, and geographically diverse student pool (<strong>Table 1</strong>). We make a strong effort to recruit students who would be most transformed by the traineeship with its emphasis on the biotech/pharmaceutical fields and tackling research projects that can directly impact on revitalizing Puerto Rico. The program has been extremely successful in helping to maintain participants in the STEM fields (<strong>Table 2</strong>) and producing several post-program accomplishments. Students have presented their research at national conferences; an average of five per year. Collectively, the program has generated 6 peer reviewed publications. &nbsp;Some of the local participants have continued to perform research with their REU mentors and others have enrolled in graduate school at UPR RP.</p>\n<p>The PR-CLIMB program has also extended its services beyond the core participants. It has provided mentorship training opportunities to the student mentors of the program and has propelled their respective doctoral/postdoctoral work. The program has networked with other on-campus summer traineeships such as the American Chemical Society and NIH STEP UP to share resources and offer its workshops and seminars to their respective participants. These resources were also shared with other summer student researchers not affiliated with these programs and due to the COVID19 pandemic, they have been extended to professors and their students at other institutions within Puerto Rico throughout the academic year. The necessity to create educational content in video form for virtual dissemination of knowledge has led to the beginnings of additional traineeship material for a variety of future application. The program has even extended its reach into science outreach, most recently preparing a video on inclusivity designed for the ACS Festival \"Sticking with Chemistry\". These accomplishments demonstrate PR-CLIMB's excellent sustainability and vast outreach.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 08/30/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Arthur&nbsp;Tinoco</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1757365/1757365_10540721_1630296109801_PRCLIMBGroupPictures--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1757365/1757365_10540721_1630296109801_PRCLIMBGroupPictures--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1757365/1757365_10540721_1630296109801_PRCLIMBGroupPictures--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Figure 1.
