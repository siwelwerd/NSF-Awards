 "awd_abstract_narration": "Understanding the socio-political impact of ethnic, religious, and linguistic diversity is a vital concern for both social scientists and policy-makers. Using several different datasets measuring diversity around the world, researchers have found that it often has a negative impact on democracy, development and political stability. However, these findings rely on fundamentally flawed datasets: their demographic estimates come from questionable sources and do not vary within countries or over time. This makes them ill-suited to studying outcomes like war and development, which often change rapidly and cluster in space. In addition, the existing datasets cannot be directly compared, making it difficult to assess their accuracy. Rather than investing time and money in the collection of new data, this project builds on an existing resource: 9 million survey responses from 175 countries around the world. By using Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods to compare these surveys to official statistics and generate improved diversity estimates, other researchers will be able to apply this method in other areas like health and inequality where government statistics are missing or questionable. Further, this project will make our results directly comparable to existing datasets. These data and methods will be made available through a user-friendly online portal, where scientists, policy-makers, and members of the public will be able to explore the data. They will also be able to create their own datasets and use visualization tools to see how the world's demographics are changing and consider what this means for our future.\r\n\r\nExisting estimates of ethnic, religious, and linguistic diversity are correlated cross-sectionally with a number of socio-political and economic outcomes including development, conflict, and social capital. Close examination of these data raises validity concerns: few are based on high-quality official statistics, the majority coming from questionable secondary sources. Further, criteria for group inclusion (i.e., ontologies) are opaque and inconsistently applied. Even where they appear accurate, data are static and aggregated at the country level, although they are often used to explain time-varying and spatially disaggregated outcomes. Ontologies in extant datasets are also incompatible, making comparison and integration difficult. This proposal improves existing measures by applying machine learning methods to compare 9 million responses across 175 countries with a new database of census results. An algorithm will identify survey design features that maximize accuracy, to define a compensatory weighting scheme across these features. The result is a set of survey-based demographic estimates with improved validity, even for countries lacking reliable census data. This method of triangulating surveys and official statistics is generalizable to research areas that use either source and can also inform improved survey design. The project will also develop tools for linking surveys, censuses, and existing datasets based on explicit and transparent decision rules to facilitate their comparison and integration. An online portal will provide access to datasets and code, supporting customized data manipulation and visualization. The methods and tools proposed here -- emphasizing accuracy, transparency, and cross-resource integration -- should serve as a model for future data collection.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

We find that existing diversity metrics likely suffer from systematic measurement error: (i) they are significantly worse in countries that lack high-quality census data on ethnicity, religion, and language; and (ii) the availability of these censuses appears to be related to diversity and a host of variables diversity is thought to impact. When data quality is systematically related to variables in our statistical models, it becomes impossible to make valid inferences. In this case, the fact that measurement error is related to diversity and its correlates calls into question many existing models of diversity's causes and consequences.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">To generate more valid measures of diversity around the world and update these existing models, we make use of over 13.5 million responses to 5700 surveys conducted across multiple countries over multiple waves by nineteen different professional survey projects. Unlike censuses, these cross-national, multi-wave surveys are broadly available and do not follow a systematic pattern. And because each survey project generates data for multiple countries, we are able to leverage inter-source overlap to assess the quality of the underlying surveys. To do so, we compare survey-based demographics to those produced by high-quality censuses. We combine insights from multiple machine learning algorithms to identify which survey features generate a mismatch between the two. Surveys with these features are down-weighted, resulting in more valid estimates of diversity for each country.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">To support our analysis, we amass an entire database of ethnic, religious, and linguistic censuses, including census forms and final results. We also develop a system for linking response categories across surveys in each country, and then connecting these with census categories, creating an up-to-date dictionary of ethnic, religious, and linguistic groups in each country. Together, these elements comprise the Global Diversity Index (GDI), accessible through a state-of-the-art web portal, complete with dynamic dashboard for exploring variation in diversity around the world. Through the portal, scholars from across the social and behavioral sciences can access all of our databases. Meanwhile, the dynamic dashboard is designed for non-specialists, including students, to use so that they may also assess how diversity can and should be measured worldwide.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Our updated measure of ethnic diversity is statistically significant from existing metrics in over 75% of cases. Moreover, the new measure paints a clearer picture of diversity's consequences. On the one hand, we are able to reaffirm an existing conclusion &mdash; that diverse countries are no more likely to experience civil wars. On the other, we overturn two existing findings. We challenge the conclusion that more ethnically diverse countries suffer worse economic outcomes and we call into question the claim that diverse countries have less social capital and weaker social bonds. These results raise critical new questions about the impact of diversity, specifically, while also highlighting the importance of measurement validity to our understanding of the world around us.</span></p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 11/29/2024<br>\nModified by: Avital&nbsp;Livny</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1824005/1824005_10558242_1732909119695_Cross_Walk_Illustration_2--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1824005/1824005_10558242_1732909119695_Cross_Walk_Illustration_2--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Dictionary of Ethnic Categories in Peru\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1824005/1824005_10558242_1732909119695_Cross_Walk_Illustration_2--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Dictionary of Ethnic Categories in Peru\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Ethnic categories that appear in surveys and censuses taken in Peru.
