However, concrete is a poor thermal insulator. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, energy loss through inefficient building envelopes inflicts an excessive financial burden on homeowners. In this research, the research team studied a novel way of reducing the thermal conductivity of cement-based matrices by coupling calcium-silicate-hydrate (C-S-H), the main constituent of cement-based matrices, with organic molecules called organosilanes. The results obtained shall benefit our society with a new multifunctional building material that can lower heating and cooling energy consumption while maintaining structural performance, with a collateral benefit that it is lightweight. The acquired knowledge can be utilized by industry and academia in developing energy-efficient and resilient building envelopes to bolster our national energy security and offer positive socioeconomic and environmental impacts.</p>\n<p>For the first time, this research award demonstrated that the nanoengineering of high-efficiency scattering mechanisms into the molecular structure of calcium-silicate-hydrate (C-S-H) using short-chain organosilanes molecules is achievable through sol-gel processing and scalable to be adopted in concrete technology.</p>\n<p>First, it revealed that incorporating organometallic molecules into the molecular structure of the C-S-H gel reconfigures its atomistic order by increasing the interlayer spacing and reducing the molecular order in the CaO layer. Such changes in the molecular framework of hybrid C-S-H gels accommodate longer chain molecules with silanol bonds condensing on the opposite Ca-galleries. The condensation of silanol bonds of organosilanes on the Ca-polyhedra layer establishes simple dimer, or trimer, silicon tetrahedra segments. Moreover, the observed differences between reference and hybrid C-S-H gels point toward the layered hexagonal Ca-polyhedra arrangement in hybrid gels and nanocrystalline turbostratic structures. Moreover, interlayer spacing in hybrid gels does not contract upon dehydration from 50&#8451; up to 105&#8451;, indicating they do not experience autogenous shrinkage along the crystal c-direction.</p>\n<p>Second, the molecular scale crosslinking of C-S-H with bis-organosilanes effectively reduces its thermal conductivity at the nanoscale. This fact draws its support from the analytical inference of the intrinsic conductivity of modified solids based on the effective conductivity measurements collected in the steady-state heat flow experiments. At the nano-crystallite particle scale, the observed reduction in crosslinked gels may reach up to 70% of the conductivity observed for classical C-S-H (Ca/Si=1, 1.15 W/(mK). The atomistic simulations developed within this collaborative award corroborate this fact independently. Through the detailed study of heat transport at the molecular level, the research team showed that C-S-H crosslinking promotes localized phonons (locons) at the expense of propagating (propagons) and diffusive (diffuson) modes. Such redistribution of vibrational modes is at the core of thermal conductivity reduction in hybridized C-S-H solids. Additionally, the decrease in the intrinsic thermal conductivity of crosslinked C-S-H correlates with the CH2 linear chain length of the bis-organosilane. Such a positive correlation partially derives from the apparent density reduction.</p>\n<p>Third, the thermal conductivity of inorganic C-S-H corresponds to the conductivity of disordered crystals in which heat transport characteristics are that of phonons in glasses. This conclusion arrives from the close match between the experimentally inferred conductivity and the amorphous limit calculated with the modified Einstein's model. It also strongly suggests that despite some degree of the long-range order, the glass-like heat energy transport model tends to be applicable to capture C-S-H's volume average thermal conductivity.</p>\n<p>Lastly, the novel crosslinked nanocomposites of calcium-silicate-hydrate can be effectively incorporated into cement-based building composites, lightweight and regular concrete. Their high specific surface area and surface functionalization increase the water demand, which results in lower packing density of cement hydration products, higher porosity, and lower thermal conductivity. The commercially available high-range water reducers can reduce water demand and aid in the modulation of the pore size distribution in the presence of organic-inorganic C-S-H nanolaminates. This would allow for preparing a hybrid cement composite of textural and mechanical characteristics comparable to the reference cementitious but with higher thermal isolation potential.</p>\n<p>Key components of this research award included core hypothesis testing, development of the synthesis protocols and high fidelity atomistic models of crosslinked C-S-H, multi-scale experimental and computational evaluation of thermo-mechanical properties and microstructural effect in organic-inorganic cement-composites incorporating bris-organosilane molecules. It also provided fundamental insight into the heat transport mechanism in organic-inorganic solids. The results are useful for industry, academia, and regulatory agencies to expedite the development and implementation of energy-efficient building envelopes.</p>\n<p>The current award contributed to graduate and undergraduate students' being offered unique multidisciplinary learning experiences across fields of heat transport, atomistic simulation, materials synthesis, and characterization. Moreover, it provided learning opportunities for K-12 students from the local high schools with the potential career opportunities of the STEM majors through on- and off-campus interactions, hands-on experiments, and scientific demonstrations prepared and delivered by the research team. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 01/12/2024<br>\nModified by: Konrad&nbsp;Krakowiak</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1825921/1825921_10581563_1705002466878_FIGURE_6--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1825921/1825921_10581563_1705002466878_FIGURE_6--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Thermal Conductivity of OPC Composites with Cross-Linked C-S-H\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1825921/1825921_10581563_1705002466878_FIGURE_6--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Thermal Conductivity of OPC Composites with Cross-Linked C-S-H\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The effect of OPC cement substitution with inorganic C-S-H (a) and organic-inorganic C-S-H nanolaminates (b) on the thermal conductivity of cement composite, as well as porosity and dry bulk density of the composite OPC cement systems, developed in this award,</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Konrad J.
