 "awd_abstract_narration": "With funding from the NSF Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (S-STEM) program, this project will support high-achieving, low-income students with demonstrated financial need at Arizona State University's Ira A. Fulton Schools of Engineering. Throughout its five years, this project will fund 40 scholarships for students who are pursuing bachelor's degrees in engineering. Scholars will be mentored by their peers, faculty, and industry professionals; conduct undergraduate research; participate in design-build-implement innovation challenges; participate in career development; and complete engineering workforce preparation experiences.\r\n\r\nThis project will follow 40 Engineering Futures Scholars for four years allowing for a longitudinal study of engineering identity development. A cohort of 20 students will be added in project year one and year two. Each cohort will be supported for four years. The scholars' future potential selves will be nurtured to facilitate engineering identity development, which is expected to support sustained motivation and persistence in their goals towards engineering degree completion. Participants will enroll in a required Build Your Engineering Future course each semester of their degree program. This course will be used to anchor identity development activities. Scholars' engineering self-efficacy and their engineering identity will be studied longitudinally using qualitative and quantitative methods, to understand the degree to which students have explored and committed to becoming an engineer while also valuing the personal and social relevance of their aspirations. A comparison group will be used to study the impact of project activities. Results of this project may strengthen the understanding of existing strategies or reveal new ones to increase undergraduate student retention in engineering and four-year graduation rates in Arizona and across the nation.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

And 1% (1 of 72) students transferred to business at the end of their second year and graduated with a business degree. Only 6% (4 of 72) students left the university without completing their bachelor&rsquo;s degree and these students left engineering during their second year. 33% (24 of 72) students continue to be enrolled in engineering. 15% (11 of 72) are on track to graduate in May 2025 and 18% (13 of 72) are on track to graduate in May 2026.
