 "awd_abstract_narration": "Wireless microscale devices that navigate the body to diagnose and treat disease are a key element of the future of medicine, addressing localized malfunction in neurological, cardiovascular, autoimmune, cancer and other disease areas. Precise localization and spatially addressable communication are the major unresolved challenges. This proposal addresses this challenge by developing a radically new technology for microscale device localization based on magnetic resonance imaging. They will engineer miniaturized integrated circuit transducers to locate and communicate with them in vivo. They call this technology ATOMS - Addressable Transmitters Operated as Magnetic Spins.\r\n\r\nThey will design, implement and optimize the performance of ATOMS in vitro and in vivo and demonstrate precise localization and targeted communication with a spatial resolution of less than 0.5 mm. They will initially focus on two applications: 1) monitor the migration of ATOMS through the gastrointestinal system of live mice, and 2) create a navigation platform for high precision surgery. To develop ATOMS devices with target operating characteristics, they will design integrated circuits capable of sensing the magnetic field, and harvesting sufficient power from the RF output of the MRI to drive the IC's functions, including sensing of local biological processes.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

For instance, in orthopedic surgeries, long bone fractures are fixed by putting a metal rod into the bone and holding the two together using screws. It is crucial to know the precise location of the screw-holes before drilling into the fractured bone to put the screws in place. Currently, multiple X-ray images are taken to accurately locate the screw-holes. Another important application is robotic surgery that requires highly precise movement of surgical tools inside the body. The gold-standard technique to achieve precise alignment and positioning of surgical tools and implants during these procedures is X-ray fluoroscopy, which produces real-time images on a screen by using continuous X-ray beams. The total duration of fluoroscopy can vary from 1-15 min per patient and is highly dependent on the skills of the surgeon, thus causing high levels of radiation exposure to the patient, surgeon and staff.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As part of our NSF-funded research at Caltech, we have worked on developing a radiation-free system for high-precision surgical alignment, navigation and tracking, using magnetic-field gradient-based localization of microscale devices.

The electromagnets produce monotonically varying magnetic fields, resulting in gradients that encode each spatial point uniquely. Fig. 1b shows the magnetic field gradient in the X-direction. The two devices can simultaneously measure and communicate the magnetic field at their respective locations to an external receiver, which maps the field-data to spatial coordinates and displays the relative locations of the devices on a computer screen in real time (Fig. 1a).
