 "awd_abstract_narration": "NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:\r\n\r\nIn nature, membrane proteins are the gatekeepers that mediate molecular transport to maintain cellular processes. If polymers can be generated with separation performance similar to that of membrane proteins, they could offer very significant impacts on the environment, energy, separation technologies, and life sciences. For example, membranes are in high use for water purification and desalination, carbon dioxide capture and separation, chemical purification, and lithium battery applications. Over decades there have been significant efforts in improving polymer chemistry and self-assembly to better mimic the known structures of membrane proteins, which have led to limited advances in membrane performance. The bottleneck is to identify critical design parameters in these highly complex and diverse biological systems. By fundamentally understanding the spatial arrangement of a polymer chain inserted in a cellular lipid analogue and correlating it with molecular transport, this project aims to provide insights to the long-standing question: \"what level of molecular control over polymeric materials is needed to replicate protein transport properties?\"  If successful, the project may result in new design rules for bio-inspired polymers, change the pathways for membrane development, and lead to technologically relevant membranes. The proposed studies are highly interdisciplinary and afford an excellent platform for training students at all levels.  They will also provide software tools for polymer analysis as well as multiple outreach opportunities.\r\n\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL SUMMARY:\r\n\r\nFor membrane proteins the common belief is that well-defined protein structure is requisite to simultaneously achieving high flux and selectivity. For decades, various porous materials have been designed following this rule and explored for selective transport with limited success. Based on preliminary results using random heteropolymers, the central hypothesis for the proposed study is that once the heteropolymer composition is fixed, the statistical monomer distribution, rather than the atomically precise polymer structure, is the key parameter governing the resulting transport properties. This project aims to test this hypothesis by: (1) developing software tools to perform in-depth analysis of random heteropolymer sequence; (2) characterizing heteropolymer chain conformation upon lipid insertion to correlate the heteropolymer phase behavior with rapid, selective proton transport; (3) exploring heteropolymer-based block copolymers for analysis of heteropolymer chain conformation and transport properties for future membrane design.  Preliminary results point to the potential that unstructured polymer chains can perform at similar level as well-folded proteins for proton transport.  The planned exploratory studies will identify the critical design parameters behind such behavior, which may impact the current approach to designing membranes. The results may also change the traditional view on structure-function relationships in naturally occurring biopolymers and affect future development of bio-inspired polymers. Based on recent advances in living polymerization, the results would be well posed to generate technologically important membranes.  Furthermore, the planned studies will: (1) provide graduate and undergraduate research opportunities, as well as outreach opportunities through a joint effort with the California Academy for educating the public and middle school students on polymers; (2) develop new software tools for heteropolymer analysis and make them publicly available; and (3) provide the materials communities with a mechanism to overcome a barrier in starting heteropolymer-related projects.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Specifically, we systematically investigated     the relationship between the block length distribution in RHPs and the     critical micelle concentration. The results are valuable toward future     design of protein-like RHPs.</p>\n<p><strong>Results:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Synthesis </strong>Given that the     sequences play an important role in tuning the self-assembly behavior of     biomacromolecules, we focused on how sequences should influence the     aggregation behavior of random heteropolymers (RHPs) in solution. To     examine the sequence effect, we used previously reported RHPs composed of     MMA, EHMA, OEGMA and SPMA with the molar ratio as 50 : 20 : 25 : 5 and synthesized     a diblock polymer (di-BCP) as control. The di-BCP has one block of random     copolymer of MMA and EHMA (50 : 20) and the other block of a random polymer     of OEGMA and SPMA (25 : 5). These two polymer systems have the same compositions,     but different sequences. Another three RHPs were also synthesized where the     ratio of MMA and EHMA is varied to modulate the overall hydrophobicity of     the RHP. The sample details are listed in <strong>Scheme 1</strong>.<strong> </strong></p>\n<p>We quantified the CMC of the all     polymers by encapsulating pyrene and monitoring its fluorescence. Consistent     with numerous studies, we used the intensity ratio of the first and third     emission peaks (I<sub>1</sub>/I<sub>3</sub>) as a good indicator of the     microenvironment polarity and identified the CMC at the inflection point of     the titration curve. From the comparison of the four titration curves (<strong>Fig.     1</strong>), it is evident that the CMC increases as the overall hydrophobicity     of the RHP increases by adding more EHMA monomer. This is consistent with     studies in amphiphilic BCPs. However, while keeping the overall composition     the same, the CMC of the di-BCP (4 ug/mL) is approximately 2 times lower     than that of the RHP (7.5 ug/mL) with di-BCP displaying a much sharper     transition as a function of amphiphile concentration. The results suggested     that larger hydrophobic blocks are related with stronger aggregation     tendency.</p>\n<p>To understand how the sequences     and compositions are controlling the micellization behavior, we performed     direct statistical analysis of the RHP sequences simulated by Monte Carlo     method based on the Mayo-Lewis equation. Modified HLB values (true HLB     value - 10) were used to indicate the hydrophilicity (positive     HLB)/hydrophobicity (negative HLB) of the monomers. By accumulating the HLB     values of monomers on each block, which is a continuous array of     hydrophobic or hydrophilic monomers as defined by sliding window averaged     HLB, both the hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity and segment size could be     combined into one parameter ? block HLB. <strong>Fig. 2A</strong> shows the     statistical distribution of the average block HLB for each chain in the     population of random-10, random-20, random-30, random-50 and     diblock-20.&nbsp; Even though the     compositions of random-20 and diblock-20 are exactly the same, the     difference in the monomer sequence leads to a significant change in the     distribution of chain average block HLB. For another, when the sequential     randomness is kept the same, an increase in the EHMA/MMA ratio also leads     to a more negative chain average block HLB and a broader distribution,     suggesting more hydrophobic and more heterogeneous segments when the     percentage of hydrophobic monomers increases.&nbsp; Extracting the mean from each     distribution, <strong>Figure 2B</strong> shows that CMC is directly related with the     mean block HLB for all four polymers and the transition sharpness is reversely     related with the mean block HLB.</p>\n<p><strong>Plan for future studies: </strong></p>\n<p>These results clearly indicated     that sequence control can lead to significant changes in the phase behavior     of heteropolymers. Future studies will focus on developing thermodynamic     understanding in the effects of block length in the CMC of amphiphilic     polymers. These studies, in conjunction with traditional approach to     calculate CMC based on the overall amphiphilicity of the molecule, will     more accurately capture/predict solution behavior of heteropolymer to mimic     that of natural proteins.</p>\n<table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"616\" valign=\"top\">\n<table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"616\" valign=\"top\">\n<p><strong>Broader     impact:</strong></p>\n<p>The     project Provide supports for graduate career development of a very talented     first-generation college graduate student from an African American family,     Ms. Aaron Hall.
