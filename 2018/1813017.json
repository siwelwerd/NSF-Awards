 "awd_abstract_narration": "In light of the vast underrepresentation of Latinas in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) academic careers at a time when Latinas represent one of the fastest growing populations in the U.S. workforce, this NSF INCLUDES symposium provides a national platform to discuss and address the issues that affect the pathways/pipelines, recruitment, retention, and advancement of Latinas in STEM academic careers. The symposium brings together various NSF-funded broadening participation projects (such as NSF INCLUDES Pilots and NSF ADVANCE projects), Hispanic-Serving Institutions, as well as national professional organizations that have a focus on enhancing the participation, inclusion and success of Latinas (and other traditionally underrepresented minority groups) in STEM careers. Therefore, the symposium provides a platform for the sharing of ideas, strategies, and best practices to broaden the participation, inclusion, and success of Latinas in academic STEM careers. This work is important for society because if Latinas continue to be underrepresented, and hence underutilized in the STEM workforce, the U.S. will likely lose ground in terms of its scientific and other workforce competitive advantages. Increasing Latina representation among STEM faculty also provides the needed role models for Latina/o students to enter into STEM careers, transition to graduate programs and ultimately progress to the professoriate. Moreover, diversifying the STEM professoriate promotes innovation and creativity, and expands the range of perspectives and experiences to which students in STEM fields are exposed. Therefore, it serves to offset preconceived notions and stereotypes some students might have about women and underrepresented ethnic minority populations. \r\n\r\nThe NSF INCLUDES Symposium advances the knowledge and understanding of how work-life issues, policies/practices, mentoring, and climate surrounding equity and inclusiveness affect the recruitment, retention, and advancement, including into leadership positions, of Latinas in STEM academic careers. The symposium incorporates presentations by scholars engaged in emerging research on Latinas (including intersectionality issues), individual perspectives from STEM Latina faculty/professionals as well as perspectives from institutions of higher education (especially Hispanic-Serving Institutions) and national diversity-serving professional organizations such as the Latina Researchers Network. It also highlights the lessons learned from other NSF-funded broadening participation projects such as NSF INCLUDES Design and Development Launch Pilots and NSF ADVANCE projects. These types of interactions/discussions allow for the development of shared goals, common metrics, and mutually reinforcing activities that lead to forming new collaborations and the expansion of the NSF INCLUDES National Network. The lessons learned from the symposium, including all presentations and panel discussions, are to be compiled and published in an edited volume, and disseminated to serve as a resource for the broader STEM community and academia at large.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
