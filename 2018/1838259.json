 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support US students to attend the 16th International Conference on Principles of Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KR&R) and its Doctoral Consortium, which will be held in Tempe, Arizona from October 29 to November 2, 2018.  The Principles of KR&R conference series, established in 1989, is driven by some of the key researchers in the field of knowledge representation, and attracts a substantial number of highly visible researchers and submissions each year. In response to the high demands for graduate students in this area, the conference has established a practice of the Doctoral Consortium event during the conference, where students can deeply interact with the researchers, and is pursuing options to further enhance the educational aspect of its events. This year there will be 7 workshops and 8 tutorials prior to the main conference. A dedicated mentoring program and other student-centered events will be put in place for the maximum benefit of the participating students.\r\n\r\nThe KR&R Doctoral Consortium provides an opportunity for student education in the field of knowledge representation and reasoning. The conference is a premier event attended by prominent researchers in the area. The principal investigators are among the main drivers of the conference series, and established researchers with high visibility and proven track record of successful student mentoring. The planned activity furthers technological advancement in the emerging area of knowledge representation and reasoning -- which is currently seeing substantial industrial interest and uptake -- through the enhancement of next generation computer scientists, with long-term benefits both to industry and academia. Actions will be implemented in order to broaden visibility, by trying to attract students from new research groups.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
