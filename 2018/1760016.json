 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will help support early career researchers who will speak and give poster presentations at the first International Conference on CRISPR Technologies, which will be held December 4-6, 2017 in Raleigh, North Carolina.  The format of the meeting is a combination of talks and posters, which will promote scientific exchange in both formal and informal settings.  A panel session will be devoted to the discussion of ethical and safety concerns related to CRISPR-Cas technology.  There will be ample opportunity for sharing the latest research results and for networking. \r\n\r\nClustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) technologies are powerful tools for genome editing in animals, plants, and microorganisms.  This meeting provides a venue for biologists, chemists, engineers and clinicians to discuss CRISPR-Cas genome editing and its applications to human health, biotechnology and agriculture.  The conference has the following overall goals: 1) to facilitate scientific exchange among Genome Engineering (CRISPR) researchers; 2) to have scientific presentations from a diverse group of researchers who study, design and use CRISPR technologies; 3) to promote interactions between clinicians and scientists, and to promote discussions of the applications and implications of CRISPR technologies; 4) to provide a forum for early career scientists to present their research and to network, since they represent the future of the Genome Engineering field.",
