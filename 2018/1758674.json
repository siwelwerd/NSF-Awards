 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project aims to provide an affordable sealant for sealing joints and cracks in cement concrete pavement, asphalt concrete pavement, bridge deck, etc. In transportation infrastructure, joints are intentionally constructed in order to allow movement of the structural elements due to linear thermal expansion/contraction when temperature rises/drops. Cracks are a common failure mode in pavement, and if not properly sealed, can cause water damage and rupture of the concrete. Sealing cracks and joints is a common practice to maintain or extend the service life of structural elements. Various types of sealants are currently used with an annual market value of about $6.1 billion. Unfortunately, many of these sealants fail to work properly and are ineffective in extending service life. In this project, a smart sealant will be developed that expands upon cooling and contracts upon heating, a thermal characteristic opposite to that of concrete. The product will address a significant problem in the industry arising from thermal movement of joined/cracked structural elements. It is expected that the product will have about 0.8% market share in 5 years helping with the need for longer lasting and more reliable infrastructure.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this project lies in the development and validation of a smart sealant technology. The root cause for joint failure is that the thermal expansion characteristics of most sealants is similar to that of concrete, i.e., contraction upon cooling and expansion upon heating. This behavior is contrary to what is required of sealants in order to avoid thermally induced separation between the sealant and the concrete. Unfortunately, few materials can fulfill this requirement in a cost effective way while maintaining other desired physical properties (such as, deformability). This Phase II project will solve the century-long problem through the use of a two-way shape memory polymer (2W-SMP) based sealant that addresses the root cause. Building upon the feasibility study of the Phase I project, the Phase II project will focus on further improving the 2W-SMP based sealant for sealing joints or cracks in pavement, and validate the product through third-party lab-scale testing, and full-scale field-level verification in both hot and humid environment and extremely cold regions. Technical outcome will include lab-scale validation, field level performance and verification, and construction protocols for this new smart material, laying a solid foundation for adoption by home owners and transportation agencies.",

Particularly, this smart sealant behaves thermally opposite to conventional construction materials ? it expands upon cooling and contracts upon heating, which is a desired property for sealants because joints/cracks open when temperature drops, and narrow when temperature rises, thus the sealant needs to expand in winter and contract in summer.</p>\n<p>In this project, we developed two versions of smart sealants: one solid version, which is a preformed sealant stripe and suitable for sealing joints and routed cracks; and the other liquid version, which is adhesive-free, ideal for both joints and cracks, especially for unrouted cracks.</p>\n<p>The solid version sealant was firstly validated by the Overlay Tester in Texas Transportation Institute (TTI). As compared to 13 commercially available sealants, this smart sealant performed the best in terms of the drop in peak load after 2,000 loading/unloading cycles at 0.6 <sup>o</sup>C. To evaluate the field-level performance, a total of 26 joints were sealed using the smart sealant and control sealants found in the marketplace. A total of three test locations were selected and all the sealants were installed in May and June 2019:</p>\n<p>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pavement Research Facility (PRF) at Louisiana Transportation Research Center (LTRC), to evaluate the performance of the smart sealant in the hot and humid environment in Louisiana, together with the repeated traffic loading simulated by the Atlas Accelerated Loading Facility. A total of 16 joints were created, and 14 of them were sealed; the sealed joints consisted of 3 expansion joints, 7 transverse contraction joints, and 4 longitudinal contraction joints. In the sealed joints, 8 joints were sealed by the smart sealant, and 6 joints were sealed by a commercial silicone rubber sealant (Dow Corning 890 SL silicon concrete joint sealant).</p>\n<p>2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; West Perdue Ave., Baton Rouge, Louisiana, to evaluate the performance in the hot and humid environment, and at the same time, the performance of the sealant subjected to real truckload. Two expansion joints were sealed, one by the smart sealant, and the other by the Dow Corning 890 SL silicon concrete joint sealant.</p>\n<p>3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Minnesota Road Research Facility (MnROAD), to evaluate the performance of the sealant at cold regions, together with real traffic load in a major interstate highway. A total of 8 joints were created, including 2 expansion and 6 transverse contraction joints. To create the worst-case scenario, all the joints were cut through the thickness of the concrete slabs. In addition to the smart sealant, three other sealants were also installed side by side to make comparisons. They were BERAM 3060 LM (Extra Low Modulus) hot-pour asphalt sealant meeting MnDOT specification 3725, Crafco 902NS Silicone Non Sag sealant, and Narrow preformed rubber sealant provided by D.S. Brown Company.</p>\n<p>Up to May 2021, both the smart sealant and the control silicone rubber sealant at the LTRC testbed perform well after about 5.65 million ESALs (equivalent single axle load), which is equivalent to about 10 years of traffic in typical highways. For the two joints subjected to truckload in West Perdue Ave. in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, the control sealant has partially debonded from the concrete wall, while the smart sealant is still in good condition. Therefore, the smart sealant, together with its low cost, is a viable alternative in regions without extremely low temperatures.</p>\n<p>For the smart sealant installed in MnROAD, the adhesive used to bond the sealant to the concrete wall debonded from the sealant stripe, although the sealant itself seems intact. Therefore, in cold regions, either a suitable adhesive or a liquid version sealant (adhesive-free) needs to be developed. Because of this, two liquid version smart sealants were developed in the lab, one was asphalt-rich and the other was polybutadiene-rich. Both are extrudable and are very soft even at a temperature of -40<sup>o</sup>C. Furthermore, both sealants expand upon cooling and contract upon heating, suggesting a good potential to work in cold regions. A verbal agreement has been reached between Louisiana Multi-Functional-Materials Group LLC (LAMG) and MnROAD to test the liquid version sealants by 2023.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 05/29/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Jizhou&nbsp;Fan</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1758674/1758674_10531166_1622252650006_Picture4--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1758674/1758674_10531166_1622252650006_Picture4--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 4\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1758674/1758674_10531166_1622252650006_Picture4--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 4\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Adhesion testing results by Overlay Tester at TTI.
