 "awd_abstract_narration": "Electronic devices are playing an ever-increasing role in human life.  Future electronic devices will contain not only inorganic materials, such as silicon, but also organic materials.  While the inorganic components provide durability and well understood electrical conduction, the organic components offer the potential to easily and inexpensively tune their properties through synthetic modification.  However, creating devices that combine these two different types of materials faces several challenges.  The organic layer must be structured at the molecular level to provide the desired electronic and photonic properties, and the junction between the organic and inorganic parts must be formed to make it easy for electrons to pass across the interface.  With support from the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry (MSN) program in the Division of Chemistry, Professor K. W. Hipps at Washington State University is using sophisticated microscopies that can see individual molecules to study the factors that determine the ordering of organic molecules on inorganic surfaces.  The discoveries from the project could impact applications ranging from electronics to sensor development, and catalysis. The research also provides training opportunities for future researchers at all levels, and is thus contributing to development of the national workforce in science and technology.  Professor Hipps actively reaches out to local high schools and engages students in continued education in STEM fields. \r\n\r\nProfessor Hipps and his students are using a combination of surface plasmon resonance and high-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy to understand and predict the thermodynamic and kinetic factors that determine the structure of self-assembled 2-D organic films.  The project's focus is on films formed from commonly used organic monomers, inorganic substrates and solvents, with the goal of determining the activation energies and entropies associated with adsorption and desorption of monomers at the solution-solid interface. Molecular dynamics simulations provide insight into the role of solvent, temperature, and pressure in film formation.  Observations from experiment and simulation are used in the development of kinetic models that describe the various stages of the adsorption and desorption of molecules from the self-assembled layer. In addition, the project is educating undergraduates, graduate students and post-doctoral associates in the science of hybrid electronic devices, while outreach to local schools introduces high-school students to single-molecule science and technology.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This work incorporated the use of new experimental techniques, mathematical stochastic analysis, and computational chemistry to extract new insights into a surface problem that is pervasive in coating processes, heterogeneous catalysis, sensing, and molecular self-assembly.\n\nLittle is known about the role of solvents in the diffusion of single molecules on surfaces.  In order to help fill this deficit, we monitored the diffusion of isolated Y[C6S-Pc]2 on the Au(111) and HOPG surface.  In phenyloctane, the diffusion on HOPG was so fast that no isolated molecules were ever seen.  On Au(111), we were able to track the position versus time and determine diffusion coefficients in various solvents (and inert gas) in contact with the double decker/Au surface.  We saw a pronounced solvent and temperature dependence in the diffusion coefficient.  There was a clear inverse-correlation to the adsorption energy of the solvent to the diffusion coefficient of Y[C6S-Pc]2 on Au(111) in that solvent.  Moreover, Y[C6S-Pc]2 on Au(111) in dry Argon moved too quickly to measure at 20 C.  Another interesting finding was that the diffusion was influenced by the tip, but in a surprising way.  It did NOT correlate with either electric field or scan direction!\n\n  A custom STM solution flow cell was designed and implemented to allow for in-situ monitoring of self-assembly at very low concentrations and with volatile solvents. Flow studies at low concentration provide insight into early-stage formation kinetics and structure of the SAMs formed.  This device has allowed us to make the first quantitative measurement of the formation and nucleation rates for a non-covalent SAM and to make those measurements as a function of solvent.\n\nWe have significantly broadened the scope of applications of scanning probe microscopy.  We demonstrated that stochastic methods can be used in scanning proble microscopy to extract significant kinetic data from single molecule equilibrium measurements.  Specifically, we determined the rate constant for O2 binding to CoOEP/HOPG to be 4.9?10-6 s-1&#8729;torr-1 and the rate constant for release of O2 to be 0.018 s-1.

It also served as an important step in the career of a postdoctoral fellow.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/07/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Kerry W Hipps"
