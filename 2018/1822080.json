 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this effort, Virginia Tech becomes a research Site of the existing Center for Space, High-performance, and Resilient Computing (SHREC), an NSF Industry-University Collaborative Research Center. SHREC comprises four university Sites: University of Pittsburgh, Brigham Young University, University of Florida, and Virginia Tech. The Center is dedicated to assisting U.S. industrial partners, government agencies, and research organizations in mission-critical computing across three domains: space computing for Earth science, space science, and defense; high-performance computing across a broad range of grand-challenge applications; and resilient computing for dependability in harsh or critical environments. The Center also seeks to address the shortage in the mission-critical computing workforce by training many students with the knowledge and skills necessary to solve the many challenges facing this growing industry.\r\n\r\nWith the complementary nature of expertise at each Site, the Center will address research challenges facing the three aforementioned domains of mission-critical computing by exploiting a variety of existing and emerging computing technologies, including field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), graphical processing units (GPUs), and hybrid processors. For space computing, the Center will develop, evaluate, and deploy novel forms of space architectures, systems, and applications while leveraging commercial and radiation-hardened technologies. For high-performance computing, the Center will explore the application and productive use of heterogeneous computing technologies and architectures in support of high-speed, mission-critical computing. For resilient computing, the Center will exploit its expertise in energy-efficient embedded computing for resilience and in fault injection and mitigation and radiation testing to demonstrate reliability concepts and solutions, including adaptive hardware redundancy, fault masking, and software fault tolerance.\r\n\r\nResearch projects in the SHREC IUCRC will significantly benefit society in terms of economic impact, due to the advancement of new ideas and technologies adopted by industry partners and featured in Center publications. Moreover, the new IUCRC will be student-centric, where each industrial affiliate board (IAB) membership funds a graduate student, and each project aims to support a graduate thesis and will employ a diverse body of undergraduate and graduate students. In addition to its research activities, the Center will serve as a catalyst for supporting and broadening the educational and outreach missions of its university partners and members. \r\n\r\nArtifacts that result from this SHREC IUCRC will be maintained at the Center-wide repository at http://www.chrec.org/ and gradually transitioned to https://nsf-shrec.org/. In addition, as appropriate, code and data will be hosted at an open-source GIT repository such as github, gitlab, or gitea.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
