 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Improving Undergraduate STEM Education: Hispanic-Serving Institutions Program (HSI Program) aims to enhance undergraduate STEM education and build capacity at HSIs. Projects supported by the HSI program will also generate new knowledge about how to achieve these aims.  This project at Wilbur Wright College will advance the aims of the HSI Program by enabling talented, underprepared, low-income students to pursue and complete a bachelor's degree in engineering or computer science.  Public schools in urban areas struggle to prepare their large populations of low-income students in math and science. Thus, many high school graduates are not well prepared to pursue further education requiring quantitative or analytical thinking, or to join the US workforce in jobs demanding these skills. This project aims to develop and implement pathways, practices, and interventions to support student success in engineering or computer science at two critical transitions: from high school to community college, and from community college to four-year universities.  The project plans to achieve this goal partly through streamlined connections between Wilbur Wright College, the Chicago Public schools, and public four-year colleges and universities in Illinois.  The strategies developed and the knowledge produced in this project are expected to be significant to a broad segment of public education.\r\n\r\nThe project will be centered at Wilbur Wright College, an urban community college in the City Colleges of Chicago system.  Wilbur Wright College is the largest federally recognized Hispanic-serving community college in Illinois. The project aims to build bridges across critical transitions by creating a Summer Bridge Camp to improve math skills and prepare incoming students for an engineering or computer science curriculum. It will also create a one-year engineering Gateway course to further strengthen students' math skills and self-efficacy.  The project also aims to enhance practices that support the development of students' professional identity (i.e. the ability to see themselves as engineers or computer scientists), through faculty and near-peer mentoring, tutoring, intentional advising, engineering and computer science social events, and participation in professional meetings. The project will track students' semester-to-semester GPA, retention, transfer, graduation rates, and length of time to complete the associate's and bachelor's degrees. Self-efficacy and identity will be measured by an educational research professional.  This project is expected to contribute to the national need for a diverse engineering and computer science workforce.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

These students went on to complete their associate degrees and transfer within two years, earning their bachelor&rsquo;s degrees within 4 to 4.5 years. Many 2019 and 2020 Bridge participants are now contributing to the U.S. engineering workforce.</li>\r\n<li>The <strong>Holistic and Programmatic Approach for Transfer (HPAT)</strong>. This model emphasizes early and active involvement of four-year transfer partners, with intentional articulation agreements built on a joint commitment to quality and student success. The HPAT model fosters a fully collaborative, holistic approach to admission, curriculum alignment, co-curricular activities, co-advising, and co-mentoring. Recognizing that additional support is essential for community college students' success, the HPAT addresses financial, emotional, social, and career-readiness barriers. Over the course of the project, more than 400 students successfully transferred, with more than 95% completing or remaining on track to complete their bachelor&rsquo;s degrees.</li>\r\n<li><strong>The Multidimensional First Year Experience (MFYE) </strong>bridges the gap between college skills and the engineering workforce. This model introduces a new model of engineering orientation with professional skills and college success components, delivered through a credit-bearing multidimensional seminar and complemented by extracurricular and co-curricular activities. The MFYE promotes a sense of belonging, self-efficacy, community of practice (CoP), leadership development, and industry engagement. MFYE model centers around implementing intentional practices that prepare students to succeed beyond associate degree completion and transfer by preparing them to be professionals. By its sixth year, 842 students (out of 905 initially enrolled) completed the MFYE, correlating with a 93% &nbsp;Fall to Fall retention. Additionally, more than 300 students earned research or industry internships.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>Through six years of the Building Bridges Project&rsquo;s implementation, the Engineering Program at Wright College saw exponential growth in enrollment among talented, underrepresented, and low-income students pursuing degrees in engineering or computer science. A total of 1,062 diverse students participated in the Project, with 58% Hispanic, 9% Black, 13% Asian American, and 23% female. Throughout all aspects of the Bridges Project, participants developed a strong sense of belonging within both the college and the engineering profession, increased self-efficacy, and STEM identity. All Project&rsquo;s participants increased confidence in their chosen career, with Black and female students experienced particularly high increases in confidence and higher completion rates.</p>\r\n<p>From its modest beginning with nine students in the engineering pilot program in the fall of 2015 to 25 students before the NSF funding in 2018, the NSF HSI Building Bridges into Engineering and Computer Science Project, launched in early 2019, has played a critical role in growing Wright College&rsquo;s Engineering Program to 650 diverse students in just six years. The evidence-based practices developed by the Building Bridges Project have led to the establishment of the City Colleges of Chicago&rsquo;s School of Engineering in Fall 2024, expanding to four additional community college sites, three of which are HSIs and one predominantly Black.</p>\r\n<p>The impact of the Building Bridges Project extends beyond students to the broader Chicago community. The project has strengthened partnerships with top four-year engineering programs, providing students with access to high-quality engineering education in Chicago. It has also shifted the mindset of industry partners, who traditionally did not hire interns from community colleges. Over six years, the nine-student engineering pilot at Wright College grew into the School of Engineering for the entire City Colleges of Chicago, which now aims to replicate the framework developed by the NSF HSI Building Bridges Project at four additional colleges. By 2030, the goal is to have 2,030 diverse students complete the program, offering Chicago residents access to an excellent and affordable engineering education.</p>\r\n<p>The Building Bridges Project has already transformed the lives of hundreds of students in Chicago.
