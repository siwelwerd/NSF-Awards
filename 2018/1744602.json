 "awd_abstract_narration": "The western Antarctic Peninsula has become a model for understanding cold water communities and how they may be changing in Antarctica and elsewhere. Brown macroalgae (seaweeds) form extensive undersea forests in the northern portion of this region where they play a key role in providing both physical structure and a food (carbon) source for shallow water communities. Yet between Anvers Island (64 degrees S latitude) and Adelaide Island (67 S latitude) these macroalgae become markedly less abundant and diverse. This is probably because the habitat to the south is covered by more sea ice for a longer period, and the sea ice reduces the amount of light that reaches the algae. The reduced macroalgal cover undoubtedly impacts other organisms in the food web, but the ways in which it alters sea-floor community processes and organization is unknown. This project will quantitatively document the macroalgal communities at multiple sites between Anvers and Adelaide Islands using a combination of SCUBA diving, video surveys, and algal collections. Sea ice cover, light levels, and other environmental parameters on community structure will be modelled to determine which factors have the largest influence. Impacts on community structure, food webs, and carbon flow will be assessed through a mixture of SCUBA diving and video surveys. Broader impacts include the training of graduate students and a postdoctoral researcher, as well as numerous informal public education activities including lectures, presentations to K-12 groups, and a variety of social media-based outreach.\r\n\r\nMacroalgal communities are more abundance and diverse to the north along the Western Antarctic Peninsula, perhaps due to the greater light availability that is associated with shorter period of sea-ice cover. This project will determine the causes and community level consequence of this variation in algal community structure. First, satellite data on sea ice extent and water turbidity will be used to select study sites between 64 S and 69 S where the extent of annual sea ice cover is the primary factor influencing subsurface light levels. Then, variations in macroalgal cover across these study sites will be determined by video line-transect surveys conducted by SCUBA divers. The health, growth, and physiological status of species found at the different sites will be determined by quadrat sampling. The relative importance of macroalgal-derived carbon to the common invertebrate consumers in the foodweb will be assessed with stable isotope and fatty acid biomarker techniques. This will reveal how variation in macroalgal abundance and species composition across the sea ice cover gradient impacts sea floor community composition and carbon flow throughout the food web. In combination, this work will facilitate predictions of how the ongoing reductions in extent and duration of sea ice cover that is occurring in the region as a result of global climate change will impact the structure of nearshore benthic communities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The expectation was that macroalgae become less important as they decline in abundance at sites with greater sea ice cover. Instead, we found that consumers that are more specialized on specific macroalgal species at sites with lower annual sea ice cover and high macroalgal abundance and diversity would disappear at sites with low macroalgal abundance. Other consumers started to show less complexity in the use of food resources, having greater trophic overlap in areas of low macroalgal abundance. This suggests that the remaining macroalgal species in areas of high sea ice cover are still important energy sources for the nearshore food web but possibly through an increased pool of mixed and microbially-processed detritus rather than direct grazing or fresh detritus. The continued function of macroalgae to support the shallow-water food webs even under high sea ice conditions not suitable for many macroalgal species shows that coastal consumers along the Antarctic Peninsula are flexible in their strategy to use available resources. This can contribute to the stability of the entire system as reliance of a more permanently available energy source, detritus from perennial macroalgae, may provide a buffer against highly seasonal inputs from other sources such as from phytoplankton production throughout the year.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/21/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Katrin&nbsp;B&nbsp;Iken</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1744602/1744602_10572865_1671640482426_IMG_1131--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1744602/1744602_10572865_1671640482426_IMG_1131--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"New sea ice\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1744602/1744602_10572865_1671640482426_IMG_1131--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"New sea ice\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A thin layer of new sea ice is forming along the coast of the Western Antarctic Peninsula</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Katrin Iken</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Katrin&nbsp;B&nbsp;Iken</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">New sea ice</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1744602/1744602_10572865_1671640322688_IMG_1112--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1744602/1744602_10572865_1671640322688_IMG_1112--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Brash ice\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1744602/1744602_10572865_1671640322688_IMG_1112--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Brash ice\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Dense brash ice accumulates along the coast of the Western Antarctic Peninsula</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Katrin Iken</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Katrin&nbsp;B&nbsp;Iken</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Brash ice</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
