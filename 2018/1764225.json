 "awd_abstract_narration": "Employment in the biotechnology industry offers good benefits, job satisfaction, and opportunities for advancement. Despite these advantages, the lack of knowledge on the part of students and teachers concerning biotech careers has made it difficult to recruit students to enroll in biotech education programs. This project will add features and services to the website, Biotech-Careers.org, which currently serves to inform students about the types of job opportunities in biotech, to identify where biotechnology students have been hired, and to help biotech education programs learn what companies are doing in their local areas. The site contains descriptions of careers in biotech companies, stories and photos from graduates of two-year programs, and a database of biotech-related employers tagged by their business area. Additions to the site will enable it to improve student awareness of the different types of job opportunities in biotechnology and help them learn where they can find college programs that can prepare them for these different types of biotech careers. To complement these services, the project team will also identify and recruit faculty who are committed to being part of a distributed national leadership council to promote improvements in biotechnology education.\r\n \r\nThe project will pursue two primary objectives. First, the project team will introduce capabilities to Biotech-Careers.org that help improve students? knowledge of opportunities in biotech and ability to find employment. Second, the principal investigators will improve and sustain the digital infrastructure connecting the biotech-education online community. Through these efforts, students will be provided with new tools for identifying and planning their career objectives and locating educational programs that can prepare them for biotech careers. These resources will include better descriptions of career pathways, better links to community college biotech programs, more information about where students are getting hired, and new tools designed to help students overcome barriers when applying for jobs. The directory and database of community college and high school biotech programs at a companion site, Bio-Link.org, will also be improved and will continue to serve as a tool for assessing biotech education on a national level. The broader impacts of this project will be to increase the number and diversity of appropriately educated students entering biotechnology and bioscience careers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\n \n\n\nThe major goals for this project were to 1) sustain the Bio-Link community, a network of faculty, two-year college biotechnology programs, and high schools that taught biotechnology and 2) preserve two Bio-Link resources: Bio-Link.org, a website with a database of biotechnology college programs and Biotech-Careers.org, a website with information about entry-level biotechnology careers. Additional goals were to add features and improvements to Biotech-Careers.org and make the site sustainable.\n\n\n\n \n\n\nDuring this project, our team successfully transitioned the Bio-Link community to InnovATEBIO, an NSF-funded Advanced Technological Education Center for Biotechnology. The Bio-Link.org educational database was preserved, updated to InnovATEBIO.org, and continues to grow. Once this goal had been accomplished, our efforts focused largely on adding features and improvements to Biotech-Careers.org.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIn order to make Biotech-Careers.org sustainable, we added a job board and options for advertising. These activities have supported web hosting for the past few years.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nBiotech-Careers' mission is to provide a comprehensive resource where visitors can learn about biotechnology careers. We have given many presentations to students and often describe site resources as: people, places, products, pathways, and jobs. The site seeks to answer students questions about careers that align with their interests and describe what the jobs are, what people do in those jobs, the skills that are required, and where they can learn those skills.\n \n\n\nTo study places, interactive maps and a database with over 9000 companies, and over 530 business areas, allow visitors to see where companies are located and what they do. Site visitors can filter information by product, country, state, city, and whether or not a company advertises for employees on their website. A word map of products supplies a visual image of the number of companies working on different technologies. Visitors can use these links to find companies working in different areas such as \"Cancer treatments\" or \"Women's health.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudents are often interested in knowing something about the people who work in biotechnology. Profiles of community college alumni help them learn about the people in biotech and the pathways they followed as part of their careers.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n36 careers are described at Biotech-Careers.org. Each career page includes an average salary, education requirements and the skills that are commonly associated with those careers. The skills are linked to descriptions and tools for searching the job board to see companies looking for those skills. Links to community colleges help site visitors learn where they can learn those skills. At least 10% of the people who visit InnovATEBIO come from Biotech-Careers.org.\n \n\n\n\nThe career resources and information at Biotech-Careers.org have made it one of the most widely used websites to be developed by an NSF-funded project. The site received over 630,000 unique visits in the last 12 months. Our data from past analyses show at least a quarter of those visits come from schools.\n\n\n\n\nWe gave several virtual presentations on Biotech-Careers.org to high school and college students during the course of the project. We found that using the site raised awareness of biotechnology careers. Students also reported that using the site broadened their ideas about who can be successful in biotechnology, helped them picture themselves in a biotechnology career and increased the likelihood that they would pursue a career in biotechnology.\n\n\n\n\nWe have also worked to create an educational resource that leverages Biotech-Careers.org to go beyond a web-based experience. This resource, Biotechopoly: Antibody Edition, helps players learn about careers in biotechnology through game play. Teams of players work to bring drugs to market by moving their products through the stages of drug development. They purchase data and documents to move from pre-clinical research to phase I, phase II/III, and finally to market. Whoever gets to market first, wins.\n\n\n\n\nSimilar to Monopoly, teams move their companies along the outside of the board. During this process, they hire people for different roles, purchase data and documents, and raise funds. They also encounter luck and karma along the way. Luck can be good or bad. Karma is usually bad but a company can protect itself from bad karma by hiring the right people. All the luck and karma stories come from real life. QR codes on the luck cards allow players to learn about the stories that inspired the cards. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/25/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: SandraGPorter\n"
