 "awd_abstract_narration": "An award is made to Clemson University to support the acquisition of a soil greenhouse gas flux measurement system. This system will fill needs for rapid, accurate, in-situ measures of important greenhouse gas concentrations and fluxes. The instrument measures concentrations and soil efflux of water vapor, carbon dioxide, ammonia, and the especially potent greenhouse gases methane and nitrous oxide. Based at Clemson University's Baruch Institute of Coastal Ecology and Forest Science, the system will be deployed in field experiments designed to elucidate the role of sea level rise on coastal wetland ecosystem functioning and potential for feedbacks to climate. It also will be deployed at agricultural research stations across South Carolina to augment research on air and water pollution, fertilizer loss, and sustainable agriculture. This system will allow researchers to generate datasets and science with greatly improved accuracy, applicability, and scalability. The system will be used in projects that include undergraduate and graduate students and postdoctoral researchers across a diverse team of researchers including women, first-generation college graduates, and underrepresented minorities in science.  The instrument will also be used in new graduate classes that cover wetland ecology, coastal ecology, and biogeochemistry.\r\n\r\nMethane and nitrous oxide are powerful greenhouse gases that exert a significant radiative forcing on Earth's climate. Wetlands and agricultural systems are major sources globally, but the mechanisms driving their sources, sinks, and sensitivity to environmental drivers are poorly understood. This gap can be attributed largely to the difficulty in measuring these trace gases at the very low concentrations at which they occur in the environment and by barriers to sampling without artifacts. The acquisition of this soil gas flux measurement system will overcome these obstacles by providing excellent sensitivity and time resolution in a field deployable configuration. An array of multiplexed, automated soil flux chambers will allow for replicate measures of treatments in situ, thus enhancing statistical rigor and the strength of conclusions. Initial use of the system will be to augment ongoing, funded projects that assess the effects of saltwater intrusion on coastal forested wetlands, the rates and types of nitrogen losses from agricultural systems, the effects of restoring impounded wetlands and old rice fields on greenhouse gas emissions, and life cycle analysis of switchgrass production for biofuels. Data and analyses from these studies will be published in peer-reviewed scientific journals, presented at scientific meetings, and used in both educational and public outreach activities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The system measures the emissions of the greenhouse gases carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide. Importantly, human activities have increased the concentration of these gases in the atmosphere, which is trapping more heat in Earth?s climate and raising the temperature.&nbsp; Since this has negative impacts on human health and happiness, scientists are currently seeking ways to reduce emissions of these gases.&nbsp; Our project focuses on two major emission pathways: wetlands and agriculture.&nbsp; While wetlands are a natural source of greenhouse gases, humans have choices on how wetlands are managed, and decisions can be made to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.&nbsp; However, how this is best done, and how this interacts with other management objectives, remains a topic of study. To advance this research, we have successfully deployed the new mobile lab in understudied impounded wetlands in coastal South Carolina.&nbsp; To better understand how methane is produced and transported in these systems, we used the new system to target soil, water and plant emissions separately, and reconcile those measurements with landscape-scale emission as measured with other technology, including flux towers. While this work is ongoing, we hope to make specific recommendations to land managers on which wetland plants and water level management strategies can reduce emissions. Coastal ecosystems are also experiencing increasing disturbances that have the potential to create new greenhouse gas emissions.&nbsp;&nbsp; Specifically, sea level rise and increasing tropical storm intensity are creating stress and plant death in coastal forests by forcing salt water into ever increasing elevations. We used the new system to conduct an experiment on soils from forests of different saltwater exposure and levels of stress and tree death. We found that upland forests that had been exposed to storm surge had a higher potential to emit methane than undisturbed soils. This is concerning because the linkages between sea level rise, forest mortality and enhanced greenhouse gas emissions constitutes a positive feedback to climate.</p>\n<p>Another important goal of this project was to train faculty and students to use this leading edge technology to facilitate their research and inspire students to become interested in environmental sciences. Over the course of this project we successfully engaged and trained 25 individuals from six institutions, including 9 faculty, 1 postdoctoral scholar, 2 technicians, 2 professionals, 6 graduate students, and 8 undergraduate students.&nbsp; Of those, three were from a small school, 11 were female and 7 were from underrepresented STEM groups (other than female), including African American, Hispanic, low income and first-generation college students. Furthermore, one postdoctoral scholar and two graduate students are using this equipment as their primary research tool and this facility and our new capacity and expertise in this area have recently supported three successful proposals which will support even more students and ensure that the impact of this instrumentation on research and student training and engagement will continue for years to come.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 01/25/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Thomas&nbsp;O'halloran</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1828167/1828167_10569827_1674576544345_rainbow--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1828167/1828167_10569827_1674576544345_rainbow--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Mobile greenhouse gas lab with flux tower\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1828167/1828167_10569827_1674576544345_rainbow--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Mobile greenhouse gas lab with flux tower\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The mobile greenhouse gas flux trailer deployed next to an AmeriFlux tower in a managed wetland.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Georgia Seyfried</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Thomas&nbsp;O'halloran</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Mobile greenhouse gas lab with flux tower</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1828167/1828167_10569827_1674576956506_twelvechambersmesocosm--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1828167/1828167_10569827_1674576956506_twelvechambersmesocosm--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Picarro in mesocosm config\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1828167/1828167_10569827_1674576956506_twelvechambersmesocosm--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Picarro in mesocosm config\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The Picarro and automated chambers in a mesocosm configuration for lab experiments.
