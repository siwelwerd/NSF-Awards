 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Washington, as the lead organization of the Research+Practice Collaboratory, proposes an EAGER project to convene three workshops on strategies for forming and sustaining research-practice partnerships (RPPs). RPPs have been shown to be effective in building knowledge about and implementation of education efforts in preK-12 settings and they have been required for applicants to the CSforAll:RPP solicitation (NSF 17-525). The first two workshops will provide technical assistance to groups on the process of forming RPPs focused on inclusive Computer Science (CS) education. The third will focus on strengthening newly formed RPPs that were funded under the FY17 CSforAll:RPP solicitation.\r\n\r\nThe first two workshops will be modeled on similar, successful technical assistance meetings that were held in 2017. They will host groups of stakeholders--CS faculty, CS teachers, school administrators, state and local education officials, and representatives of local Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) organizations--interested in forming an RPP to address equitable, sustainable CS education.  The workshop activities will help participants identify compelling questions that can be supported by an RPP, design projects that include measures to develop and sustain robust RPPs, and gain insight into the ways in which RPPs can be leveraged to develop evidence that can inform both practice and theory. The third workshop will provide additional technical assistance to PIs that have already received funding for RPPs through the FY2017 CSforAll:RPP solicitation (NSF 17-525), helping the to strengthen their partnerships, better understand the co-creation of suitable research agendas, learn from other RPP teams, and resolve any organizational challenges they have encountered. It will be held in conjunction with the 2018 Broadening Participation and Education in Computing PI and Community Meeting.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis award funded two workshops, led by the Research+Practice Collaboratory, to support 33 teams, consisting of 109 K-12 computer science educators, administrators, and researchers, to design and develop 'research-practice partnerships' (RPPs) aiming to expand and enhance K-12 computer science education nationwide.\n\nAdditionally, it funded one workshop for already funded \"Computer Science for All\" RPPs, as well as the development of public-facing documents synthesizing the work.\n\n \n\nIntellectual Merit\n\nRPPs are collaborations between educational practitioners (teachers, administators, curriculum developers, and others) and educational researchers who together (a) determine what questions should be researched, (b) what data are meaningful for answering those questions, and (c) what can be learned from the data that is collected.  RPPs focus research on 'problems of practice' --issues that are directly related to educational improvement.  RPPs optimize the expertise and experience of educators and researchers to produce knowledge that can improve practice.  They may be particularly useful to the emerging field of K-12 computer science (CS) education, in which both practice and research are being developed at the same time\n\n \n\nThe Research+Practice Collaboratory workshops led teams through a process of collaboratively (1) identifying the local problems of practice they sought to address (e.g., preparing teachers to teach new AP courses, engaging parents and community stakeholders, integrating CS into elementary instruction, etc.), (2) identifying local project goals, and (3) developing research questions, answers to which could be used in practice.  Many project teams went on to develop full NSF proposals which were submitted to the NSF CS for All RPP program.  A high percentage of teams that received the awards had attended the workshops.\n\n \n\nAdditionally, the grant supported a workshop, led by the Research+Practice Collaboratory, for CS for All RPPs that had been funded the previous year to gather at the annual NSF program PI meeting in Alexandria VA.  At this workshop, participating RPP teams identified topics they were struggling with in their first year of project implementation, and met with other projects facing the same challenges to discuss strategies and solutions.\n\n \n\nBroader Impacts\n\nThe project produced documents summarizing the benefits and challenges related to RPPs in K-12 computer science.  A blog was posted online and a paper was presented at the annual RESPECT symposium -- attended by CS educators and researchers whose work focuses on broadening participation in STEM -- preceding the annual computer science in education conference (SIGCSE).  These documents are posted on the Research+Practice Collaboratory website.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/06/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Bronwyn Bevan"
