 "awd_abstract_narration": "Electric motors account for more than 60% of the electricity consumed and electric machines and associated power electronic drives represent a multi-billion dollar industry. The research will develop fundamental knowledge and innovative concepts for high-efficiency and high-performance electric machines and drives through a synergetic combination of transformational designs, multiphysics analysis, and the latest developments in power electronics, including wide band gap devices. The project will train graduate and undergraduate research students, lead to engineering teaching and training curriculum development, publically disseminate the results, and support STEM middle and high school outreach activities and increased efforts to attract students, including women and minorities, to higher education in science and engineering.\r\n\r\nRaising the fundamental operating frequency for electrical machines results, in principle, in increased power density, provided that the typical challenges of higher losses, lower material utilization, and more complicated constructions, which are specific to conventional designs, can be overcome. The research will provide innovative solutions in this respect and study two novel axial flux permanent magnet machine topologies, which are best fitted for ultra-high number of poles and operation with high fundamental frequency, ensured through controlled supply from power electronics with wide band gap devices. One construction, suitable for high-speed operation, employs a coreless stator with an innovative continuous-wave phase winding arrangement in multiple layers. Another construction, suitable for low-speed direct drive operation, employs special rotors and innovative ferromagnetic-core stators with a winding pattern such that the stator coils and teeth are one order of magnitude lower than the number of rotor poles, a design feature that far exceeds the characteristics of known topologies. This machine also incorporates a torque magnification effect, which contributes to size reduction and efficiency increase for given power output. For two-phase machine designs, innovative hybrid H-bridge inverters comprising one leg with wide band gap devices and another leg with silicon devices are proposed for control and system integration. Computational studies include multi-physics analysis for electromagnetic, thermal, and mechanical stress, and differential evolutionary algorithms for mathematical optimization, and systematic comparison of thousands of candidate designs. Experimental studies include building prototype demonstrators and laboratory testing. The outcomes are ultra-high power density and efficient electric machine - drive systems.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Two axial flux (AF) permanent magnet (PM) machine topologies with very high polarity have been proposed to benefit of recent advancements in materials, manufacturing technologies, and special power electronics converters with the latest generation of wide band gap devices (WBG). Studies included combined analytical models, three-dimensional finite element analysis (3D FEA), multi-physics models, and large-scale optimization based on differential evolution methods.

The stator is placed between two PM rotors for which versions with ferromagnetic core back iron and coreless with Halbach PM arrays have both been considered. The theoretical developments included new specific methods for torque and loss calculations, evaluation and mitigation of eddy and circulating current losses, the effects of number of phases and low inductance on controls and drives. Large scale optimal design studies have been conducted to identify the best polarity for specified performance requirements, and to compare stator winding and rotor types for very high specific power output. Studies involved multiple prototypes, including one with 36 poles and PCB 3-phase winding with concentrated coils, which demonstrated through combined analysis and testing the effect of optimal effective conductor transposition for supplementary loss minimization and ultra-high efficiency capability over a wide range of torque and speed. Application design studies included very high-speed flywheels, light systems for electric traction and propulsion, and direct drive multi-MW wind generators.<strong> <br /></strong></p>\n<p>The second type of electric machine proposed and studied, referred to as MAGNUS, employs a special rotor with ferromagnetic core and a very high number of poles and PMs placed radially and magnetized tangentially in a &ldquo;spoke&rdquo; configuration. The stator has a ferromagnetic core with innovative design and a low number of main teeth, each of which may have additional/auxiliary teeth. Multiple stators with concentrated coils or no coils have been combined in the design studies. Theoretical developments included the derivation of possible combinations of poles, teeth, and winding patterns, the mechanism of torque production and separation of components, the effects of non-linearities, air-gap field harmonics, calculation of eddy currents, and of the equivalent circuit parameters. The remarkably large number of poles results in very high flux concentration and specific torque, and the use of minimum number of coils enables the implementation highly effective colling systems. Optimal design studies included a prototype with 40 rotor poles and only 12 main stator teeth, each with 2 additional auxiliary teeth, equipped on one stator with a 3-phase winding with concentrated coils and a second special stator without winding. This protype has been tested and provided successful experimental validation. Application design studies included high-torque low-speed direct-drive in-wheel electric vehicle traction.</p>\n<p>This project also created engineering research and training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students. Three PhD dissertations have been completed and a fourth one is expected in 2024. One of the undergraduate students has received an NSF Graduate Fellowship and continued with the group at University of Kentucky for PhD studies. New teaching materials for university classes and short courses for industry have been developed. The research group has exhibited project prototypes and presented technical papers at large conferences: 2023 IEEE ITEC and 2023 IEEE ECCE.
