 "awd_abstract_narration": "One goal of evolutionary ecology is to understand the processes that lead to species becoming better adapted to their local environment.  Studies of local adaptation have historically focused on geographically separated populations, where adaptive differences are maintained by limited dispersal of individuals between populations. Growing evidence, however, suggests that adaptive evolution can occur over small spatial distances. How this fine scale, adaptation arises and is maintained remains unresolved, despite applications for human health, agriculture, and biodiversity. On Santa Cruz Island, the Island Scrub Jay has two morphologies. Birds in pine habitat have long and thin beaks where as those in oak habitats have short and deep beaks. These differences are known to facilitate feeding on pine cones versus acorns, but how such adaptive genetic differences are maintained over very small geographic distances is unknown. The researchers will collect data on the genomes of individuals from both types of habitats to test if the same set of genes are differentiated between pine and oak populations, and how other regions of the genome change spatially across the island. These measurements will be coupled with telemetry studies that track how birds move and use oak and pine habitats. In addition, vocal experiments will test if males prefer females that originate within their habitat. The data obtained from this work will then be used to develop general models that can inform the conditions under with adaptive differences in can occur. Such models would be of interest to conservation managers that manage this and other unique or rare species. Additionally, the project will produce a learning module for high school classroom use, and will provide research opportunities for both undergraduate and graduate students. \r\n\r\nCases of microgeographic adaptation challenge classical evolutionary theory that posits adaptive divergence should be constrained by gene flow, leading to a reassessment of the spatial scale at which evolutionary processes occur. The research team has recently discovered replicated, adaptive divergence in jay bill shape in adjacent oak and pine habitats, despite gene flow between these adjacent habitats. This pattern occurs across habitats separated by less than one kilometer. The researchers will test alternative hypotheses about how divergent selection, dispersal, and non-random mating shape adaptive divergence in bill morphology. In Aim 1, they develop population genetic models that test the interacting effects of selection, gene flow, assortative mating, and genetic architecture at different spatial scales. In Aim 2, they will test for divergent selection by measuring selection gradients, examining patterns of genomic divergence, and by identifying candidate genes associated with variation in bill morphology. In Aim 3, they will use a combination of population genomics, telemetry, and transplant experiments to test for population genomic structure and if dispersal is non-random In Aim 4, they will test if divergence in bill morphology is correlated with vocalizations and facilitates assortative mating. Collectively, the proposed work takes an integrative approach in a tractable study system. This research has broad implications for understanding both the spatial scale at which adaptive divergence occurs, and the conditions that allow individuals within a single population to diverge across heterogeneous habitats.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Past research has focused on adaptive divergence between geographically separated populations. However, growing evidence suggests that adaptive evolution can occur at microgeographic scales within the range of individual dispersal. Such results challenge conventional thinking on the tension between selection, gene flow, and random mating in promoting adaptive differences. The goal of our research was to understand how adaptive differences are generated and maintained at microgeographic scales. Our research focused on the Island Scrub-Jay, a bird species restricted to Santa Cruz Island off the coast of southern California. Island Scrub-Jays (hereafter Jays) show a repeated pattern of beak adaptation to oak and pine habitat. Within Santa Cruz Island there are three patches of pine habitat, and within each pine patch, the Jays have longer and thinner bills, which is assumed to be beneficial in extracting seeds from pinecones. In the remaining oak-scrub habitat, the Jays have shorter and deeper bills, which is assumed to be beneficial in handling acorns. Similar patterns have been observed in closely related mainland jays, leading to the hypothesis that diet and foraging differences between pine and oak habitats generate divergent selection. This is a reasonable hypothesis on the mainland as pine and oak habitats are separated by hundreds of kilometers, which reduces gene flow. However, Santa Cruz Island is only 35km long, and Jays can easily fly between habitats, suggesting high potential for gene flow despite the observed phenotypic differentiation between habitats. Whether Jays disperse and settle on territories randomly or choose habitats that best match their morphology remains unknown. Finally, most theory also assumes mating among individuals is random, but it is known that assortative mating can play a powerful role in preventing gene flow. The degree to which Jays mate randomly or non-randomly is also unknown. These observations motivated our research into asking how divergent selection, gene flow, habitat choice, and mate choice play out to generate the observed microgeographic patterns in Jays.<br />&nbsp;<br />To quantify the genetic architecture and test for divergent selection across the pine and oak habitats we sequenced individuals and measured their bill lengths to find regions of the genome under selection. We found jays were genetically differentiated between pine and oak habitats and several regions of the genome containing genes associated with variation in bill length between these habitats (Fig. 1). Perhaps surprisingly, we found that the specific markers or Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNPs) associated with variation with bill length variation were not shared or &ldquo;parallel&rdquo; among the three pine habitats, however evidence for parallelism increased when we tested which genes were linked to these SNPs and which pathways these genes are associated with (Fig. 2). Using feather samples, we also found individuals sampled in oak habitats were more enriched in 15N and 13C compared to individuals sampled in pine habitat. Collectively, these results supported our hypothesis of divergent selection between pine and oak habitats are linked to differences in diet. To evaluate how these genetic differences could be maintained in the presence of potential dispersal and gene flow between habitats, we examined population genetic structure and quantified dispersal distances using a molecular pedigree. We found evidence for gene flow between adjacent pine and oak habitats on the island, but also that females disperse further from the &ldquo;natal&rdquo; territories where they hatched compared to males (Fig. 3). Males become more genetically differentiated with geographic distance, whereas females do not. Importantly, when we controlled for whether a female&rsquo;s parent or male relative hatched in pine habitat, we found that natal dispersal of female&rsquo;s was significantly lower in pine habitat (see Fig. 3b vs 3c). We investigated this pattern further and found that the best predictor of dispersing to pine was the percentage of pine in the natal territory (Fig. 4). These results suggest dispersal is not random in the Jays, but rather that individuals that hatch within pine habitat preferentially disperse and settle within pine habitat, which likely contributes to the genetic differentiation between pine and oak habitats. In contrast, when we tested for mate preference based on vocal differences between oak and pine habitat, we found no evidence for preference, suggesting limited potential for non-random mating. To explore the generality of these results, we developed quantitative genetic and individual simulation models that characterized the strength of selection, and the degree to which movement and mating is random or non-random with respect to habitat. Our models show the pattern of microgeographic differences is dependent on non-random movement and habitat matching, whereas divergent selection and non-random mating are likely to have minor roles. The results of these modelling efforts are consistent with our empirical results but raise the possibility that the genetic differentiation between pine and oak habitats reflects habitat matching rather than selection.</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 03/12/2025<br>\nModified by: Chris&nbsp;Funk</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1754821/1754821_10555707_1741789827360_Figure_3--rgov-214x142.jpeg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1754821/1754821_10555707_1741789827360_Figure_3--rgov-800width.jpeg\" title=\"Figure 3\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1754821/1754821_10555707_1741789827360_Figure_3--rgov-66x44.jpeg\" alt=\"Figure 3\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">(A) Natal dispersal distances for Island Scrub Jays who bred within 5 nest monitoring study plots between 2008 and 2023.
