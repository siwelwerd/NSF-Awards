 "awd_abstract_narration": "To study the formation and early development of planets around other stars (known as \"exoplanets\"), this program will measure the properties of infant exoplanets.  Using new ways to make astronomical images at the world's largest and most sensitive infrared wavelength telescope--the Large Binocular Telescope at Mt. Graham, Arizona--this program will look at specific characteristics not studied by other scientific programs that image exoplanets. These planned observations can detect younger planets located very close to their host stars.  The observations will constrain the processes that form giant planets, and will provide pictures of planets in their infancy.  The Principal Investigator will incorporate the results into public lectures in Tucson and into teaching materials.  University students will be involved with all aspects of the research.\r\n\r\nAn unusual and highly beneficial aspect of the proposed work is the ability to probe simultaneously at high resolution exoplanets and the environments in which they are forming.  The investigators will use non-redundant masking interferometry coupled with adaptive optics on the telescope, which allows observations close to or within the diffraction limit of their telescope system.  Non-redundant masking provides high precision measurements, and when used behind an adaptive optics system, can reach faint targets and companions with contrast.  This will provide information on the boundary conditions for planet formation, including initial composition, while at the same time constrain how planets are assembled.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe major goal of the project was to image forming planets still embedded in their natal environments.  While many extra-solar planets are now known, when we began this program, there were only handful of potential candidates of actively-forming protoplanets.  We therefore sought, and still seek, to obtain direct observational constraints on the planet formation process by observing protoplanets still in the process of accreting matter.\n\nWith support from this award, we conducted a survey of transitonal disks (which show structure attributed to forming planets) in young star-forming regions using a novel high-contrast imaging technique called non-redundant masking interferometry.  This technique allows us to probe for planets or planet-induced disk structure with orbits similar to the planets in our solar system (i.e., stellocentric radii of 10-AU or so).  We surveyed many young stars, and found very few candidate young protoplanets, suggesting that either the formation phase is very brief, or that these forming protoplanets are very rare even at these orbital radii.\n\nWe also demonstrated that we can probe even smaller separations using larger telescopes.
