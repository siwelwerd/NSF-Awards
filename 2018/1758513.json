 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant supports work on the Organization of Tropical East Pacific Convection (OTREC) field campaign. The campaign seeks to understand the formation and development of tropical convective clouds and associated heavy rainfall in the adjacent but distinct regions of the eastern equatorial Pacific and the southwest Caribbean, along with their evolution over the intervening portions of Central America and Colombia. The campaign also examines the genesis and evolution of easterly waves, large westward-moving atmospheric disturbances (wavelengths of about 2,000 km) which occur on a weekly basis in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific. The full set of campaign grants is discoverable on the nsf.gov/awardsearch webpage by a keyword search on \"OTREC\".\r\n\r\nTropical convection plays a critical role in earth's climate system and is also responsible for extreme precipitation and hurricane formation. Easterly waves are of particular interest for weather forecasting given their tendency to spawn hurricanes. More generally, tropical convection is an engine of weather and climate worldwide yet poorly understood and difficult to simulate. Work leading to better representation of tropical convection in weather and climate models can thus lead to better weather forecasts and impact assessments, both for the public and decision makers. Aside from the societal relevance of the science, the campaign includes several education and outreach activities including support for undergraduates to participate in fieldwork and production of short documentary videos for use in classroom teaching and informal science education. In addition, the Principal Investigators (PIs) of this grant incorporate results from the campaign into their outreach to New Mexico high schools, in part through a class on weather and climate offered in the Masters of Science Teaching program at New Mexico Tech. They also develop materials for K-12 classroom teaching in their state. The project supports a graduate student and a postdoctoral research fellow, thereby providing for the future workforce in this research area.\r\n\r\nThe eight-week OTREC deployment consists primarily of a set of 20 flights of the Gulfstream V (GV) research aircraft maintained by the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR). The campaign uses an airport in Costa Rica for easy access to the equatorial Pacific and southwest Caribbean study regions, and conditions in these regions are sampled using dropsondes and a wing-mounted W-band radar. Dropsondes contain the same instrument package as standard weather balloons, only dropped from an aircraft (in this case from about 40,000 feet) with a small parachute.\r\n\r\nDespite intensive study we lack a satisfactory theory for how environmental conditions determine when and where tropical convection will form, how long it will last, how much it will expand and organize, and how much rain it will produce. The PIs have developed a theory in which deep convection over warm oceans is controlled by three thermodynamic factors: heat and moisture coming from the underlying ocean, the \"saturation fraction\" of the atmospheric column (a kind of bulk relative humidity), and moist convective instability (with a counterintuitive association between weaker instability and heavier rainfall). But the theory assumes uniform atmospheric and oceanic conditions, and this assumption may not hold in the eastern equatorial Pacific. Instead, the region features a large north-south contrast in sea surface temperature (SST) accompanied by a narrow east-west convection band called the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ). The sharp SST contrast provides an alternative explanation for ITCZ convection, as near-surface winds generally blow across the temperature contrast and converge over the warmer SSTs. Rising motion where low-level winds converge can produce convection, but the observed convection does not clearly match expectations based on SST contrast arguments.\r\n\r\nA further issue involves the vertical structure of convective clouds, as convective clouds in the eastern Pacific ITCZ are relatively shallow yet they produce rain rates similar to their deeper counterparts over the western Pacific. The PIs have an explanation for the development of heavy rain from mid-depth convection which can be tested using campaign data. A further mystery is that satellite data from the NASA Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission (TRMM) seem to show a large amount of stratiform rain in the eastern Pacific, even though high stratiform rain fraction is usually associated with the anvil cloud and decaying cloud plumes found in regions of deep convection. The PIs argue that cloud features identified as stratiform rain in TRMM data should instead be classified as weak cellular convection, thus removing the inconsistency between stratiform rain amounts and relatively shallow convection. The combination of dropsonde and airborne radar data should suffice to distinguish between stratiform rain clouds and weak cellular convection.\r\n\r\nIn contrast, SSTs in the southwest Caribbean are quite uniform so convection does not develop from SST-induced wind convergence. Moreover, mid-tropospheric air over the area is relatively dry and thus not conducive to convection and heavy rainfall.  Yet convection and heavy rainfall still occur, often associated with the passage of easterly waves. These waves appear on a weekly basis and sometimes cross Central America to reach the eastern Pacific.  But it is not clear whether the majority of easterly waves in the eastern Pacific come from the Caribbean or if they form locally.  These issues are also addressed in the campaign.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nLarge cloud systems, often reaching elevations of 13 km or more, produce most of the rainfall over the tropical oceans.  In addition, they form the upward branch of  a global atmospheric circulation called the Hadley circulation, with the downward branch spread over the vast subtropical regions.  The return flow at low levels in the atmosphere constitutes the famous Tradewinds, which flow toward the southwest in the northern hemisphere and the northwest in the southern hemisphere.  Though the composite ascent of air in the Hadley circulation is relatively constant when averaged over space and time, the detailed location, structure, and timing of individual cloud systems, which actually cover only a small fractional area of the tropics, have been exceedingly hard to predict.  These factors are important in getting global weather and climate models right and in making local forecasts of cloudiness and rain.  Incorporating their effects into global models is difficult because, as important as they are, they are individually too small to be resolved in detail in these models.  Somehow, the effects of these cloud systems must be inferred from variables that the models can predict.\n\nThe OTREC project (Organization of Tropical East Pacific Convection), based in Liberia, Costa Rica, was conceived as a way to determine the collective effect of these cloud systems on global models and to enable these models to predict where they will occur.  The prime observational tool in this project was the dropsonde.  These compact instruments were launched from the National Science Foundation/National Center for Atmospheric Research's Gulfstream V aircraft from elevations near 13 kilometers above sea level, radioing back measurements of wind, temperature, and humidity as they fall.  The sondes were deployed in an approximate one degree grid over three strategic areas in the Tropical East Pacific and the far Southwestern Caribbean.  In addition, a downward looking radar was used to determine the characteristics of the precipitation falling from the clouds that we overflew.\n\nUnsurprisingly, we found that strong cloud systems were favored in regions with high relative humidity over a deep layer.  In somewhat more of a surprise, stronger rainfall was found in regions in which the buoyant forces causing the ascent of these hot towers were positive but smaller than average.  These two factors, which are predictable by global models, were found to be the main factors controlling the strength of convection.  Other hypothesized mechanisms involving wind patterns and the distribution of sea surface temperature, were found to be less important than expected.  This pattern was found in all three study areas, which differed climatologically from each other, suggesting that our findings are universal and not peculiar to a particular location in the tropics.  Confirmation of these findings over other areas using the methods and philosophy pioneered in OTREC would provide a solid basis for handling the effects of tropical cloud systems in global models.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/03/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: David J Raymond"
