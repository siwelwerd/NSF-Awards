 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will investigate the laws that govern how continents deform, build mountain ranges and plateaux and the associated seismicity. The research will focus on the context of the India-Asia collision. The research team will analyse and model deformation that followed the Mw 7.8 Gorkha earthquake in the Himalaya of Nepal. They will also use lake level variations since the last glaciations to better understand the total deformation of the region. This topic is of broad interest in geology and geodynamics: it will help understand how continents support surface loads due to the topography, hydrology or glaciations; it also has implications for seismic hazard in the Himalaya-Tibet region. The work will collaborative effort with scientists in Nepal and will work with the National Society of Earthquake Technology to update building code in Nepal. The project will support a graduate students and postdoctoral fellow.\r\n\r\nThe research will advance our understanding of the mechanics of continental deformation and the seismic cycle along the Himalayan front. The work will model postseismic deformation following the Mw7.8 Gorkha earthquake in the Himalaya of Nepal. This analysis will inform fault friction laws and viscoelastic properties responsible for short-term post-seismic relaxation. They constrain the viscous properties of the crust and upper mantle based on the surface deformation response to load variations induced by continental hydrology. They use the response to lake level variations at the Holocene time scale, using the deformation of paleoshorelines, and modern decadal time scales, as well as at the decadal time scale by analysing the response to modern lake level variations and to long-wavelength variations of surface loads measured by GRACE. These investigations will give insight on fault frictional properties, the temperature-dependent non-linear viscous flow laws governing distributed deformation of the crust and upper mantle and the possible need for a transient viscous rheology.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
