 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project studies what allows underrepresented groups to break glass ceilings in (1) becoming professors and (2) the reception of their innovative ideas.  Women, minorities, and international students become professors at significantly lower rates than their counterparts. Even if they become professors, their scientific innovations may be received differently than those of others. These glass ceilings are studied by investigating the factors that affect whether over 1.2 million US doctoral recipients (1977-2015) become professors, and whether they become professors with long lineages of subsequent students who go on to become faculty themselves.  Also studied is whether diverse individuals bring new concepts and new conceptual relations and expand the body of research in new directions.  The project also examines factors that affect the citation and reception of research (net of its contribution), with attention to the work of diverse scholars.  Findings will show how barriers to diversity in higher education may be lowered and overcome and what policy levers can be used to enable equal access to the professoriate and to the creation of scholarly ideas, to the benefit of science and the national welfare more generally. This project was supported jointly by the Education and Human Resources Core Research Program, the Sociology Program, and Science of Broadening Participation. \r\n\r\nGoing beyond previous studies, this project follows doctoral recipients and their careers and considers all scientific fields and multiple demographic groups.  The data for this study encompass almost all scientists that entered US academia from 1977-2015.  The anchor data set of degree recipients is augmented by data on their authoring activities and enriched by demographic data, academic field, and citations.  Questions relating to innovation are investigated by extracting data concerning the content of publications.  Following linking of the various data sets and cross-validation, statistical analyses are used to investigate the principal questions of the study.  Contributions of the study include data to be publicly available, methods for processing and analyzing similar data, and findings concerning the glass ceilings.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Prior work in this area conducts careful qualitative case studies; focuses on a single group, program, or field; or focuses only on successful professors and asking what qualities they share in common. Using these prior works as a springboard, we greatly expand the focus to concern the careers of over 1 million US PhDs from 1980-2015. Most of these never become professors or have their work recognized, but by studying them and their careers, we are able to identify factors facilitating successful transitions over those features which do not.

We partly explain this inequity as the result of the nature of the intellectual contributions diverse students make ? they are often distal connections unfamiliar to the core and dominant set of researchers of scientific fields. We also find that these distally related contributions take longer to be recognized, but that over time, they do get taken up. In short, this suggests that minority students make valuable novel intellectual contributions, but because they are less interpretable to the majority groups dominating a field, they take longer to become core concepts of a research field. The implication of these findings is that greater translation may be needed to render minority contributions more relatable. And /or it may help to explain that distal discoveries will be where their fields move over time anyway so they should reconsider whether their positional bias may be preventing them from seeing their long-term value (Galvez et al 2019; Hofstra et al 2020; Heiberger et al 2021; Schiebinger et al 2021).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Some other work of ours finds that underrepresented scholars still face implicit and explicit bias that may thwart the diversification of the professoriate and the broadened representation of different groups research ideas.

As such, it helps to study man-dominated topics like machine learning over woman-dominated topics like child development, and even within sociology, it helps to study say causal methods over sociology of education. Interestingly, women in STEM fields face more explicit bias in the form of access and structural barriers, while women in the Humanities and Social Sciences (HSS) have greater access and representation in their fields but face more implicit bias in the sense that what they study is devalued.
