Additional information about the conference can be found on the website http://www.ucs.louisiana.edu/~lxr7423/ECOAS/ECOAS2017.html\r\n\r\nThis conference is the fifteenth installment of the East Coast Operator Algebras Symposium, a series that annually brings together a diverse group of mathematicians whose primary research interests are in the theory of operator algebras. The main foci of the 2017 event are the following: subfactor theory, Popa's deformation/rigidity theory; free probability theory, the Elliott classification program for C*-algebras, the Novikov conjecture, and C*-algebras and dynamical systems. The conference program provides ample opportunity for graduate students, postdocs, and other young scientists to present their work.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe East Coast Operator Algebras Symposium (ECOAS) was held at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette on Oct. 7 to 8, 2018.  A follow-up activity, a Mini-workshop on the Cuntz semigroup, was held at the University of Houston on June 18 to 20, 2018.   Operator algebras is an important part of modern analysis, with many connections to other subjects, and ECOAS is one of the leading operator algebras conferences in North America.   The Cuntz semigroup is an important part of modern day operator algebra theory.  Cutting edge research was presented by leading researchers to a wide audience.  There was a large group of participants, with a good mixture of senior researchers and students and young people at the beginnings of their careers.  New collaborations were formed, old collaborations were continued, and new research advances resulted.  Young people learned a lot from the excellent speakers, and they had the opportunity to interact with others, thus providing opportunities to move forward their research as well as their careers.   At least 64 percent of participants or speakers were students or young people at the beginnings of their careers.  At least 20 percent were members of underrepresented groups.  The ECOAS website has slides of the speakers' lectures, thus making available the interesting and important talks to the wider mathematical community.  \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/19/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Ping Wong Ng"
