 "awd_abstract_narration": "This REU Site award to the University of Georgia, located in Athens, Georgia, will support the training of 10 students for 9 weeks during the summers of 2018-2020.  This program will introduce undergraduates to areas of microbial research and increase their awareness of careers in microbiology and graduate school application process through multiple workshops. Students from groups that are underrepresented in the scientific community, including deaf and hard-of-hearing students and ethnic minorities, are encouraged to participate. Each REU participant conducts an independent project with a faculty mentor residing in one of several Departments (e.g., Microbiology, Marine Sciences). All provide research topics that address the functions of microscopic organisms and use interdisciplinary techniques that combine knowledge from diverse fields, including Genetics, Biochemistry, and Bioinformatics. Projects may address broad questions including the role of microbes in environmental or geochemical processes, or in engineering microbes to synthesize industrially-relevant compounds. These processes may be dissected at the molecular or genome sequence levels. Student applications are submitted electronically, and students will be selected by a committee of research faculty. \r\n\r\nIt is anticipated that a total of 30 students, primarily from schools with limited research opportunities, will be trained in the program.  Additional support will be provided to deaf or hard-of-hearing (D/HH) participants. Students will learn how research is conducted, and many will present the results of their work at scientific conferences.  Participants will meet with faculty, attend scientific seminars, tour local biotech industries, participate in discussions of science ethics, and join regular laboratory group meetings. Students will present their research results at the end of the summer in a poster session. \r\n\r\nA common web-based assessment tool used by all REU Site programs funded by the Division of Biological Infrastructure will be used to determine the effectiveness of the training program. Students will be tracked after the program to determine their career paths. Students will be asked to respond to an automatic email sent via the NSF reporting system. More information is available by visiting http://mib.uga.edu/reu-site-molecular-and-synthetic-microbiology, or by contacting the PI (Dr. Vincent J. Starai at vjstarai@uga.edu) or the co-PI (Dr. Timothy Hoover at trhoover@uga.edu).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIn the five years spanning 2018 to 2022 (did not run program in 2018 or 2020), the University of Georgia NSF REU Site Award: Molecular and Synthetic Microbiology has trained a total of 30 undergraduate students in cutting-edge microbiological research techniques.  All participants were directly supported by this funded NSF proposal.  Of these participants, eighteen were undergraduates at liberal arts schools or undergraduate-serving institutions (60%), where focused research opportunities for these undergraduates tend to be limited.  In addition, our program successfully provided research opportunities to student groups who are poorly represented in scientific careers.  Eleven of those participants (37%) were members of underrepresented minority groups in STEM fields, which included students who identified as Deaf or hard-of-hearing. \n\n            Research seminars given by guest speakers outside UGA diversified REU Site participants\u2019 exposure to scientific programming at other institutions.  Various workshops provided participants with information on professional careers in microbiology and related fields, as well as introduced students to ethical behavior in data collection, scientific publication, and data ownership.  Participants toured local biotechnology companies and government science agencies, which further broadened their views of potential career choices.  Students received instruction in presenting research results in a poster format and presented the results of their research in a final poster presentation to the UGA at-large scientific community in order to hone their scientific presentation skills.  Faculty and graduate student trainers involved with the program had access to \"Entering Mentoring\" workshops, a premier workshop for the training of scientific mentors.\n\n            Twenty-seven of our 30 NSF-funded participants have graduated from their home institutions, and the vast majority of those students have enrolled in graduate or professional schools.  Two of the remaining 3 students who have not graduated yet are on-track to graduate by the end of the spring 2024 semester.  Seven of the twenty-seven REU Site participants who have graduated or are graduating this semester (26%) have either come back to UGA to enroll in Ph.D. programs (4 students; Microbiology, Integrated Life Sciences), or have come back to work at UGA in a research environment (1 student, PREP program in Infectious Diseases; 2 students, research technicians).  The entry of past REU Site participants into graduate programs and careers at UGA suggest that students find the research environment at UGA to be supportive for their career objectives.\n\n            Over the five years of this award, our participants have made (and continue to make) important contributions to scientific discovery and in the dissemination of research to the community.  Although none of the REU Site participants have published their research in a peer-reviewed research journal, two students were selected to present their work at national symposia.  These symposia included the Southeastern Branch, American Society for Microbiology (SEB-ASM, October 2022) and the McNair Scholar Symposium (March, 2023).  In addition, most of the participants presented their work at smaller, local symposia and conferences at their home institutions.  Taken together, our participants have been competitive for selection into nationally-recognized conferences, thus highlighting the strength of our research experiences over the lifetime of this program.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/04/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Vincent J Starai"
