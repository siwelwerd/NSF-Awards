 "awd_abstract_narration": "The mechanisms for dissipating the ocean's balanced flow remain uncertain but are important for correctly simulating oceanic circulation. Dissipation through internal lee-wave generation followed by turbulence production has been proposed to account for 20-75% of the needed loss. However, microstructure measurements do not agree with the predicted dissipation. This research will explain this discrepancy and better constrain the role of lee-waves in dissipating vs. redistributing energy. This study will carry out numerical simulations describing the generation, propagation, dissipation, and reabsorption of internal lee-waves in areas where earth rotation-induced flows of finite extent are dominant. Results from this project will be presented at conferences and published in peer-reviewed journals to make them available to the wider scientific community. The results of this study will provide an improved parameterization for the dissipation and redistribution of balanced flows and induced mixing by lee-wave generation and increase the accuracy of Ocean circulation modeling. The project will support education and mentoring of a graduate student in numerical modeling and internal-wave physics, and an undergraduate student in research. The research will also be utilized in outreach activities for the general public and K-12 science teachers, as well as undergraduate and international student training.\r\n\r\nLarge amounts of power, equivalent of 1 TW, is thought to be input into the ocean circulation by wind-work. The maintenance of steady state conditions (i.e., constant energy levels) in the world's oceans requires that addition of energy by the wind is balanced through energy dissipation processes. Internal lee-wave generation has been assumed to be one of the largest predicted energy sinks dissipating 0.2 to 0.75 TW through turbulence generation. However, measurements in Antarctic Circumpolar Current jets find that turbulent dissipation rates fall short of predictions by as much as an order of magnitude. Recent numerical simulations of spontaneous near-inertial wave generation in the Kuroshio Front find that much of the generated wave energy is reabsorbed back into the mean flow. If reabsorption also occurs for lee waves, they would be as much a mechanism for redistributing balanced energy as dissipating it. These numerical simulations will determine what fractions of lee-wave energy are lost to turbulence vs. being reabsorbed into the mean flow and hence address whether lee-wave generation represents a major sink for the large-scale circulation. Missing key elements have been sheared flow and wave action (E/w) conservation where E is the wave energy density, w = kU the Lagrangian frequency of the lee wave, k the topographic wavenumber and U the flow speed. In a bottom-intensified rotating shear flow, the fraction kU1/(kUo) is available for dissipation and (kUo- kU1)/(kUo) for reabsorption, where Uo is the bottom flow speed and U1 > f/k the flow where the waves break. The numerical simulations will test realistic ocean flow and topography configurations to determine whether reabsorption is a significant fraction of lee-wave generation in the ocean.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
