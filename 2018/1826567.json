 "awd_abstract_narration": "Plants have typical shapes, and one part of each plant, the flower, has a shape and structure characteristic of the species.  How growing plants create flower shapes is unknown. Understanding how flowers acquire shape is important flowers are major sources of human food.  Earlier work has shown that the shape that flowers take depends on the expression of regulatory genes in the growing flowers, and on the mechanical properties of the walls of the floral cells.  This project will create computer models of flowers that show all of the cells and cell walls at several stages of floral growth and add to those models the physical properties of the walls (measured by several biophysical methods) and the patterns of gene expression that create the cell walls and regulate floral shape.  By comparing these patterns, the team will develop hypotheses about how the combination of changing gene expression and changing mechanical properties lead to changes in cell shape and size, and therefore to the development of flower shape. They will test the hypotheses and the models by changing wall mechanical properties experimentally and seeing if the computer model predicts the shape changes seen in the experiments. The outcomes will provide tools with wide applicability to crop plants, enabling researchers and breeders access to genes and processes that contribute to establishing floral shape. Educational efforts focus on training students and post-docs in cutting edge interdisciplinary approaches that merge biology and mathematical modeling.\r\n\r\nThis project will develop a tool called the \"Computable Flower\" that permits the user to (i) integrate data on geometry, gene expression and biomechanics and (ii) explore, interpret and generate hypotheses based on data supported by mechanistic modeling approaches. The tool therefore provides an integrated description in the form of a 3D dynamic template of the growing flower bud.  The Computable Flower will be populated with existing or novel quantitative datasets coming from experimental and computational techniques concerning the spatial distribution of regulatory molecules such as transcription factors and hormones, and the spatial expression patterns of genes involved in cell wall synthesis and remodeling which operate downstream and upstream from these regulatory networks. Information on the spatial organization and properties of structural elements of the developing flower, including cell wall stiffness, microtubule orientation and cellulose microfibril organization will be added to the template.  Following this, temporal information will be included, showing correlations of gene expression, mechanical properties of the tissue, and changes in geometry.  This will lead to computational models and hypotheses regarding biochemical, physical and geometrical properties with simulation outcomes quantitatively compared with experimental data. Predictions coming from the modeling will guide experiments using domain-specific perturbation of genes that influence microtubule and wall status. These transgenic lines will then be subjected to detailed quantitative growth studies to test the validity of the model or to refine it.  The overall result will be a path to calculate floral phenotype from genotype that includes mechanical properties of tissues and their role in morphogenesis.  The broader impact will include potential applications in agriculture as well as training of students and postdocs in the combination of experimental and computational developmental biology.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe goal of this collaborative project (an ERA-CAPs project involving four laboratories in the US and Europe) was to find by experiment and mathematical modeling how different gene actions contribute to growth in developing flowers.  This would allow an understanding of the relation between gene activity, growth due to cell division and change in the shapes and size of cells, and the physical forces that lead to shape changes in flowers as they grow.  This in turn would give us a fundamental conception of how flowers grow and develop as a result of the action of genes, and consequently, the ability to predict how changes in gene expression will change flower development.  The data correlating gene expression, cell division, and growth are being combined with computational models of mechanical forces in flowers, to see how these forces might feed back on gene expression and growth, and how gene expression controls the mechanical forces that lead to growth and shape change.\n\nThe information obtained, both experimental and computational, is being combined in an interactive tool called the Computable Flower that integrates spatial and temporal information on molecular regulators, quantitative data on growth of cells, division of cells, growth of flower regions, and maps of physical parameters such as stress patterns, in developing flowers.  The data on gene expression patterns are already available in the public Morphonet database.  This allows the information obtained to be accessed in detail by other researchers, and allows the wider research community to add data and models, to achieve in the end a full understanding of how genes lead to flowers.\n\nThe broad impact of the work is of particular relevance to agriculture and the environment.  Flowers are the source of most of our food - grains such as rice, wheat and corn.  The yields of these crop plants depend on the development and growth of flowers, as the grains are parts of the flowers. Increasing yields to feed the world, and to nourish its growing population as well as to increase agricultural productivity in countries with sufficient food, as an economic contribution, requires, in the long run, that we understand how genes control flower development.  The ability to predicably modify plant growth in different environments will also allow more sustainable agricultural practices.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/30/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Elliot M Meyerowitz"
