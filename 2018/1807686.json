 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-technical summary:  \r\nElectromigration is a type of failure that occurs in metals used both in the semiconductor industry and in new technologies such as wearable and flexible electronics. In this type of failure, small metallic lines used to conduct electricity (so-called interconnects) develop microscopic voids and ultimately break due to a large amount of electrical current, leading to the overall failure of the electronic device. It is known that electromigration is controlled by the structure of the metallic material, in particular how its atoms are arranged. In typical metals, certain regions (called grain boundaries) display large levels of disorder in the atomic arrangement, and this is known to facilitate failure by electromigration. In this project, new kinds of nanoscale metallic materials with well-ordered atomic structures (so-called twin boundaries), and thus a high potential to prevent electromigration, will be studied. Electromigration is a barrier for the progress of the electronic industry, hampering further miniaturization and greater reliability. In the case of the new wearable and flexible electronic technologies, it limits broader mass-market applications. The understanding of electromigration in metals with twin boundaries emerging from this research will contribute to remove these difficulties, and enable new directions in the design of interconnects. Furthermore, mentoring and research opportunities for graduate, undergraduate and high school students will be enabled by this grant. The graduate students will engage in mentoring of undergraduates participating in the project, and of high-school students hosted in the PI lab through the Nanoexplorers program at UTD. By doing meaningful research related to this project, the high school students will be inspired to pursue careers in STEM. \r\n\r\nTechnical summary: \r\nElectromigration is a diffusion process where electrons travelling in a conductor in a high-current-density scenario- promote the diffusion of atoms in the metallic lattice, leading to voids and eventually failure. Diffusion depends on the microstructure; in fact, grain boundaries are known to facilitate electromigration due to their loosely-packed structure. Twin boundaries, on the other hand, promise to slow diffusion by several orders of magnitude due to their ordered atomic structure. The proposed research aims to investigate the potentially-beneficial role of materials with well-defined and repeatable twin boundaries, as interconnects with increased resistance to electromigration. The proposed research program is experimental in nature, and aims to gain insights into the electromigration behavior of twinned interconnects by conducting tests where high current densities and controlled temperatures will cause failure. A combination of high-throughput ex-situ electrical tests for statistically-significant quantification of failure, and in-situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) tests to understand the evolution of the twinned microstructure during electromigration, will be conducted. The objectives of the research are: i) To quantify the electromigration parameters in twinned interconnects; ii) To characterize in-situ TEM the electromigration behavior to obtain structure-property relations; and iii) to compare the electromigration performance of twinned interconnects with respect to published data from interconnects currently used in the electronic industry.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The semiconductor industry continues to miniaturize chips, which require ever smaller metallic interconnects, the miniature \"cables\" that connect transistors together. As interconnects are made smaller, they carry more electrical current per area (current density), like a tube that is shrunk but is forced to carry the same amount of water. This increased current density causes a failure called electromigration, which has become more frequent. Electromigration occurs because electrons knock atoms out of place and displace them, eventually creating voids that cause the interconnect to fail. This process is made easier if the atoms in the metal have a disordered arrangement, which occurs in areas called grain boundaries. Interconnects used today display more grain boundaries as they are made smaller, increasing the likelihood of failure.</p>\n<p>To address this challenge, this project studied twinned nanowires. These are nanoscale metallic wires with a special arrangement of atoms called twin boundaries, which do not have disorder. Their dimensions are about 100 nanometers wide and a few micrometers long (500 times thinner, and 5 to 10 times shorter than the width of a human hair). Because nanowires also withstand severe deformation (mechanical properties), they can be incorporated in a novel class of devices called stretchable electronics. Random networks of millions of nanowires, similar to a fabric made of many threads, can conduct electricity while deforming, much like a piece of clothing. These devices thus have the potential to enable better wearable devices for applications such as health monitoring.</p>\n<p>One outcome of the project was the measurement of the current density that these nanowires can withstand. Using advanced nanomanufacturing techniques (Image 1), investigators were able to connect electrical test equipment to individual nanowires (Image 2). They then applied increasing electrical current to the wires until failure (Image 3). It was found that current densities can reach values as high as ten times as those carried in other interconnects. To reach them, it was found that the nanowire must have a smooth surface, to allow it to efficiently transfer heat to the surroundings. Otherwise, the nanowire still can withstand a large current density, but its magnitude is similar to that carried by normal interconnects and can vary significantly. Because researchers tested many specimens, there was enough data to measure this variation so that a statistical analysis could be made, which in turn can be used to predict failure in future nanowire applications. This outcome thus provided guidelines for achieving good performance in these nanowires, should they be used in future semiconductor devices or stretchable electronics. Furthermore, future designers of stretchable electronics can predict the survival rate of new devices, using the statistical data. Statistical data is important as these devices will use millions of nanowires. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>The researchers also studied the nanowires' time to failure, caused by electromigration. This is a metric used in the semiconductor industry to evaluate the longevity of interconnects. This metric was unknown up to now for nanowires, which prevented comparing them with established technology. To do this, the investigators used similar nanomanufacturing techniques to apply current to the nanowires, while they were subjected to an environment of elevated temperature (Image 4). Time to failure depends on temperature, which is why a controlled environment was necessary. The wires were subjected to these conditions until their electrical resistance increased, indicating failure. Testing periods as long as a few weeks were needed. The data was analyzed using a mathematical model that gives the energy necessary to start electromigration. This so-called energy barrier can be used to compare different technologies as it enables the prediction of time to failure under different operating conditions. It was found that if the surface of the nanowires is protected, so-called passivation, such that diffusion in the surface is minimized, the nanowires can display longer times to failure than normal interconnects. This outcome thus points to the conditions needed for a future nanowire-based device to outperform current technologies.</p>\n<p>Finally, the project enabled the training and engagement of students (Image 5). One PhD student, who graduated in 2023, was trained under the direction of the principal investigator. His dissertation was focused on the topics of this project. This investigator will now work in another academic institution as a postdoctoral researcher, utilizing the nanomanufacturing skills learned. Over the course of the project, three undergraduate students worked on summer projects. Furthermore, the PhD student and principal investigator conducted outreach to a local high school. High school students were invited to UT-Dallas for field trips, where they learned about nanowires and their applications. The PhD student and principal investigator led these activities.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 07/05/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Rodrigo&nbsp;Bernal Montoya</p>\n</div>\n<div
