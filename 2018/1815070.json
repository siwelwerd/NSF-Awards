In particular, a novel research area enabled by multi-material additive manufacturing is the fabrication of objects with desired appearance properties.  This project will develop technology for ultra-high fidelity reproduction of texture, spectral color, gloss, and translucency. While consumer-grade printers typically use 4 ink colors, our system will employ 10 different inks in order to accurately reproduce color across the spectrum, including regions that are at the edge of visibility. The use of these 3D printers will enable not just the reproduction of color, but also the recreation of gloss, translucency, and fine-scale detail such as brush strokes. Our testbed for this work is painted fine art images.  This domain provides technical challenges that will push the state of the art for high-fidelity reproduction in general, as well as immediately benefiting cultural heritage preservation efforts. Fine art objects are inherently subject to degradation or damage from light and air when on display for long periods of time.  Ultra-high quality facsimiles of these cultural treasures can be exploited in place of the originals in many applications, including restoration practice, conservatory studies, education in museums, and enjoyment at home. Collaboration with local museums in Boston and Princeton will enable strong outreach with curators and the general public.  Project outcomes will have additional broad impact by enabling accurate appearance reproduction with 3D printing in support of a wide range of applications in rapid prototyping and the manufacture of end-user products.\r\n\r\nTo achieve these goals, the project will investigate several key methods and technologies.  First, there is the question of how to use advanced camera systems to capture the properties of the original paintings.  This involves measuring the full spectrum of light refracted by each point on the painting, as well as how shiny or opaque the surface is.  Moreover, it involves the use of high-resolution 3D scanners to measure the fine bumps on the surface left by brushes or other tools.  A second component of the project is to characterize the full capabilities of multi-material 3D printers, and to incorporate the measured ink properties into computer simulations that can predict exactly how the print-outs will look.  The final components of the project are to perform computer optimization to determine the exact type, number, and concentration of printing materials that should be used, and how the printing process should be tweaked to achieve maximum reproduction quality.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Project outcomes will have additional broad impact by enabling accurate appearance reproduction with 3D printing in support of a wide range of applications in rapid prototyping and the manufacture of end-user products.\n\nTo achieve these goals, we investigated several key methods and technologies.  First, we showed how to take advantage of the current 3D printers capabilities of combining highly concentrated inks with a large number of layers, to expand the spectral gamut of a set of inks.  We use a data-driven method to both predict the spectrum of a printed ink stack and optimize for the stack layout that best matches a target spectrum.  We demonstrated reproduction of a number of real paintings and historically important pigments using our prototype implementation that uses 10 custom inks with varying spectra and a resin-based 3D printer.\n\nSecond, we developed new printing hardware based on piezo-actuated needle valves capable of jetting highly viscous varnishes.  Based on the new hardware setup, we demonstrated a complete pipeline for controlling the gloss of a given 2.5D object, from printer calibration, through material selection, to the manufacturing of models with spatially-varying reflectance.  Apart from being a viable solution for 3D printing, our method offers an additional and essential benefit of separating color and gloss fabrication which makes the process more flexible and enables high-quality color and gloss reproduction.\n\nThird, we demonstrated the feasibility of learning a closed-loop control policy for additive manufacturing using reinforcement learning.  We discovered that approximate, but efficient, numerical simulation is sufficient as long as it allows learning the behavioral patterns of deposition that translate to real-world experiences.  In combination with reinforcement learning, our model can be used to discover control policies that outperform baseline controllers.  Furthermore, the recovered policies have a minimal sim-to-real gap.  We showcased this by applying our control policy in-vivo on a single-layer, direct ink writing printer.\n\nFinally, we explored using stiff fibers (e.g., carbon fiber) to thermoplastic polymers with limited stiffness.  Our automated fiber path planning algorithm maximizes the stiffness of a 3D print given specified external loads, using a gradient-based optimization algorithm that uses the adjoint method to calculate the gradient of stiffness with respect to fiber layout.  The results show that objects with fiber paths generated by our algorithm achieve greater stiffness while using less fiber than the baselines.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/28/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Szymon M Rusinkiewicz"
