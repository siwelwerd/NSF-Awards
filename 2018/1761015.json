 "awd_abstract_narration": "Bioenergy sorghum, a relatively new type of sorghum, has emerged as a potential source for biofuel owing to its large amount of biomass. This sorghum grows relatively tall (3-5 m) but commonly breaks and topples under wind, rain, hail or other mechanical stresses. A promising approach to reduce breakage is to develop new mechanically robust sorghum varieties.  To do this will require a fundamental understanding of the biomechanical properties of stalks and identifying the genetic and environmental influences that produce stronger plants. Experiments have shown that mechanically stimulating the plants during growth can significantly change the physical and biomechanical characteristics of sorghum stems.  This occurs because the mechanical load changes the growth of the cells in the plant stem. This mechanical stimulation causes adaptive growth that improves the mechanical properties of the stalk. This research will accelerate the development of new fuel-rich and mechanically robust varieties of sorghum, thereby leading to significant increases in food, feed, and biomass productivity. This project will provide undergraduate and graduate students with interdisciplinary professional and technical training.  The team will also participate in a summer research experience for teacher (RET) program and summer camps to disseminate the study of biomechanics and genetics/epigenetics of sorghum to high school teachers and students.\r\n\r\nTo accomplish these goals, this study will integrate experimental and computational studies of structural morphologies, biomechanical properties, physiology, and genetics/epigenetics of bioenergy sorghum stalks, to provide a fundamental explanation of stalk lodging (breaking) and to guide development of new lodging-resistant sorghum. The intellectual significance of this work resides in addressing the following fundamental topics: 1) uncovering the thigmomorphogenic response (response to mechanical stimulation) in tuning the biomechanical properties of bioenergy sorghum stalks, including investigating epigenetic changes, gene expression, and hormonal responses associated with the mechanical properties of stalks; 2) revealing the impact of the viscoelastic responses of stalks and their constituents (sclerenchymatous tissue and parenchymatous tissue with different cell wall structures) on stem lodging; and 3) providing structure-property-genetic/epigenetic relationships for stalks with superior biomechanical properties. Knowledge gained from this study will likely be transferable to other grasses, thereby extending the impact of the project.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This sorghum grows relatively tall (3-5 m) but commonly suffers from stem breakage (see <strong>Image 1</strong>) and anchorage failure under various mechanical stimuli, e.g., wind, and rain. To explain stem breakage, this study has explored the biomechanical properties of live sorghum stems. Live stems contain a large amount of water, which can lead to changes in the mechanical properties with time (viscoelastic response) and the transport process of water within cells (poroelastic response). Time-dependent effects on the biomechanical properties of sorghum stems can influence the mechanical failure of sorghum stems. Moreover, mechanical stimulation during plant growth induces changes in the plant morphologies which can affect the biomechanical properties of the stems.</p>\n<p>This study has aimed at understanding the effects of mechanical stimulation during sorghum plant growth on the changes in the stem biomechanical properties as a result of altering the epigenetic and morphology of the stems. Bioenergy sorghum plants were grown in a greenhouse under two treatments with and without mechanical stimulation. The mechanical stimulation was administered via continuous periodic bending from weeks 6 to 13 during the growth period. Mechanical properties of sorghum stems at several internode and node locations were measured under bending. Expressions of genes and hormones at different growth stages were determined. Changes in the stem morphology and tissue microstructures (see <strong>Image 1</strong>) were also investigated. Understanding the effects of mechanical stimulation on sorghum stems? biomechanical properties can support the development of new bioenergy sorghum variants that are failure resistant.</p>\n<p>Highlights of research findings are summarized below:</p>\n<p>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At maturity, the morphological traits of the stimulated and non-stimulated stems were characterized, including internode lengths and diameters, and tissue structures of two internodes (4 and 7). Younger internodes were more responsive and experienced more pronounced changes in length due to the stimulation when compared to the older internodes. Mechanical stimulation produced shorter internodes with slightly larger diameters (<strong>Image 2</strong>). Mechanical stimulation promoted changes in the abundance/expression of hormones and genes that can strongly influence the morphology and constituent compositions of cell walls and tissues, which impact the morphological and biomechanical traits of the stems (<strong>Image 3</strong>).</p>\n<p>2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Biomechanical properties, including elastic (instantaneous) modulus, flexural stiffness, strength, and time-dependent compliance of two internodes under bending, were determined. The two internodes of the stems were at different stages of development at the time of mechanical stimulation. Mechanical stimulation produced softer (more compliant) and stronger internode stems. No apparent changes in the biomechanical responses of the nodes were observed from the stimulated plants. Rind tissue has a stiffer modulus compared to the pith tissue of internodes. Mechanical stimulation results in softer rind and pith tissues, which is consistent with the responses under bending. Younger internodes were more responsive and experienced more pronounced changes in biomechanical properties when compared to the older internodes (<strong>Image 3</strong>).</p>\n<p>3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Significant time-dependent responses were observed in the internodes under uniaxial compression and bending tests (<strong>Image 4</strong>). Under both tests, at certain load ranges water migration out of the tissue samples was seen. Constant forces prescribed to the samples cause continuous increases in the corresponding displacements (creep responses) without further migration of water.</p>\n<p>4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Plant stems have geometric irregularities at multiple length scales, which can have a significant effect on the mechanical responses of the stems. Simulations of mechanical testing under different boundary conditions, i.e., uniaxial compression and tension, and bending, were performed to highlight the existence of localized stress or strain due to irregular shapes and sizes of the specimens that may lead to premature structural failures (<strong>Image 4</strong>).</p>\n<p>5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Simulations were also performed to investigate the deformation mechanisms of several tissues within an internode with different microstructural geometries under compressive loadings. Tissues with smaller cell sizes and denser cells result in higher stiffness and strength, which is consistent with the experimental tests on the rind and pith tissues (<strong>Image 5</strong>).

These signals altered the expression of more than 2500 genes within 10 min. Gene ontology terms related to transcription and jasmonic acid signaling were overrepresented at 10 min. Selected gene expression and hormonal responses to mechanical stimulation occur very rapidly (2.5 to 10 min), and these responses may manifest some distance from the site of stimulation.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 01/05/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Anastasia&nbsp;H&nbsp;Muliana</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1761015/1761015_10544160_1672933398622_Image1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1761015/1761015_10544160_1672933398622_Image1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Sorghum Morphologies and Mechanical Stimulation during Growth\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1761015/1761015_10544160_1672933398622_Image1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Sorghum Morphologies and Mechanical Stimulation during Growth\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Sorghum stem is a hierarchical structure of different tissues (i.e., rind, pith, and vascular bundle) of varying cell wall structures and constituents.
