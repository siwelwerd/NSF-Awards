 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support the PI and undergraduate students from Regis University to enable them to contribute to the Muon g-2 Experiment at Fermilab, which aims to discover new particles and interactions that are beyond the current Standard Model.  The Standard Model of subatomic physics provides an overarching theoretical framework that describes all known forces except gravity.  It has been extensively tested, and it successfully predicts almost every phenomenon that has ever been observed in experiments at particle accelerators.  Nevertheless, it is known to be incomplete, since it does not have a way to explain dark matter or dark energy, and it does not account for the asymmetry of matter over antimatter that allowed the structures of our universe to form.  Muons are in many ways similar to electrons, but with a mass approximately 207 times higher, and they are unstable, decaying in a few microseconds; they appear in nature as cosmic rays.  The Muon g-2 Experiment measures the rate at which the of muons rotate as they orbit in a magnetic field. That rotation could arise from the coupling of muons to new particles.  The experiment has been constructed and has completed its first year of data collection.  With close mentoring from the PI and other collaborators, students will maintain and upgrade particle detectors, assist with taking data at Fermilab, and analyze data. They will have opportunities to present their work at conferences and collaboration meetings. The professional development of these students is a primary focus of this project.  Entering classes at Regis University are continuing a trend of increasing ethnic and socioeconomic diversity, so the students supported by this award represent a broadening in the participation by groups that are currently underrepresented in physics research.\r\n\r\nThe Muon g-2 experiment measures the muon's anomalous magnetic moment.  Previous measurements of this quantity differ from theoretical predictions by about 3.5 standard deviations.  The new measurement at Fermilab will record 20 times more muon decays than experiment 821 at Brookhaven National Laboratory.  Systematic uncertainties will also be reduced, leading to an expected precision of 140 parts per billion.  Consequently, the experiment has the potential to discover the indirect effects of new particles and interactions with very high statistical significance. The range of possible new physics is wide; it could include ideas such as supersymmetry, light weakly-interacting particles from a \"dark sector,\" axion-like particles, or extra dimensions.  Conversely, if the result turns out to agree with the Standard Model, it would provide a strong constraint on all of these new physics models.  The experiment measures the rate of spin precession in flight for a muon beam in a weak-focusing 1.5 Tesla storage ring magnet.  Several beam dynamics effects directly contribute to the systematic error, including coherent betatron oscillations (CBO) and muon losses, which are partly driven by the CBO.   The fiber harps, which were refurbished and are maintained by the Regis group, are used to characterize and to minimize the CBO.  The anticipated precision of the experiment assumes that the systematic errors from CBO and muon losses will be reduced by factors of 2.3 and 4.5, respectively.  The Regis group participates in the analysis of fiber harp data in order to understand these beam dynamics effects; it also contributes to other parts of the analysis effort, including data quality control and run selection.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis grant supported the Regis University group's contributions to the Muon g-2 Experiment at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory from September 2018 through August 2022. \n\nThis experiment relies on particles known as muons, which behave in many ways as electrons do, but they are about 207 times more massive; they are also short-lived, decaying (when at rest) in an average of 2.2 microseconds.  We use muons as probes that interact with virtual manifestations of many different kinds of matter and energy, including those that are already known, but also any that might not yet have been discovered directly.  Each muon acts as a tiny magnet because of its intrinsic spin, and the experiment observes the rotation of the direction that the magnetization points while the muons are stored in a magnetic field.\n\nThe magnetic moment of a particle characterizes the rate at which its spin vector rotates in a magnetic field.  The muon's magnetic moment has been predicted very precisely from the Standard Model of subatomic physics, and the Muon g-2 experiment tests this prediction, which includes the effects of all known types of particles and interactions.\n\nIn April 2021, the Muon g-2 Collaboration reported a first result, which was based on a dataset that we collected in spring 2018.  The precision of this initial result, 0.46 parts per million, was comparable to that of a previous measurement made at Brookhaven National Laboratory.  The combination of the two experimental results does not agree with the prediction of the Standard Model; it differs by 4.2 standard deviations from the consensus value that was determined by the Muon g-2 Theory Initiative.  This level of discrepancy is very unlikely to arise by chance; it might be caused by new physics beyond the known Standard Model.  Alternatively, it might point towards a need to improve our understanding of the contributions from hadrons (particles that are composed of quarks and gluons), which introduce the most uncertain part of the Standard Model calculation.\n\nThe result stimulated intense interest and excitement in the nuclear and high-energy physics communities; our paper, published in the journal Physical Review Letters, was the most frequently cited in the field in 2021.  The Regis University group's primary contribution to this groundbreaking result was to the data quality control process.  We developed and applied computing tools to verify the operational conditions for each segment of recorded data, and we made the final selection of which segments to include in the analysis.\n\nThe Regis group also continued to maintain a set of detectors known as \"fiber harps,\" and to analyze the data from them.  Notably, we developed improved amplifier electronics, which we installed in 2019.  Each fiber harp contains seven 0.5 mm diameter fibers that can be inserted into the beam for special runs; the fibers produce light as muons pass through them.  This light is transported, digitized, and recorded, and it is used to reconstruct how the position of the muon beam varies over time.  We have used the fiber harps to observe and characterize the oscillations of the muon beam that arise from its focusing by the electric and magnetic fields in the experiment.\n\nFinally, the Regis group also contributed substantially to the collection of additional data sets that will be the basis of future publications with even more precise results from the experiment.  In particular, the PI was one of the on-site operations managers for the experiment for the fiscal year 2022 data collection run.\n\nRegis University is a primarily-undergraduate institution, so education and professional development for undergraduate students form a vital aspect of this project.  A total of eight of them participated in this work.  All of them worked on data analysis projects; six were also able to travel to Fermilab to maintain the fiber harp detector hardware.  Three students were able to attend and present their contributions to this research at American Physical Society conferences.   A majority of the students who were involved in the project are from demographic groups that are underrepresented in physics.  Of the students who have graduated, most have entered the technology workforce in engineering or software development roles.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/29/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Frederick Gray"
