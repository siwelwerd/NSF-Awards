 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-Technical Description\r\nThis Major Research Instrumentation award supports the University of Alabama at Birmingham to acquire an atomic force microscope for interdisciplinary materials research and education. This microscope supports a diverse, multi-departmental research in soft materials ranging from soft synthetic hydrogels to relatively dense composites and biological structures. The instrument provides enhanced capabilities for quantitative nanoscale mapping of electrical, mechanical, biological, and chemical properties. It also plays a vital role in student education in the fields of chemistry, materials science, biomedical science and biomedical engineering. Educational opportunities are available not only for undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral fellows on the campus, but they expand via outreach to local middle and high school students. These multidisciplinary educational efforts are important to increase the recognition of the research efforts in the Departments of Chemistry, Medicine, and Biomedical Engineering in order to improve student recruiting, especially among underrepresented populations. A high caliber research environment is also vital to the regional economy in Central Alabama through raising community awareness toward biomedical and soft-materials technologies.\r\n\r\nTechnical Description\r\nThis atomic force microscope combines the capabilities for high-resolution and high-speed imaging with quantitative nano-electrical and nanomechanical mapping. The ability to acquire multifunctional, high-resolution data under a wide range of operating conditions allows for studies on a broad spectrum of dry and hydrated samples. The types of samples extend from synthetic networks, polymer composites, nanodevices, to cell membranes and tissues. The common theme among these samples is that they all involve soft materials, i.e., synthetic polymers, biological structures, or combinations of the two. An increased ability to characterize state-of-the-art nanomaterials results in an enhanced fundamental understanding of the structural properties of soft materials and the composition at their surfaces. This includes the effect of the surface morphology on the physical, biological, and chemical characteristics of the materials. The understanding enables transformative research for the development of new materials in tissue regenerative therapies, controlled drug delivery, molecular sensing, and related biotechnologies.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
