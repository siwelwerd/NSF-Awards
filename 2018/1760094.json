 "awd_abstract_narration": "Microseisms are very small displacements (micrometers) of the Earth's solid surface that have been detected since that advent of seismometers, but the source of these vibrations was a mystery to scientists until about 60 years ago, when it began to become clear that they are largely generated by ocean waves. There are two main ways that ocean waves can generate microseism energy: 1) the interaction between waves traveling in different directions in the open ocean (secondary microseisms), and 2) the interaction of waves with the seafloor in shallow areas near the coast (primary microseisms). We presently have a good understanding of secondary microseisms, but the generation and propagation of primary microseisms is not well understood.  Recently, it has been discovered that several large lakes around the world also produce microseism energy, including Yellowstone Lake in Yellowstone National Park. Yellowstone Lake provides a unique opportunity to study microseisms because, unlike the large oceans, it is relatively small and can be completely surrounded by seismic instruments, which gives us the opportunity to pinpoint the locations where microseisms are being generated and to study how they propagate into the surrounding regions. Our project will take advantage of the ongoing HD-YLAKE project, which deployed an array of seismometers on the floor of Yellowstone Lake, by supplementing those instruments with arrays of seismometers on the lake's perimeter and islands. In addition, we will also deploy instruments to simultaneously measure key atmospheric information (air temperature, pressure, wind speed, and wind direction) and the lake waves (amplitude, period, and direction) while the seismometers are recording. This combination of atmospheric, wave, and seismic data has never been collected in one place before, and it will provide an unprecedented opportunity to understand the processes that generate microseisms. Our results will have broad implications for the study of microseisms, and ultimately, we want to develop the ability to use these naturally occurring seismic waves to image the Earth's structure. This is an exciting possibility in Yellowstone Lake, because it hosts active hydrothermal systems that are believed to create large gas pockets in the lake floor sediments, and the microseism propagation velocity should be very sensitive to the presence of gas. As a broader impact, the investigators will work with Yellowstone Park educators to make their results accessible to the wider public through their exhibits.\r\n\r\nTechnical Summary:  It has recently been found that many lakes generate observable microseisms at periods near 1 s.  Observations from land-based seismometers deployed near lakes show that the microseisms propagate as short-period Rayleigh waves (Rg), often with prograde particle motion because of the low velocity of lake sediments. However, it is unknown if the source process is linear, corresponding to primary ocean microseisms, or non-linear, corresponding to secondary ocean microseisms, or both. It is also unknown whether the source regions are predominantly in the open water or near the shoreline, and how the microseismic wavefield evolves as it crosses the shoreline. Yellowstone Lake is an excellent natural laboratory for understanding shallow water microseisms because (1) there are no potentially confounding swells from distant storms, as there are in the oceans, (2) the source region is geographically small and can essentially be surrounded with seismometers, and (3) the Yellowstone Lake microseisms are a regular, repeatable phenomenon associated with diurnal wind variation during the summer and fall. An understanding of the source mechanism of Yellowstone Lake microseisms will likely be applicable to other shallow water regions around the world and could lead to improved imaging of very shallow Earth structure. The proposed work involves a monthlong deployment of (1) 40 three-component, autonomous, 5-Hz geophones around the perimeter of Yellowstone Lake and on islands within the lake, (2) four weather stations collocated with selected geophones, and (3) two wave-height recorders in the northern portion of the Yellowstone Lake. The deployment is planned for the summer of 2018 so that it can overlap with the ongoing, NSF-funded, HDYLAKE experiment, which deployed an array of 10 lake-bottom seismometers around an active hydrothermal site. The PIs and a graduate student will analyze the interdisciplinary data set in an effort to determine the origin and generation mechanism of the short-period (~1 sec) microseisms that were recently observed to originate from Yellowstone Lake during periods of open water.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nMicroseisms, which are continuous oscillations of the Earth\u2019s surface not caused by earthquakes or anthropogenic sources at periods of ~3-20 seconds have been observed for centuries but scientists are still puzzled at the processes that generate them.  Because most microseism energy is generated in the oceans, it is difficult, and costly, to deploy instrumentation close to the source to record the relevant data to characterize the generation process.  Recently it has been documented that various lakes of the world create their own microseism energy, mostly in the one second period range, regardless of their size.  These lakes provide an ideal opportunity to deploy instrumentation to better record data to characterize the generation of microseism energy.  In this study, we deployed 40 seismometers, 4 weather stations, and 2 wave gauges to record data related to all the processes involved in the generation of lake-induced microseisms.  In addition, we took advantage of 10 lake bottom seismometers that were previously deployed on the floor of Yellowstone Lake as part of the NSF-funded HDYLAKE project.  The main goal of this experiment was to constrain all the relevant processes involved in the generation of shallow-water microseisms (wind -&gt; waves -&gt; bathymetry -&gt; microseisms) for the first time, and thereby provide rigorous constraints on their origin, generation, and evolution.\n\nResults show that both double-frequency, and single-frequency microseisms are generated on Yellowstone Lake.  However, the most dominant microseism energy is from the double-frequency microseism in the ~0.8-1.2 second period range.  The double-frequency microseism in Yellowstone Lake is primarily generated from the interference between wind-driven incident and shoreline-reflected waves in the main basin of the lake.  The lake-bottom seismometers recorded the strongest microseism energy followed by the land-based seismometers on the lake\u2019s islands and it\u2019s northern and eastern shorelines.  This makes sense given that the dominant wind direction is out of the southwest.  The microseism is generated daily as winds pick up during the daytime hours.  Dominant double-frequency microseism energy in the ~0.8-1.2 second period range matches well with the recorded dominant wave periods of ~1.5-2.5 seconds observed on Yellowstone Lake.  We suggest that the smaller periods of lake-generated microseisms compared to ocean-generated microseisms is due to the limited size (fetch) of lakes limiting the size and period of the waves generated on lakes.\n\nIn addition to the dominant double-frequency microseism generated on Yellowstone Lake, we also observe single-frequency microseisms on a handful of stations primarily on the northern and eastern shoreline in the ~1.5-2.5 second period range, again matching the recorded wave periods on the lake.  The single-frequency microseism is primarily generated by direct interaction between the waves and the northern and eastern shorelines.\n\nResults from this project have allowed us to better characterize the generation of microseism energy in Yellowstone Lake, which can be used to better understand ocean-generated microseism energy, which is widely used to image the subsurface of the Earth.  In future studies, microseism energy produced on Yellowstone Lake, and perhaps other large lakes in the Yellowstone region, can be used to image the shallow subsurface beneath the lake, which has some of the largest hydrothermal eruption craters in the world and a large active hydrothermal system on the lake floor.\n\nTwo undergraduate students were able to be involved in the field deployment portion of this experiment and gained valuable experience in the process of deploying geophysical equipment and how to design an array based on a scientific hypothesis.  Two graduate students were partially funded to work on this project and were mentored in data analysis and dissemination related to this project.  In addition, the results of this project have been shared with Yellowstone National Park and is used in annual training for interpretive staff so they can use these results educate the over 4 million annual visitors to Yellowstone National Park with the latest research results.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/14/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jamie M Farrell"
