 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this Education and Human Resources Core Research project is to better understand how technology-based learning environments impact students' scientific literacy. The project will address the need to equip students with the skills to read and interpret scientific texts in a manner that facilitates solving real-world scientific problems. The learning environment will deliver \"missions\" related to three essential curricular units pertinent to 5th grade built in a framework potentially scalable for the comprehensive grade curriculum. Through a pedagogical agent, Monty, and a cast of interactive characters, the program will impact scientific literacy with informational texts to improve science conceptual knowledge, comprehension-monitoring skills, and argumentation, encourage mastery and growth mindset approaches, and increase self-efficacy and interest with science topics more broadly. The project will also test the efficacy for students to transfer what they have learned outside of the game on project-based classroom activities. A highly diverse sample of students will participate that includes large numbers of minority, international, ESL (English as a Second Language) status, and economically disadvantaged students. The resulting system will be accessible and inclusive for all learners as a pedagogical tool to enhance traditional classroom instruction that includes a teacher dashboard for monitoring and assessment purposes. \r\n\r\nTwo primary programmatic goals include: 1) to design, develop, and iteratively refine the learning environment for 5th grade students that improves comprehension monitoring and supports science learning and 2) to increase current theoretical and practical understanding of how elementary students engage with and monitor their comprehension of informational science texts. The program will function within a self-regulated learning framework and include three key curricular units (ecosystems, Earth and human activity, from molecules to organisms) that align with Next Generation Science Standards. A systematic program of studies will be conducted starting from design-based studies in Years 1 & 2 to test digital strategy tools and game-based elements followed by experimental studies in Years 2 & 3 to examine the influence of both embedded comprehension monitoring tools and adaptive scaffolding. A mixed method measurement approach will be adopted along with an iterative program development model. Measures of content learning, metacognitive monitoring, transfer, and motivational and affect variables (e.g. self-efficacy, interest) will be targeted to inform the literature. Design studies will further examine the impact of the environment with regard to ethnicity, gender, socioeconomic status, ESL status, prior gaming experience, and achievement levels.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This transition brings about great challenges for students and teachers alike as high levels of engagement and effective comprehension skills are required. This academic phase impacts students ability to critically consume science texts and ultimately the degree to which one becomes a scientifically literate citizen with the potential to effectively navigate real-world scientific challenges. Recognizing that a growing body of research is revealing the potential of educational games to influence science learning, this project focused on the development of Missions with Monty, a narrative-centered, game-based learning environment aimed at improving 5th graders' science literacy. Borrowing from successful reading instruction programs in traditional classrooms, we emphasized metacognitive strategies to improve comprehension skills but did so within the digital gamified environment. Metacognitive strategies highlight 'when and why' conditional knowledge for applying reading strategies and also how to regulate the use of such strategies to improve comprehension. We posited that these strategies could be more effectively taught within an engaging environment wherein students are offered immediate feedback.Therefore, the major goals of the project included 1)the development and deployment of the Missions with Monty program in schools, 2)experiments to test the efficacy of embedded comprehension tools,and 3)experiments to test customized scaffolds that adapt to individual students.<br />Our interdisciplinary research team was split between North Carolina State University and The Pennsylvania State University and included educational psychologists, computer scientists, and designers. In addition, a group of five teachers, selected from participating schools to form a Lead Teacher Cadre, provided our team with critical feedback at each step in the development of the program. Missions with Monty presents an animal-themed fictional narrative wherein the player enters the game to begin collaboration with the well-known adventure scientist Monty, a monitor lizard, who started Wildlife University. Unfortunately, upon arrival at Wildlife University, the player learns that the University has been shut down because students and faculty are getting sick and also that Monty has disappeared. Thus, players are challenged to determine the cause of the sickness to save Wildlife University and also tasked with finding Monty. This can only be done by engaging in a series of missions across rainforest, savanna, and ocean contexts to learn from various animal researchers. The program emphasizes three key curricular units(ecosystems,Earth and human activity,from molecules to organisms)that align with Next Generation Science Standards. Classrooms typically integrated the use of Missions with Monty within their instruction two to three times per week across approximately five weeks.<br />During the project 26 different schools and approximately 2500 students in North Carolina participated. A number of challenges were faced including COVID-19, limited teacher time, programming challenges, and technical limitations for school connectivity. Despite these challenges a series of studies revealed Missions with Monty to be effective at increasing science literacy. First, the team developed all science texts and gamified assessments used in the program and conducted a validation study of these with participating schools. Second, across multiple investigations students who played Missions with Monty showed significant gains in science content knowledge. Third,when matched with a computer-based learning environment that lacked gamified elements students who played Missions with Monty had significantly higher reading comprehension scores and reading motivation. Fourth, significant improvements were found in students' ability to accurately judge their science knowledge after playing Missions with Monty. Fifth, in-game science knowledge gains predicted knowledge transfer above and beyond science prior knowledge on a dilemma-based set of science problems outside the game-based learning environment. Updates to Missions with Monty are continuing with efforts to add additional modules and functionality.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/01/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: John&nbsp;L&nbsp;Nietfeld</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1761110/1761110_10543757_1695669271207_BannerWithMonty01--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1761110/1761110_10543757_1695669271207_BannerWithMonty01--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Missions with Monty banner\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1761110/1761110_10543757_1695669271207_BannerWithMonty01--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Missions with Monty banner\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Missions with Monty characters</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">NC State research team</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">John&nbsp;L&nbsp;Nietfeld</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Missions with Monty banner</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1761110/1761110_10543757_1695670844706_Typesoforganisms--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1761110/1761110_10543757_1695670844706_Typesoforganisms--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Text environment\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1761110/1761110_10543757_1695670844706_Typesoforganisms--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Text environment\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Text environment for Missions with Monty</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">NC State research team</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">John&nbsp;L&nbsp;Nietfeld</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Text environment</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1761110/1761110_10543757_1695670978853_Stefan_Narrative--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1761110/1761110_10543757_1695670978853_Stefan_Narrative--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Mission screen\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1761110/1761110_10543757_1695670978853_Stefan_Narrative--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Mission screen\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Mission screen for rainforest</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">NC State research team</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">John&nbsp;L&nbsp;Nietfeld</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Mission screen</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1761110/1761110_10543757_1695671035760_Doug_Summarychallenge--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1761110/1761110_10543757_1695671035760_Doug_Summarychallenge--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Summary Challenge\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1761110/1761110_10543757_1695671035760_Doug_Summarychallenge--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Summary Challenge\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Missions with Monty summary challenge</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">NC State research team</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">John&nbsp;L&nbsp;Nietfeld</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Summary Challenge</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1761110/1761110_10543757_1695671119185_Detectiveboard--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1761110/1761110_10543757_1695671119185_Detectiveboard--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Detective Board\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1761110/1761110_10543757_1695671119185_Detectiveboard--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Detective Board\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Detective board for Missions with Monty</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">NC State research team</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">John&nbsp;L&nbsp;Nietfeld</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Detective Board</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
