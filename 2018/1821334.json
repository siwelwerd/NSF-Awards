 "awd_abstract_narration": "Complex fluids are mixtures of homogeneous fluids and deformable or rigid particles or fibers. These fluids are ubiquitous in biological systems and engineering applications and accurate prediction of their behavior is important for a broad set of problems such as hemodynamics modeling, simulation of intracellular processes, and microfluidics device modeling. Currently, accurate models of complex fluids require highly expensive simulations at microscopic or mesoscopic level, resolving the behavior of each particle (e.g., a deforming cell or fiber) and their interactions.  In contrast, macroscopic continuum models for complex fluids (when available) allow for a far more efficient computation. However, these models often lack accuracy, and cannot capture all important aspects of the flow behavior in realistic settings; hindering construction of fast predictive models. The goal of the project is to enable construction of such models in a data-driven way. \r\n\r\nThe investigators will develop a framework based on microscopic numerical simulations.  The challenge in developing efficient and accurate continuum computational models of such fluids is the hard-to-analyze transition from microscopic to macroscopic parameters. In this work, the investigators focus on (1) robust and scalable solvers for particulate flow in 2D and 3D; and (2) the utilization of our framework to explore data-driven macroscopic models for the complex flows in 2D, with an initial exploration of extensions to 3D.  The team will develop the algorithms for accurate solution of large-scale 3D flows with a high volume fraction of immersed deformable particles handling viscosity contrast, complex geometric boundaries, and long simulation times.  Key mathematical components for this include boundary integral formulation and computation, kernel-independent quadrature schemes for singular and near-singular integration on surfaces in 3D, contact handling and close interaction, and improving efficiency of time-stepping schemes. In the second component of the project, the investigators will apply this framework to explore macroscopic characteristics of complex flows and their dependence on microscopic parameters and local geometry; this will create a foundation for data-driven continuum models for complex fluids.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe key overall outcome of the project was a scalable, large-scale solver for small-scale flows of deformable particles (cells)  confined in complex boundaries.  An important example of such flows is the flow of blood cells through small blood vessels; other examples are flows inside cells, or flows in microfluidics devices containing either cells or artificial vesicles, commonly appearing in a broad range of applications. \n\n Computational modeling of such flows is potentially useful in a number of contexts: e..g, one can infer microscopic properties of cells, such as stiffness of walls, from simulating macroscopic behavior of such flows and comparing it to experimental observations.  One can also use these simulation as a part of engineering design pipelines for microfluiding design.\n\nThe main research challenge of such simulations is that in realistic situations, the number of  particles can be extremely large: e.g., one drop  of blood (several microliters) may have tens of millions of cells in it.  As each cell may undergo fairly complex deformations requiring a sufficiently precise and expensive computational model,  the overall scale of a complete simulation is extremely large.  Additionally, one needs to simulate the motion of particles for long distances to understand the behavior of the flow. \n\nWhile we have demonstrated the possibility of such simulations in previous work, a few key technical components  to support such large-scale long-duration simulations were missing.  In the course of this project we added the following essential components: \n\n Our system now can handle complex boundaries such as blood vessel walls, both as a boundary constraint for the fluid flow, as well as a confinement for cells. \n This required adding a new accurate and fully parallel solver for boundary integral equations describing the fluid flow, building on our previous work in this domain, but introducing many new features, in particular full parallelism allowing it to use machines with tens and even hundreds of thousands of processors efficiently. \nA critical component of our system is contact handling; in fact,  for highly dense suspensions of  particles, contact may dominate the computational cost.  Moreover, ability to run long-duration simulations depends on robustness and accuracy of contact handling. We have developed a set of new algorithms for contact, significantly improving on the state of the art in this area. and releasing the latest code as open-source.  In the context of our system, we developed highly scalable parallel form of these algorithms. \nSolving for microscopic properties based on macroscopic behavior requires efficient estimation of how much the flow changes if a microscopic parameter changes (\"sensitivity  analysis\")  We worked on making this possible for  our collision model and algorithm.\n\n\nThe latter part of the work also has broader applications, e.g., in optimal shape design, increasingly used in a variety of engineering applications,  which we also explored as a part of this project. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/15/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Denis Zorin"
