 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports research to overcome a challenge of mutual exclusiveness of the crystalline quality and lateral size in the manufacture of two-dimensional materials. Two-dimensional materials are atomically thin films with properties that can revolutionize low-power electronics, biological detection, multi-functional composites and energy storage applications that promise important benefits for the US society and economy. The roadblock to these applications is that, when grown in large size, the two-dimensional material's crystallinity is poor and conventional heat treatment does not improve the crystallinity because the materials are typically resistant to high temperatures. This award enables the investigation of a fundamentally different approach, where a two-dimensional material is grown over a large area with initially low quality, which is then greatly improved through the combination of electrical and mechanical treatments. This is a multi-disciplinary approach, which trains the graduate students in cutting edge aspects of nanomanufacturing, materials science and mechanical engineering. The project involves undergraduate, women and under-represented minority students in research to better train the diverse work force of the future.\r\n\r\nThis award investigates the manufacture of atomically thin two-dimensional (2D) materials over large areas by atomic layer or pulsed layer deposition. The as-grown nanosteets are usually of low crystallinity. The crystallinity is enhanced with a combination of electron wind force and mechanical stress. The electrons transfer their momentum at the defects and grain boundaries to impart unprecedented atomic/defect mobility at lower temperatures. The role of mechanical stress is to accelerate the electrical annealing. The hypothesis is that the stress field around the defect can intensify the local strain energy, which is a driving force for crystallization and grain growth. Computational models, based on reactive empirical bond-order potential with the electron wind force imparted to individual atoms, are developed to guide the experimental research. Experiments are performed inside the transmission electron microscope to understand the synthesis of ultra-thin films and electro-mechanical annealing. The in-situ microscopy reveals the transformation from a low quality amorphous phase to a highly crystalline state. The research demonstrates that high crystallinity 2D atomic layer materials can be achieved by a novel electrical and mechanical treatment instead of conventional heat treatment. The research also investigates scaling up of this technique by wafer-scale synthesis on a substrate coated for high residual stress followed by electrical annealing.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

These special class of materials are called two-dimensional (2D) materials and they possess excellent electrical, optical, mechanical etc. properties that cannot be expected in their bulk counterparts. The projects main focus was to resolve a challenge called the mutual exclusiveness of size and quality. This is a roadblock for the technology adaptation for this next generation class of materials; highest quality is achieved only on small, microscale crystals, whereas very large scale materials show low quality (in terms of crystallinity and uniformity of the number of layers). Currently, high quality 2D materials are extremely small (&lt;0.001 mm<sup>2</sup>) and/or non-uniform (with either overlap or gap) crystals synthesized at 800-1000 degrees Celsius. This is shown by circle 1 in Figure 1. The other extreme is shown by circle 2, where the 2D material can be large-area and uniform layers, but with very poor crystallinity.</p>\n<p>The intellectual accomplishment of this project is a two-step transformative path that leads to very high-quality materials with very large area coverage as well as layer/thickness uniformity. The nanomanufacturing process intentionally starts with low temperature manufacturing of two-dimensional materials. The outcome is large and uniform material but of low quality. Figure 2 shows representative results for a high impact opto-electronic materials (Molybdenum di-suphide). In the second step, the quality is enhanced with a unique process that send very sharp (tens of micro seconds) current pulses in the material. This is shown in Figure 3. The sharp current pulses create very high energy electrons that collide with any defects in the material. In this process, the defects absorb the energy and it can move in the materials and eventually escape to the surface.

This is transformative science because it is in sharp contrast to conventional annealing that takes high temperatures (400-1000 degrees Celsius; depending on materials). Thus, it allows materials systems such as two-dimensional materials on polymer that would never been possible. a novel driving force for recrystallization that does not depend on temperature. The biggest impact on the society is due to all-electric operation, which (in absence of high temperature) is very energy efficient. Thus, the impact on energy efficiency and carbon footprint can be tremendous.</p>\n<p>The process developed in this project is extremely fast, requiring only few minutes compared to few hours needed by current art.
