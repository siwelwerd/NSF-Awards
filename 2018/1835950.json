 "awd_abstract_narration": "The study of geology requires diagrams to represent the extreme spatial and temporal scales of most geologic structures and processes, yet diagrams can be the source of student misconceptions. Recent advancements in web-based technology have resulted in classroom tools that allow students to click directly on a diagram in response to an instructor's question. Instructors can then display a heat map of the diagram that shows the frequency of students' responses and use this feedback to guide instruction. The principle investigators of this proposal have pilot tested this technique and found that click-on-diagram questions reveal spatial misconceptions that are not documented in the geoscience education literature. The goals of this project are to: (1) Combine click-on-diagram questions with qualitative methods to validate the existence of novel spatial misconceptions; (2) Contrast the learning from multiple choice and open-ended click-on-diagram questions; and (3) Train instructors to develop click-on-diagram questions that can improve students' spatial understanding in geology.\r\n\r\nThis project aims to improve STEM learning by building evidence about improved STEM instructional practices and by implementing and testing approaches to improve adoption of education research into teaching practice. The work will focus on geology courses, but improved understanding of student misconceptions about diagrams and charts is applicable to most, if not all STEM fields. A classroom study will test two learning mechanisms identified in the education research literature: spatial feedback and cued versus open retrieval. In addition to its education research activities, the project also aims to foster widespread use of evidence-based resources and pedagogies in undergraduate STEM classrooms. To this end, a faculty workshop will help instructors develop questions that assess documented geology misconceptions and that explore conceptual challenges that instructors have observed in their own classrooms. A workshop deliverable will be design recommendations for how to change existing classroom questions into effective click-on-diagram questions. The questions developed in this project will be hosted for open access on the STEM Education Resources Center Pedagogy in Action webpage.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\n\nThe purpose of this project was to develop a tool to increase student engagement and measure learning gains in geoscience classrooms. Diagram-based questions, we called GeoClick questions, engage students in clicking on a diagram to demonstrate their understanding of geologic concepts. The Geoclick questions offer insights about students spatial conceptions that would be hard to gather with traditional verbal measures. Such information is valuable for researchers working to characterize students mental models of Earth processes and for instructors who can target instruction to correcting spatial errors.\n\n\n\n\nWe investigated undergraduate non-science majors understanding of surface and groundwater processes because these topics are essential for science literacy. Data were collected with four universities and with over 1000 undergraduate non-science majors. We found that students do not have a good understanding of how erosion and deposition occurs in river systems. For example, in Diagram 1 the red areas represent places where most students clicked when asked, Click where you expect to find the greatest rate of erosion. Students selected both the inside (incorrect) and outside (correct) of the river bend. We also learned that students do not know that water flows laterally (i.e., across the land underground) in addition to flowing down due to gravity (i.e., deeper underground). The majority of students interviewed for this study drew contamination spreading evenly from a leaking septic tank (Diagram 2). The correct answer includes both gravity (downward movement of water) and underground flow due to topography (to the right, away from the tank). These topics are important because they can determine how citizens judge proposals for land-use in their communities and the risk of natural and pollution-driven hazards. Based on our findings, we have identified the need for a better understanding of water flow among non-science majors.\n\n\n\n\nThis project provided essential training for developing researchers and undergraduate instructors. Three undergraduate researchers, two graduate researchers, and one post-graduate researcher learned how to design, collect, and analyze classroom and interview data to investigate research questions. The work was published in peer-reviewed journals so that other researchers can build upon our results. Through conference presentations at regional and national conferences, publications, a workshop and the NAGT Teach the Earth website, this project provided instructors with an approach for using GeoClick questions in their classroom to better understand their students pre-existing ideas about geologic processes. The questions developed for the research study and example questions generated by the 36 instructors in the workshop are now permanently hosted in the NAGT Teach the Earth website and available for future instructors to use in their classes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/30/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: NicoleLadue\n"
