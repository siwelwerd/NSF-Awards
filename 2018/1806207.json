 "awd_abstract_narration": "A great deal can be learned about the extremes of strong gravity, about denser-than-nuclei matter, and even about the origin of heavy elements by studying the collisions of neutron stars with each other or with black holes.  One such merger of two neutron stars has recently been observed in gravitational waves and across the electromagnetic spectrum.  Astronomers now know that such events happen and that they release tremendous amounts of radiation and material, but exactly how this release happens in a merger aftermath remains unclear. Numerical simulations that include general relativity are the only way to predict how merger processes unfold, but these simulations are made incredibly difficult by the presence of turbulence, which creates fluid flow and magnetic field features across a wide range of length scales.  Small-scale flows do drive changes in the merger remnant at large scales and so cannot be ignored.  Although computer simulations cannot yet directly capture all of this dynamics, a great deal can be learned with current computing capabilities by parameterized exploration of unresolved small-scale effects and post-merger initial states.  This project will pursue these strategies to shed light on how these exotic and violent events produce their outflows and radiation.  Carrying out these simulations will involve training both graduate and undergraduate students on techniques of computer modeling in relativistic astrophysics. The resulting gravitational wave and nuclear debris data will be made available to all astronomers working to detect and characterize these events.\r\n\r\nThe Washington State University will study three core problems of numerical relativity--inspiraling binaries, differentially rotating neutron stars, and hyperaccreting black holes--using the Spectral Einstein Code (SpEC), a high-accuracy numerical relativity code that includes magnetohydrodynamics, nuclear microphysics, and neutrino transport.  Inspiral simulations will study equation of state effects on gravitational waves, and improvements to evolution algorithms and smooth, causal equation of state parameterizations will be explored.  Post-merger dynamics of NSNS systems will be modeled, focusing on the case of a hypermassive neutron star remnant.  Simulations will track the secular evolution to collapse under the influence of neutrino radiation, large-scale magnetic fields, and subgrid-scale turbulence.  Finally, neutrino effects around black hole-torus systems will be analyzed using neutrino transport methods.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe spiraling together and merger of two compact objects--meaning two black holes, two neutron stars, or one of each--is a rare but incredibly energetic event; the LIGO gravitational wave observatory has now detected all three of the above types of event!  In addition to creating gravitational waves, neutron star-neutron star and black hole-neutron star mergers can create electromagnetic (light, infrared, ultraviolet, etc) signals detectable from Earth.  They may also play a role in the creation of heavy elements not created by the big bang or regular stars.  NSF funds not only LIGO itself but also theoretical studies like this one which try to model these violent events; models help interpret observed gravitational waveforms and electromagnetic counterparts.\n\nThis project in particular concerned itself with what happens after black holes and neutron stars collide.  Modeling this post-merger evolution is particulartly challenging both because of all the complicated physics involved--hot nuclear matter, turbulent fluid flows, magnetic fields, and neutrino radiation--and because of the long timescales involved--it takes several seconds for the post-merger evolution to play out, while most merger simulations only go about a hundredth of that time.  The tool used was the Spectral Einstein Code (SpEC), which has already had much success in evolving mergers.  Most of the effort of the PI and students was devoted to improving SpEC's treatment of the relevant physics and to enabling it to efficiently evolve nearly symmetric systems for long times.  Evolution of neutrino radiation fields and treatment of low-density regions were significantly improved.  Models of momentum transport by small-scale turbulence were implemented, studied, and compared.  SpEC was given the ability to evolve in two dimensions systems with an axis of symmetry.  Combining the improvements, by the end of the project, a black hole-neutron star system was successfully evolved for a few seconds after merger, long enough to see the neutrino emission go dim and for matter to be ejected into space by an accretion disk wind.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/02/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Matthew D Duez"
