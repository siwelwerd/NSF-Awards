 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Discovery Research preK-12 program (DRK-12) seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools. Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects. This project will develop and test the impact of heredity and evolution curriculum units for middle school grades that are aligned with the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS). The project will advance science teaching by investigating the ways in which two curriculum units can be designed to incorporate science and engineering practices, cross-cutting concepts, and disciplinary core ideas, the three dimensions of science learning described by the NGSS. The project will also develop resources to support teachers in implementation of the new modules. The planned research will also examine whether student understanding of evolution depends on the length and time of exposure to learning about heredity prior to learning about evolution. \r\n\r\nThis Early Stage Design and Development project will develop two new 3-week middle school curriculum units, with one focusing on heredity and the other focusing on evolution. The units will include embedded formative and summative assessment measures and online teacher support materials. These units will be developed as part of a curriculum learning progression that will eventually span the elementary grades through high school. This curriculum learning progression will integrate heredity, evolution, data analysis, construction of scientific explanations, evidence-based argumentation, pattern recognition, and inferring cause and effect relationships. To inform development and iterative revisions of the units, the project will conduct nation-wide beta and pilot tests, selecting schools with broad ranges of student demographics and geographical locations. The project will include three rounds of testing and revision of both the student curriculum and teacher materials. The project will also investigate student understanding of evolution in terms of how their understanding is impacted by conceptual understanding of heredity. The research to be conducted by this project is organized around three broad research questions: (a) In what ways can two curriculum units be designed to incorporate the three dimensions of science learning and educative teacher supports to guide students' conceptual understanding of heredity and evolution? (b) To what extent does student understanding of evolution depend on the length and timing of heredity lessons that preceded an evolution unit? And (c) In what ways do students learn heredity and evolution?\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The 4-5 week <em>Genes, Traits, and Change over Time</em> unit focuses on the mechanisms that drive genetic variation and how natural selection makes certain trait variations more common in a group. Each of the unit&rsquo;s four modules (Traits; Inheritance; Reproductive Success; and Natural Selection) is structured around a guiding question and incorporates visually-rich, interactive multimedia and videos that use a consistent visual language to support student understanding. Paper-based activities provide scaffolded experience in analyzing data from published scientific studies, working with models, writing explanations, and identifying cause and effect relationships. Comprehensive materials for teachers provide guidance for carrying out the lessons.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>We conducted a classroom pilot test to evaluate the new unit&rsquo;s promise for student learning and to gain teachers&rsquo; perspective on its classroom usability and educational value. We first iteratively developed and carried out validation processes that resulted in a 30-item, multiple-choice test. The 14 teachers who participated in the pilot test teach in urban, suburban and rural schools across the US with high numbers of students from backgrounds underrepresented in science. Students took the test before and at the end of the unit. Students made significant learning gains (<em>p</em> &lt; 0.001) for each of the four modules and for the unit as a whole. On average, they answered 62% of the questions correctly after the unit. However, 184 students (19.7%) received a score of 80% or higher, with three scoring 100%. Thus, it was possible for students to learn enough from the curriculum materials to earn a perfect score.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;The pilot test teachers completed a post-unit survey. Many praised the unit&rsquo;s activities, for example: <em>&ldquo;Students loved the interactives &ndash; many commented to me that they went back and played with them outside of class. They also enjoyed working in small groups to discuss and debate the evidence as we moved through the activities. The students made sense of the concepts through discussion with peers (and a little guidance from me).&rdquo; </em>Half of the teachers (7) reported that the unit was better than other materials they have used in the past to teach similar content, for example: <em>&ldquo;This unit has a more effective progression of concepts. It also does a fantastic job of addressing misconceptions.&rdquo;</em> The other teachers said some parts of the unit were as good as or better than other materials but some parts were not as good. Eleven teachers plan to use the full unit again while three will use selected activities.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>To explore how students integrate heredity and evolution concepts, we conducted interviews with 21 pairs of students who had participated in the pilot test. In one task, students were presented with data from a research study on guppies and asked to explain variation in the guppies&rsquo; coloration. They were able to generate hypotheses based on the information provided as well as construct explanations about how heredity and change over time were likely to operate in the guppy pools. In a second task, students reviewed and explained their work from the unit&rsquo;s culminating activity, <em>MythUnderstood</em>, which integrates four key scientific ideas involved in explaining change over time. While most students were able to provide clear evidence for the conclusions they drew from the activity, the quality of their explanations varied and only 25% of the groups discussed all four science ideas. Even if they did not give a full explanation, students&rsquo; responses showed that their thinking had moved away from the wide-spread misconception that organisms can change their traits at will in response to environmental conditions.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The<em> Genes, Traits, and Change over Time</em> curriculum unit is freely available online. Teacher materials, available at <a href=\"https://teach.genetics.utah.edu/content/change/\">https://teach.genetics.utah.edu/content/change/</a>, including instructions and implementation suggestions for each lesson, downloadable PDF&rsquo;s and graphics for paper-based lessons, NGSS connections, and an eLearning module that prepares them to teach the unit.
