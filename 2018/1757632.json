 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research Experiences for Undergraduates site will enable 10 undergraduates each year to conduct hands-on research in the field of smart environments for a period of 10 weeks each summer. Research participants from a wide variety of institutions and demographic backgrounds will explore the links between multiple applications including artificial intelligence, machine learning, data mining, high-performance computing, pervasive computing, networking, distributed systems, health, medicine, psychology, gerontechnology, and energy sustainability. Within this context, participants will gain an appreciation for how to collect large amounts of data from these environments, analyze the data for new knowledge, and take actions to effect changes in the environments in order to improve health, security, efficiency and sustainability. \r\n\r\nThis REU site facilitates research and training in multiple complementary disciplines including computer science, electrical engineering, psychology, and health care. The team partners with other REU programs on campus, and participants will interact regularly with other REU students from around the country, with faculty from multiple REU programs, and with graduate students from the related ongoing research programs in smart environments. The program will enable interdisciplinary research that links design of technology with health-based sustainable energy applications, and creates new opportunities for undergraduates to study health, energy and human behavior using the technology. Results of this program, including descriptions of student projects, lessons learned, and quantitative and qualitative feedback, will be disseminated via the program website. This program will also make a contribution to a generation whose workforce is trained in multiple, complementary disciplines. Finally, our planned recruitment effort and strong mentoring component will spread knowledge of the benefits of the REU program among the targeted populations, resulting in broadening participation in engineering and related disciplines.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

A smart environment is one in which we deploy sensors, collect and analyze data, and take action to improve performance. Smart environments range from farms, cities, buildings, homes, even to our own bodies (see graphic). Our REU program facilitated research and training in the complementary disciplines of computer science, electrical engineering, psychology, and health care. Because we partnered with other REU programs on campus, students regularly interacted with other REU students from around the country, with faculty from ours and other REU programs, and with graduate students from the related ongoing research programs in smart environments.</p>\n<p>In terms of intellectual merit, this REU site enabled high-quality, interdisciplinary research that links computer science, electrical engineering, and psychology, and provided new opportunities for undergraduates to study how these disciplines can be applied to making environments smarter.&nbsp; Students are not only exposed to research environments and techniques, but they also learn to work with students and faculty in other fields. Knowledge from computer science and electrical engineering, and from other WSU REU programs, is needed to create a smart environment, because an effective smart environment cannot be adequately designed without researching these topics in fully interactive ways. More information about each project is available on the program website (<a href=\"https://reu.eecs.wsu.edu\">https://reu.eecs.wsu.edu</a>), and includes projects in machine learning, data science, robotics, pervasive computing, high-performance computing, sensor design, wearable sensors, energy efficiency, bioinformation, cognitive neuropsychology, and healthcare. These research projects have so far resulted in eight publications including the REU students as co-authors. This interdisciplinary effort is valuable for undergraduate students to investigate ideas that have a significant impact on their community.</p>\n<p>In terms of broader impact this REU site helped to attract and retain students from primarily undergraduate institutions and from underrepresented groups, and provided a research experience designed to encourage them to pursue graduate research. Over the six years of the program, we received 734 applications and were able to fund 61 participants from 46 different institutions in 23 different states (see graphic). Of our 61 participants there were 40 males, 21 females, 37 Caucasian, 7 Hispanic/Latino, 4 African-American, 8 Asian, 1 Native-American, and 4 from other or mixed groups (see graphics). And 30 of the 61 participants have attended or plan to attend graduate school.
