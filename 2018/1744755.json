 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Southern Ocean serves as the planet's major uptake region for the oceanic uptake of increasing levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2). The current generation of coupled climate models (atmosphere-ocean-land) are used to make future climate projections, but are known to exhibit significant biases in observed ocean carbon uptake. These numerical models are known to lack the resolution (space and time) to adequately represent many of the mesoscale processes and features known to effect important roles in air-sea exchange. To account for the ocean mesoscale (10km - 100km) phenomena, such as jets, fronts, meanders and eddies known to be crucial for bio-physical interactions of CO2 fluxes, this project will progressively increase model resolution from coarse to finer grid spacing, furthering our understanding of mesoscale processes.\r\n\r\nThe study will focus on regions of interest, the austral South Pacific, and the Drake Passage. Both regions are to some extent well observed. These two regions are topographically constrained pathways constituent pathways of the Atlantic Circumpolar Current, and exhibit enhanced eddy activity. The numerical output will be compared with observations and a suite of bio-geochemical tracers will be used to examine biophysical interaction processes, occurring at fronts and eddies.\r\n\r\nThe results from the study can provide process and specific metrics and diagnostics to assess and calibrate the global climate carbon models. A Ph.D. and an undergraduate intern will be trained and gain research insight.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The key processes are hypothesized to occur around the</span>&nbsp;ocean mesoscale (10 to 100km) through its impact on the ocean mixing and the distribution of limiting nutrient, iron. Current generation of earth system models, that are used to make climate projections, lack the resolution to adequately resolve ocean mesoscale, exhibiting significant biases in the ocean carbon uptake. Mesoscale processes include many features including jets, fronts and eddies that are crucial for bio-physical interactions, air-sea CO2 exchange and the transport and storage of carbon in the interior ocean. Despite its importance our understanding is limited due to its inherent complexity where the strong seasonality and mesoscale variability act together to control the biological productivity and air-sea CO2 fluxes. In particular this project addressed scientific questions through the development of three dimensional, high resolution model that takes advantage of high performance computing facility at NSF-supported Cheyenne supercomputer at National Center for Atmospheric Research. The results include much improved simulation of ocean carbon cycle on the timescale of months to years. The results from this project are published in 4 peer-review publications. These publication described detailed procedure for model development, calibration and validation with observational data. As shown in the image of surface ocean pCO2, the result from this model accurately replicates the seasonal and year-to-year variation of observed pCO2 in the Southern Ocean.&nbsp;The validated model output was used to better quantify the regional carbon budget, and were used to better understand the role of circulation and biological processes to regulate the regional ocea carbon uptake. We also purposefully modified the model to suppress the effect of ocean eddies to evaluate the role of mesoscale ocean eddy processes. This project also helped to educate two new PhD scientists and undergraduate students at Georgia Tech. Furthermore, this project also helped the public presentation of oceanic phenomena at Atlanta Science Festival by the team from Georgia Tech.&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 08/20/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Takamitsu&nbsp;Ito</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1744755/1744755_10540096_1661013814510_ScreenShot2022-08-20at12.42.50--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1744755/1744755_10540096_1661013814510_ScreenShot2022-08-20at12.42.50--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"3D distribution of temperature in the Drake Passage domain\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1744755/1744755_10540096_1661013814510_ScreenShot2022-08-20at12.42.50--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"3D distribution of temperature in the Drake Passage domain\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">This is a model output of temperature taken as a snapshot from Year 2010.
