 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will contribute to a detailed understanding of a mysterious plasma process called magnetic reconnection, a process behind explosive events in space including solar flares and so-called geomagnetic storms that drive space weather.  It occurs where a magnetic field embedded in a superheated (ionized) gas, a plasma, changes directions and rapidly releases large amounts of energy into the plasma.  The project will also contribute to understanding of plasma turbulence, where energy injected at large scales cascades down to small dissipation scales.  This project will pursue a systematic approach to determining where dissipation occurs in plasmas.  The approach is to develop the tools to apply the concept of entropy, known since the late 19th century, to this modern problem where it has been underutilized.  This project has the capability to be truly transformative to the field of geospace sciences since it will provide the infrastructure for using entropy as a diagnostic for dissipation which should be useful in many subareas of this field, and will be directly comparable to existing satellite measurements.  It fosters education through the support of a graduate student and a postdoctoral researcher.\r\n\r\nThe goal is to perform the first systematic study using kinetic entropy as a diagnostic for dissipation in reconnection and turbulence, and to compare the results with observational data from the Magnetospheric Multiscale space mission.  The kinetic diagnostic was recently developed for particle-in-cell (PIC) codes by the research team, so the new diagnostic will be used to assess the numerical dissipation in collisionless PIC codes and implemented into a collisional PIC code that self-consistently contains dissipation.  The two will be compared to provide strong insights into where dissipation occurs and what physical mechanism causes it.  As needed, the results will be compared directly with a new Vlasov-Maxwell solver that was recently developed by a collaborator at the Los Alamos National Laboratory.  The simulation study will be carried out on standard test problems in magnetic reconnection and turbulence.  The expected contribution of this work will be a systematic approach to study dissipation in nearly collisionless systems which can broadly be used for plasma science, and a newfound understanding of what causes irreversible dissipation in reconnection and turbulence.  This project is being supported as a part of the NSF/DOE Partnership in Basic Plasma Science and Engineering, with a collaborating effort at the Space Science Institute supported by the Department of Energy, Office of Fusion Energy Sciences.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

In plasma turbulence, energy is injected into a plasma at large scales, and self-consistently evolves to reach small scales where it is converted and dissipated. In another plasma phenomenon, called magnetic reconnection, energy at large scales is stored in the ambient magnetic field and gets eruptively released due to small scale energy conversion and dissipation. In both cases, the physical mechanism allowing the energy conversion and dissipation at small scales is well understood for plasmas for which the particles making up the plasma collide with each other at a sufficient rate, i.e., when the system is in ?local thermodynamic equilibrium? (LTE). When collisions are not important to the dynamics, the system is not in LTE, and understanding small-scale energy conversion and dissipation is a significant challenge at the forefront of plasma physics research. Understanding this kind of energy conversion is important for studies of solar flares, why the solar atmosphere (corona) is so hot, and geomagnetic storms and substorms that produce auroral light displays and the deleterious effects of space weather.</p>\n<p><br />There are multiple aspects to the intellectual merit of the results of the present study. We implemented kinetic entropy into a state-of-the-art numerical simulation tool so that it could be readily calculated. We did a parametric study of what is necessary to use for the numerical parameters in order to make sure the calculations are reliable. Then, for the first time we are aware of, we calculated two terms in a decomposition of the kinetic entropy in terms of a ?position space kinetic entropy? and a ?velocity space kinetic entropy? in a plasma system as described by simulations of magnetic reconnection. We argued that the former provides information about compressional energy conversion, while the latter describes energy conversion associated with heating. We then analyzed a metric based on kinetic entropy that had been proposed as a measure to easily determine whether a plasma is locally in LTE or not. We introduced a new related measure that has some other desirable properties, and developed an approach to use kinetic entropy to calculate how much effective dissipation is produced within a numerical simulation, which can be important for validating codes and ensuring that code output is physical.</p>\n<p><br />With this infrastructure, we tackled a major goal of the research ? to use kinetic entropy to understand energy conversion in reconnection and turbulence. In a collaborative study, a number of research groups with codes using different numerical techniques performed simulations of reconnection and turbulence, and many quantities that researchers have used to study energy conversion were calculated for each. This included scans with different collisionality to ascertain the effect of collisions. We compared and contrasted the energy conversion metrics with each other, and also identified similarities and differences between reconnection and turbulence. In particular, we found the counterintuitive result that collisions can decrease the amount of energy conversion. We then used NASA?s Magnetospheric Multiscale mission satellites to measure a reconnection event in Earth?s magnetic field (the magnetotail), and developed the ability to calculate kinetic entropy from the satellite data. We compared these results with numerical simulations of the same event, so we could confirm that the quantities being measured were reliable and therefore can be used to study energy conversion and dissipation in naturally occurring systems.</p>\n<p><br />Importantly, we recently had a breakthrough in the theory of energy conversion for systems not in LTE. We argued that the kinetic entropy contains information about all possible forms of energy in the plasma. Therefore, how the kinetic entropy evolves in time provides information about energy conversion. By subtracting off the known equilibrium terms describing compression and heating, the remaining term describes energy conversion associated with being out of LTE. This quantity is relatively easy to calculate and captures all forms of energy conversion not included in the first law of thermodynamics, which is fundamentally an equilibrium theory. We calculated the relevant terms in simulations of collisionless reconnection, showing that the local energy conversion in non-equilibrium moments can be significant and therefore should not be ignored as has been done in all previous studies. This result is very important and will likely have a significant impact on the study of energy conversion and dissipation in reconnection, turbulence, and many other plasma systems.<br /><br />For broader impacts of this project, the PI continued his successful outreach partnership with ?Spark!
