 "awd_abstract_narration": "Most estuaries have natural bends that flows must navigate around. Various studies have documented the circulation and stratification variability unique to flows of homogenous and stratified waters around bends in estuaries and rivers. However, none have attempted a systematic study in order to understand the dependence of the dynamics and impacts on a range of relevant estuarine parameters. This project will be a comprehensive study of the dynamics and regulation of flows (longitudinal and lateral) around channel bends in estuaries, the overall impact of these flows on salt transport, horizontal dispersion, and estuarine structure, and how this impact is dependent on estuarine regime. The project will engage a young audience through social media and science writing to convey the value of the physical ocean sciences. The training of a graduate research assistant and an undergraduate researcher in quantitative research is included. Several education and training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students are planned. The project will additionally enhance collaborations and partnerships with scientists and stakeholders with interests in resource management and restoration of Yaquina Bay.\r\n\r\nLateral (cross-channel) flows driven by a range of mechanisms (for example, differential advection, Coriolis forcing, asymmetric mixing, mixing over sloping bottoms) have been shown to interact strongly with the longitudinal estuarine currents, and have a fundamental impact on momentum budgets, dispersion of tracers and residence time in estuaries. This research would constitute the first systematic study of the dynamics of flows around curves in estuaries and will quantify the significance of these flows (relative to secondary flows driven by other mechanisms) and their impact on estuarine structure and function. The approach will include both idealized and realistic numerical simulations and analysis of previously collected data in estuaries that vary in channel size, curve structure and estuary regime classification.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nUnder this grant, four topics were researched related to physical oceanography of estuaries and coastal currents.Here we summarize the research accomplished under each of these topics.\n\n\n1.Cross-channel flows at estuary curves.Most estuaries have natural bends that flows must navigate around. These curves can cause cross-channel water motions that cause estuary waters, and the materials contained in those waters such as plankton and nutrients, to be stirred.Additionally, other factors such as the Earths rotation can cause cross-channel stirring motions in estuaries.In this project, we conducted a detailed analysis of the combined effects of channel curves and Earths rotation in causing cross-channel stirring motions.For this, we utilized data sets collected at different sites along the Hudson River estuary, with channel curves of different sizes.Using this data, we determined the patterns of the cross-channel stirring motions, how they differ at the different sites and how they change depending on factors such as the strength of river flow and the strength of the tides.\n\n\n2.What controls water temperature in estuaries?Over seasons, shorter time events like heat waves and storms, and with the flood and ebb of tides, temperature of estuary waters can change dramatically.These changes are controlled in large part by changes in temperature of waters entering the estuary from the river and from the ocean.Additionally, estuary water temperature can change due to heating at the water surface.We studied what controls temperature in estuaries and how these controls change with time, such as in winter when river flow is typically strong and summer when river flow is typically weak.For this research we collected long term (2 years) measurements of temperature and other parameters in a local estuary (Yaquina Bay estuary).Additionally, we developed a numerical model of the estuary to study in more detail, the head budget in the estuary.We found that, during high flow periods, river and ocean inputs are dominant controls on estuary temperature.During low flow periods, ocean input and surface heating are the dominant controls.\n\n\n3.What happens to a pulse of river water after it enters the coastal ocean?This grant supported research on the fate of a high discharge pulse of river water (for example, from an extreme storm event) after it enters the coastal ocean and forms a transient river plume.The research involved a suite of numerical model experiments to study the evolution of the river plume and its dependence on background river flow, size of the discharge pulse, and strength of coastal winds. \n\n\n4.What causes eddies in buoyant coastal currents?When river water enters the coastal ocean, it often forms a buoyant (water less dense than the adjacent ocean water) coastal current that flows along coast.But the coastal current can become unstable, forming a string large eddies along the length of the current.With support from this grant, we conducted numerical experiments and used instability theory to quantify the impacts of various factors in controlling the growth of instabilities along buoyant coastal currents.The factors studied included the steepness of the bottom slope of the coastal ocean, coastal ocean bottom friction acting on the coastal current, and the strength coastal current (referred to as ageostrophic effect).\n\n\nThe grant supported the research training and professional develop of three undergraduate students and two graduate students.Approximately 10 scientific presentations resulted from work under this grant.Additionally, three scientific journal articles based on research under this grant were published.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/01/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: JamesLerczak\n"
