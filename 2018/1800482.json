 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project, funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamic & Mechanism B Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Susan Odom of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Kentucky is developing high-oxidation-potential organic compounds to serve as electro-active components of batteries with non-aqueous electrolytes, and to develop a library of shelf-stable and organic radical cation salts for use as chemical reagents.   The research could have significant impacts on overcharge protection of high-voltage cathodes in lithium-ion batteries.  It could also lead to more efficient preparation of active components of pharmaceutical values.   This project, which bridges organic, materials, and electro-chemistry, is poised to train students in highly collaborative research. Through annual Expanding Your Horizons Conferences, middle school girls with interest in STEM fields are the focus of outreach activities.\r\n\r\nThe reactivity of radical cations of conjugated organic compounds is difficult to predict, complicated by the combination of the electron deficient and radical nature of these singly oxidized species. Despite the numerous applications in which radical cations are used directly or appear as intermediates, progress in developing new materials is hindered due to the limited understanding of factors leading to stable oxidized states. Through the proposed research, this research group hopes to develop electro-active materials with stable radical cations and to extend the environments in which these species can be utilized.  In addition to more efficient compounds for overcharge protections in lithium-ion batteries and new reagents for organic synthesis, the research will elucidate reaction mechanisms of radical cations for a greater understanding of the stability and decomposition pathways of these electron-deficient species.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

OFMEEPT is a liquid at RT which is miscible in acetonitrile and has an oxidation potential of 1.08 V vs. Fc/Fc<sup>+</sup>(4.4 V vs. Li), the PT derivative with highest oxidation potential. Its charged form was isolated as SbCl<sub>6</sub><sup>-&nbsp;</sup>salt (Figure 2). The stability of the neutral and&nbsp;charged forms was studied in acetonitrile using UV-vis spectroscopy. The neutral form is stable; however, the charged form slowly decays and loses most of the absorption intensity within 24 h. When analyzed using bulk electrolysis, rapid capacity fade was observed. The reason for the instability is still unclear.</p>\n<p>Organic radical cations are used in synthetic chemistry as oxidizing catalysts or initiators and they mediate a significant number of transformations to construct C-C and C-X bonds.&nbsp;They are also important intermediates in organic materials science as of their usefulness in electronic and energetic applications.&nbsp;In order for radical cation salts to act as reagents for synthetic transformations, they should have sufficient shelf and solution stability. They can often react with the solvent, electrolyte, or with the intermediates that are formed during the reaction. Radical cation salts of various phenothiazines are synthesized by chemical oxidation using different chemical oxidizing agents such as SbCl<sub>5</sub>, NOBF<sub>4</sub>, NOPF<sub>6</sub>, AgClO<sub>4</sub>.xH2O and AgTFSI.<sup>1, 2</sup>&nbsp;As an example different salts of MEEPT were synthesized (Figure 3) and isolated as solids which were further crystallized to produce crystalline salts.&nbsp;The stability&nbsp;of these radical cation salts was studied in solution and solid state by electrochemical and spectroscopic methods.<sup>1&nbsp;</sup>Evaluating shelf stability is another&nbsp;practical consideration for their use as reagents.
