 "awd_abstract_narration": "Over the last two decades a widespread effort has been mounted to transform the undergraduate teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) in order to more effectively educate all students and at the same time increase recruitment and retention of STEM majors needed for the future workforce. This transformation includes a move from primarily lecture and content-based teaching to more interactive and inquiry-based courses. In the geosciences one of the leading agents of change has been the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) supported On the Cutting Edge professional development program. From 2002 to 2012 this program offered more than 100 professional development workshops that reached ~20% of geoscience faculty. While this program has had a significant impact on teaching practice in the geosciences, statistics suggest a large percentage of geoscience faculty has yet to move toward incorporating interactive teaching practices in their undergraduate courses. Furthermore, the very success of this previous effort has led to a voluminous collection (more than 5000 pages) of resources that can appear overwhelming to new users. The goal of this project is thus to develop and widely distribute a set of short, quick-start manuals for existing resources, named on-ramp guides, to faculty members who teach courses related to plate tectonics. These on-ramp guides will facilitate access to existing community resources and adoption of more interactive and inquiry-based teaching. While this effort stems from recommendations made in the recent tectonics community vision document submitted to the NSF, principal investigators anticipate that the resources they develop could easily be adapted to other geoscience disciplines or STEM fields.\r\n\r\nDespite significant gains over the last two decades, there remains a large percentage of geoscience instructors who have yet to move toward incorporating engaged teaching practices in their courses. The purpose of this project is to reach and enable a portion of faculty members who teach courses related to plate tectonics but have not yet adopted best practices of engaged pedagogy. Following recommendations made in the recent tectonics community vision document, the principal investigators plan to develop a set of six short, quick-start resources, named term on-ramp guides, that will help facilitate access to and adoption of a more engaged and inclusive pedagogy. Each ~2 page on-ramp guide will focus on a single geoscience education-related topic and will include a short description of the topic as well as a list of exemplary tectonics teaching activities with links to additional resources for further exploration. The primary activities supported by the grant will be 1) a preliminary virtual meeting to organize the twelve participants into teams and to launch the development process, 2) a three-day writing workshop for teams to meet face-to-face to write the on-ramp guides and prepare them for dissemination, and 3) dissemination of the completed guides. On-ramp guides will be published as web pages available through high-level links on the existing geoscience education resource pages hosted by the Science Education Resource Center (SERC) and disseminated as pdf files with active web links. The pdf format will enable us to email the guides widely and have them hosted on web sites other than those at SERC in order to enable more people to discover, navigate, and use the available resources.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
