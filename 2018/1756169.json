 "awd_abstract_narration": "Natural History collections, including paleontology collections provide a foundational resource for biological science research.  An award is made to the Cincinnati Museum Center (CMC) to transfer and secure the University of Minnesota (UM) paleontology collection, consisting of over 15,000 invertebrate and 5,500 vertebrate fossil specimens.  This collection is currently at risk due to lack of curation, poor storage conditions, and imminent removal to offsite storage.  The project will unite two scientifically significant Midwest US collections and facilitate achievement of two major goals: (1) secure the collection in a dedicated storage facility with appropriate climate controlled conditions, and (2) curate and disseminate the collection to the scientific and broader community for research and education.  Paleontology collections excite the imagination of public audiences and inspire the next generation of scientists.  Cincinnati has a long history of paleontological research and education beginning in the mid-1800s.  This tradition will continue under this project by training undergraduate and graduate students in curatorial skills through student internships.  In addition, collaboration with CMC's successful STEM Girls Program will provide girls (ages 7 to 14) the opportunity to be \"Curator for a Day\" and have authentic experiences behind the scenes of the Museum working with real objects and scientists in a collaborative environment.\r\n\r\nThe focus of this project is the physical transfer, rehousing, digitization, and dissemination of a scientifically significant and endangered UM paleontology collection.  The UM collection contains a significantly high proportion of type and figured specimens.  Taxonomic, geographic, and stratigraphic overlap, and the historical connections between UM and Cincinnati Museum Center (CMC) paleontology collections, make CMC the natural place to house and care for UM's orphaned collection.  As CMC's collection is dynamic and growing, this transfer will exponentially increase the visibility, use, and access to the UM paleontology collection.  This award facilitates the support of a dedicated staff member to oversee the curatorial requirements of this project.  Specimens will be catalogued, entered into CMC's existing electronic database, and integrated into CMCs current collection.  Additionally, UM specimens will undergo imaging, georeferencing, and sharing of digital data to CMC's website (www.cincymuseum.org/research/invertebrate) and iDigBio (iDigBio.org).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
