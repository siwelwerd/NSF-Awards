 "awd_abstract_narration": "Theoretical Computer Science (TCS) is concerned with core questions in algorithms and complexity theory, and also with many questions in other scientific disciplines viewed through the so-called \"computational lens.\" This refers to the study of many scientific phenomena that are fundamentally computational in nature and can therefore benefit from a TCS perspective. This project addresses both core topics and connections with other disciplines, notably statistical physics and population genetics. A unifying theme in the project is techniques for the analysis of random and physical processes arising in all of these fields. The project will engage as collaborators experts in fields such as complex analysis, applied probability and statistical physics to work on these interface areas. The project affords many opportunities for graduate student and postdoctoral training and ideas from this research will find their way into course curricula. The investigator also maintains a strong interest in undergraduate and K-12 teaching, the latter through his involvement with the Berkeley Math Circle.\r\n\r\nOn a more technical level, the project contains three broad themes:\r\n\r\n1. Approximate counting: the development of approximation algorithms for counting problems, with special emphasis on the emerging technique of \"geometry of polynomials\" and its connections to the more classical techniques of Markov chain Monte Carlo and correlation decay. Applications include generating functions in combinatorics, partition functions in statistical physics, the computation of volumes, and the analysis of graphical models in machine learning.\r\n\r\n2. Stochastic local search algorithms: the study of a novel framework, arising from recent advances on the algorithmic Lovasz Local Lemma, for the design and analysis of stochastic local search algorithms, which search for combinatorial structures with desired properties by successively eliminating \"flaws\". The new framework is based on matrix norms and is inspired by linear time invariant analysis in control theory.\r\n\r\n3. Nonlinear dynamics: the study of computational aspects of two distinct, but related nonlinear dynamical systems: mass action kinetics and the \"red-queen\" dynamics. Mass action kinetics is a standard model for chemical reaction networks, and also captures other processes such as the Boltzmann equation in statistical physics, genetic algorithms and recombination in population genetics. The more speculative red-queen dynamics is a novel model for the evolution of multiple species under selection.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe project used advanced mathematical techniques to study the following three computational paradigms, with applications to combinatorics, optimization, statistical physics, machine learning and population genetics:\n\n1. Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms.\n\n2. Local search algorithms.\n\n3. Nonlinear dynamical systems.\n\nResearch was conducted by the PI and his students, postdocs and collaborators on several specific topics within the above broad areas.  Three PhD students at UC Berkeley were supported by the project, and the PI also mentored one undergraduate student and two postdocs.  Other collaborators included faculty and postdocs in the US (Caltech, Georgia Tech, Penn State, UC Santa Cruz), India (Tata Institute), Israel (Hebrew University), and Italy (University of Rome III).  The results of the project were disseminated in research papers in leading journals, as well as presentations at major international conferences and workshops.\n\nThe major outcomes of this work include the following.\n\n(i) Speeding up Markov chain Monte Carlo.  Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms are very widely used to obtain information about physical systems and belief networks: the idea is to simulate a dynamics that repeatedly updates the value of a local random variable, until the system settles into an equilibrium state.  Key quantities can then be measured.  The effectiveness of these algorithms depends crucially on how quickly the system reaches equilibrium, also known as the mixing time.  It is well known that many important systems undergo a phase transition, which dramatically slows down the rate of convergence because of the emergence of ?bottlenecks? between the phases.  We investigated two alternative approaches to overcoming this fundamental obstacle.  The first approach is to start the system off in a random configuration that lies in each of the phases with a carefully chosen probability (rather than in some arbitrary configuration as is usually done).  The second approach is to use non-local dynamics that are able to update many random variables at a time.  We were able to prove that, in some important examples, both of these approaches can eliminate the slowdown of the dynamics at or near a phase transition.\n\n(ii) Phase transitions and algorithms.  Physicists typically define a ?phase transition? as the existence of a complex zero in the partition function (or one of its logarithms).  This rather abstract-seeming mathematical condition has until now not had any algorithmic significance.  However, a recent proposal of Barvinok indicates how to use the absence of zeros in order to obtain efficient algorithms for the physical system.  This opens up a whole new style of algorithm for such problems, going beyond classical MCMC; and these algorithms have the added advantage that they are deterministic (i.e., they don?t make any use of randomness).  Another major thrust of the project was to apply this idea to obtain new algorithms for several benchmark problems, including the Ising model, the hard-core model and the Potts model.  As a byproduct of this work, we also established bounds on the locations of phase transitions for some of these models that are better than those previously known by physics arguments.  (This is an example of the computer science lens helping to solve problems in a different discipline.)\n\n(iii) Local search algorithms.  Many problems in engineering, mathematics and artificial intelligence call for finding a solution that simultaneously satisfies a large number of constraints: such problems are called constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs).  A famous mathematical result from 1975, called the Lov?sz Local Lemma (LLL), gives conditions under which a CSP has a solution (though it gives no clue as to how to find one).  Recent breakthroughs have turned this condition into an algorithm for actually finding a solution: this is a local search algorithm, that proceeds by gradually modifying a partial solution, typically improving it until it eventually satisfies all the constraints.  Our work has pushed forward the boundaries of this field by developing new, more flexible LLL criteria that guarantee a solution and an algorithm to find it.  The algorithms we generate are more powerful than previous ones, and interleave local improvement steps with backtracking steps.  We have demonstrated the power of this new approach by developing algorithms for finding valid colorings of both the vertices and the edges of a graph in a wider range of settings than was previously possible, among other applications.\n\n(iv) Nonlinear dynamics.  Another strand of our research explored the potential for nonlinear dynamics for solving sampling and inference problems.  In contrast to linear dynamics (MCMC), this area is not yet well understood, and even the most basic questions remain unanswered.  Moving beyond typical examples studied in chemical reaction networks, we have worked towards an understanding of combinatorially motivated nonlinear systems.  Among our results are a proof of global convergence for nonlinear dynamics on matroids and on the spanning trees of a graph.  These early results suggest many avenues for further research with much potential.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/18/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Alistair Sinclair"
