 "awd_abstract_narration": "An award is made to the Drosophila Species Stock Center (DSSC) at the University of California-San Diego (UCSD) to provide the research and education communities with 1) a repository to maintain and secure standardized genetic resources for current and future generations of investigators and educators, 2) tools to perform manipulative empirical studies, not possible with preserved material, to inform practical applications, and 3) access to relatively inexpensive materials for engaging students in the Nation's classrooms. The DSSC currently maintains a diverse collection of over 1600 living specimens from 225 Drosophila species.\r\n\r\nCommunity interest in the collection is broad and includes both an education and research component. Virtually all fields of biological inquiry, such as genetics, genomics, cellular and developmental biology, physiology, neurobiology and behavior, ecology, systematics, and evolution, benefit from the resources offered by the DSSC. The research products generated using DSSC stocks can be classified as essential science, an important focus of the NSF Directorate for Biological Sciences, as well as translational science that has a direct and positive impact on the well-being of all people. Furthermore, stock center personnel work with existing infrastructure at UCSD to facilitate the teaching of concepts related to invasive species, biodiversity, evolution, and ecology in K-12 classrooms. More information can be obtained on the DSSC website (https://stockcenter.ucsd.edu/info/welcome.php).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This resource is used by researchers from all over the United States and the World studying genetics and genomics, developmental biology, neurobiology, ecology and evolution.  Our major goals are to (1) maintain, in culture, a diverse assemblage of species, representative of the genus Drosophila and family Drosophilidae, and (2) provide these genetic resources to the research and educational communities.  \nIntellectual Merit.  The genus Drosophila has been an effective model system for over 100 years because these taxa are easy to culture in the laboratory and they represent a phylogenetically, ecologically, and phenotypically diverse group of species.  This diversity is particularly useful to geneticists in trying to understand the underlying principles of inheritance, the mechanisms for how organisms develop, and the organization of the genome.  To date, the genomes of over 30 Drosophila species have been completely sequenced, making this genus a critical resource for research in comparative genomics.  Not only have researchers been able to refine our understanding of how the genome is organized and evolves, but they have also used Drosophila as a test case for developing computational resources to discover genes and analyze whole genome data.  We anticipate that the need for diverse Drosophila species will grow as sequencing costs become lower and technologies more available, making the DSSC a critical resource for biological and computational researchers.\nBroader Impacts.  The DSSC works with a number of groups on the Cornell campus to train and mentor students from diverse backgrounds.  Our facility offers a unique opportunity for independent research focused on Drosophila species.  During the granting period covered by this report (9/1/2017 &mdash; 5/31/2018) we have mentored 10 undergraduate students, several of whom were students of color, first generation college students and/or women.  Of these, three have done research projects and one will be attending graduate school in the fall. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/01/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Patrick M O'grady"
