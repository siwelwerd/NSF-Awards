  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe symposium Particle Astrophyiscs and Cosmology Including Fundamental Interactions (PACIFIC-2018) was held in Japan.  The venue location was attractive and convenient for international community, helping ensure a broad and diverse international participation. \nAstroparticle physics is an exciting discipline at the boundaries of elementary particle physics, astrophysics and cosmology.  The abundance of new astrophysical data and new ideas about the fundamental properties of our universe make this a very exciting field.   The symposium has brought together experimentalists and theorists working in a variety of areas of astroparticle physics, cosmology, particle physics, and nuclear physics.  Dark matter, black holes, supernova explosions, gamma-ray bursts, x ray astrophysics, neutrino physics, and other topics were among those discussed at the symposium.  \nThe conference series, organized annually starting in 2011, has produced a number of breakthroughs in the past, and the researchers have cited the PACIFIC conference as the origin of new ideas and new collaborations.   The PACIFIC 2018 conference program included invited presentations, which were accompanied by lively discussions.   The invited speakers included both senior and junior researchers from a broad international community of astroparticle physicists.   The conference website archives a collection of presentations, which proves useful for both the participants and the community at large.  \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/26/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Alexander Kusenko"
