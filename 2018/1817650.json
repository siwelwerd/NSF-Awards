 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to improve the accuracy of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for studying the structure and dynamics of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs).  Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) make up about a third of the proteins found in eukaryotic cells (cells of more complex organisms than bacteria), and are involved in many essential cellular processes, but as their name implies, their structures are not well defined.  In this project, the investigators will develop force fields, the physics based laws that describe how atoms interact with each other, that can be used for IDPs in MD simulations.  This work will contribute to understanding how IDPs contribute to the machinery of life. New MD force field parameters will be made publicly available such that others can use them in their simulations.  The interdisciplinary research will carried out by three graduate students who will gather expertise in MD, biophysics, physical and organic chemistry, and a variety of spectroscopic techniques. The project will foster an international collaboration among the laboratories of Profs. Urbanc (PI) and Schweitzer-Stenner (Co-PI) at Drexel University in Philadelphia and Harald Schwalbe at the Johann Wolfgang Goethe University in Frankfurt/Germany. PI and Co-PI will organize summer workshops on MD simulations of unfolded peptides at Drexel University and an effort will be made to attract students and faculty targeting underrepresented minorities from neighboring institutions to attend this event. The research outcomes will be featured through the annual Kaczmarczik Day event, which offers demonstrations of research conducted at the Physics and Chemistry Departments at Drexel University to the general public, mostly high school students from the local Philadelphia area. \r\n\r\nExperimental research on unfolded peptides demonstrate that for most amino acid residues in water the backbone dihedral angles are restricted to two predominant regions in Ramachandran plot corresponding to polyproline II (pPII) and beta-strand. Of all amino acids, alanine shows the highest pPII propensity, which is important in the context of molecular dynamics (MD) force field development that routinely uses alanine-based short peptides as reference systems. Current MD force fields consistently fail to reproduce the high pPII content of alanine-based short peptides observed in vitro. The PIs and collaborators have acquired multiple experimental data for most naturally occurring guest residue x in GxG (G-glycine, x-all amino acids other than Q, G, P and W) peptides in water, which allowed them to uniquely determine residue-specific intrinsic conformational ensembles. This proposal will utilize this comprehensive set of experimental data to test the existing MD force fields and water models with respect to their ability to reproduce the conformational propensities of guest residues x in GxG peptides in water (Aim 1); derive a new parameterization of the existing MD force field, AMBER ff99SB, and combine it with the water model that best captures the intrinsic conformational propensities of guest residues x in GxG peptides to obtain the new force field AMBER ff99SB EXP-GxG (Aim 2); and conduct a systematic five-step assessment of the resulting AMBER ff99SB EXP-GxG force field that will test its transferability to longer unfolded peptides and its ability to capture protein folding and protein self-assembly into soluble protein oligomers (Aim 3). These advances in MD force field development will improve predictions of MD simulations of IDPs. \r\n\r\nThis award is jointly funded by the Molecular Biophysics Cluster of the Division of Cellular and Molecular Biosciences and the Chemical Theory, Models and Computational Methods Program in the Chemistry Division.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The power of MD predictions depends on the accuracy of the underlying force field, which models interactions among pairs of atoms. The overarching goal of this sponsored research was to assess the current additive  MD force fields with respect to their ability to capture a comprehensive set of spectroscopic data on guest amino acid residues x and y in short unfolded  GxG, GxxG, GxyG peptides and somewhat longer linear motifs, and establish a basis for a new MD force field development that would offer a significant improvement over the currently available MD force fields. The conformational ensembles of guest residues x are represented and visualized by Ramachandran distributions, which are two-dimensional plots displaying the preferred conformations defined by dihedral angles phi and psi. For each guest residue x, a Gaussian Ramachandran distribution can be derived theoretically by fitting the parameters of Gaussian distributions to respective experimental data. We found that for any guest residue we examined, this Gaussian distribution outperforms the MD-derived Ramachandran distributions by at least one order of magnitude. More specific findings of this sponsored research are as follows: (a) most current MD force fields lack amino acid specificity in conformational ensembles visualized by Ramachandran distributions; (b) the few MD force fields that implemented amino acid specific parameters do not show a significant improvement over the MD force fields that lack amino acid specificity with respect to spectroscopic data; (c) nearest neighboring interactions are unaccounted for even in the best performing force field, which is (arguably) CHARMM36m with its intrinsic TIP3P water model. These discrepancies that are identified at the level of short unfolded peptides may accumulate in MD studies of longer peptides and proteins, in particular of intrinsically disordered proteins, characterized by long stretches of disordered regions/domain, leading to erroneous MD predictions. Thus, development of an improved MD force field is critical for reliability of MD findings on intrinsically disordered peptides and proteins.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"western\" style=\"margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"western\" style=\"margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;\"><span style=\"font-family: Times New Roman, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\"><strong>Broader Impact</strong></span></span></p>\n<p class=\"western\" style=\"margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"western\" style=\"margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;\"><strong><span style=\"font-family: Times New Roman, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">There is a large community of computational scientists who use MD simulations to obtain atomistic-level insights into protein folding, protein assembly, protein-protein as well as protein-ligand interactions, and protein interactions with other biomolecules, such as lipids, DNA, and RNA.
