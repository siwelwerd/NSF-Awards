 "awd_abstract_narration": "Accurate knowledge of sea ice thickness over large scales is crucial for understanding the current and future states of the Arctic ice cover, and for near- and long-term predictions of Arctic marine environments. With the Arctic ice pack undergoing a major transition from perennial to seasonal ice, ice thickness - more so than ice extent - is a key variable  describing the state and evolution of the ice-ocean system. However, methods of observing sea ice thickness at regional or basin scales with sufficient accuracy and resolution to capture growth and melt processes, detect hazards, or assess habitat quality are lacking. This project will develop an Airborne electromagnetic (AEM) snow radar system capable of being integrated into long-range Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS). This will allow acquisition of basin-scale ice thickness and snow depth data as part of a network for Arctic observations that addresses information needs of researchers, local communities and industry. This MRI development project will contribute to NSF's Navigating the New Arctic Big Idea. \r\n\r\nAEM methods offer a novel means of measuring sea ice thickness over the full range of thicknesses found in the Polar Regions. By remotely sensing the positions of the upper and lower surfaces of the ice cover, AEM measurements typically achieve an accuracy of better than 10% of the total thickness, with less sensitivity to uncertainties in snow cover or sea surface topography. Development and commissioning of the Long-range Airborne Snow and Sea Ice Thickness Observing System (LASSITOS) will also provide opportunities for education and training, including capstone projects for the University of Alaska Fairbanks' new minor in aeronautical engineering and student involvement in comprehensive calibration/validation field activities. LASSITOS is expected to generate interest among native students from coastal villages in northern Alaska, who represent another key stakeholder group for sea ice information. The leader of this project is an early-career researcher.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

However, we found that even small carbon fiber airframes would produce unacceptable interfererence with the EM signal from the ocean and so we needed a tether to separate the LEM from its UAV. This made long-range, low-altitude operations with a fixed-wing aircraft impractible and so we refocused our efforts toward making the system lightweight and compatible with a smaller class of multirotor UAVs. This provided the additional benefits of greater manueverability for dense 2D mapping of the ice thickness and simplified integration and operation, which makes it more practicable for operation by local communities or in remote locations.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Pictures\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"Pictures\"><strong>Specifications and accuracy</strong></p>\r\n<p>The LEM is able to operate at 8 discrete frequencies in the 0.6-8 kHz range. Although only a single frequency can be broadcast at a time, they can be switched rapidly enough to allow effectively simultaneous measurements with up to 3 different frequencies. Results from &ldquo;calibration climbs&rdquo; over level sea ice and open water demonstrates an accuracy in the measurement of&nbsp;h<sub>w</sub>&nbsp;of better than 10% at all frequencies for&nbsp;h<sub>w</sub>&nbsp;up to 12 m. Accounting for pitch and roll of the UAV, the laser altimeter typically measures the distance to the snow surface,&nbsp;h<sub>a</sub>, of &lt; 2cm. The accuracy of the freeboard measurement depends on the uncertainties in both the laser altimeter and the GNSS position. Using real time kinematic (RTK) corrections, the freeboard error can be reduced to approximately 5 cm. This is sufficient for mapping surface topography of thicker ice or identifying freeboard differences between, for example, level first year ice and thicker multiyear ice.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The LSR uses a frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) ku-band radar with a modest bandwidth of 1.5 GHz, which is the result of hardware compromises to keep the system within the weight limits for FAR Part 107 rules (55 lb total take-off weight). In this configuration, the LSR is able to resolve snow depths greater than approximately 25 cm. Below this depth, the reflections from the air-snow and snow-ice interfaces cannot be readily distinguished. We also tested an ultra-broadband (16-18 GHz) version of the LSR installed on a snow mobile.

Figure 2 compares LASSITOS measurements along the first 800 m of this transect with in situ validation observations. Overall, the LEM measurements of total snow-plus-ice thickness,&nbsp;h<sub>w</sub>, agree with drill hole measurements to within better than 20 cm. However, we note there is a frequency dependent response to water depths less than approximately 3 m.

We attribute this to the presence of conductive water in the porous keel and we anticipate a multi-frequency approach may allow estimates of ridge keel porosity.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 12/23/2024<br>\nModified by: Andrew&nbsp;Mahoney</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1828743/1828743_10582525_1734979934543_LASSITOS_LEM_LSR_sketch--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1828743/1828743_10582525_1734979934543_LASSITOS_LEM_LSR_sketch--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Figure 1: LASSITOS subsystems and principles of operation\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1828743/1828743_10582525_1734979934543_LASSITOS_LEM_LSR_sketch--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Figure 1: LASSITOS subsystems and principles of operation\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The LASSITOS instrument is composed of the LEM and LSR subsystems operating from separate UAVs, which together measure ice thickness and snow depth</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Achille Capelli</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Andrew&nbsp;Mahoney\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 1: LASSITOS subsystems and principles of operation</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1828743/1828743_10582525_1735002157513_LEMRidgeTransect_mod--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1828743/1828743_10582525_1735002157513_LEMRidgeTransect_mod--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Figure 3: Multifrequency LEM survey over a pressure ridge\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1828743/1828743_10582525_1735002157513_LEMRidgeTransect_mod--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Figure 3: Multifrequency LEM survey over a pressure ridge\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Freeboard and total thickness of a pressure ridge in landfast ice near Utqiagvik measure by the LEM.
