 "awd_abstract_narration": "An award is made to the University of North Carolina Wilmington to acquire an FEI-Apreo Scanning electron Microscope (SEM).  The SEM will be a cornerstone of the undergraduate curriculum in introductory and advanced cell biology teaching. The educational benefits will be further extended to pre-college students through collaboration with the UNCW STEM Learning Cooperative, with a special focus on girls from underrepresented communities. The SEM will be used to conduct an integrative multi-year project that involves graduate and undergraduate students developing 3D visualization methods for microscopic specimens and production of 3D printed replicas of these specimens. Students will collaborate with pre-college teens to image, explore and produce models that can be used as educational material in their own schools. The SEM will provide regular outreach opportunities for science fairs, college open days, and life-long learning events that engage the general public in microscopy-based STEM. The award will therefore enable continued implementation of The University of North Carolina Wilmington's high-impact education and public outreach activities that are crosscutting, from K-12 through Ph.D.\r\n\r\nThe award will allow for high resolution imaging and microanalysis of surface structures of cells and tissues, biominerals, geological and paleontological samples, manufactured materials, and nanoparticles. Specifically, five thematic clusters of research will be supported: (1) Cell biology, taxonomy, and diversity of marine algae, (2) marine invertebrate and microbial symbiont diversity,  (3) angiosperm functional diversity and biogeography, (4) morphology and microstructure of cetaceans and their parasites, and (5) archeology, marine palentology, and sedimentary petrology. In addition to these research themes, many other projects, new research initiatives, and national and international collaborations will be facilitated by this award.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
