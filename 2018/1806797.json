 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cosmic rays are highly energetic sub-atomic particles from space that travel at velocities near the speed of light.  The origin of cosmic rays and their acceleration mechanisms are unknown, but they likely originate in extreme astrophysical phenomena both within and beyond our galaxy.  The Telescope Array (TA) is the largest cosmic ray observatory in the northern hemisphere.  Located outside Delta, Utah, and representing a joint US-Japanese effort, TA was designed to study the nature and origin of the highest energy particles in the Universe.  This award to the University of Utah supports the scientific analysis of data from TA and the TAx4 upgrade that is currently under construction.  The University of Utah is the host institution for TA and therefore plays a critical role in scientific activities of the observatory.  This award will also support the University of Utah group's involvement in the Astrophysics Science Project Integrating Research and Education (ASPIRE) program, which engages area teachers, students, and the public through a web site of interactive educational materials and visits to local schools.  The group will also host associated experiments in other fields that benefit from the TA location and infrastructure.\r\n\r\nThe primary objectives of the TA experiment are to measure the energy and spatial distributions, and the chemical composition of the highest energy cosmic rays in order to address the nature and origin of ultra-high energy cosmic rays.  Through this award, the group will work to substantially improve the event statistics of the anisotropy data set and clarify the nature of the apparent \"hotspot\" in the northern sky.  They will improve the precision of the spectrum measurement in order to elucidate the nature of the suppression in the cosmic ray energy spectrum at high energies.  With increased statistics from hybrid data they will improve and extend measurements of the shower maximum depth to resolve the composition of cosmic rays at the highest energies.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Telescope Array is an ultra high energy cosmic ray observatory located in central Utah, USA.  It studies particles from space with energies greater than 10^17eV.  It observes the extensive air shower of secondary particles that occurs when the primary cosmic ray enters the Earth's atmosphere and collides with the nucleus of atmospheric gases in the upper atmosphere.  These collisions generate showers of billions of secondary particles which tell us about the origin and nature of the primary cosmic ray particle. \n\nThe Telescope Array uses two types of detectors to measure the air shower particles.  We sprinkle the surface of the Earth with scintillator detectors.  850 detectors are spread over about 750mi^2. They sample the density of charged particles in the air shower when it reaches the Earth's surface.  Measuring the number of charged particles in each detector, the lateral distribution of the charge, and the timing of arrival, we are able to both measure the energy of the primary cosmic ray and the direction in the sky from which it originated.  By using machine learning/AI techniques we are also able to discern information about the chemical composition of that primary particle. \n\nAs the air shower passes through the atmosphere on the way to the surface, it also excites the gases.  The excited gases emit light to return to their ground state.  This causes the air shower to glow with light which is primarily in the ultra-violet.  The Telescope Array has three telescope stations with 60 telescopes that view these ultraviolet tracks in the skies above the array of scintillator detectors.  From the amount of light and timing information, we are able to determine the origin and energy of the primary cosmic ray particle.  By looking at the development of the air shower, its peak and width of the development, one can also find clues about the chemical composition of the primary.  Of course combining the information of the two sets of detectors provides more and better information about the cosmic ray.\n\nBy studying the energies of many cosmic rays over time showing the frequency with which various energy particles arrive, we can make a spectrum of the flux of cosmic rays.  It turns out that the flux is very steeply falling with energy.  For every order of magnitude in energy increase, the flux of cosmic rays falls by nearly a thousand!  Therefore, when we plot the flux vs energy of the cosmic rays, we typically multiply the flux by E^3.  This has the effect of taking out the overall slope of the spectrum and revealing the underlying wiggles in the spectrum.  These wiggles are related to the acceleration mechanisms of the original sources as well as the interactions that the cosmic rays endured on their way from the source to the Earth.  For example if the cosmic ray originated as a proton with energy 10^20eV, it might collide with a photon of the cosmic microwave background producing an intermediate particle and resulting in a lower energy proton and a pion.  If the cosmic ray was a heavier nucleus say nitrogen, then it might interact along the way spallating off nucleons and changing in composition.  Either way, the direction of the charged particles will be bending in the extra-galactic and galactic magnetic fields.    \n\nThe Pierre Auger experiment is a similar ultra-high energy cosmic ray observatory in the southern hemisphere.  It observes different sources and notably the galactic center.  The Telescope Array and Auger largely agree on the cosmic ray spectrum.  However, they observe different high-energy suppressions.  This may be due to different sources or distances to sources. Understanding this difference is one subject of continued study.\n\nFrom 10^15-10^18 eV, the Telescope Array measurement of cosmic ray composition changes from light to heavy and back to light as the source of particles changes from galactic to extra-galactic.  For energies greater than 10^18 eV, we find a composition that looks light somewhere between protons and helium.  The resolution is not sufficient to differentiate between p and He.  The Telescope Array measurements are in agreement with the previous High Resolution Fly\u2019s Eye stereo fluorescence measurements where we also found a light composition at the highest energies.  However, the Auger experiment in the south observes a composition that appears to be getting heavier for energies greater than 10^18.5eV.\n\nWe also see signs of potential sources of ultra-high energy cosmic rays near Ursa Major and overlapping with the Perseus-Pieces supercluster.  While there is evidence, of these, they require more data to verify.  Finally, we have observed a very high energy event with energy approaching that of the \"Oh-My-God\" particle.  This event was observed with the scintillator array and calibrated by the fluorescence telescopes.  Using this very different technique it is good to see this confirmation of these VERY high energy events. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/28/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: John N Matthews"
