 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will develop a novel mathematical approach for describing the dynamics of ecological communities at large spatial scales, a description of dynamics called metacommunities.  From a mathematical standpoint, the project will start with relatively simple descriptions of interactions among species, such as competition and predation, at small spatial scales, coupled with descriptions of connectivity, the way species move between locations.  The mathematical descriptions will then be expanded to include more detailed and realistic descriptions of interactions among species and underlying environmental changes.  The models will be analyzed to determine both long-term behavior and dynamics.  The mathematical models will then be used to answer important ecological questions focused on how changes in habitat quality and availability and connectivity between different habitats will affect the composition and dynamics of these metacommunities.  This, in turn, will provide information about how human activities that affect habitats and connectivity will affect species composition and dynamics and can provide guidance for both conservation and restoration efforts.  \r\n\r\nThe mathematical models of metacommunities used will be primarily phrased in discrete time with a time step of one year, both to reflect dynamics in seasonal environments and how data is gathered. The simplest models will focus only on species presence or absence and will be difference equations, so a relatively complete analytical treatment will be possible. Equilibria and their stability can be calculated. The more complex descriptions will all be phrased as integro-difference equations where time is discrete, but the state space is continuous.  The underlying dependent variables will be density functions for the abundance of the species under consideration, and the kernels in the integro-difference equations will describe the underlying ecological dynamics.  Initial analyses will be numerical with the expectation that analytic treatment of conditions for persistence and coexistence will be possible, building on recent mathematical work on integro-difference equations.  To treat changing conditions through time, the kernels will be modified to include explicit time dependence.  The mathematical analyses will then be used to answer the underlying ecological questions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project developed mathematical approaches for describing the dynamics of ecological communities at large spatial scales, a description of dynamics called metacommunities.  Results were reported in 12 published papers as well as presentations at scientific meetings with more publications in preparation. The project started with relatively simple descriptions of interactions among species, such as competition and predation, at small spatial scales, coupled with descriptions of connectivity, the way species move between locations. One key question is whether populations at different locations fluctuate so that high population levels are present at different locations at the same time, or at different times.  The answer turns out to depend on specific details of both the way that individuals move between locations and the dynamics of local populations in complex and subtle ways, unless many individuals are moving.  This general conclusion emerged from a number of different specific approaches to the problem suggesting that the conclusion is quite robust.\n\nA related question then becomes what determines the rate of movement between different locations; how does movement rate evolve.  Here, the simple answer that has been known for a long time for a single species is that slower movement is better; where an organism is now is on average going to be better than anywhere else.  However, simple models developed during the project can be used to show that if resources (food) are dynamics and changing that directed movement can lead to the evolution of higher movement rates. The particular example of evolving movement rate in response to a second species is also one of several specific models examined that looked at the complexities introduced by consideration of multiple species.\n\nThe broader impacts fall into two categories.  Individuals with interdisciplinary training in mathematics and biology are clearly needed to address societal problems, from managing responses to epidemics to dealing with the effects of global change.  Specific training in this area was received by multiple graduate students on the project.  Second, managing spatial ecological populations is also a challenge and the approaches developed provide important insights into this question.  In particular, general results obtained provide information about how human activities that affect habitats and connectivity will affect species composition and dynamics and can provide guidance for both conservation and restoration efforts.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/02/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Alan M Hastings"
