 "awd_abstract_narration": "St. John, Virgin Islands is a tropical island made up primarily of ash and debris from volcanic eruptions. It is exposed to major geohazards such as hurricanes and tsunamis. The bathymetry of the nearshore coast has a strong influence on the severity of runup and surge from such events. St. John and other similar volcanic islands are unlike carbonate/limestone islands that are flat and lack significant topography. St. John has steep slopes and the type of rocks immediately near the coast that are prone to weathering. This makes such islands vulnerable to land-based sediment erosion. A multibeam bathymetric survey was conducted in August 2017 in several offshore bays.  Because Hurricane Irma passed over the Virgin Islands after the hurricane, there is a valuable opportunity to understand the impact of the hurricane in this offshore environment. This project will complete a second multibeam bathymetric survey and collect sediment cores to assess the extent of the erosion of the island, the quantity of sediments that flowed into the bays, and how the shape of the floor of the offshore bays changed. Understanding these impacts are important for creating more resilient coastal communities. Two graduate students will be involved in the field work and data analysis.  The results will be provided to local geoscience and environmental groups.\r\n\r\nThe major scientific objective of this project is to quantify the volume, distribution, and type of\r\nsediment influx that occurred as a result of Hurricane Irma on St. John, U.S. Virgin Islands. Isolating the\r\neffects of this hurricane event will yield a better scientific understanding of how to interpret paleo-storm deposits observed in sediment cores A post-hurricane Irma multibeam bathymetry and backscatter survey is planned to exactly overlap the regions of St. John mapped pre-Irma (Coral Harbor, Johnson Bay, and Saunders Bay) and also, to fill in data gaps from previous surveys. A transect of cores from the interior of Coral Harbor moving seaward will be taken from the survey vessel using a pocket vibra core system. Results of the project will constrain the sediment flux delivered to the marine environment by storms versus non-storm sedimentation. In addition to understanding the hurricane event, these new data together will yield important insights into the relative contribution of a one-off storm event versus that of annual-to-decadal non-storm sedimentation.",

In this rapid response project, we mapped and sampled the bay floor in a coastal embayment in St. John, USVI. Hurricanes waves can cause physical damage to coastal ecosystems, re-suspend and transport antecedent seafloor sediment, while the associated intense rainfall can yield large influxes of land-derived sediment to the coast (e.g. burial of ecosystems). Post-storm studies are difficult and rare. Furthermroe the lack of pre-storm baseline data are rare with which to compare post-storm data against. In this study, we had pre-storm baseline bathymetry and sediment data from August, 2017 (pre-storms) and repeated it in November, 2017 (post-storms). Comparison reveals morphologic seafloor changes and widespread aggradation with an average of ~25 cm of sediment deposited over a 1.28 km2 benthic zone. Despite an annual amount of precipitation between surveys, sediment yield modeling suggests watersheds contributed &lt;0.2% of the total depositional volume. Considering locally established accumulation rates, this multi-hurricane event equates to ~1-3 centuries of deposition. Critical benthic communities (corals, seagrasses) can be partially or fully buried by deposits of this thickness and previous studies demonstrate that prolonged burial of similar organisms often leads to mortality. This study shows how storm events can result in major sediment deposition, which can significantly impact seafloor morphology and composition and benthic ecosystems. The results of this project allow for a detailed understanding of (1) the post-hurricane pulse of sediment that was deposited in the marine environment, (2) the sediment flux, and (3) the morphological changes to the bay floor. This will assist in developing more accurate interpretations of pale-storm deposits.</p>\n<p><strong>Intellectual Merit:</strong> The major scientific objective was to quantify the volume, distribution, and type of sediment influx as well as morphological changes to the bay floor that occurred as a result of Hurricane Irma on St. John, U.S. Virgin Islands. The U.S. Virgin Islands are vulnerable to natural hazards such as hurricanes and tsunamis and detailed bathymetry is critical for understanding and preparing for run-up and surge events. Focus on hurricane impacts is typically placed on terrestrial damage. The effects on the marine environment are poorly understood but are important because the bathymetry of the nearshore coast exerts a strong feedback on the severity of future inundation/surge/run-up events.

The U.S. Virgin Islands are naturally exposed to tropical storms and other hazards (e.g. tsunami). Coastal ecosystems are critical to economic, cultural, and ecologic health, yet are vulnerable to hurricanes. Understanding modern hurricane deposition is important for assessing impacts to coastal ecosystems and to accurately interpret the geologic record of past events. Furthermore, characterizing previous storm events is challenged by the difficulty in distinguishing a storm bed from a tsunami bed and vice versa. Here, we can fingerprint what a hurricane deposit looks like that can better inform interpretation of layers in cores that are suspected storm beds. In order to better prepare for future events it is critical to understand the impacts immediately following an event. This project integrated the science with the local geoscience/environmental groups on St. John including the Coral Bay Community Council. Data and analyses will be disseminated for scientific use as well as to management and policymakers. This project supported an early career investigator and graduate student training.
