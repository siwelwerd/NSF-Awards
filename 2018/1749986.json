 "awd_abstract_narration": "The build-up of a thunderstorm, from scattered popcorn clouds to a dark towering storm cloud, is a common sight on a summer afternoon. The vigorous growth of such clouds is fueled by the convective available potential energy (CAPE) of the atmosphere. Formally CAPE is the amount of work that would be done by the buoyancy force on a saturated plume of air rising through the portion of the atmosphere in which it is lighter than the surrounding air, assuming that no ambient air mixes into the rising plume.  Weather forecasters routinely calculate CAPE from atmospheric temperature soundings and use it to predict the likelihood of severe convective storms.\r\n\r\nComputer simulations of greenhouse-gas induced climate change commonly show large increases of CAPE with global mean temperature, a result which has raised concerns that thunderstorms may become more common or intense as a consequence of climate change.  But the reasons why CAPE should increase with global temperature are not clear, and the lack of a theory for the dependence of CAPE on temperature limits confidence in model results.\r\n\r\nUnder previous funding the PI's group developed a simple model which explains the dependence of CAPE on temperature.  But the theory assumes that the atmosphere is in a state of radiative-convective equilibrium, a state which approximates the condition of the atmosphere over warm tropical oceans.  The theory is compelling as a starting point but cannot be directly applied to understand CAPE change over land or at higher latitudes.  Work under this award thus seeks a more general understanding of the relationship between CAPE and global climate, including the effects of large-scale atmospheric circulation.  \r\n\r\nThe research is conducted through examination of climate model simulations produced for the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, combined with experiments using a cloud resolving model on a limited domain to test hypotheses.  The role of atmospheric circulation is assessed through calculation and analysis of moist mean available potential energy (MAPE), the maximum amount of kinetic energy that can be reversibly produced from the mean state of the atmosphere by transforming to a lower energy reference state. The MAPE analysis seeks to relate the mean state of the atmosphere in middle and high latitudes to its potential to generate CAPE through large-scale circulations.  The impact of land surface conditions on CAPE is another focus of the research, as the strong diurnal cycle of temperature and moisture plays a key role in the development of convection over land. Further work considers the impact of changes in CAPE on the Walker circulation, a large-scale overturning circulation between the western and eastern Pacific.\r\n\r\nThe work has societal as well as scientific value given the damaging effects of convective storms, including hail, lightning, tornados, and flash floods, along with indications that their intensity or frequency of occurrence may increase due to climate change. Results with practical implications are shared with interested parties through workshops and other venues, and research results are incorporated into classroom teaching and other educational activities.  In addition, the project provides support and training to a graduate student, thereby providing for the future work force in this research area.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "The overall aim of the project was to better understand changes in the thermal structure of the atmosphere and their link to changes in the circulation of the atmosphere, including small-scale convection in the storm tracks in the midlatitudes and the large-scale Walker circulation in the tropics. This was accomplished through analysis of current observation-based estimates of the state of the atmosphere, as well as analysis of simulations of climate change with comprehensive and idealized climate models.\nOur research on changes in available energy for atmospheric circulations in the midlatitudes has demonstrated that the component of the mean available energy related to convection has increased over recent decades in the Northern Hemisphere in summer, despite decreases in the available energy for large-scale circulations. In simulations of solar geoengineering scenarios, we have shown that the extratropical storm tracks also weaken in both hemispheres even though the global mean surface temperature remains roughly constant, and this is because the spatial pattern of residual warming leads to non-negligible changes in available energy.  For summer in midlatitudes, we showed that projected changes in upward motion in extreme precipitation events are strongly linked to decreases in relative humidity over land. The decreases in relative humidity seem to affect upward motion through increases in convective inhibition, but this physical mechanism requires further investigation.  We have also made the first estimate of the available energy of the atmosphere that takes into account both moisture and the atmosphere's three-dimensional structure, and this allows us to connect the regional mean state of the atmosphere to thermodynamic potentials for convective activity driven by large-scale overturning and for ascent in warm conveyor belts associated with extratropical cyclones.  \nThe Walker circulation is a large-scale overturning cell of the atmosphere over the tropical Pacific ocean that has important implications for weather and climate in many regions of the world.  We used an energetic analysis to show that the extent to which the Walker circulation is projected to weaken with climate warming is largely determined by the extent to which a measure of thermal stratification -- the gross moist stability (GMS) -- increases with climate warming.  In idealized simulations, changing a parameter in a climate model related to mixing of clouds with their environment can affect how the GMS responds to climate warming, and this then affects how the Walker circulation responds.  However, the uncertainties in this cloud mixing parameter are not large enough to explain the large intermodel differences in how the GMS and the Walker circulation respond to climate change, and further work is needed to understand the controls on changes in GMS. In the current climate, we showed that spatial variations in the GMS are related to spatial variations in the pattern of sea surface temperature through their effect on the vertical structure of the winds.\nThe results of the project lead to a better understanding of the relation of the circulations of the atmosphere to the thermodynamic state of the atmosphere, both in the current climate and under ongoing and projected future climate change.  The results were widely disseminated through conference presentations, journal articles, and MIT news stories.
