 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will permit the acquisition of a time of flight-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectroscopy (TOF-ICP-MS). In general, ICP-MS is widely used to analyze metal isotopes in complex matrices after complete digestion into dissolved form. Although this form of ICP-MS analysis remains commonly used, alternative sampling approaches that produce transient (as short as 500 microseconds) signals are being adapted extensively, such as single particle and single cell ICP-MS analysis. Sequential scanning ICP-MS instrumentations are limited to measuring transient signals of one element only. However, many materials are composed of multi elements. The TOF-ICP-MS allow: 1) full simultaneous detection of the entire mass spectrum of elements from Li to U for every single measurement in less than 50 microseconds; 2) multi-element determinations in fast transient signals such as single particles and single cells; 3) improved precision, particularly for measuring isotope ratios; 4) real-time internal standardization; and 5) untargeted analysis, i.e., identifying analytes in a sample without a priori knowledge of analytes in the sample. \r\n\r\nThe acquisition of the TOF-ICP-MS will fill a crucial gap in elemental analytical facilities at the University of South Carolina by enabling simultaneous, untargeted, multi-element analysis of transient signals. The acquisition of TOF-ICP-MS will enhance on-going fundamental studies and support diverse applications including: 1) characterization of natural nanoparticles (NNPs) to better understand their properties, environmental behaviors/functions, and environmental and human health implications; 2) characterization of engineered (ENPs) to underpin development of new ENPs and assess environmental ENP exposure for potential environmental and human health implications; 3) characterization of incidental nanoparticles (INPs) to understand the fate and behavior of metals in aerosols emitted during combustion and thermal processing of wastes and their impact on air quality; and 4) provide analytical support for the NSF-funded Virginia Tech National Center for Earth and Environmental Nanotechnology Infrastructure (NanoEarth). These projects are at the forefront of their respective fields, yet their continued success hinges on ready access to the proposed instrumentation. \tThe acquisition of the TOF-ICP-MS will enhance and accelerate existing collaborations between the PI and faculty, federal agencies (EPA, NIST and USGS), and NanoEarth, and will allow the researchers to establish new collaborations with other institutions nationally and internationally.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Conventional iinductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) is widely used to measure element concentrations in diverse types of samples such as surface water, soils, sediments after complete digestion of the samples. Although analysis of metal concentrations in samples following digestion remains the most common use of ICP-MS, alternative sampling approaches that produce transient (as short as 500 micro-seconds) signals have been recently adapted such as single particle and single cell ICP-MS analysis. Sequential scanning mass spectrometers are limited to measuring transient signals of one element at a time. However, many materials such as naturally occurring nanomaterials, composite engineered nanomaterials, and catalysts are composed of more than elements. This major research instrumentation grant enabled the acquisition of an inductively coupled plasma-time of flight-mass spectrometer (icpTOFMS) along with two sample introduction systems; that is microdroplet generator and laser ablation. At the time of the proposal submission, the requested icpTOFMS was the first of its kind to be installed in the United States. The acquired mass spectrometer instrument has the unique capability to measure all elements generated in the plasma, and to capture a full mass spectrum approximately three orders of magnitude faster than a conventional quadrupole-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometer. These capabilities allow: <strong>1)</strong> simultaneous detection of the entire mass spectrum of elements for every single measurement in less than 30 micro-seconds, <strong>2)</strong> multi-element determinations in fast transient signals such as single nanoparticles,<strong> 3)</strong> improved analysis precision, particularly for measuring isotope ratios, and <strong>4)</strong> untargeted analysis, <em>i.e.</em> identifying analytes in a sample without a priori knowledge of sample composition. The microdroplet generator has the capability to produce microdroplets containing known element concentrations which are then used to determine element mass within a single nanoparticle and enable overcoming the limitations of conventional methods used for nanoparticle calibration. The laser ablation allows mapping elemental distribution and concentration in solid samples by the mass spectrometer.
