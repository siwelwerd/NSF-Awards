 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will investigate how children between the ages of 3 and 7 years learn about the rules that govern counting. The main goal of this project is to examine how the verbal structure of counting in different languages affects children's ability to learn core math concepts like recursion and infinity. Therefore, the work will have a broad impact on understanding how the structure of symbolic systems taught to children affect their ability to learn core STEM concepts. The project will foster interdisciplinary research, and will create a collaborative bridge between the University of California-San Diego, a PhD granting university, and Skidmore College, where research is conducted as part of undergraduate training. This will promote new forms of training on both campuses, spanning Psychology, Cognitive Science, Linguistics, and Education.\r\n\r\nResearchers will examine how the structure of the verbal count list - which differs across languages - affects how children learn core mathematical concepts. To accomplish this, researchers will assess how high children can count, and assess the ability of children to generate the next number in a sequence of numbers when not counting. These two assessments will allow the researchers to determine whether children have acquired a recursive +1 rule (the \"successor function\"). Researchers will test whether learning this recursive rule leads children to infer that numbers are infinite. Finally, using similar methods, the researchers will examine whether learning that numbers are infinite might lead children to infer that other domains, like space and time, are also infinite. Therefore, the researchers will determine how learning a concrete system of counting rules might lead children to learn about abstract entities (such as infinity) that can never be directly experienced. Using simple behavioral methods, the project addresses a central property of mathematics education with important implications for educational practices in mathematics.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

To explore this question, we investigated how children learn to count and add numbers internationally, in the US, China, Europe, and India. We found that differences in the structure of languages spoken in these locations impacted how easily children learned to count, with important downstream impacts on other conceptual understanding of number and mathematics. For example, languages with simple and predictable counting systems - like Chinese - led to quicker learning of counting and better understanding of how counting encodes number. We also found that this quicker learning of counting likely facilitates conceptual insights, such as the fact that numbers are infinite. In contrast, when languages featured unpredictable counting sequences - like the teens in English (eleven, twelve, thirteen), learning was relatively delayed. The largest delays were seen for highly irregular counting systems in Indian languages such as Hindi and Gujarati, with US English showing intermediate irregulatity. This work suggests that instructors should be aware of how the linguistic properties of number words impact learning, to develop interventions that promote learning counting structures that support later mathematical development. Future research should explore ways to minimize negative impacts of irregularity in linguistic counting systems, and how to teach children the rules that govern counting, and allow the generation of a potentially infinite set of numbers.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/06/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: David&nbsp;A&nbsp;Barner</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"></div>\n</div>",
