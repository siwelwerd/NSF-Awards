 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hurricane Irma and Maria, both category 5 storms, that struck the Caribbean in the summer of 2017 caused severe damage to many islands not only destroying a significant amount of civil infrastructure but also impacting many shallow submarine environments.  This research project collects time-critical, ephemeral data consisting of observations of erosion, sediment redistribution, and coral reef structure damage at Cane Bay on St Croix in the US Virgin Islands. This location was picked because it was at or near the center of both Hurricane Irma and Hurricane Maria when they were at their maximum strength. It is also the location of another major hurricane strike (i.e., Hurricane Hugo) in 1989.  Data like that collected for the present project were also collected for Hurricane Hugo, allowing comparisons to be made and comprehensive modeling of the impact major storms have on carbonate production, bioerosion, and sediment export in a modern reef system.  Land and marine photographic images, as well as other data will be collected to provide high quality measurements of sediment removal by each storm.  These data, as well as historical data from Hurricane Hugo, will be used to model storm related sediment transport in the area over the past century. Broader impacts of the work include partnership with researchers at the US Geological Survey, production of an educational video based on overcoming reef-building misconceptions, and improving knowledge of the impacts of major storms on coral reefs which will help inform and improve reef management.\r\n\r\nCarbonate production and carbonate cycling in modern reefs is due to a balance between the secretion of calcite by corals and coralline algae and the breakdown and removal of the physical structure of the reef by biological and physical means. While the biologically related components of this equation have been intensively studied, a missing part of the equation is sediment export, a parameter that is presently poorly understood and quantified.  A key set of data documenting sediment export in a reef system was collected in Cane Bay at St. Croix in the US Virgin Islands just after Hurricane Hugo. Additional data was collected during fair weather conditions on the island for comparison. This new project collects similar data to that collected after Hurricane Hugo. It will allow a quantitative comparison between the various storms and an assessment of sediment export. Goals will be to characterize sediment removal from the northwestern insular shelf of St. Croix. Modeling, to be carried out by a collaborator from the US Geological Survey, will be focused on determining the relative roles of bottom shear versus storm surge during major storms in exporting sediment from coral reefs in tropical carbonate systems.",

Most recently, this has triggered severe coral-bleaching events and encouraged diseases that will reduce both coral abundance and the rate of calcium-carbonate production. At the same time, increases in tropical-cyclone activity will physically damage both reef organisms and framework. Cores have shown that sediment and rubble constitute at least half of the reef framework. Therefore, as more of these materials are exported, reef-building capacity will likely be reduced, and it will be harder for them to keep up with accelerating sea-level rise.</p>\n<p>More recent ?reef budgets? have used the balance between carbonate production and substrate loss due to bioerosion as a proxy for ?reef health?.&nbsp; However, to quantify the declining ability of reefs to keep pace with accelerating sea-level rise, we also need to understand how increasing storminess will affect the potential export of detrital material that is more susceptible to transport. Our earlier studies documented an order-of-magnitude increase in sediment export between fair-weather conditions and tropical storms. During Hurricane <em>Hugo</em> (Category 4 - 1989), sediment export increased by yet another order of magnitude along the northwest shelf of St. Croix.</p>\n<p>This study revisited Cane Bay following the passage of Hurricanes <em>Irma</em> and <em>Maria</em> in late 2017. Based on our post-<em>Hugo</em> study and the growing storm literature since 1989, we expected to see significantly greater sediment losses as a result of these back-to-back Category 5 storms. However, measurements during our most-recent study generally revealed only moderate losses (Figs. 1 and 2). In some instances, we even found minor sediment accumulation (Fig. 3).</p>\n<p>The message from all of this appears to be that storm intensity alone is an imperfect predictor of off-shelf sediment transport. The eye walls of both <em>Irma</em> and <em>Maria</em> passed close to or over St. Croix. Maximum wind speeds exceeded what had been measured during <em>Hugo</em>. However, both storms were moving much faster, resulting in a shorter duration of hurricane-force winds. Also, as <em>Irma</em> and <em>Maria</em> approached St. Croix, the wind direction was less conducive to significant storm surge at Cane Bay. During <em>Hugo</em>, counterclockwise circulation around the eye piled water up (ca 2 m) against the inner shelf. As the storm passed, this trapped water was suddenly released as winds shifted from onshore to offshore. The intense offshore currents were the main factor in the tremendous volume of sediment loss from the Cane Bay shelf margin.</p>\n<p>During <em>Irma</em> the eye passed just north of St. Thomas and St. John (Fig. 3). The shorter fetch between the northern islands and St. Croix (ca. 60 km) significantly limited the ability for even Category 5 winds to build the larger and longer waves associated with Hurricane <em>Hugo</em>. During <em>Maria</em>, the eye wall skirted the south coast of St. Croix and winds blew to the west along Cane Bay (i.e., parallel to the north coast) and strong offshore currents were either limited or absent altogether.</p>\n<p>As storm intensity increases in the future, greater damage can be expected both on land and across nearshore reefs. Damage to corals and other calcifying organisms will temporarily reduce the volume of calcium carbonate available for reef building. At the same time, reef framework will be reduced to rubble. However, any metric for predicting a reef?s ability to keep up with accelerating sea-level rise must consider the fate of detrital material created by the breakdown of reef framework and not just the abundance of corals. If storm debris remains in the reef system, the composition of the reef interior will change, but accretion will be largely unchanged. For reef building to decline, this material must be permanently removed. This study clearly shows that such losses require a storm path that encourages strong storm surge as the hurricane approaches followed by a sudden release of the water trapped across the inner shelf. For St. Croix, this is a major hurricane approaching from the southeast and passing obliquely over the area.</p>\n<p><em>Hugo</em>, (1989), <em>Irma</em> and <em>Maria</em> (2019) all tracked directly over the US Virgin Islands. Maximum wind speeds during <em>Irma</em> and <em>Maria</em> were actually stronger on St. Croix than those associated with <em>Hugo</em>. However, the slower movement of <em>Hugo</em> and its specific path over St. Croix created a more intense storm surge at Cane Bay followed by much stronger currents (&gt; 1 m/sec) flowing off the Cane Bay shelf. As climate warms, storms will intensify. This will lead to greater damage on land and in shallow nearshore areas. However, if we are to fully understand the effects of more severe storms on reef building and their ability to keep up with rising sea level, we will need to better understand the fate of detrital material created by both physical and biological forces going forward.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 06/06/2020<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Dennis&nbsp;K&nbsp;Hubbard</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1821104/1821104_10529571_1591106436834_channelerosion--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1821104/1821104_10529571_1591106436834_channelerosion--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Shelf-edge erosion\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1821104/1821104_10529571_1591106436834_channelerosion--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Shelf-edge erosion\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Photograph of erosion in a shelf-edge channel at Cane Bay (NW St. Croix USVI) following the passage of Hurricanes Irma and Maria.
