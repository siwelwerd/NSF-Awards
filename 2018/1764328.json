 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics, and Mechanisms B Program of the Chemistry Division.  Professor Kendall N. Houk of the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, and Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering is developing new computational methods to understand chemical reactivity, mechanisms, and selectivities.  Professor Houk's group has pioneered in this area and continues to demonstrate to organic chemists in how computation is a crucial adjunct to their experimental research.  New methods of theory and simulation will be demonstrated for the experimental community.  Theoretical support to experimentalists throughout the country will be provided through collaborations, leading to broadening the horizons of participating experimental and computational scientists. Undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctorals will all be trained in the use of theory and computation as a companion to experiment for the solutions of chemical problems.\r\n\r\nMore technically, this project involves calculations of reaction paths and molecular dynamics of organic reactions, including reactions in solution.  This group will continue the study of ambimodal reactions that can form several products from one transition state.  Specific systems include:  the study of synthetically important reactions of the reactive intermediates, carbenes and benzynes;  Nickel catalyzed reactions;  cation electrostatic catalysts;  organocatalysts; cycloaddition reactions; dynamics of molecular machines, solid state rotors, and molecular gears;  and the functionalizations of graphene.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe NSF provided support for research on the use of computational methods to study how chemical reactions occur.  Because of our research, chemists are now closer to being able to predict the rates and products of pericyclic, organometallic, and organocatalytic reactions using computers.  Collaborations with experimental groups in the U.S. and many other countries led to understanding of what controls rates and selectivities of synthetically valuable reactions.  Our group has become well-known for developing ways to analyze the results of calculations.  We endeavor to describe the results of quantum mechanical and molecular dynamics calculations in ways that can be understood by experimentalists, who may not be expert in the theoretical methods that we use.  The grant also supported the training of experimental chemists in ways to perform these theoretical calculations and to use them in their work in the future.\n\n \n\nThe specific areas of research supported by this grant, described in more than 100 publications in major scientific journals, are:\n\n \n\n&bull; CH activation and cross-coupling reactions catalyzed by Pd, Ni, Rh, and other metal catalysts.  This is a hot area of investigation by synthetic chemists, and calculations supported by this grant have given detailed information about how these reactions occur.  These results will guide future experiments.\n\n \n\n&bull; Rates and selectivities of hydrogen-atom abstraction by oxyradicals.  These developments are now being followed up by work in our group on a general method for prediction of rates of CH activation to give radical intermediates, taking advantage of modern AI methods.\n\n \n\n&bull; Ambimodal reactions &ndash; reactions that can give two or more products from one transition state.  We have reported detailed quantum mechanical and molecular dynamics studies of many new pericyclic reactions of this type and have developed ways to predict product ratios.\n\n \n\n&bull;  We have discovered a general way that very polar polyenes can undergo electrocyclic reactions that violate the Woodward-Hoffmann Rules.\n\n \n\n&bull; With our collaborator, biosynthetic expert Yi Tang, we have established a new class of enzymes, the pericyclases &ndash; enzymes that catalyze pericyclic reactions.  We have reported together many new examples as well as developed more general ways to understand and control periselectivity &ndash; which competing pericyclic reaction product is favored.\n\n \n\n&bull; Our work has provided new understanding of organometallic mechanisms involving Pd, Ni, Co, Rh, Re, and Ru; stereoselectivities of allylborations of carbonyls; stereoselectivities of aldol reactions, cycloaddition and organometallic reactions used in in synthesis; and selectivities of ketene, keteniminium, and cyclic allene cycloadditions.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/27/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Kendall N Houk"
