 "awd_abstract_narration": "New and emerging Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) developments have the potential to accelerate scientific discovery and industrial growth with positive social impacts. However, big picture assessments of new and emerging ICT are often lacking, particularly from an international perspective. The European Commission, under its Horizon 2020 program, launched a 2016 project on ICT Policy, Research and Innovation for a Smart Society: Towards New Avenues in EU-US ICT Collaboration (the PICASSO project). Under this proposal, NSF will provide co-funding for US researchers to participate in a PICASSO project symposium focused on exploring emerging areas of ICT relevant to cooperation between researchers in the US and EU. This workshop, the 2nd Trans-Atlantic Symposium on ICT Technology and Policy, will be held at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars (the Wilson Center) in Washington, DC, on June 18-19, 2018.  The symposium will result in greater awareness of shared US/EU priorities and needs in ICT technology and policy and in enhanced collaborations. Attendance of approximately 100 is anticipated, with outreach designed to facilitate participation from groups that are historically under-represented in STEM.\r\n\r\nPervasive sensing and connectivity, large-scale secure data repositories, high-performance analytics in distributed and cloud platforms, real-time closed-loop applications, and robotics all offer individual advances in research and application areas, and will enable social, environmental, and economic benefits on unprecedented levels as the impacts of these technologies converge. Taking an international perspective, the goal of this workshop is to convene representatives from academia, industry, and government seeking to identify and advance collaborative research in new and emerging ICT areas. Specific thematic areas to be explored include Cyber Physical Systems (CPS), Internet of Things (IoT), big data, 5G and beyond, the future of automation, and cyber-resiliency, all of which are a high priority for the US and EU. The symposium will predominately feature a mix of keynote speeches and plenary panel discussions, through breakout sessions on the second day will allow researchers to discuss key technical aspects of different thematic areas in detail. This workshop will provide inputs to help define opportunities for US/ EU collaboration from a high-level road-mapping perspective. A final report will be prepared for NSF and the European Commission, and a version of this report will also be made publically available on websites of the Wilson Center and PICASSO project. The symposium will also identify opportunities for and advance collaborative research through networking participants from the US and EU.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis grant helped support the 2nd Transatlantic Symposium on ICT and Policy: Leveraging People, Technology, and Information for a Smart and Connected Society.   The conference was hosted at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, in Washington, DC on 18th-19th June 2018.  Co-sponsors included the Wilson Center, the European Commission-funded PICASSO Project, and Mississippi State University.\n\nIntellectual Impacts\n\nThe conference format facilitated in-depth discussion of innovative research in CPS, IoT, security, big data, 5G, and autonomous systems. \n\nFor CPS and IoT, participants noted that a current research challenge is the design and operation of Cyber-physical System of Systems (CPSoS), which must consist of many subsystems with some autonomy that change their structure over time, operate with changing demands and resources, and must react to faults and unplanned situations.  Such complexity mandates that activities are not performed in a centralized or manor, under a common authority, but rather must respect the autonomy of individual systems and focus on coordination over control.  Key topics with high potential for transatlantic cooperation include closing the loop in IoT-enabled Cyber-physical Systems; integration, interoperability, flexibility and reconfiguration; model-based systems engineering; trust, (cyber-)security, robustness, resilience, and dependability; autonomy and human-in-the-loop; and, situational awareness, diagnostics, and prognostics.\n\n IoT devices in public and private spaces are proliferating, but are not scaling in a manageable way from a cybersecurity point of view.  The way we build systems has reached a high level of complexity, and exposes EU and US alike to  vulnerabilities.  Research from three EU-funded cybersecurity projects suggests that predictive and preventative approaches, including security by design, should be used.  On the US side, the NIST cybersecurity framework explores certification and verification mechanisms for any device.  These can include security update verifications or enforce recovery mechanisms.  This is a productive area for future research.\n\nMany discussions on big data focused on ecosystem enablers.  The panel discussed the needed partnerships between government, enterprises and NGOs to foster big data ecosystem, services, research approaches (e.g. the forth paradigm era) and economy.  There are also specific needs for research and development to support big data management, particularly in the healthcare sector. \n\nFor 5G, many discussions focused on mmWave.  Potential health side effects are an urgent issue to explore, since there is neither agreement nor sufficient evidence available to determine whether RF heating might impose health problems.  THz communications and Edge intelligence are other important research areas for future technological developments to explore.  Opportunities for EU-US collaboration include physical layer deep learning, mmWave system deployment strategy and 5G above 52.6 GHz &amp; THz communications. \n\nFor the future of autonomous systems, conversations aligned with needs for fast and safe development of autonomous transportation systems and in particular Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) and autonomous ground vehicles.  Unmanned aerial systems are expected to bring important revenue in the future, and to be applied to many sectors (law enforcement, telecoms, forest fire, borders, coastguards, earth observation, and others).  The main enabler of these technologies is the development in the sensors? and robot?s area.  One of the aspects needing further research is Unmanned Traffic Management (UTM), especially through a decentralized approach.  New opportunities for the security and control of all these platforms also need to be considered.  Additional challenges include challenges comprise full-scale delivery; hybrid design; certification processes; data ownership, migration, consumption; privacy; mixed traffic; V2V, V2I, V2x. \n\nBroader Impacts\n\nThe relationship between technology and society is important to shape the future of research orientations.  This is true for the boundaries that the policy and legal framework sets to engineers and technology developments, as well as for the needs and requirements expressed by citizens.  In order to be effective in protecting human rights, it is important to design technologies in accordance with overlying principles, and not on a case-by-case basis.   Overarching frameworks can be developed with support from organizations like IEEE.  \n\nA critical topic in education is developing the skills necessary to understand, avoid, and mitigate ethical issues as they come up during data intensification.  The first point of departure is data literacy; systems that run on data depend on the participation and choices of the humans who use such systems ? and thus on their understanding of what data, which choices effect how data are shared, and how these decisions may have implications for an individual or others.  We must also consider how to teach e-Scientists about data and data ethics (what to teach and how).  \n\nProfessional development and workforce development are key concerns.  The development of professional skills and specialized curricula is the first precondition for fully exploiting the value of big data, and current academic programs and institutions are not capable to supply the needed skill combination.  New crosscutting and transdisciplinary academic courses have to be created for this purpose, and important potential collaboration areas between the US and the EU can be foreseen. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/10/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Anne Bowser"
