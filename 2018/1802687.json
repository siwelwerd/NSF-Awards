 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports participation in the 2018 Algorithmic Number Theory Symposium (ANTS XIII) held in Madison, Wisconsin on July 16 - 20, 2018.  The meeting is part of a biannual research conference series that specializes in problems related to computations on numbers and algorithms that answer questions about numbers.  Two examples of such problems are (1) given a number, determine if it is prime or composite and (2) given a composite number, determine its prime factorization.  Techniques for solving such problems are the foundation of internet security and digital commerce.  Approximately 130 mathematicians participate in each meeting. The research presented will be compiled into a proceedings volume of peer-reviewed papers.  For more information, visit  http://www.math.grinnell.edu/~paulhusj/ants2018/.\r\n\r\nThe Algorithmic Number Theory Symposium is a leading scientific venue for dissemination and catalysis of novel research in the fields of algorithmic and computational number theory.  The meeting is devoted to algorithmic aspects of number theory, including elementary number theory, algebraic number theory, analytic number theory, geometry of numbers, arithmetic algebraic geometry, finite fields, and cryptography. Speakers submit papers that are peer-reviewed, selected through a competitive process, and subsequently compiled into a proceedings volume.  Funding is available for graduate students and other early-career mathematicians.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n            The Thirteenth Algorithmic Number Theory Symposium (ANTS XIII) occurred July 16-20, 2018 in Madison, WI, USA.  ANTS is the premier international forum for new research in computational number theory, featuring experts in the fields of mathematics, computer science, and cryptography.  An example of an open problem in this area is the quest for a fast algorithm for factoring composite numbers; the hardness of this problem helps secure internet transactions. \n\n            Papers were chosen competitively through a peer-review process to ensure correctness and quality, and then authors summarized their work at the conference.  Topics ranged from practical advances in attacking and protecting digital security systems, to theoretical questions about numbers and computation that we expect will lead to future systems.  One plenary speaker discussed the threat quantum computers pose to the existing digital security infrastructure, and called on the audience to participate in the announced Post-Quantum Cryptography Standardization project, run by the National Institute of Standards and Technology.\n\n            All papers were edited for a proceedings volume.  This compendium of high-quality research is available for free as part of the Open Book Series published by Mathematical Sciences Publishers.\n\n            The conference featured 5 plenary speakers and 28 contributed talks.  There were 107 conference attendees representing 13 countries, with 58% of the participants being residents of the USA and 38% of the participants being students.  Demographic information was requested, and 27 of the conference attendees (or 25%) identified as female, though many chose not to volunteer information.  The organizers are grateful to the National Science Foundation and the National Security Agency for providing funding that enabled young researchers to attend and be exposed to cutting-edge research.\n\n            The conference successfully met all objectives.  A venue was provided for presenting high-quality research, the results are available to all online at no additional cost, and the large number of students will contribute to a bright future through the study of mathematics and computer security.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/28/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Andrew Shallue"
