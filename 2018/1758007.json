 "awd_abstract_narration": "This REU Site award to the University of California Berkeley (UCB), located in Berkeley, CA, will support the training of 12 students for 10 weeks during the summers of 2018 - 2021. The theme of the REU is \"Integrating Biology from Molecules to Ecosystems.\" The program offers research training in molecular biology, cell biology, developmental biology, physiology, and ecology. Evolution is central theme and inherent part of all research programs included in the program. Students will be able to conduct research in areas that could include anything from gene regulation and cell morphogenesis, to examining environmental factors that alter developmental trajectories in whole animals, to studying evolution in the field. In addition to the intensive research experience (with students mentored by faculty members and doctoral or postdoctoral students), the program offers an intensive week of introductory courses, a weekly research seminar presented by faculty members from across campus, writing and oral communication exercises, ethics training, a weekly professional development course, and a balanced social/recreational program. Students will assess the program by using the REU common assessment tool. The UCB REU program seeks students interested in pursuing graduate school and research careers in the biological sciences. Student applications are assessed by the PI, co-PI and training faculty.\r\n\r\nIt is anticipated that a total of 48 undergraduate students, primarily from schools with limited research opportunities, will be trained in the program. One of the program goals is to increase the number of women, underrepresented minorities, first generation students, students from low income backgrounds and students with disabilities who pursue graduate degrees in the biological sciences. Students in the program will learn how research is conducted, and enhance their skills and confidence to do science. Many will present the results of their work at scientific conferences, improving their chance to get into the most competitive graduate programs in the country. Further, the UCB REU program will strengthen ties with colleges and universities that serve the targeted student populations. \r\n\r\nStudents are required to be tracked after the program and must respond to an automatic email sent via the NSF reporting system. More information is available by visiting http://mcb.berkeley.edu/nsfreu/ or by contacting the PI (Dr. Gian Garriga at garriga@berkeley.edu or co-PI (Dr. Tyrone B. Hayes at tyrone@berkeley.edu).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
