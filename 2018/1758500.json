 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Noyce Track 1 project, Math and Science Scholars for the Inland Empire, aims to enhance mathematics and science teaching in San Bernardino City Unified School District (SBCUSD), one of California's most challenged public-school districts. This project will address the shortage of well-qualified secondary STEM teachers in SBCUSD through effective teacher preparation and support. It will also support long-term capacity building by expanding professional development activities for master teachers in the district, including training to effectively mentor new teachers. This project builds upon the success of prior Noyce grants and seeks to 1) strengthen and expand recruitment of both mathematics and science Scholars at California State University-San Bernardino, as well as master teachers in the SBCUSD who will mentor the Scholars;  and 2) build a cadre of teacher leaders in the district who are effective at and passionate about mentoring both Noyce Scholars and new teacher at their schools.\r\n\r\nThis project aims to recruit 25 secondary science and mathematics teachers from a viable pool of STEM majors at California State University-San Bernardino. The project will provide Noyce scholars with extensive preparation for teaching, including early field experiences in a high-need school. Supports from mentor teachers before and after the Noyce Scholars earn their teaching credentials are intended to assist in retaining these highly-qualified teachers in high need school districts.  A new Early Teaching Experience in Mathematics and Science component will be introduced at the institution to improve recruitment of STEM majors, thus growing the pipeline of future STEM teachers. Additionally, the project will develop an innovative support network that features campus enrichment activities, an online Noyce Scholars community, and an extensive mentoring program with in-service teachers in the area. The project's research agenda includes investigation of the extent to which the classroom-based mentoring model that will be implemented improves teacher retention and new teacher preparedness.  The overarching benefit of this project is in its intent to develop 25 well-prepared STEM teachers.  The project also has potential value to other universities and districts that want to develop successful recruiting and mentoring programs for pre-service teachers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
