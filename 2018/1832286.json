 "awd_abstract_narration": "Studies of Earth's past climate and oceans are important for developing an understanding of the range of possible behaviors in the climate system. This project seeks to reconstruct the history of the \"Agulhas Leakage\" from the Indian Ocean into the Atlantic Ocean, and to understand how changes in this leakage are related to past climate and the ocean's circulation. The Agulhas Current is a large boundary current (similar to the Gulf Stream) that flows southward along the southeast African margin. When it gets to the southern tip of Africa, most of the current turns back to the east, but some rings spin off into the Atlantic. This leakage brings water that is saltier than Atlantic water into the Atlantic, and this salt is carried by surface currents, including the Gulf Stream, to the far North Atlantic where it contributes to the formation of North Atlantic Deep Water. Thus, the Agulhas Current system is a key part of the ocean's large-scale overturning circulation. Changes in climate factors in the past may have led to changes in this system, and the goal of this project is to investigate such changes by combining evidence for the surface and deep ocean circulation from sediment cores collected on International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) Expedition 361. The location of Site U1479 is ideal for making proxy records for both the surface and deep ocean, so it will be possible to simultaneously examine the changes and linkages between Agulhas Leakage and NADW production using a broad suite of geochemical tools. The project involves extensive international collaboration with the scientists from the expedition and will include training and mentorship of a diverse research team that includes undergraduates, graduate students, a postdoctoral fellow and an early career faculty member.\r\n\r\nThe project seeks to detail the relative timing of variability in Agulhas Leakage and North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) through the last glacial cycle (0-150 kyr) and over the mid-Pleistocene transition (MPT, 0.7-1.3 Ma), an important time of reorganization of the climate system that took place in the absence of changes in the underlying orbital forcing. The variability of Agulhas Leakage will be studied using detailed terrigenous clay provenance analyses, while the NADW variations will be studied with Nd-isotopes in fish teeth and foraminifera coatings. The primary site proposed for the combined deep and surface signal is IODP Site U1479, which is currently bathed in NADW and located where the Agulhas rings are shed into the South Atlantic, comprising the Agulhas Leakage. Additionally, clay provenance proxies from Site U1474, which is located near the beginning of the fully-constituted Agulhas Current, will constrain any end-member changes to the terrigenous composition of the Agulhas endmember. Because the data for both sets of proxies will be collected from the same samples, and also from the same samples that are being processed for benthic isotope stratigraphy, the relative timing of changes in the composition of the Agulhas endmember, the amount of Agulhas leakage, and the changes in NADW will be co-registered. IODP Expedition 361 collected sedimentary records from the broader Agulhas Current System that provide an unparalleled opportunity to examine in detail linkages between the Agulhas Leakage and Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) as well as linkages between the Agulhas Current System and southern African climates.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Most of these waters are re-circulated into the Indian Ocean, but a portion is transported as rings and eddies into the South Atlantic. This \"Agulhas Leakage\" is recognized as an important source of heat and salt to the Atlantic Ocean which, in turn, contributes to deep convection in the North Atlantic the formation of North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW). Agulhas Leakage and NADW formation are both parts of the global overturning circulation, a system of ocean currents that transports heat, salt, nutrients, and carbon between the world's oceans. As such, an important question is whether changes in Agulhas Leakage drive changes in the overturning, or whether the Agulhas Leakage is responding to upstream changes driven by some other mechanism.</p>\n<p>The objective of this collaborative study was to document the variability of Agulhas Leakage and of North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) export during the last 150,000 years and over the Mid-Pleistocene Transition (700,000-1,300,000 years ago) using geochemical proxies for sediment provenance and bottom water composition. In particular, we wanted to document the temporal relationship between Agulhas Leakage and NADW variations (i.e. does one lead and the other lag behind?). We used samples from two deep-sea sediment cores, Site U1479 in the Agulhas Leakage area, and Site U1474, beneath the Agulhas Current. Both sites are currently bathed in NADW. Each sample was split into size fractions for the different proxy analyses so that all measurements from a given sample represent the same time interval.</p>\n<p>Results for the clay fraction reveal that the relationship between clay geochemistry and provenance is complex. To fully understand the role of varying inputs of Agulhas derived clay requires multiple isotope ratios and elemental concentrations, measured on subsamples of different grain sizes and compared with grain size measurements.</p>\n<p>Clay geochemistry at the upstream site (U1474) varies systematically with climate, indicating that the composition of the Agulhas clay source has changed with time. This is interpreted as changes in continental weathering and/or varying discharge from different catchment areas caused by changes in rainfall associated with the precession of Earth's orbit. We found that some, but not all of these compositional variations are seen at the Leakage site. When the two sites converge, that indicates the presence of Agulhas waters at Site U1479, and implies a strong Agulhas Leakage. That Leakage is inferred to be reduced when the two sites diverge. Our results suggest strong Leakage during the warm, interglacial periods and reduced Leakage during colder, glacial stages.</p>\n<p>Clay geochemistry and deep-ocean circulation monitored by Nd-isotopes in foraminifera coatings co-vary throughout most the record with more Agulhas waters coinciding with more NADW at Site U1479. There is no consistent lead-lag relationship, but we can look in detail at the sequence of changes during specific climate events. For example, descending into glacial marine isotope stage 24, which marks the onset of the \"900-ky event\", we see that changes in deep-ocean proxies lead changes in clay geochemistry, indicating that deep ocean circulation changes were fundamentally important to that event.</p>\n<p>This work contributed to our collective understanding of a key component of the climate system over time periods that extend beyond the timescales of human observations.
