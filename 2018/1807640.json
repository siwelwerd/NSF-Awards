 "awd_abstract_narration": "A fuel cell (FC) is an electrochemical device that converts chemical energy into electrical energy through catalyzed reactions. Recent efforts in developing alternative, renewable and sustainable energy sources have led to increased research aimed at building viable FC configurations. FCs could be used in many applications from portable electronics, commercial buildings, and residential power, to utility-scale applications. Conventional, commercial FC catalysts are often based on platinum (Pt) and similar precious metals, but these systems tend to have serious performance problems and can be cost prohibitive. In this project, Dr. Stanislaus Wong of Stony Brook University is designing new classes of cheaper and better-performing FC catalysts by investigating catalytic efficiency and cost-effectiveness. These objectives are achieved through a holistic consideration of key reaction variables such as the size, shape, and composition of the underlying catalyst support.  His research group correlates these factors with the FC performance to improve cost efficiency and sustainability.  Professor Wong seeks to ensure the full participation of underrepresented minority students in science. To do this, he creates the SCI-LIFE discussion initiative, to provide students with the opportunity to receive important career information from professional researchers and scientists.  SCI-LIFE invites researchers and scientists from academia, industry, and government to give informal talks to the students, describing not only their research interests but how they address and tackle potential career concerns, fears, questions, and misconceptions.\r\n\r\nWith funding from the Macromolecular, Supramolecular, and Nanochemistry (MSN) Program of the Chemistry Division, Dr. Wong is probing the morphology- and composition-dependence of the catalytic behavior of novel nanoscale electrocatalysts. He is examining the fundamental, individual mechanistic roles of the effects of a one-dimensional morphology, a core-shell motif, the deliberate addition of a transition metal dopant (i.e. alloy core composition), and the effect of the underlying support upon the associated methanol oxidation reaction activity and kinetics.  Nanoscale electrocatalysts are being synthesized, consisting of platinum monolayer shells supported on and circumscribing ultrathin nanowire cores. These model systems are then immobilized onto either perovskite or hybrid supports. The structure and electrocatalytic properties of the ultrathin, one-dimensional, core-shell system are then examined with a suite of complementary characterization techniques, including in situ methods.  These studies address the structural and electronic origins of catalytic enhancement within novel catalyst-support systems.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
