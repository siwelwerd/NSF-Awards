 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Gulf of Maine, and the northwest Atlantic in general, has warmed at four times the global average rate over the last 34 years, and since 2004, the Gulf of Maine has warmed at a rate faster than 99% of the world's oceans. The observed warming has been shown to have marked impacts on species distribution, fisheries productivity and the economic viability of fisheries. The Gulf of Maine fishery ecosystem presents an ideal system for students to explore coupled natural and human system dynamics. The Gulf of Maine Research Institute will host a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site that will bring six students to Portland, ME each summer for three years. The program will conduct a national search for applicants and seek to engage students who are from schools with limited research opportunities. Most of the funding provided supports student stipends, housing and travel to attend the program. This project supports the national goals of developing the next generation of scientists and the scientific workforce.\r\n\r\nEighteen REU students at GMRI will explore the structure and function of the Gulf of Maine fishery ecosystem (plankton to seafood), how it is changing over time (trends and prediction), how it responds to perturbations (e.g., climate and fishing), and how changes may affect local economies. They will develop independent, hypothesis-driven research projects and will be exposed to multiple scientific approaches, including classic experimental ecology, observational science, and statistical and dynamical modeling. The primary objective of the program is to train the next generation of scientists capable of describing, quantifying and communicating the interconnections between environmental and human influences on marine ecosystems. Students will receive training and professional development, including safety training, ethics training, and data management, analysis and scientific communications workshops. Activities include a journal club, regular seminars and a final student symposium.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The Gulf of Maine is warming faster than 96% of the global ocean, meaning GMRI is strategically positioned to conduct cutting-edge research on this issue. This includes documenting and monitoring change, as well as predicting and mitigating future impacts of climate change on ecosystems and the people who depend on them. This award allowed us to involve undergraduate students in our work and contribute to our understanding of climate change and its impacts on our coastal and marine ecosystems, communities, and industries. Students were paired with GMRI researchers engaged in a range of climate, ecosystem, fisheries, oceanographic, economic, social science, and interdisciplinary studies. Students were given the opportunity to work with their mentors to design and conduct an intensive 10-week independent research project. Projects involved field sampling (particularly as part of our long-term monitoring effort - Casco Bay Aquatic Systems Survey or CBASS), laboratory experiments, data compilation and analysis, computational simulations, policy analysis or any range of top tier research methods that help them address their research questions. Throughout the summer students took part in regular workshops and meetings designed to provide training in ethics, data analysis and statistics (e.g., R coding), scientific communication and critical thinking (via journal clubs). At the end of the summer, students further developed confidence as researchers by presenting their findings at an in-house research symposium using analysis and communications skills honed throughout the summer (see attachments for presentation titles in each year; note that the total number of presenters in these schedules exceeds 20 students because other non-REU-participating interns were invited to present their summer work as well). In addition to focusing on independent and impactful research projects, students at the GMRI REU site were also exposed to a range of initiatives ongoing at GMRI, including those within our Education, Community, Climate Center, and Ventures programs, all interactions that provided valuable career and graduate student advice from staff with widely varied academic and career trajectories. Feedback indicated that this was one of the most appreciated aspects of the program (see attached image for feedback on a range of program aspects and skills development).</p>\n<p><strong>Broader Impacts:&nbsp;</strong>This award allowed GMRI to engage 20 undergraduate students from diverse backgrounds in cutting-edge research as described above. Note that this award funded 6 students per year from 2019-2021 (total of 18); an additional 2 students took part in the program with funding from other sources. Of the 20 students who took part in this REU, 12 are known to have gone on to graduate school; an exit survey indicated that the summer REU was an important factor in their decision to do so. Most of the other students entered research (STEM) careers outside of academia. Of note, this REU partially focused on providing opportunities to students from 2-year community college programs. Of the 4 students from Southern Maine Community College that took part in this program, 2 have gone on to complete 4-year degrees and start graduate school. With funding from this award, students who took part in the REU had the opportunity to attend national and international conferences. Examples include the <em>Ocean Sciences</em> meeting (San Diego 2020; prior to shutdown) and the <em>Benthic Ecology Meeting</em> (Portsmouth 2021). Unfortunately, opportunities to attend conferences in person were limited due to the pandemic. That stated, this REU provided a valuable virtual leaning experience for students at the beginning of the pandemic (when many other opportunities were cancelled) and one of the first in-person experiences for students in 2021, something that was highly appreciated by students who had no in-person contact at their schools for over a year. While this REU site focused on developing research skills, including oral presentations, and less on writing, one student published his work in the primary literature: Falciani, J.E., Grigoratou, M., Pershing, A.J. 2022.
