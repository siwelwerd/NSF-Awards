 "awd_abstract_narration": "Careers involving the understanding and use of Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS), commonly known as drones, are developing rapidly. A wide range of careers, from precision agriculture and crop insurance to real estate and police work, need trained UAS technicians. In addition, industries are discovering new needs for UAS and industries that use UAS are finding new ways to benefit from the data and imagery gathered by UAS. To meet these increasing demands, Parkland College will develop UAS courses and certificates with a focus on agricultural applications. This project will include the participation of five other community colleges, three four-year institutions, and industry partners. The new curriculum will advance UAS technician education so that students earn relevant credentials that will prepare them for jobs after completion. The project will focus on recruiting women and veterans into the UAS program, and will engage high schools and universities to enhance educational avenues into UAS technology careers. Students who graduate with credentials in UAS technologies should be able to enter a high-growth STEM industry that is expected to need many workers in the next decade. \r\n\r\nThe central goal of the project is to develop UAS curricula at Parkland College that meet industry needs in the major agricultural hub of Central Illinois and its surrounding area, which is expanding the use of UAS technologies. The newly-developed courses will be based on existing courses from partnering community colleges but with an emphasis on UAS applications for agricultural industries. Topics covered in the courses will include flight controllers, aerodynamics, managing data, regulations, and safety and operational considerations. The courses will be combined to create 6-credit and 18-credit UAS certificates. Industry input about curricular content will be integrated into designing the credentials so that the credentials appropriately prepare technicians for jobs in the UAS sector. The project team also aims to develop articulation agreements with universities offering UAS degrees. These connections will ensure that the new curriculum will be transferable for students wishing to continue their education. Project outreach activities will focus on recruiting women and veterans into the program, and foster associations with regional high schools. The products and best practices from the project will be disseminated through coordination with community college and university partners as well as online at multiple NSF-ATE Centers, including the National Geospatial Technology Center of Excellence.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Over the course of the project, three new courses and two certificates were created to produce qualified workers.  An advisory board was created that played an instrumental role in assuring that the curriculum aligns with industry needs as well as offering internship positions and employment opportunities for program graduates. \n\nThe UAS program saw a steady increase in enrollment, despite the impacts of COVID.  The program goal of enrolling 50 unique students was well exceeded with an enrollment of 134 unique students.   The project has also shown an increase in program diversity through the enrollment of minority students, particularly female students.  Marketing materials were created as well as targeted outreach events to attract a more diverse student population.  Throughout the four years of the grant, female enrollment averaged 19%, well above the project goal of 10%. \n\nTo help create a pathway for high school students, UAS training workshops were offered to teachers that resulted in the implementation of UAS in high school classrooms across the state of Illinois.  Through these workshops, teachers were provided training to obtain their commercial UAS certificate and received hands on training to fly drones as well as using simulation software.  For students looking to continue their education beyond a certificate or associate degree, an articulation agreement was created between Parkland College and Lewis University, a 4-year institution.  \n\nThe UCID project has had a demonstrable impact by creating a UAS program to serve as a model to other institutions, positive overall enrollment numbers as well as increased diversity, performing outreach to high schools, and creating a path to continuing education at a 4-year institution.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/22/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Amanda Briggs"
