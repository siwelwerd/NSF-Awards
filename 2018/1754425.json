 "awd_abstract_narration": "Species diversity varies dramatically across the tree of life: some groups of organisms, such as beetles and flowering plants, contain far more species than most other groups of organisms. Understanding how and why some groups have come to be more species-rich than other groups is a central and unsolved problem in the life sciences. One class of explanations for these differences in species numbers involves the rate at which new species arise. Using tools from genome biology and computational data science, this project will identify the mechanisms that lead to different rates of species formation and quantify their importance in a major group of vertebrate animals.  The project will provide training in genomics, geographic information systems, computational biology, and biodiversity science for students and researchers at the undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral levels. Genomic resources and new scientific software developed for the project will be made publicly available, and a museum exhibit will highlight the ways in which genomics and computer programming are changing the way scientists study and understand the diversity of life forms on Earth.\r\n\r\nThis project will produce a novel synthesis between population biology and large-scale patterns of species diversity by integrating next-generation population genomics with a phylogenetic comparative perspective on lineage diversification rates. The project will quantify the genomic signal of several population processes to address how rates of population splitting and persistence influence speciation rates as measured on time-calibrated phylogenetic trees. These objectives will be supported by estimating phylogeographic and population genomic parameters across many species of squamate reptiles that vary in rates of speciation, and by developing new methods to link these parameters to diversification rates on phylogenetic trees. The project will also assess how organismal traits (life history, dispersal biology, population size) contribute to demographic processes that can influence the formation and persistence of incipient species. The project will provide a bridge between biological processes that occur at two very different timescales and will provide an understanding of how changes in populations at ecological timescales affect changes in biological diversity at deep (million-year) timescales.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Previous research has shown that there is a lot of variability in the rates species accumulate in different groups (i.e., species diversification). Diversification rates variation is a major factor explaining why some groups have more species than others. However, we still know very little about how population level processes (i.e., microevolution) can influence genetic divergence, speciation, and/or extinction, and therefore scale up to shape the patterns we see in the entire tree of life (i.e., macroevolution). We also know very little about what ecological and biogeographical factors may contribute to this large variability on diversification rates. Our project brings a comprehensive approach to understand diversification rates in squamates (lizards, snakes and amphisbaenians), which consists of over 10,000 living species. We obtained genetic material with collaborators in Brazil for multiple species from different groups of squamates. We use a new technique designed for this project to produce a large genomic dataset. We also combined information available from published sources with the dataset we generated to produce a comprehensive squamate phylogeny which we used for multiple project goals.</p>\n<p>We used our dataset on multiple species from the savannahs of central Brazil (the Brazilian Cerrado) to explore how the tendency for population isolation is related to speciation rate in lizards and snakes. Populations that evolve reproductive barriers quickly and become more isolated should form new species at faster rates than populations that acquire reproductive barriers more slowly and are less isolated. Contrary to our expectations, our results showed no connection between the population isolation parameters and the broad-scale patterns of species diversification. These results suggest that other stages of the speciation process are likely to play a more important role than population isolation to produce the speciation rate variation we see in squamates.</p>\n<p>We also used the phylogeny from this project to calculate speciation rates for squamates and test multiple hypotheses about what ecological and biogeographical factors may explain the variation in squamate speciation rates. We gathered several ecological traits that were previously hypothesized as being important to explain diversification rates. Contrary to our expectations we found little support for all the previously proposed mechanisms to explain variation in speciation rate. Interestingly, we found strong evidence that snakes have remarkably fast diversification rates when compared to other squamates. We find that multiple characteristics associated with morphology, feeding ecology, and sensory ecology all showed major shifts early in the evolutionary history of snakes. More broadly our results suggest that high diversification rates within large-scale phylogenies cannot be predicted from specific mechanisms and seems to be an idiosyncratic phenomenon.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 08/26/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Gabriel&nbsp;C&nbsp;Costa</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1754425/1754425_10532233_1661529348698_Mateiros_TO_2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1754425/1754425_10532233_1661529348698_Mateiros_TO_2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Brazilian Cerrado\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1754425/1754425_10532233_1661529348698_Mateiros_TO_2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Brazilian Cerrado\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Brazilian Cerrado landscape in the region of Mateiros, state of Tocantins.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Guarino Colli</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Gabriel&nbsp;C&nbsp;Costa</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Brazilian Cerrado</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1754425/1754425_10532233_1661529500813_Chironius_flavolineatus_AltoParaisodeGoias_GO--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1754425/1754425_10532233_1661529500813_Chironius_flavolineatus_AltoParaisodeGoias_GO--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Chironius flavolineatus\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1754425/1754425_10532233_1661529500813_Chironius_flavolineatus_AltoParaisodeGoias_GO--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Chironius flavolineatus\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Chironius flavolineatus a snake from the Brazilian Cerrado.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Guarino Colli</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Gabriel&nbsp;C&nbsp;Costa</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Chironius flavolineatus</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1754425/1754425_10532233_1661529579425_Tropidurus_oreadicus_Carolina_MA--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1754425/1754425_10532233_1661529579425_Tropidurus_oreadicus_Carolina_MA--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Tropidurus oreadicus\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1754425/1754425_10532233_1661529579425_Tropidurus_oreadicus_Carolina_MA--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Tropidurus oreadicus\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Tropidurus oreadicus, a lizard species typical from the Brazilian Cerrado.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Guarino Colli</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Gabriel&nbsp;C&nbsp;Costa</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Tropidurus oreadicus</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
