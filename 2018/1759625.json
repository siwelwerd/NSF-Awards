 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the sequencing of the Human genome and the dawn of the genome age, physicians and scientists have a complete 'parts-list' - DNA and protein sequences - for the machinery in the cells of thousands of different organisms, from people to plants to bacteria. But, because we cannot look at the machines or their parts directly, some of the details are incorrect.  The methods produce incorrect details in part because they were developed in the 'pre-genome' era, when our parts lists were far less complete, and in part because we use the parts-list from one organism (mouse) to help us identify the parts in another organism (rat).  But, if the first set of parts (protein sequences) has errors, those errors can end up in the second set, and as more organisms are studied, the errors multiply.  Incorrect protein sequences make it more difficult to identify mutations that may be associated with cancer and other diseases.  Today, protein sequence quality control largely relies on the accuracy of other protein sequences.  This proposal seeks to greatly expand the types of information used to confirm that the details (sequences) of the cellular machinery are correct, and to collaborate with the Uniprot protein sequence database to ensure that incorrect sequences are corrected and so that future analyses do not repeat mistakes.  The proposed research will increase researchers' confidence that exciting differences between phenotypes, such as diseased and normal cells, or different strains of food crops, are genuine, and not the result of mistaken protein sequences.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe UniProt Reference protein sets are a critical resource, providing a foundation for advances in genome biology, structure/function prediction, and personalized medicine. But Reference protein sets have characteristic errors that can be amplified in genome annotation, reducing the accuracy of functional annotation and similarity search sensitivity. This project is a collaboration with the Uniprot protein resource that will develop novel strategies for identifying protein sequence errors; these strategies will be incorporated into the Uniprot annotation pipelines to remove erroneous sequences from Reference databases. Initially, errors will be found by integrating exon-boundary and Pfam domain annotations into BLAST-based similarity search results to identify currently recognized errors, such as missing/additional exons and partial domains. In addition, strategies will be developed to detect currently unrecognized errors, by clustering similar proteins and looking for 'outliers'. Lists of 'suspect' protein sequences will be examined by Uniprot annotators and classified as true or mistaken errors, and successful error detection strategies will be refined and integrated into the Uniprot annotation pipeline, reducing functional annotation errors.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nProtein sequences are among the most informative and widely used resources available to molecular biologists, genome biologists, and other life scientists who are exploring the molecular basis of disease, and detailed questions about how the machinery of life works. Proteins are the \"machines\" of living organisms when they act as enzyme catalysts, but they are also the scaffolding of the cell in their structural roles.  Because understanding protein function is so critical to understanding health and disease, it is critical that protein sequence databases provide accurate protein sequences.\n\n Providing accurate sequences can be difficult, because some genes that encode proteins are capable of producing multiple proteins from the same gene.  Selecting the \"correct\" representative protein sequence is challenging, and in the past, simple rules -- pick the longest sequence -- were often used, even though such a simple rule ignores both biological and evolutionary information.\n\nIn this project, we collaborated with the Uniprot protein sequence resource to develop a more biologically accurate strategy for selecting representative protein sequences.  At the beginning of the project, we examined how to detect biologically unlikely protein sequences, and we imagined several strategies for improving protein sequence accuracy.  During the last half of the project, we developed a relatively simple strategy for representative sequence selection -- pick sequences that are most similar in length to members of the same protein family in different organisms.  Thus, if a mouse had a well characterized enzyme that was 200 amino-acids long, the rat, and even human versions of the same protein should have a very similar length (which happens about 90% of the time in current databases).  We have built a sequence analysis pipeline that collects the different forms of a protein from different mammals (human, mouse, rat, chimp, gorilla, cow, dog, and opossum), aligns those sequences, and finds clusters of sequences of similar length.  Some of those clusters contain well characterized proteins, while other clusters contain variant forms of unknown (and often questionable) function.  Our analysis pipeline suggests changes to the current protein sequence database when it appears that the wrong protein has been chosen to be representative.\n\nThis pipeline will be correcting the content 8 mammals in the Uniprot/Trembl protein sequence database, beginning with the first release of 2023.  With that release, we expect to correct about 7,000 proteins, out of about 160,000, mostly from less well characterized organisms (e.g., rat, cow, dog, and opossum).  Later next year, we hope to extend the approach to a larger number of mammals, and later to vertebrates and plant proteins.\n\nBecause current protein sequence analysis techniques often focus on \"unusual\" members of a family, correcting the 5 - 10% of proteins should dramatically improve our ability to predict protein function and the effect of pathological mutations.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/27/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: William R Pearson"
