 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Discovery Research K-12 program (DRK-12) seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools (RMTs). Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects\r\n\r\nThis EAGER project aims to conduct a study designed to operationalize a culturally responsive computing framework, from theory to empirical application, by exploring what factors can be identified and later used to develop items for an instrument to assess youths' self-efficacy and self-perceptions in computing and technology-related fields and careers. The project explores the constructs of culturally responsive computing across youths of diverse gender and racial identities (i.e., White, African American, Latino, Native American, Alaskan Native boys and girls) using a culturally responsive, participatory action research approach. \r\n\r\nThe project explores and develops the factor structure of an instrument on culturally responsive computing with diverse middle and high schoolers of intersecting identities. It uses culturally responsive methodologies to co-create an instrument for later validation that will assess youths' self-efficacy and self-perceptions in technology. The project will explore Culturally Response Computing constructs across variables by conducting observations, focus groups and interviews, and collect context data and information from teachers and students that will contribute to a series of case examples. The work involves a two-phase mixed-methods research study focused on assembling evidence to assess, design and validate a Culturally Responsive Computing Framework from theory to empirical application. A total of 50 students and teachers from four geographically diverse rural and urban areas and racial ethnic backgrounds will participate in co-creating constructs.",
