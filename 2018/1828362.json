 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is supported by the Major Research Instrumentation and the Chemistry Research Instrumentation programs. Professor Mykhailo Shatruk from Florida State University and colleagues Igor Alabugin, Susan Latturner, Biwu Man and James Frederich have acquired a microfocus, dual source single crystal diffractometer. In general, an X-ray diffractometer allows accurate and precise measurements of the full three-dimensional structure of a molecule, including bond distances and angles, and provides accurate information about the spatial arrangement of a molecule relative to neighboring molecules. The studies described here impact many areas, including organic and inorganic chemistry, materials chemistry and biochemistry. This instrument is an integral part of teaching as well as research and research training of graduate and undergraduate students in chemistry and biochemistry at this institution. Students are involved in chemical and protein research. The resource is also utilized by neighboring primarily undergraduate institutions. \r\n\r\nThe proposal is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels. It is especially useful for studying temperature-, and light-induced spin-state switching in molecule-based materials, for the identification of compounds prepared using molten metal fluxes. The diffractometer is also being used in investigations of phosphorescent molecules from halide perovskites for energy applications, and for structurally characterizing supramolecular species made from contorted carbon-rich molecules and nanomaterials. It is also employed for the characterization of synthesized natural products used to evaluate protein-protein interaction modulators.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
