 "awd_abstract_narration": "Earthquake recordings made by seismometers at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean contain important information about the structure and evolution of Earth's tectonic plates.  When a plate initially forms near a mid-ocean ridge, for example, pods of melt can become trapped within the plate as it cools.  These pockets of frozen melt have a different composition than the surrounding material and as such, alter how seismic waves propagate.  This project plans to examine existing data recorded by two arrays of ocean-bottom seismometers deployed in the western Pacific. Novel observational and modeling techniques will be used to search for pods of melt emplaced during the formation of the tectonic plate.  An important aspect of the project is to reconcile competing models of the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary, that is, the transition from the rigid lithospheric plate to the more pliable rock below.  Certain types of seismic observations suggest quite convincingly that the asthenosphere is mechanically weak relative to the overlying plate (lithosphere) but if this is the case, it is difficult to explain the existence of the seismic waves that are recorded.  One hypothesis, which will be explored thoroughly, is that the addition of small-scale structures such as the frozen melt pockets can reconcile the two observations.  The project supports the training of a postdoctoral investigator as well as undergraduate students.\r\n\r\n\r\nPn and Sn waves - high frequency guided waves traveling within the lithosphere - provide one of the few ways that the fine-scale structure of the lithosphere can be probed.  A detailed analysis of Pn and Sn waves recorded on two arrays of ocean-bottom seismometers (OBS) in the western Pacific will be carried out during this project.  By examining the detailed waveforms in addition to the traditional approach of modeling the overall shape of the coda, it will be possible to resolve the overall velocity structure of old oceanic lithosphere better, the amplitude and scale of heterogeneities within the lithosphere, and the attenuation structure of the lithosphere.  In turn, these observations will add to our understanding of the processes of lithospheric formation.  The approach will be to combine detailed data analysis using new analytical techniques applied to more high quality Pn and Sn records than ever available before with extensive modeling of propagation of seismic waves in 3-D heterogeneous media.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nA region southwest of the Shatsky Rise in the western Pacific is the oldest area that can be dated with identifiable magnetic anomalies. This ~155 million-year-old seafloor has not been significantly affected by subsequent seamount volcanism and thus represents an end-member for studies of lithospheric evolution and structure. We used S-waves from remote earthquake sources that are converted to p waves at seismic discontinuities to probe the underlying lithospheric and asthenospheric structure. The technique we used, called S-p receiver function analysis, revealed that two significant discontinuities must exist in the mantle: a raipd velocity decrease at 40-55 km depth and an increase at 130-150 km.\n\n\nModels of the S-velocity structure responsible for these two signals are non-unique. The simplest model has a velocity decrease of ~3% at about 45 km and a velocity increase at about 150 km. However, surface wave data and thermal models put lithospheric thickness at about 100 km in this area making the velocity decrease a mid-lithosphere discontinuity rather than marking the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary. In addition, efficient propagation of Pn and Sn phases require extended, thin, horizontal velocity contrasts within the plate and active source, wide-angle reflection experiments have detected multiple, sub-horizontal, seismic reflectors within old Pacific lithosphere. We demonstrate that the stacked receiver function is consistent with the eixstence of several low-velocity layers within the mid-lithosphere. Although not required, a velocity decrease at ~ 100 km improves the fit to the data (the decrease is partially obscured by a positive reverberation) . The deeper discontinuities at 100 and 150-km could represent gradients over distances of 10-20 km, rather than abrupt transitions.\n\n\nPutting it all together, our data is consistent with models of the formation and evolution of oceanic lithosphere. Near the mid-ocean ridges, pressure-release melting produces magma that migrates upward and is focussed to the ridge axis to form the new oceanic crust. Farther away from the axis, deeper melts may be trapped within the growing lithosphere and be frozen within the cooling plate to form sub-horizontal pockets of garnet-granulite (or dolomite, depending on composition). In our data, these trapped, frozen pokets appear as the mid-lithosphere discontinuity, there may be a lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary at ~100 km representing the top of an asthenospheric layer containing a small melt fraction, and the ~150-km discontinuity represents the disappearance of melt due to increeasing pressure.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/15/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: DonaldWForsyth\n"
