 "awd_abstract_narration": "With funding from the National Science Foundation Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (NSF S-STEM) program and in collaboration with regional industry partners, this project at Walla Walla Community College (WWCC) in Washington will coordinate activities between its Workforce Education and Transitional Studies departments to increase the recruitment, retention, and realization of students in four science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce education degree programs: engineering, agriculture, energy, and water. Because graduates from these four programs are in high demand by employers, this project is designed to impact degree completion, advanced education and job placement for students. Due to the demographics of the institution and the targeted recruitment of dual enrollment high school students and adult basic education/career change seeking students, the project will help to diversify the workforce. The project will generate knowledge on the efficacy of courses that use the Integrated Basic Education and Skills Training (I-BEST) model to facilitate degree completion at a rapid pace with good student performance by providing contextualized instruction combined with supplemental support in the classroom. Research will assess the effectiveness of recruitment strategies for dual enrollment students and adult basic education/career change seeking students. Research will also evaluate to what extent the implemented retention strategies result in STEM degree completion and placement in relevant STEM jobs and/or advanced STEM education. The project will have a broad impact by (1) studying, developing, and implementing effective strategies to recruit and enroll women, students of Latina/o origin, and other traditionally underserved populations into STEM workforce programs; (2) developing and evaluating the implementation of coordinated, evidence-based practices that facilitate retention and completion in STEM workforce education degree programs; and (3) disseminating the lessons learned from the recruitment, retention, and realization strategies and practices with the highest beneficial impacts to internal and external audiences.\r\n\r\nTo increase the number of academically talented students with demonstrated financial need who are retained in and complete a program in engineering, agriculture, energy, or water, the project will focus on combining financial support through scholarships with strategies that center on (a) developing learning communities through two required courses on learning strategies/human relations and job seeking skills, (b) regular advising by Navigators who are experts in available support services, (c) mentoring by faculty instructors, and (d) frequent opportunities for mentoring by and interactions with science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) industry professionals. Targeted recruitment activities that will be implemented include outreach to working farming families, outreach materials in Spanish and/or that feature women in STEM trades and professions, and quarterly open houses where STEM program demonstrations are promoted through community partners.",

Recruitment was significantly enhanced during this period and moved from single-program focus to a broader Workforce and STEM focus to capture the attention of more potential scholars. The addition of English-Spanish bi-lingual recruiters significantly enhanced these efforts. Originally, STEM scholar-only recruitment events were performed, but poorly attended and few converted to becoming scholars. When we implemented a more collaborative and broad recruiting plan and began recruiting current undecided students we enrolled more S-STEM scholars. These recruiting efforts targeted all potential scholars, but focused on individuals identifying as female and underserved populations in each program. The percentage of females in the programs was increased from 21% to 25-29% depending on the cohort and the percentage of Latinx students increased from 19% to 29-40% depending on cohort. A total of 70 unique scholars were funded to some extent, 38 of which graduated (~54%) and either entered the workforce or transferred and began work on a baccalaureate degree. This fell short of our retention and completion goals, but we were happy to see so much success in the face of the COVID -19 pandemic. Reasons for leaving the S-STEM program include poor academic performance, taking a leave of absence typically tied to online only education during the pandemic, choosing to be a part-time student (later part-time students became eligible), no longer being financially eligible, or switching to a non-STEM major. Anecdotally, it appeared that the students who engaged at a high level in student clubs were better retained and had a higher likelihood of completion. Of those scholars that graduated many went into STEM related fields immediately in positions such as farm manager, research assistant, electronics technician, and wastewater treatment plant operator. Several others went on to pursue baccalaureate degrees in Engineering, Agricultural Systems, Soil Science, and Natural Resources. Two of the scholars are now in graduate school studying Soil Science and Civil Engineering. Some of the broader impacts that we are realizing are enhanced societal mobility of underserved populations in Workforce related STEM areas as well as our institutions adoption of new recruitment models. Our College created Navigator positions on campus that help students navigate not only the academic side of their college experience, but also the financial side. These navigators have had a significant impact on first generation students and students from underserved populations. This was a challenging time in Higher Education, but it afforded us the opportunity to pivot and demonstrate what resilience looks like to our scholars. Results of this award have been communicated internally throughout the award period as well as with participation in the AAAS hosted NSF Fall Symposium in 2021 with a video submission.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/10/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: MatthewWWilliams\n"
