 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project, funded by the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry Division, Dr. Michael Harmata of the University of Missouri-Columbia is developing new methods for the construction of molecules containing rings of atoms. Molecular rings are found in many compounds that possess significant biological activity and are potentially applicable to human health. Examples include colchicine, used in the treatment of gout, and the experimental resiniferatoxin, a lead compound in the treatment of pain. Molecular rings are also of interest in the development of new materials. In addition to synthesizing these compounds, Dr. Harmata is investigating the how the reactions progress. Certain molecules have a 3-dimentional structure that makes them non-superimposable on their mirror image, just as right and left hands are not superimposable on each other. Dr. Harmata is developing methods to control which mirror image product is formed. Because the different mirror image forms of a molecule can have very different biological activity, the methods Dr. Harmata developed have broad, general significance. Dr. Harmata is also engaged in activities directed towards younger chemists and the general public. He organizes a symposium called Organic Chemistry Day to bring chemists from Missouri and neighboring states together to talk about organic chemistry frontier.  Dr. Harmata also speaks at a program at the University of Missouri called Saturday Morning Science. These outreach activities enable him not only to teach organic chemistry, but to explain how research is done and how it serves the general public, sometimes to children as young as six or seven years old. Last but not the least, Dr. Harmata sponsors a summer program for underrepresented high school students to work in his lab. \r\n\r\nDr. Harmata is studying two unique (4+3)-cycloaddition reactions. The first synthetic scheme is an asymmetric, catalytic process. Expanding the scope of this process beyond cyclopentenyl oxyallylic cations that are currently being used and understanding the origins of the high enantiocontrol observed are being investigated both experimentally and computationally. The second area makes use of developing oxidopyridinium ions as dienophiles in (4+3)-cycloadditions. This research is being pursued at the most fundamental levels, developing tools for simple stereoselection as well as the control of diastereoselectivity and enantioselectivity. For all of the reactions mentioned, the investigations include both intermolecular and intramolecular prospects. Finally, unique aspects of these reactions are being studied. These include chemical modification of the products to produce reactive species such as strained alkenes and radicals that allow the synthesis of molecules of greater structural complexity.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nDuing the funding period, we studied various aspects of the (4+3) cycloaddition reaction of oxidopyridinium ions with dienes.  A simple example is shown in below.  This process leads to the construction of a molecular structure that is found in a number of interesting chemical compounds present in Nature and serves as an entry to molecular scaffolds that are rigid and may be of interest in drug development.\n\nWe studied the reaction using dienes substituted at the carbon 2 position in anticipation of achieving high endo selectivity in the process.  This goal was accomplished and the results published.  We also conducted a broader survey of various dienes in the reaction and published these results as well.\n\nWe realized that the cycloadducts might undergo an intramolecular [2+2] photochemical cycloaddition, producing structures in which the ring system of the tropane alkaloids was imbedded.  Scopolamine and cocaine are among the alkaloids that belong to the tropane family.  This work was successful and was published.\n\nIntramolecular reactions of this type were also studied, generally and in the context of exploring their potential applicability to the synthesis of the natural compound daphnicyclidin A.  These studies were also successful.  One set of results has been published and another is under review.\n\nFinally, we discovered a number of pieces of chemistry associated with the cycloadducts in addition to that already mentioned.  Of note is the selective oxidation of certain cycloadducts to give bridgehead functionalization, a process that appears to be unprecedented.  This work is also current under review.\n\nWith respect to Broader Impacts, our work certainly will be of interest to those interested in alkaloid chemistry and drug development.  We continued engagement by organizing and hosting a symposium entitled Organic Chemistry Day in 2021 and 2022.  This program we established has been in operation for over 30 years, with only one cancellation in 2020 due to Covid.  In 2019 and 2021, we hosted two high school students for internships in our labs.  These students worked with graduate students and the PI to both learn chemistry and perform chemical reactions in a nuturing and safe environment.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/30/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Michael Harmata"
