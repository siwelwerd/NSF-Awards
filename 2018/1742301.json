 "awd_abstract_narration": "With funding from the National Science Foundation's Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (S-STEM) program, this project will provide financial support to Pell-eligible, academically talented students interested in pursuing the sciences at Hendrix College in Arkansas. In addition to covering all out-of-pocket expenses, this S-STEM Track 1 project will also provide significant academic, social, and mentoring support to ensure the success of the scholarship recipients. Such support includes mentoring, specialized living accommodations, undergraduate research and internship opportunities, career counseling, and exposure to psychological interventions proven to increase success and retention. Through this project Hendrix College seeks to increase the likelihood of success for low-income students, many of whom are first-generation college students hoping to break the cycle of poverty endemic to many parts of Arkansas. \r\n\r\nStudents from underprivileged backgrounds from the Mississippi River Delta, the Arkansas River Valley, and additional parts of rural Arkansas will be recruited in this \"Springboard to Success\" project. These areas have significant minority populations, high percentages of low income families, low levels of higher education, and a high proportion of first-generation college students. The financial support component of this S-STEM project will allow students to matriculate at no immediate cost, thus removing a prohibitive financial burden in attending college for these economically disadvantaged students. In addition, each scholarship recipient will be able to participate in a freshmen introductory orientation trip, a seminar course, a STEM mentoring program, three years of undergraduate research or internships, involvement in a STEM-themed living and learning community during their sophomore year, and field trips to STEM research laboratories and industries.  Students will also have access to a high-quality career services program and personal advising and mentoring.  Collectively, these activities are expected to increase retention and academic achievement of Pell-eligible students in STEM fields at Hendrix College, thus addressing a significant institutional challenge.  In addition to providing a high quality and enhanced undergraduate experience, different intervention and mentoring programs that have the potential to increase success of at-risk students interested in a STEM career will be evaluated.  The results of these studies will provide guidance for how to most effectively educate future Pell-eligible STEM students and contribute to the research literature on the efficacy of so-called \"wise\" interventions, which are short, targeted actions that promote a sense of community and belonging. Finally, the use of frequent assessment throughout the project will be used to ensure its effectiveness and provide critical feedback for its enhancement and expansion into the future.",
