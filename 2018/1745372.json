 "awd_abstract_narration": "The artist April Waters is an accomplished painter focused primarily on water and the scientists who study it. Her deployment to Palmer Station, Antarctica will afford her the opportunity to observe, sketch. and produce study-paintings of the ocean, sea ice. icebergs, and glaciers around the station that will inform her large-scale canvasses, which she will paint in her home studio.  The focus on water is intended to bring a fresh and unique perspective to observe and express the Antarctic wilderness.  Her goal is to communicate the beauty as well as the vulnerability of Antarctica's ecosystem and help communicate the region's sense of wonder to the public.  Her unique perspective will provide a distinctive addition to the Antarctic Artists and Writers portfolio.  \r\n\r\nThis artist's portfolio of oil paintings focused on water has afforded her multiple opportunities to speak about water issues in forums that bring together scientists, government officials and the public.  Her work in Antarctica will be a natural extension of her prior work.  Her new work, comprised of 10-12 large canvasses, will be exhibited across the state of Oregon, with multiple on-going opportunities to speak with students and the public about her Antarctic experiences. She will also exhibit at the NCAR Art Gallery in Boulder, Colorado.  Over an extended period, her work will bring awareness and appreciation of Antarctica to a significant audience.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
