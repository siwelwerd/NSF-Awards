 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Christina Conlee (Texas State University) and Dr. Corina Kellner (Northern Arizona University), along with an international team of researchers will examine the rise and fall of ancient civilizations to provide insight into how societies gain power and expand, how less powerful groups adapt and resist, and what stressors lead to a society's transformation and collapse. The project, which will be conducted in the desert of Peru, aims to obtain important comparative data on these topics. Archaeology is unique in its ability to provide a long-term view of these processes and helps in understanding the resilience and frailty of ancient and modern societies. In terms of broader scientific impacts, students will be supported and trained in both archaeological field and lab methods to further their careers in archaeological and other scientific endeavors. Cultural outreach is aimed at including the local community so they remain invested in preserving archaeological sites in the area. The results of this project will be made available to scholars and the general public through a digital repository at Texas State University, and through presentations and written articles. \r\n\r\nThe goal of the research team is to study the expansion of empires, the process of colonization, and how provincial people resist imperial control. The team will also explore the complex processes involved in the collapse of societies, and the impact of social, political, and environmental factors. The Wari (AD 650-1000) were the first empire in South America, and radically changed the known world in the Andes. The investigators will research the highland Wari's relationship with the coastal province of Nasca, including the dynamics between them that aided the expansion of Wari, resulted in the conquest and transformation of Nasca society, and ultimately led to the collapse of both. The investigations will focus on Huaca del Loro, the largest, and best preserved site of this time period in Nasca. Excavations in residential, ceremonial, and burial areas will be conducted along with several types of analyses of the archaeological and human remains. The project will examine what type of site was Huaca del Loro. Was it a local settlement, a Wari colony, or a site of local resistance against the empire? The research will also address how and why the settlement was abandoned and the implications this has for local and imperial collapse. Varied and innovative techniques and technologies will be used and include stable isotope analysis to determine the geographic origin and diet of people buried at the site, Structure from Motion that involves creating high resolution 3-D images of the site and excavations, and compositional analysis of various artifacts to understand trade and manufacture of various goods.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This is significant because the Wari were a highland based civilization and Huaca del Loro was located in the coastal desert of Nasca, Peru, further documenting Wari&rsquo;s vast expansion and control throughout the Andean region. The findings support the idea that empires in South America developed long before the Inca, making Wari possibly the earliest empire in the Americas (650-1000 CE). The chronology of the settlement, based on radiocarbon dating, indicates that before the Wari installation a cemetery was established that had hybrid Nasca/Wari mortuary practices and dated to 532-750 CE, which indicates that Wari influence was present before the establishment of the colony. The Wari imperial installation dates 664-1050 CE, which was partially contemporary with an area of the site that housed local people. The discovery of four mummy bundles associated with the Wari temple complex suggests ancestor worship of elite individuals was part of the activities that occurred in the temple. Another result of the project is that the last occupation of the site was at 1020 CE and coincides with a drought period from 950-1250 CE showing that changing climatic condition contributed to the collapse of Wari and the abandonment of the region. During this drought period there is evidence on a regional scale of population movement out of Nasca. Overall, the project has provided data on the nature of early empires and colonization in the Andes, which can be used in comparative research on other civilizations to better understand cycles of expansion and collapse.</p>\r\n<p>The research project was a collaboration between archaeologists from the United States and Peru. Numerous undergraduate and graduate students worked on the project and obtained field and laboratory training that increased their skills in archaeology. Students were mentored through graduate research assistantships and independent studies, and two graduate theses resulted from the project. Through the community education portion of the project in Peru, grade school children learned about archaeology, and the possibility of careers as archaeologists and scientists. The students also learned about the deep history of the valley they live in, and we worked to spark their interest in learning more about the past. These children live in a poor, rural area of Peru where they have little access to educational resources beyond the basic curriculum in their primary schools, which focuses on events that took place far away and rarely includes Indigenous perspectives. Peru has an abundance of archaeological resources and employment in archaeology is high but children in many areas know little about jobs in the field. The results of this project have been disseminated in English and Spanish through social media, journal articles, reports, conference presentations, and public talks.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 12/20/2024<br>\nModified by: Christina&nbsp;Conlee</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1758084/1758084_10567360_1734711441543_Huaca_del_Loro_temple_complex--rgov-214x142.JPG\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1758084/1758084_10567360_1734711441543_Huaca_del_Loro_temple_complex--rgov-800width.JPG\" title=\"Huaca del Loro temple complex\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1758084/1758084_10567360_1734711441543_Huaca_del_Loro_temple_complex--rgov-66x44.JPG\" alt=\"Huaca del Loro temple complex\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A Wari D-shaped structure and associated architecture.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Jerod Roberts</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Christina&nbsp;Conlee\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Huaca del Loro temple complex</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1758084/1758084_10567360_1734711748528_Map_of_Huaca_del_Loro--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1758084/1758084_10567360_1734711748528_Map_of_Huaca_del_Loro--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Map of Huaca del Loro\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1758084/1758084_10567360_1734711748528_Map_of_Huaca_del_Loro--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Map of Huaca del Loro\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Map of Huaca del Loro with excavation areas.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Jerod Roberts</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Christina&nbsp;Conlee\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Map of Huaca del Loro</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1758084/1758084_10567360_1734711206669_Community_education_project--rgov-214x142.JPG\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1758084/1758084_10567360_1734711206669_Community_education_project--rgov-800width.JPG\" title=\"Community education project\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1758084/1758084_10567360_1734711206669_Community_education_project--rgov-66x44.JPG\" alt=\"Community education project\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Students participating in one of the after school workshops in Las Trancas, Peru.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Christina A.
