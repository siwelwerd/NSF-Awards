 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-technical Description: Interactions between organic molecules and light may enable formation of a hybrid light-matter state (polariton). Such state has fascinating optical and electronic properties which are of interest both from the fundamental physics and from the applications perspective. The applications of polaritons include lasers, sensors, devices enabling optical communications and information processing, and many others. In this project, properties of polaritons are explored using a combination of experimental and computational approaches with the goal of designing next-generation organic optoelectronic materials and device architectures that utilize enhanced light emission and/or conductivity enabled by polaritons. The project integrates fundamental physics with materials design and device technologies, thus providing unique educational resources and infrastructure for graduate and undergraduate students, including those from underrepresented groups, involved in this project. The investigators develop educational materials based on the results of the project and related concepts and participate in a broad variety of outreach activities ranging between lab-based demonstrations for various audiences and participation in university-wide and department-wide outreach initiatives.\r\n\r\nTechnical Description: Organic (opto)electronic materials are of interest due to their low cost and tunable properties appropriate a broad range of applications has been demonstrated. One of the areas that has seen a dramatic progress is the applications relying on strong exciton-photon coupling in organic microcavities. In spite of considerable amount of theoretical and experimental work on strong exciton-photon coupling in organic materials, there is still a number of unresolved fundamental issues pertaining to the nature and properties of hybrid light-matter (polariton) states. Resolving some of these issues and providing experimental validation for some of the recent theoretical predictions, exemplified by that of a dark polariton (a hybrid state with unique photophysical characteristics), is the goal of the present research. In particular, a systematic investigation of photophysics of hybrid light-matter states and their ability to enhance charge transport in model organic semiconductors, chosen to be solution-processable functionalized acene and anthradithiophene derivatives, is carried out. For this, various modalities of optical and photoluminescence spectroscopy are combined with measurements of charge carrier dynamics and with numerical simulations. The ultimate goal of the research is to establish the nature and properties of hybrid light-matter states in microcavities and on plasmonic nanostructured substrates and to quantify the potential of such states to enhance coherent charge transport in organic crystalline materials. More specifically, the research team seeks to establish how the properties of polaritons evolve depending on the nature of excitonic states in the organic semiconductor, molecular packing and disorder, and to lay foundations for enhancing charge carrier mobility and photocurrent in high-performance organic semiconductors via coherent hybrid states.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Over the past decade, remarkable enhancement in performance of organic devices has been achieved. For example, power conversion efficiencies of over 19% have been demonstrated in organic solar cells. This progress was largely enabled by the better understanding of underlying physical mechanisms that guided design of improved materials. Nevertheless, fundamental limits in performance of organic devices have not yet been achieved and therefore innovative solutions that would lead to further improvements are in demand. A promising direction is to utilize properties of light-matter hybrid states (polaritons) which form when molecular materials are placed in resonant structures such as microcavities and strong exciton-photon coupling conditions are met. &nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"Default\">In spite of considerable amount of work on strong exciton-photon coupling in organic materials, there is still a number of unresolved fundamental issues pertaining to the nature and properties of polaritons and how they could boost the performance of organic devices.

The choice of the model organic materials was dictated by their high performance in organic devices relying on charge carrier mobility (such as thin-film transistors) and, additionally, by their ability to support singlet fission, which is a process that can convert a photon into two charge carrier pairs and thus enhance power conversion efficiency in solar cells. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>The project resulted so far in 6 published research articles (1 letter, 1 feature article, 3 invited), 4 full-size conference proceeding papers, 7 national (MRS, SPIE, CLEO, Ultrafast Phenomena, APS) (2 invited) and 2 regional (1 invited) meeting presentations, 6 invited seminars, and 2 articles that are currently in preparation for submission.</p>\n<p><strong>Intellectual Merit</strong></p>\n<p><strong> </strong>We systematically investigated photophysics of hybrid light-matter states in benchmark organic semiconductors - functionalized pentacene, tetracene, and ADT derivatives - and explored integration of organic materials into devices utilizing various types of photonic structures: microcavities, nanostructured plasmonic substrates, and hyperbolic metamaterials (HMMs). First, we established how molecular packing in model organic crystals (diF R-ADT, where molecular packing is adjusted using side groups R) determines singlet fission efficiency and photoconductivity, both properties important for optoelectronic devices. Next, we placed various organic films in microcavities and demonstrated strong coupling between molecular excitons and cavity photons in all-metal and metal/distributed Bragg mirror cavities. We revealed that cavity photon preferentially couples to disordered populations in mixed-phase (amorphous/crystalline) and crystalline films, regardless of the cavity structure. This observation is important for organic devices, since coherent polariton states created in the defect-rich areas (which represent a bottleneck for organic devices that require crystalline ordering for the best performance) may relax the requirement for the crystalline order and simplify device fabrication. Next, we demonstrated strong coupling between molecular excitons and plasmons in metal nanohole arrays and HMMs. This work provides the basis for using such structures in strongly coupled organic devices utilizing planar geometries such as (photo)transistors, without the need for integration with microcavity structures.&nbsp; Finally, we incorporated transistor structures into resonant microcavities.
