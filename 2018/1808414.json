 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professors Malika Jeffries-EL of Boston University and Aimee Tomlinson of University of North Georgia are supported by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular, and Nanochemistry (MSN) Program of the Division of Chemistry to develop new carbon-based materials - organic semiconductors - that combine the properties of organic materials with the optical and electronic properties of conventional inorganic semiconductors. These complex materials are of technological importance as they can be fabricated into devices for use in a variety of different areas including energy (solar cells), displays, (light emitting diodes), and electronics (field effect transistors). During the course of this project, conjugated materials based on the cross-like motif are designed by Tomlinson's team using computational methods in order to identify the most promising candidates for synthesis and characterization by the Jeffries-EL group. This research enhances our understanding of how structure impacts its material properties, and how these properties then impact its performance in various applications. In addition to supporting basic research, this grant provides interdisciplinary research experiences for both undergraduate and graduate students. The broader impacts of this grant include the development of highly qualified scientists with extensive experience working on complex interdisciplinary projects in a diverse environment. Since the University of North Georgia is located in the foothills of the Blue Ridge mountain range a number of first generation and underrepresented undergraduates are given the opportunity to be involved in this project. Additionally, Dr. Jeffries-EL fosters interest in materials chemistry in underrepresented high school students through the Achievement, Self-Awareness, Communication, Engagement, Networking and Developmental Skills (ASCEND) outreach program targeting low-income and underrepresented minority students in grades 9-12. \r\n\r\nThe project further advances the field of organic semiconductors through an investigation of structure-property-morphology relationships in cross-conjugated benzobisoxazoles (BBOs). Cross-conjugated molecules, which are systems with two orthogonal conjugation paths that intersect through a central aromatic ring, are especially advantageous for organic semiconducting applications as this arrangement leads to spatial segregation of the frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs). Consequently, it is possible to selectively tune the FMOs and band gaps through aryl group substitution along the various axes as a result of extension of the pi system and inductive effects. The benefits of the approach are that the cross-conjugated platform allows for the opportunity to optimize the material's optical and electronic properties for specific applications. Based on the insights from the previous grant period, there are several opportunities for the rational design of new materials, specifically architectures for narrow band-gap materials for photovoltaic cells and wide band gap materials which can be used as either blue emitters or hosts in organic light emitting diodes. A combination of theory, synthesis, device fabrication and characterization are utilized to identify and generate new materials as well as provide insights on how to design future materials. The simple iterative approach allows for easy synthesis of the target materials and structure-property studies advance the rational design of new materials with characteristics that are tunable and predictable. As such this work is expected to impact the field of organic electronics.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The semiconducting optical and electronic properties within organic semiconductors (OSC)s are a result of the extensive delocalization of electrons throughout the molecule. OSCs are promising for use in applications such as organic light emitting diodes (OLED)s and photovoltaic cells (OPV)s, because their properties can be optimized for specific applications through chemical synthesis. Cross-conjugated materials are particularly useful, as their unique architecture provides for exceptional tuning of their optical and electronic properties in a way that is hard to achieve with typical OSCs. Previously, our teams demonstrated that molecules known as benzobisoxazoles are useful building blocks for creating new materials. Based on the insights from the previous grant period and using a combination of experimental and computational techniques, we designed light-emitting materials for use in OLEDs and light harvesting materials for use in OPVs. Given the plethora of possible combinations of aryl substituents around the central BBO core there are several opportunities for the rational design of new materials. We focused our efforts on developing materials that can be used in either OPVs or OLEDs.&nbsp; During the grant period, dozens of materials were prepared, and characterized. Those that fit the requirements for OLEDS or OPVs were further evaluated by testing them in working devices. The baseline performances for the OLEDs were particularly exciting as we achieved deep-blue emission, which is hard to accomplish with a purely organic emitter. Overall, this project was successful in that it produced new organic semiconducting materials for the target applications and provided insights on how to design future OSCs. In addition to our scientific work, we have made significant contributions to human resource development. Professor Jeffries-EL partially supported four graduate students by this grant, three of whom (2 men, 1 woman) were members of an underrepresented minority (URM) group. Three students ( 2URM)s completed PhDs during the grant period. One of them was a former student from Professor Tomlinson?s group. Six undergraduates have also worked on this project including two women, and two URMs as a result of Professor Jeffries-EL?s involvement in various programs. In addition to the research opportunities offered in the lab, the PI has done substantial outreach work through her participation in programs within the community to further encourage others to pursue STEM careers. Since August 2018, Professor Tomlinson has worked with 17 undergraduate students which included 3 young women.&nbsp; These students have presented 6 posters at national meetings and 6 have been co-authors on 10 publications.
