 "awd_abstract_narration": "Electrical power and computing infrastructures are increasingly interdependent. Computing provides information that enables decision-making, commerce, government, and social interaction, and disruptions in power supply may trigger critical losses of information and decision-making capabilities, resulting in the potential for significant economic losses. To reduce critical risks and identify synergies from the growing interdependence of these infrastructures, the objective of this Critical Resilient Interdependent Infrastructure Systems and Processes (CRISP) project is to increase the resilience and efficiency of the electrical power and computing infrastructures by understanding how to exploit and maximize emerging synergies between the two infrastructures. The project will have broad impact in computing and power grid research and industrial practice, enabling better design of power and computing infrastructures, leading to improved management and benefiting their resilience and efficiency. Project results will be disseminated to the research and industrial communities via papers, talks, and models as open-source software.  Students and postdoctoral fellows involved will gain a holistic systems-level understanding, giving them the ability to combine concepts in optimization and energy markets.\r\n\r\nThis project will develop optimization formulations for theoretical insights on resiliency and economic benefits that can result from infrastructure coordination. It will also investigate new market designs that properly incentivize the provision of spatio-temporal load modulation flexibility at large-scale (in the form of virtual power flows) among various kinds of computing assets, exploring different levels of coordination (because distinct business and regulatory constitutions govern them) and feasible computing flexibility.  To achieve these goals, the project will embed those optimization formulations within stochastic programming models to identify optimal system layouts that benefit both infrastructures. In addition, the project will develop suitable utility functions for varied types of computing providers that the ISOs (Independent System Operators under Federal Energy Regulatory Commission) can use to quantify costs associated with load flexibility.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Computing provides information that enables decision-making, commerce, government, and social inter- action. The delivery of information comprises essential computing tasks such as sensing and data collection, data processing/analysis, prediction and optimization, economic transactions, as well as automation of infrastructures, manufacturing, and buildings. The project objective explores how to exploit and maximize emerging synergies between the computing and electrical power infrastructures, increasing resilience and flexibility.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe project has created optimization formulations that provide theoretical insights on resiliency and economic benefits that can result from infrastructure coordination. The formulations were used to investigate new market designs that properly incentivize the provision of spatio-temporal load modulation flexibility at large-scale. These formulations were used to create specific strategies for coordinating datacenter power load adaptation with power grids to increase both renewable power absorption (decarbonization of the grid), and reduced power prices for all consumers, including datacenters. The efficacy of these strategies have been demonstrated in simulations of realistic power grids, and represent a path forward that is attractive both to power grid operators (ISO s) and cloud operators. For example, simulations of the Western Electric Coordinating Council (WECC) area shows significant improvements in decarbonization for both datacenters and all power grid customers with our Share24 coordination approach. This approach shares day in advance power use plans from datacenters with the grid, allowing it to do better planning and market organization. This turns out to benefit all (the power grid, reliability, cost, and ability to use green power). These benefits should increase as more renewable generation and datacenters are added to the power grid (particularly because of explosive growth of AI). These strategies have been published in leading research publications, and also presented at various power grid companies to aid idea transfer.\n\n\n\n\n\nBroader Impacts: The project ideas and research results have been disseminated to the research community, power grid and cloud operators. While initial feedback is positive, time will show whether these results can directly affect practice. In terms of human resources, five graduate students and one postdoc at Uchicago as well as one graduate student at UWisconsin received cross-disciplinary training in computer science, power grids, and markets. Five faculty involved across the two universities also received training.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/08/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: AndrewAChien\n"
