 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funding for US based participants in the meeting \"Nonlinear Partial Differential Equations and Many Particle Systems\" to be held at KTH Royal Institute of Technology Stockholm, Sweden, from November 21-25, 2018.\r\n\r\nThe workshop is devoted to the latest fundamental and transformative trends in nonlinear evolution partial differential equations (PDE) and applications. Two main goals of this conference are to bring together scientists and mathematicians working in PDE and related fields, and to train and mentor younger generation of mathematicians working in nonlinear PDE and applications. The main impact is to establish a closer tie between researchers in Europe and the US and by pushing the limits of current boundaries of knowledge in nonlinear processes described by PDE to the new level.  \r\n\r\nAdditional information about this meeting can be found at the website: https://www.kth.se/en/sci/institutioner/math\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
