 "awd_abstract_narration": "The North American Dendroecological Fieldweek (NADEF), is an annual ten-day field-based activity that teaches the tools of dendrochronology, provides networking opportunities for students and professionals, and expands the benefits of dendrochronological records to forest managers.  Support for NADEF will catalyze new activities focusing on understanding the mechanisms behind the increases in global forest mortality, which has become more widespread than has been documented in preceding centuries.  Understanding the mechanisms behind this forest mortality is critical for the development of intelligent, timely, and science-driven management responses to these mortality events.  The field weeks will provide professional development for approximately 120 participants over a three-year period while educating participants about management information needed to sustain these forests. The field week will continue its strong record for broadening gender and ethnic diversity among scholars in dendrochronology.  Opportunities for undergraduate scholarships will be provided to students from underrepresented groups, and graduate research fellowships will help educate and train students in professional presentation of the findings from the field weeks.\r\n\r\nNADEF has a 25-year history of bringing together a diverse group of scholars to learn cutting-edge dendrochronology science for the continuous improvement of research in the forestry sciences and the better management of forest resources.  For this series of field weeks, participants will engage in five research projects that will focus on completing a fire history, insect-outbreak reconstructions, climate reconstructions, analyses of stand-age structure across an elevational gradient, and sclerochronology, which is the examination of annual rings in bony structures such as those found in clams and the ear bones of fish.  Field week researchers will use innovative research techniques to examine quantitative wood anatomy (the examination of individual cells of growth in the tree rings) along with stable isotopes to tease apart relationships among climate, fire, and insect outbreaks on forest mortality.  These research activities help participants to better understand the direction that these forests are naturally trending so that future conditions for these forests can be predicted more accurately and more effective forest management strategies can be implemented.  Beyond these learning experiences, the field weeks provide networking opportunities for students and professionals and expand the benefits of dendrochronological records to forest managers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The work on this grant is organized through the North American Dendroecological Fieldweek (NADEF) and the African Dendrochronology Fieldschool (ADF). These are hands-on tree-ring training events that run from 10-14 days. The participants split into 3-5 research groups and complete a research project from start to finish in the time of the fieldweek. They develop hypotheses, sample tree-rings to answer that hypothesis, prepare samples, complete the analysis, and present their findings by the end of the fieldschool. We examined forest decline from many perspectives in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem over five years and found an upward advance of ecotones, but a surprising finding was that whitebark pine seedlings were establishing at all elevations (upslope and downslope). This could be due to the dispersal by the Clark?s Nutcracker, but it is a hopeful finding as whitebark pine is being threatened by many factors. We found that its regeneration is strong. Mountain pine beetle, spruce beetle, and spruce budworm are all active in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. We documented that the trees were being stressed by a rise in temperature, but these insects are coming into the system and accelerating the shift to a new equilibrium. We were able to use no-cost extensions to expand this work to the Miombo woodlands in Zambia. Our groundbreaking work in Zambia has been very successful. We have been able to document 32 tree species in four stand-age structure plots at the AEL site near Mufulira, Zambia. From these 32 species, about 53% of them have good potential for datable rings. Our dendroclimate group has successfully examine the climate response of multiple species of <em>Brachystegia,</em> which is a major component of the Miombo woodlands, finding a strong response to precipitation.</p>\n<p>As mentioned in the specific objective section, we were able to document climate responses across multiple species in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem and document some evidence for increased stress in the system. Along with this, we see mountain pine beetle, spruce beetle, and spruce budworm outbreaks becoming more intense and causing increased mortality since 2008. We documented the wildfire regime across multiple ecotones and found six spreading fires since 1650 and three that moved from lower elevation into the high elevation whitebark pine forests. As we have seen in locations throughout the west, there are no fires documented since 1900 in the area along Forest Service road 118 up to Clay Butte, which is outside the natural range of variability for a period without fire. We did document some upward motion of ecotones, but also a more chaotic response of seedlings of multiple species showing up outside the range of their mature trees in both higher and lower elevations.</p>\n<p>The main outcome is that we held five successful fieldweeks assisted with NSF funds that brought together 180 people and facilitated networking and education in dendrochronology. Through these fieldweeks in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem and then in the Miombo woodlands in Zambia, we have been able to develop robust data sets in areas that were lacking these reconstructions. We documented the accelerated transition of the forest in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem due to temperature increases and facilitated by insect outbreaks.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 04/06/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: James&nbsp;H&nbsp;Speer</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1759694/1759694_10543781_1680786832616_IMGP5378--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1759694/1759694_10543781_1680786832616_IMGP5378--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"NADEF Group Photo 2018\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1759694/1759694_10543781_1680786832616_IMGP5378--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"NADEF Group Photo 2018\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">This is the group from the North American Dendroecological Fieldweek (NADEF) in the Shoshone National Forest in 2018.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">James H.
