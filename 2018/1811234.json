 "awd_abstract_narration": "As part of its overall strategy to enhance learning in informal environments, the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program funds innovative research, approaches, and resources for use in a variety of settings. Using community-based participatory research,  human-centered design, and developmental evaluation approaches, this project will co-create a national community science project, which is a form of Public Participation in STEM Research (PPSR) or citizen science. The project seeks to increase inclusion and equity in STEM, while building capacity in research and science through leadership and participation by both historically underrepresented communities and established academic institutions. Participants will record their levels of perceived stress and well-being in relation to their local soundscape. This project will help to connect participants, specifically youth and their families from communities underrepresented and underserved in STEM, with science and nature through learning that is authentic and relevant to their lives.  With support of a mobile app, community science project participants explore and map soundscapes to identify areas of \"excessive noise\" as well as \"noise refuges.\" Community-led dissemination of results will inform adoption of community science projects by other community-based organizations. The project is a collaboration involving fifteen community leaders, the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, Metro Atlanta Urban Farm in Atlanta, WorldBeat Center in San Diego, CLUES in St. Paul, MN, and Camp Compass in Allentown, PA.\r\n\r\nPPSR has exciting potential to engage broad audiences in STEM learning and research, particularly when projects are genuinely co-created by local communities, scientists, and educators. Using a community-based participatory research approach in the project fosters direct involvement from community members in integration of science practices and learning, from the development of the research questions, design of the study, to analysis, interpretation, and dissemination of results. Human-centered design is important as it is an established collaborative approach for addressing real-world problems facing human communities. In this project, human-centered design will include technology in the problem-solving phases of inspiration, ideation, and implementation. Developmental evaluation will provide on-going direct feedback to the project team over the project lifespan with respect to equity and inclusion in PPSR, an informal STEM learning environment. The project will further knowledge and understanding of soundscapes and noise pollution, enable use of mobile apps to map soundscapes in urban environments, and contribute to the relationship of noise to well-being.The project will produce conceptual frameworks and practical resources (toolkits) to guide future community-based PPSR efforts. Results from this project will advance knowledge, skills, attitudes, and behaviors of PPSR practitioners regarding equity, diversity, and inclusion of underrepresented audiences in STEM.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

When one considers the need to maintain the perceived institutional public image and the interests of powerful dominant-culture leaders and board members, there is a clear conflict of interests.

CBOs must have direct access to resources, networks, and channels currently available only to dominant-culture institutions. Communities are tired of being studied, used, saved, and educated. Power inequities and lack of transparency will not be confronted, and race will not be centered if we do not change the system from a top-down, deficit approach to one that is bottom-up and based on community strengths and priorities.

When one considers the need to maintain the perceived institutional public image and the interests of powerful dominant-culture leaders and board members, there is a clear conflict of interests. Since STEM Institutions control the funding, research priorities, and evaluation, if they do not see the value of community leadership in research, and fear the public consequences of the work, there is little hope of creating meaningful change in addressing inequity in science. \nThese results lead us to highlight the critical importance of funding communities directly, bypassing dominant culture STEM institutions, so that CBOs are able to control and build equitable projects that use community-centered approaches. CBOs must have direct access to resources, networks, and channels currently available only to dominant-culture institutions. Communities are tired of being studied, used, saved, and educated. Power inequities and lack of transparency will not be confronted, and race will not be centered if we do not change the system from a top-down, deficit approach to one that is bottom-up and based on community strengths and priorities. We must fundamentally change the scientific enterprise by providing direct funding to communities historically excluded from the sciences so that their leadership, expertise, and voices are not filtered by the existing system. \nFinally, our research has also led us to understand that the success of STEM research and programming focused on our communities is best evaluated by community-led teams and must include indicators such as how much ownership communities have over the results. Evaluators (particularly BIPOC evaluators) may feel like they need to be cautious in their reporting due to the power that institutions hold and the repercussions that may come if they call out inequities. It is important that there are no mediating institutions with their own motivations and biases. \n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/01/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Karen A Purcell"
