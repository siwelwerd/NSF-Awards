 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) project will be a cost-effective, commercially viable, alternative process for on-site treatment of food waste and energy recovery.  In the U.S., nearly 40% of food is wasted with $165 billion equivalent loss of food plus associated water, energy, chemicals, and labor used in food production.  Disposal of the food waste involves additional costs and causes environmental pollution, e.g. rotting food waste in landfills accounts for a large portion of U.S. methane emissions, a powerful greenhouse gas.  Moreover, food waste streams contain a substantial amount of chemical energy that also is lost by its disposal.  Recovering energy in food waste in the form of biofuel and chemicals, as proposed in this project, will provide efficient management of food waste problem reducing food waste disposal costs while producing useful products.\r\n\r\nThis STTR Phase I project proposes to develop and demonstrate the performance of a novel, immobilized clostridia cell membrane bioreactor-based continuous process to convert food waste to butanol.  The conventional stirred-tank fermentation reactor-based food waste conversion process exhibits low butanol concentration as well as productivity.  The proposed process will address the technical barriers of the conventional process by immobilizing the clostridia cells on porous media to dramatically increase cell culture density, and, consequently, butanol productivity and conversion efficiency.  In addition, by separating butanol from the reaction media, recycled butanol concentration is minimized in the reactor, which alleviates butanol toxicity.  The membrane fouling issues in biomass separation will be addressed by an \"open channel\" membrane module design to separate and recycle biomass to the bioreactor.  The energy requirement for recovery of butanol from dilute reactor effluent will be reduced by an order of magnitude over the conventional distillation by using a pervaporation membrane.  The objective of the proposed effort is to demonstrate a steady state continuous integrated process for converting food waste to butanol after optimizing individual components.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOverview \n\nThe Techverse Inc. NSF Phase I STTR project demonstrated a continuous food waste conversion process to produce valuable products, primarily butanol, by anaerobic fermentation of the glucose and hydrolyzable starches present in the food waste.  The project objective was to demonstrate food waste conversion with high butanol productivity in a continuous, steady state integrated bioreactor and membrane separation system.  A continuous immobilized cell culture bioreactor was integrated with a membrane filtration system for recycling cell biomass and a pervaporation membrane system to recover organics energy efficiently.  Real world food waste from a university cafeteria was used to demonstrate the process. \n\nKey words:  food waste, bioreactor, fermentation, pervaporation, ultrafiltration, biofuel, butanol\n\nIntellectual Merit\n\nThis Phase I Small Business Technology Transfer project addressed two main barriers in the current state-of-the-art process for butanol production by food waste fermentation: 1) low final butanol concentration and 2) low rate of production.  Butanol productivity and food waste conversion efficiency were increased by a novel immobilized cell membrane bioreactor for providing high clostridia culture cell density for food waste fermentation.  Toxicity of butanol to the culture was minimized by separation of the liquid phase from the cell biomass recycled to the reactor.  Using an \"open channel\" membrane module allowed achieving high solids concentration in the recycled biomass minimizing the butanol concentration in the fermentation reactor.  The energy requirement for recovery of butanol from the aqueous permeate was reduced substantially by using a pervaporation membrane making the overall process energy efficient.  This project demonstrated economic viability of producing butanol by the food waste conversion process.\n\nBroader Impacts:\n\nIn the US, ~40% of food (about 133 million MT) is wasted resulting ~$165 billion/yr equivalent loss accounting food as well as the associated water, energy, chemicals, and labor used in food production.  Food waste is produced in food harvesting, processing, distribution, retail, commercial dining facilities, and household kitchens.  With the population growth, increasing food wastes increase economic and environmental concerns.  Therefore, appropriate management and utilization of food waste is urgently needed.  The continuous food waste treatment process developed in this project will provide an environmentally sustainable on-site solution to the food waste disposal problem. Large food processing plants and commercial dining facilities, e.g. university dining halls and restaurants, represent a large customer base needing cost-effective food waste management.\n\nThe Phase I project used real-life food waste to demonstrate its conversion to butanol. Such conversion of waste to butanol will provide a renewable, \"drop-in\" fuel supplement to gasoline thereby reducing the dependence on depleting fossil fuels.  Butanol is also an industrially important chemical used as a solvent and as an intermediate for manufacturing of a variety of household products such as detergents, adhesives, coatings, paints, and textiles.  Although the Phase I effort specifically considered food waste solution, the developed technology is also applicable to other wet organic waste sources with high organic content such as brewery waste and household municipal waste where food waste constitutes the large proportion of the total waste.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/25/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Ashok Damle"
