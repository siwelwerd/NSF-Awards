 "awd_abstract_narration": "Community colleges play a vital role in meeting the national demand for qualified graduates in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM).  In particular, community colleges are key in preparing students to enter the skilled technical workforce. In a growing number of community college STEM programs, students are gaining technical skills by conducting course-based research. There is a need for resources and tools that can measure the impact of course-based research experiences on student outcomes, and the ways in which this type of research conducting prepares students to enter the STEM technician workforce.\r\n\r\nThis project will support community college students who conduct course-based research in technician education programs.  The project aims to help students identify the knowledge and skills they gain through their research experience, to identify areas in which they need to improve, and to use this knowledge to their advantage as they enter the workforce. The project aligns with the goals of the ATE program in educating a skilled technical workforce, and leverages both the Community College Undergraduate Research Initiative and the technical resources available through the Science Education Resource Center at Carleton College. This project builds upon EvaluateUR, an evidence-based method developed at SUNY Buffalo State to measure a range of desirable outcomes of research participation. The EvaluateUR tool measures content knowledge, as well as outcomes that are critically important in the workplace, such as communication skills, creativity, autonomy, an ability to overcome obstacles, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills. EvaluateUR also provides students with metacognition skills, as well as a strategy to identify how much academic progress they have made or still need to make. To date, EvaluateUR has focused on one-on-one student/faculty mentor relationships. This project will modify EvaluateUR to expand the number of students who can benefit from this assessment method.  This expansion is designed to meet the needs of entire classrooms of students who conduct course-based research. The lessons learned during implementation of this project at community colleges may apply to course-based research conducted by undergraduates at other institutions, including four-year colleges and universities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

In an increasing number of community college STEM programs, students are conducting course-based undergraduate research. Research experiences have been shown to help students take ownership of their learning as they develop and apply problem-solving skills. The overarching goal of the project was to determine if EvaluateUR could be modified to support course-based undergraduate research experiences (referred to as CUREs). EvaluateUR measures student academic and metacognitive growth through several rounds of student self-assessments matched with faculty mentor assessments using identical assessment items and scoring metrics. EvaluateUR was developed for independent student research experiences (individual students working on a one-to-one basis with faculty mentors).</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">E-CURE modified EvaluateUR for the CURE classroom setting, where there is one instructor for many students. Its design replicates several key features of EvaluateUR: 1) E-CURE has eleven student outcome categories, each defined by several outcome components that include both content knowledge and outcomes that are critically important in the workplace, such as communication skills, creativity, autonomy, ability to overcome obstacles, critical thinking, problem-solving skills and teamwork. 2) To assess student progress, each outcome component is scored by the student researchers and, independently, by their faculty instructors, using a five-point scale and accompanying scoring rubric. 3) Students and instructors share reviews of their respective assessment scores and discuss the reasons for their assessments. This feature is designed to help students understand their strengths and weaknesses in working to achieve these outcomes, and develop or enhance related metacognitive skills. Unlike EvaluateUR, E-CURE allows faculty to select a subset of outcome categories for assessment and to include several optional outcomes related to their specific CURE. This format enables faculty to focus on a 'core' set of outcomes and to add others that reflect specific course activities and objectives. E-CURE is an online environment, with features for instructors to provide timely feedback to students to help them enhance their metacognitive skills. A statistical reporting feature allows faculty to easily obtain pre-post individual student score reports as well as class-wide summary assessment data for all course outcome components. These data enable instructors to document student learning gains and use the reports to inform designs for course improvements.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">E-CURE was developed and pilot tested over a five-year period between 2019 and 2023. Results of this project include the successful development of E-CURE and its pilot testing in 54 courses at 23 institutions. Project findings demonstrated that E-CURE introduced student participants to a comprehensive list of competencies and skills they would need in order to succeed in graduate work and/or the workplace. &nbsp;Almost all E-CURE assessment components yielded statistically significant positive self-reported student gains and successfully measured student growth on a wide range of outcomes and all but one E-CURE assessment component saw statistically significant positive student gains as reported by the CURE instructors. Student-instructor conversations contributed to the development and enhancement of student metacognitive skills, characterized&nbsp;by learners becoming aware<em> </em>of what learning strategies they are pursuing and why, and then using that awareness to make intentional adjustments to those strategies in order to learn more effectively. These conversations also helped most students confirm their plans for graduate school or employment in their major field. E-CURE made it easier for instructors to identify the academic strengths and weaknesses of their students, enabling the instructors to focus their teaching efforts more productively.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">To help students further develop their metacognitive skills, twelve metacognition exercises were developed to complement E-CURE implementation. Refinement of E-CURE during the project has reflected extensive feedback from community college faculty who have implemented E-CURE in their classrooms. An evaluation of E-CURE demonstrated its effectiveness in helping students identify the knowledge and skills they gain through their research experiences and to identify areas in which they need to improve. In addition to supporting students enrolled in community colleges, EvaluateUR-CURE is available to CUREs at other institutions, including four-year colleges and universities.
