 "awd_abstract_narration": "From the 9th to 12th centuries CE, people at Chaco Canyon New Mexico and throughout a vast surrounding region built communities with monumental architecture suggesting the development of an ancient Puebloan elite. Archaeologists have long sought to understand the nature of sociopolitical relations at Chaco Canyon, and between Chaco and its outlier communities. The evidence of sociopolitical hierarchy at Chaco itself is ambiguous, with few of the stamps of individual power seen at other power centers around the world, and archaeologists know even less about Chaco's 100+ outlier communities, of which only a handful have seen significant excavation. Michelle Turner of Binghamton University, under the guidance of Dr. Ruth Van Dyke, will examine the relationship between Chaco Canyon and Aztec Ruins, one of the largest Chacoan outlier communities, by establishing a chronology for the construction of the Aztec North great house. This research will be a basis for Turner's PhD dissertation, so this grant supports the work of a student. The researchers' project was developed in cooperation with archaeologists at Aztec Ruins National Monument, following consultation with tribal representatives, and it will provide valuable new information for the park's staff to share with visitors. The researchers will share their findings with tribal representatives and other members of descendant communities, and the results will also be disseminated at public talks in the region as well as in academic journals and at professional conferences. \r\n\r\nTurner and Van Dyke conducted limited archaeological testing in 2016 at the previously unexcavated Aztec North great house, one of three great houses at Aztec Ruins National Monument. Aztec North's origins are hotly debated. While its neighbor great house Aztec West was clearly constructed with the involvement of Chacoan builders starting around 1110 CE, Aztec North's architecture includes an unusual combination of Chacoan and non-Chacoan construction features. For example, while the walls of the structure have a sandstone veneer that looks very much like Chacoan masonry, that veneer conceals an adobe fill core that looks more local. Was this structure built by newly arrived Chacoan builders who had not yet developed the work force to build a full masonry structure, or was it built by local people imitating Chacoan ways? Or was it perhaps a much later experiment in adobe construction? Turner will test these possibilities by running radiocarbon dating on organic materials from Aztec North to pinpoint the site's occupation dates. If Aztec North was built in the years just after construction of Aztec West, then it is probable that Chacoan builders were already present, while earlier dates would indicate it was most likely built by local people emulating Chaco. Dates after the mid-1100s would suggest a post-Chacoan origin. The radiocarbon dates, interpreted in combination with the researchers' analysis of the architecture, ceramics and other artifacts from the excavation, will provide valuable data for archaeologists seeking to understand the history of both Aztec Ruins and the wider Chacoan region.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Built by Ancestral Puebloan people (not Aztecs) between around 1100-1275 AD, the Aztec community was the largest known outlier of Chaco Canyon, a major center of sociopolitical activity. Aztec might have also been a political successor to Chaco after its decline around 1140 AD.</p>\n<p>There are three monumental great houses at Aztec, organized in an elaborate cultural landscape (Fig. 1). Archaeologists have good evidence that the Aztec West great house, which park visitors can walk through today, was built mainly between 1110-1120 AD and that Chacoan builders were involved in that construction (Fig. 2). This is partly because of the massive foundations that underlie the walls and the core-and-veneer walls which used shaped sandstone masonry \"veneers\" over a stone rubble core. Both of these features made the walls massive and strong, allowing multistory construction. Both features were technologies apparently developed in Chaco Canyon. They are considered \"low-visibility features;\" because they're hidden in the final building, others would not be easily able to imitate them.</p>\n<p>From the surface, Aztec North looked very different from Aztec West. In shape and size, it looked very much like other Chacoan great houses, but its walls seemed to have melted away and left little sandstone behind. Archaeologists assumed that it was built mainly of adobe.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Our 2016 limited excavations revealed surprises. Instead of the adobe structure we expected, the rooms we excavated had core and veneer walls, with Chaco-style coursed sandstone masonry. This suggests, at minimum, an effort to conform to Chacoan ideals. In addition, we uncovered the same kind of massive foundation trenches that are typical of Chacoan construction (Fig. 3). But the cores of the walls consist of adobe chunked in by the handful?a construction method that is definitely not typical of Chacoan structures (Fig. 4). So the great house's construction seems to combine both Chacoan and local construction methods.</p>\n<p>We sought this NSF funding in order to radiocarbon date corncobs and other organic materials from the great house, to determine when it was built and occupied. In particular, we wanted to know if Aztec North predated Aztec West. The radiocarbon dating, combined with other lines of evidence such as the pottery we excavated and the architecture of the great house, confirms that this was the case. It was built sometime in the three or four decades before construction began at Aztec West, so near the end of the 11<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;century.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Having these dates for Aztec North makes it possible to more securely interpret the site. Despite the unusual architecture, other aspects of the great house look very much like what we would expect to find at a Chacoan great house. A large percentage of the pottery, for example, was imported from the Cibola and Chuska regions, a characteristic of Chaco. Despite the unusual construction, Aztec North was soon fully integrated into the Chacoan world.</p>\n<p>We also see the architecture as evidence of this transition. Archaeologists have tended to see Chacoan masonry as evidence of social hierarchy, of powerful people able to mobilize the labor of others. But Aztec North's adobe points more towards a community working together. Adobe construction does not require particular skill or strength, but everyone would have had to come together to lay 100 rooms' worth of adobe before the rains came. The combination of masonry and adobe points to a community transitioning from egalitarian labor regimes to a more hierarchical system.</p>\n<p>Our research at Aztec North has demonstrated that archaeological models of Chacoan expansion have been too simplistic. While Chacoan-trained builders were clearly involved in construction at some outlier great houses, and other great houses were local imitations of Chacoan architecture, Aztec North was something in between. It was built by people who had not previously built a great house, but they were not completely lacking in Chacoan knowledge. Moreover, people here engaged in an audacious experiment in adobe construction, on an unprecedented scale.</p>\n<p>This research will add greatly to Park Service interpretation at Aztec Ruins National Monument. Rangers can now tell visitors more reliable dates for Aztec North and describe a more complex relationship with Chaco Canyon than was previously understood, in addition to other details we have revealed about food and daily life at this site. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>This project also contributes to a greater public understanding of cultural landscapes. Aztec North stands at the apex of this landscape, with a road running up from the valley and with visual and ideological connections to other parts of the Chacoan world. The PIs' research results highlight the importance of preserving this landscape and the viewsheds, roads, and alignments that connect Aztec's great houses to each other and to the rest of the Chacoan world.&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 11/12/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Michelle&nbsp;Turner</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1838474/1838474_10559635_1573089532532_AzWwithmesa--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1838474/1838474_10559635_1573089532532_AzWwithmesa--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Fig. 2 Aztec West\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1838474/1838474_10559635_1573089532532_AzWwithmesa--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Fig. 2 Aztec West\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A view of Aztec West, which was extensively excavated in the early 20th century.
