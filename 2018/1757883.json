 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a new Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site in physics at Oklahoma State University.  Between six and eight undergraduate students will be supported per year for ten weeks of summer research.  The primary objective is to immerse students in a stimulating multidisciplinary research atmosphere that will allow the participants to pursue a personalized research project in physics. This REU program will develop human resources that enhance the nation's technology base and are critical for the well-being of society at-large.\r\n\r\nResearch projects are available in several research areas including Atomic Physics, Computational Physics, Experimental and Theoretical High Energy Physics, Optical Physics, Optoelectronics, and Quantum Information Sciences. Participants will also attend seminars on a variety of topics including both professional development and careers in physics, receive ethics and safety training, and engage in cohort activities with the other students.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
