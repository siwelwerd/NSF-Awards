 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nitrate is an important nutrient that marine plants and algae need for growth. It is abundant in deep ocean waters, but scarce in most sunlit surface waters. The purpose of this project is to better understand what controls the availability of nitrate in the deep ocean and its delivery to surface waters. Researchers from Stanford University, Princeton University, and Brown University will analyze the stable isotopes of seawater nitrate collected between Alaska and Tahiti in the Pacific Ocean. The data will provide information about the supply of nitrate to a large section of the Pacific Ocean and allow informed decisions on past and future changes in marine photosynthesis. This collaborative project will be carried under the GEOTRACES program, an international effort to understand the distribution of elements in the global ocean. This study will include undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral researchers at all three academic instititutions. The investigators will develop a 1-day workshop for the Teachers as Scholars program, for middle and high school teachers at Princeton University. The workshop will focus on accessing and visualizing ocean data sets and other content available on the internet for project-based learning in the classroom. Investigators will also participate in teacher workshops offered each summer at Stanford University. Data from this project will be made available to the public through the Biological and Chemical Oceanography-Data Management Office (www.bco-dmo.org). The data will also be compiled in GEOTRACES data products that will be freely available.\r\n\r\nThe isotopic composition of nitrate in the ocean interior records biogeochemical and physical processes on the time scales of years, decades, centuries, and millennia, with the shallow subsurface and deep ocean recording shorter and longer time scales, respectively. These are meaningful time scales in the efforts to (1) understand the feedbacks that structure the biogeochemistry of N in the ocean, ocean productivity, and the global carbon cycle, (2) reconstruct past changes in ocean biogeochemistry and carbon cycling, and (3) perhaps predict future changes. This proposal seeks to analyze the nitrate isotopes during the upcoming US GEOTRACES Pacific Meridional Transect (GP15) between Alaska and Tahiti. Nitrate isotopes provide critical constraints on the ocean N cycle and budget, especially in the Pacific Ocean where a variety of processes affect the distribution of nitrate and its supply to surface waters. This largely meridional section of nitrate isotope data will be broadly useful as part of the growing nitrate isotope dataset for the global ocean and for comparison to the many complementary geochemical data sets that will be generated as part of this GEOTRACES effort. In addition, nitrate isotopes in aerosols will be measured to support interpretations of nitrate isotopes in surface waters along the section. The proposed measurements will contribute to the investigation of three overarching questions: 1) What are the similarities and differences in N biogeochemistry among the different nutrient-rich regions in the Pacific basin: the Southern Ocean, equatorial Pacific, and subarctic North Pacific, and how do they affect nitrate supply to low-latitude surface waters? 2) What sources of nitrogen fuel export production in surface waters across the Pacific? 3) What are the roles in surface and subsurface processes in the distribution of nitrate isotopes in the ocean interior?",

The ratio of heavy to light stable isotopes of nitrogen (N) and oxygen (O) in nitrate reflects the processes that have produced, consumed, and modified thte nitrate. Our core goal in this project was to generate nitrate 15N/14N ratio (&delta;15N) and 18O/16O ratio (&delta;18O) measurements along the US GEOTRACES Pacific Meridional GP15 transect (Figure 1). The nitrate isotope measurements were merged with the other data generated from the GP15 expedition to investigate modern ocean processes and to provide ground-truthing of tools used for reconstruction of past ocean conditions and changes.\n\nNitrate &delta;15N records a range of physical, biological, and chemical processes in the ocean that combine to form \"feedbacks\" (interactions among processes) that ultimately control the productivity of the ocean and the ocean/atmosphere partitioning of carbon dioxide. While nitrate consuming processes have a similar impact on the &delta;15N and &delta;18O of nitrate, nitrate consuming processes can affect nitrate isotopes differently. Thus, nitrate &delta;18O measurements are complementary to &delta;15N measurements, helping to separate and quantify overlapping imprints of multiple N fluxes. This is particularly important in the Pacific, which hosts all major N fluxes, including the processes of the so-called fixed N budget (N2 fixation and denitrification, the source and the sink of the global ocean?s r fixed N) and the processes of the ocean's internal N cycle (the cycling among different forms of fixed N; for instance, nitrate assimilation in which phytoplankton build their tissues using dissolved nitrate).  \n\nThe distribution of the nitrate isotopes along US GEOTRACES GP15 (extending from 60&deg;N to 20&deg;S of the Pacific Ocean at 152&deg;W) reveals a strong North-to-South asymmetry, with the North and South Pacific being dominated by different N fluxes.  \n\nIn the southern equatorial-to-tropical Pacific, the impact of denitrification (signaled by a deficit in nitrate relative to phosphate that is also characterized by high nitrate &delta;15N and &delta;18O) is restricted to ~300 m depth (Figure 2).

The latitude of greatest N2 fixation appears to coincide with the northern margin of upwelling of the denitrified waters. These results are consistent with a previously proposed feedback in which denitrification encourages N2 fixation at a comparable rate, the net result of which is stabilization of the global ocean's fixed N reservoir. \n\nThe project supported the researchers' involvement in workshops for middle and high school teachers and the development of web portal for displaying the published nitrate isotope data available for the global ocean.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/26/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Daniel M Sigman"
