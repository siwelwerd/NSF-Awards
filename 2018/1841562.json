 "awd_abstract_narration": "This travel grant helps fund 15 students to attend the annual ACM Conference in Information-Centric Networking, September 21-23, 2018 at Northeastern University, Boston, Massachusetts. This conference is the leading venue for research on the relatively new concept of Information Centric networking that gained credence as a result of the NSF's Future Internet Architecture program. Students given the opportunity to attend and participate in the conference will be exposed to and interact with the leaders in this field of research, a full program of peer-reviewed papers, poster and demonstration sessions, and social events. Exposing graduate students to the research venues and participants in the research field of their choice is a critical part of their education. These travel grants will allow them to attend.\r\n\r\nThe best research occurs when researchers are able to interact directly, discussing and questioning each others' research. This is very effectively achieved at research conferences. Enabling students to participate fully is key to building the next generation of top-notch researchers. The more frequently they are included in the research community and able to participate in such conferences, the better prepared they will be to become full-fledged researchers. This award supports US students generally, but specifically targets women, underrepresented minorities, and students with disabilities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Students who are first authors are expected to be supported by their academic advisors. It is especially important to reach students who may have less access to such conference, including but not limited to those from under-represented minorities in the field. For this conference, in addition to the conference website, email is sent to a number of places including: the ICN working group of the Internet Research Task Force, the ACM Sigcomm (Special Interest Group on Communications) general mailing list, and then lists to reach women, Blacks, Hispanics, and people with accessibility limitations. In addition, in this conference we have reached out to students from non-first tier universities, to include students more broadly.
