 "awd_abstract_narration": "After decades of research and development, the search for gravitational waves has finally succeeded, and their detection has forever changed the field of astronomy.  During the first two observing runs NSF's Advanced LIGO detectors have already detected at least five binary black hole mergers and one binary neutron star merger.  While these detections have already validated the theory of general relativity at new levels, enabled novel cosmological measurements, and greatly advanced our understanding of compact objects, they have only scratched the surface of what these detectors can achieve.  LIGO and Virgo's next observing campaigns will bring hundreds more observations of compact binary mergers. The goal of this work is to use those detections to answer the questions: 1) How are compact binaries formed? and 2) Are we missing unmodeled physics?  The group conducting this work will include a teacher from a local high school for two consecutive summers, enabling the integration of topics in gravitational wave astronomy into the curriculum.  \r\n\r\nOver the next 2-3 years, LIGO's improved sensitivity will increase detection rates from one per month to one per day. This award will support the development and employment of the next generation of source characterization tools to enable new science in the regime of high-event-rate observation, including rapid and automated event follow-up, binary population characterization, and constraints on deviations from predicted signal models. New Bayesian hierarchical modeling tools will be developed and deployed to assess compact binary formation environments.  Alternative signal models will also be developed, which will be sensitive to a range of unmodeled physics (e.g., tidal disruptions of neutron stars, excitation of neutron star resonances, deviations from relativity), that current characterization techniques could miss.  To enable this science an improved analysis infrastructure is necessary, capable of handling much higher event rates.  This award will support the development of a new open-source gravitational wave data analysis library that incorporates the models developed as part of this work, as well as other techniques necessary for characterizing compact binary mergers detected by LIGO.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nSince the first detection of gravitational waves from a binary black hole merger on September 14, 2015, the LIGO and Virgo detectors have collected an impressive census of compact binary mergers in the local universe. By the end of the second observing run in August 2017 the LIGO Scientific Collaboration and Virgo Collaboration claimed a total of 10 binary black hole mergers and one binary neutron star merger. The third observing run spanned April 2019 through March 2020, and the pending update to the gravitational wave transient catalog (GWTC) will likely bring us close to 100 compact binary mergers.\n\nWith the PI serving as co-chair of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration\u2019s working group on compact binary mergers during the award period, this award supported the leadership of, and contributions to, the analysis and publication of compact binary mergers observed during LIGO and Virgo\u2019s third observing run.  Discoveries made during this time include the second binary neutron star merger detected by gravitational wave emission (GW190425), the first binary black hole system with evidence of unequal masses (GW190412), the least massive black hole or most massive neutron star ever observed (GW190814), the first detection of an intermediate-mass black hole (GW190521), and the first detections of neutron-star-black-hole binaries (GW200105 &amp; GW200115).\n\nThe award also supported the development and application of techniques to better understand black hole and neutron star formation from gravitational wave observations.  For individual gravitational wave measurements, we searched for and ruled out novel forms of potential departures from the predictions of general relativity.  Using these same techniques applied to the catalog of black hole mergers, we found evidence of interesting features in the distribution of black hole masses around 10 times the mass of our sun, hinting at possible physical mechanisms that play an important role in black hole formation that will be better resolved with future updates to the catalog.\n\nWe also developed a \"gap\" model designed to look for missing black holes in the distribution of black hole masses in our catalog.  We used this model to assess the evidence for a gap in the distribution of black holes around 70 times the mass of our sun, a prediction of stellar modeling due to a special type of supernova (pair instability supernova) that is expected to disrupt the black hole formation process for stars that would potentially produce black holes of this mass.  Our modest sensitivity to such black holes has made such measurements inconclusive thus far but is expected to improve with future catalogs.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/29/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Ben Farr"
