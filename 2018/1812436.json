 "awd_abstract_narration": "Traveling waves are solutions to time-dependent systems that propagate without changing their shape. They are observed throughout the natural world and include surface and internal waves in the ocean, ignition fronts in combustion theory, and even stripe patterns in animal fur. Through their ubiquity, traveling waves command the interest of researchers in nearly every corner of the physical and biological sciences. This project aims to develop novel tools for constructing large-amplitude waves, especially for the important case of pulses, which are localized disturbances that travel through unbounded domains (such as tsunami waves or rough waves). In a related direction, the project will apply and extend a new theoretical framework for diagnosing stability of traveling waves solutions, i.e., capacity of the waves to persist when subjected to a disturbance. This project will advance the mathematical understanding of traveling waves; the results will have implications to oceanography, fluid mechanics, and combustion theory. More generally, the techniques developed by this study are intended to provide a framework with considerable potential for future applications to a broad array of disciplines. Graduate students will be trained and actively involved in this research. \r\n \r\nThis project aims to advance the mathematical understanding of traveling waves along two parallel tracks: existence theory and stability theory. The first set of activities concern the existence of large-amplitude traveling waves on unbounded domains.  While many tools currently exist for constructing small-amplitude waves in a neighborhood of known explicit solutions, the non-perturbative regime is far less well understood.  This is particularly true for problems set on unbounded domains, for which issues of compactness seriously frustrate what tools are available.  This project will develop a global bifurcation theoretic machinery designed to overcome these obstructions using symmetry and monotonicity properties.  This new framework will then be used to address important open problems in a variety of systems.  Specifically, these applications include (i) construct large-amplitude bore solutions to a two-phase fluid system in a channel; (ii) prove the existence of large-amplitude traveling waves evolving according to general non-compact symmetry groups, for example scroll ring solutions to reaction-diffusion equations; and (iii) extend beyond the appearance of internal stagnation points a family of large-amplitude solitary stratified water waves constructed in earlier work. A second set of projects will develop new systematic tools for diagnosing the orbital stability or instability of traveling solutions to abstract Hamiltonian systems that possess symmetries. This work aims to relax key hypotheses in existing theory to allow more direct application to highly nonlinear systems like those governing water waves.  Using this machinery, it is planned to (i) prove the instability of internal waves in a two-phase system confined to a channel and (ii) give a new systematic proof of the stability and instability of Korteweg?de Vries solitons. Moreover, a local well-posedness theory in the Hadamard sense for the water wave problem with a point vortex will be provided.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual Merit\n\nTraveling waves arise in applications ranging from optics to combustion theory to epidemiology, and they have an especially deep connection to fluid mechanics.  This project advanced the understanding of traveling waves along two parallel tracks: (i) establishing the existence of new types of waves that are large or non-perturbative in some sense, and (ii) determining the stability/instability of several physically important types waves.  Notably, these results were obtained through the development of new systematic tools that will drive future research.  In total, the project produced 13 manuscripts; 10 have been accepted and three are currently under review.  Major highlights include the following.\n\nExistence:\n\nProved the existence of large families of stationary capillary-gravity waves in water exhibiting a vortex spike.  These are solitary waves in the sense that the free surface is asymptotically flat, and the vorticity is spiked in that it is exponentially localized in space.  Remarkably, while their amplitude is small, these waves carry finite kinetic energy that does not tend to zero as the height of the wave decreases. In this and other respects, they are strikingly different from any other rotational water waves in the literature. \nDeveloped a general theory for constructing large front-type solutions to elliptic PDEs set on unbounded domains.  Problems of this form can be found in many physical contexts.  As just one concrete application, the machinery was used to construct large-amplitude internal hydrodynamic bores of elevation and depression.  Bores are ubiquitous in coastal regions and of great interest to geophysics and oceanography.  Small-amplitude bores have been obtained previously (including in other work done as part of this award) but this is first rigorous work that pushes into the non-perturbative regime.  Following the elevation bore curve to its extreme, one finds waves whose interfaces either overturn or become singular in that the flow in both layers degenerates at a single point on the boundary.   For the limiting depression bore, either the interface overturns or it contacts the upper wall.   Both possibilities are connected to longstanding open problems in water waves.\nStudied front-type anti-plane shear deformations of an incompressible elastic solid whose reference configuration is an infinite cylinder with a cross section that is unbounded in one direction. For a class of generalized neo-Hookean strain energy densities and live body forces, curves of front-type solutions of arbitrarily large magnitude were constructed. \n\n\nStability:\n\nMade a number of significant discoveries regarding the stability of water waves with surface tension (capillary-gravity waves).  First, we proved that small-amplitude capillary-gravity waves with a submerged point vortex are stable to perturbations.  This is one of the only known results on the nonlinear stability of water waves with vorticity.  It was accomplished using a substantial improvement of classical methodology that allows one to treat far more complicated systems.  A PhD student supported by the award studied water waves with a submerged dipole (two counter rotating point vortices), showing that this configuration is generically unstable.  \nCharacterized the stability of internal capillary-gravity waves.  Like the hydrodynamic bores mentioned above, these are waves that move along the interface separating two layers of fluid of differing density.  When the surface tension is strong, we proved that small-amplitude solitary waves are always stable in the orbital sense --- that is, their shape is robust to small perturbations.  With near-critical surface tension, moreover, it was shown that the stability/instability is determined by the stability properties of the corresponding traveling wave solutions to a much simpler dispersive model equation.  Both of these results hold even in the case of a single fluid beneath vacuum.  A PhD student supported by the award extended this study to the case where the flow in each layer has constant vorticity.  \n\n\nBroader Impact\n\nThe PI has given 22 invited talks on the subject of this research, at both domestic and international international venues.  These included several expositional lectures aimed at the broader mathematical community: the PI delivered an invited colloquium at the University of Vienna and participated in the Online Northeast PDE Seminar program on water waves.  The latter of these was a series of lectures aimed at introducing graduate students and early career researchers to this area of research.  The PI coauthored a survey article based on these lectures which has recently appeared.  \nAs community outreach, the PI gave a public lecture to the math honor society at Hickman High, a local high school in Columbia, Missouri.  \nFinally, the award has supported the travel and summer research of three PhD students who have made central contributions to the research.  Their work resulted in four articles, three of which of have already appeared in high tier mathematics journals.  Two of these students won the Blumenthal Prize, which is an internal award given by the Math Department and the University of Missouri in recognition of the best PhD thesis of the year.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/19/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Samuel P Walsh"
