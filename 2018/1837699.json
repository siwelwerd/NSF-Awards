 "awd_abstract_narration": "San Francisco State University (SFSU) and the San Francisco Unified School District (SFUSD) propose a Research Practitioner Partnership (RPP) to address the lack of qualified computer science (CS) teachers at the high school level and the lack of diversity among high school students in CS courses. The RPP will develop and implement CS4SF, an innovative and scalable program for the professional development (PD) and ongoing support of high school CS teachers, supplying them with the knowledge and skills they need to teach this in-demand subject in a more rigorous manner while engaging a broader swath of students.\r\n\r\nCSforAll will implement a three-part program. Firstly, a one-week summer professional development course will immerse high school teachers in CS knowledge and evidence-based, inclusive pedagogical strategies. Secondly, a Community of Practice will meet monthly to provide teachers with their own inclusive learning community, offering support throughout the year and the opportunity to regularly interact with SFSU CS professors. Thirdly, teaching assistants, selected from the most talented CS undergraduates at SFSU, will assist teachers in the classroom for 4 to 5 hours a week, deepening their own CS knowledge as they collect student-generated ideas for culturally relevant classroom projects. For this work, SFSU and SFUSD have jointly developed an initial set of research questions: Does the CS4SF model improve high school teachers' mastery of CS concepts and pedagogy, so that they can teach beyond the curriculum and truly engage their students? Does the CS4SF model improve the engagement of female and other students from other underrepresented groups in high school CS courses? What is the potential for sustainability and scalability of the CS4SF model? \r\n\r\nThe strategies identified will be of broad interest as the problems that SFUSD faces today are similar to those faced by many other school districts as they try to ramp up their CS offerings. Over the course of this grant, the RPP will reach 100 teachers, 72 teaching assistants, and 5,000+ high school students.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

K-12 CS education is a relatively new and emerging field. The research outcomes of this project contributed to the understanding of 1) how to design and implement short and long CS teacher professional development to improve high school teachers&rsquo; mastery of CS concepts and pedagogy, and 2) how to design CS professional learning activities to integrate CS content knowledge with culturally relevant and inclusive pedagogy. This project has generated knowledge, experience, and resources that can be used more broadly by the educational community to provide professional development for high school CS teachers and improve the rigor of their CS education. This project has provided professional development and support for 100+ CS teachers in San Francisco and the Bay Area in California, trained 93 CS undergraduate students as effective teaching assistants, and reached 5000+ high school students. With greater content knowledge of CS and how to engage all of their students, the high school CS teachers supported by this project felt more confident in their teaching abilities and more fulfilled by their jobs. This also increased high school CS teacher recruitment and retention. Moreover, with the leadership skills they learnt in this program&mdash;by participating in the professional development activities, leading discussions and meetings, and presenting their projects to the outside world&mdash;the teachers, many of whom are female or from underrepresented groups (URGs), have the potential to become pioneers in the field of CS education. This project has also significantly improved access to CS courses and experience in CS courses of high school students in San Francisco Unified School District (SFUSD), especially female students and URG students such as Hispanic and African American students. The number of high school CS teachers in SFUSD who are equipped with solid CS content knowledge and understand how to recruit, support, and engage female and URG students has been significantly increased, which resulted in not only an increasing number of students enrolled in CS classes but also an increasing percentage of female and URG students in high school CS courses. For example, the percentage of African American students in high school CS classes in SFUSD during the past decade increased from 0.4% in 2013-2014 to 6% in 2021-2022, now reflecting their composition in SFUSD. The percentage of URG students in high school introductory CS courses increased from 12% in 2013-2014 to 46% in 2021-2022, now exceeding the school district&rsquo;s average of 39%. The percentage of URG students in high school AP CS courses increased from 5% in 2013-2014 to 17% in 2021-2022. These students now have access to a highly marketable set of skills, making them more attractive to universities and employers. This is the first step in ensuring broader CS participation. In addition, every high school student who is taught by a CS teacher supported by this project, or who interacts with one of the teaching assistants provided in this project, receives a more rigorous and engrossing CS education. These impacts will continue to accrue long after this grant is over, as the CS4SF teachers teach more students every year. As a more diverse pool of high school students graduate with a higher level of CS knowledge, and greater confidence in their ability to succeed in this field, universities, the tech industry, and society will benefit. The rate and scale of innovation will increase, as the CS pipeline becomes more diverse and a wider range of ideas and approaches is brought to bear on society&rsquo;s most pressing problems.</span></p>\n</span></p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 01/28/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Hao&nbsp;Yue</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"></div>\n</div>",
