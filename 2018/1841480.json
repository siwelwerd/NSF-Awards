 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent advances in astronomical facilities have opened new windows on the universe that extend observing capabilities beyond conventional telescopes. Joint observations that combine telescopes, neutrino detectors, and new gravitational wave detectors including the NSF-supported LIGO Observatory are revealing aspects of the universe that are presently a mystery. Just recently, signals from the collision of two extremely dense neutron stars - a merger known as GW170817 - were detected by both conventional telescopes and gravitational wave detectors.  The event was detected first in gravitational waves, two seconds later in gamma rays, after 10 hours in optical, ultraviolet, infrared, and much later in x-ray and radio waves.  From this single event, the world learned that some short-hard gamma ray bursts indicate neutron star mergers, that these mergers might be the origin of many elements in the periodic table such as gold and platinum, that gravity and light travel at the same speed, and that gravitational waves really could measure how fast the universe is expanding.  Despite what was learned, GW170817 left the world with many questions. What object was formed afterward? Was it another neutron star? Was it a black hole? Why was the gamma ray burst associated with GW170817 unlike anything else that had been observed? Answering these questions, and conducting these kinds of joint observations on a regular basis, requires significant computing and software infrastructure (cyberinfrastructure).\r\n\r\nThe project proposes to develop the cyberinfrastructure necessary to give earlier gravitational event alerts to other astronomical facilities than is currently possible, allowing researchers to collect as much data as possible about these new types of celestial events. This project will fortify the streaming data delivery of LIGO by producing sub-second data delivery to a streaming early warning search for neutron star mergers. Substantial automated monitoring and feedback will ensure the entire system operates without manual intervention. The project will capitalize upon existing NSF investments in cyber-infrastructure for real-time gravitational wave analysis and will significantly augment the data delivery and automation layer for detections which is presently a bottleneck and failure mode. Using gravitational waves to provide an early warning for robotic telescopes will significantly enhance the scientific utility of LIGO data and significantly facilitate multi-messenger astrophysics.  This proposal will promote the progress of science in two of the National Science Foundation's 10 Big Ideas: \"Harnessing the Data Revolution\" \"Windows on the Universe: The Era of Multi-Messenger Astrophysics\". \r\n\r\nThis project is supported by the Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure in the Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n \nIn 2015 scientists working with the National Science Foundation\u2019s Laser Interferometric Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) detected minute distortions in the fabric of space itself.  These distortions, called gravitational waves, confirmed a one-hundred year old prediction of Einstein whereby massive objects orbiting one another send ripples across the universe that ever so slightly change the distance between objects as they pass.  Using lasers to carefully measure distances across 4 km long vacuum chambers, scientists confirmed passing ripples from two black holes that merged over a billion years ago.  Since that historic day, the same scientists have confirmed 100 more merging black holes.  In 2017, the same scientists detected a new type of merging celestial objects - neutron stars. Neutron stars - extremely dense objects formed from the collapse of stars about ten times more massive than our sun - have long been thought to be responsible for a variety of astronomical phenomena including gamma ray bursts discovered decades ago and now known to be cosmologically distributed (uniformly spread throughout space and much farther away than our own Galaxy.)
