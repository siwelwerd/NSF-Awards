 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, at the University of Maine, establishes an Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Site at this institution.\r\n\r\nNSF Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors.\r\n\r\nWith an I-Corps Sites designation at the University of Maine, its Foster Center builds upon the programming and the university's research and development activities to support campus-based teams. The Site's innovation training supports the commercialization of natural resource-based technologies that can have a significant impact on rural communities. Maine relies on a natural resource-based economy and the state adopts unique tactics to remain innovative. \r\n\r\nThe UMaine I-Corps Site program fills a critical gap between awareness and training and more intensive support programs. Involving teams in the I-Corps Site at an early stage in the commercialization pathway increases the likelihood of success as these teams move into more intensive accelerator and incubation programs and the next step in the commercialization pathway. The Site acts as a \"pre-accelerator\" helping them understand the market opportunities for their technologies through customer discovery and competitive and patentability analysis.\r\n\r\nWhile supporting rural economic growth, the I-Corps Site also supports the full inclusion of women in entrepreneurship with a campus research center focused on recruiting, retaining, and advancing women faculty. Campus resources for women researchers are utilized and expanded with resources from I-Corps. The Foster Center incorporates training to help women entrepreneurs reach commercialization. The Foster Center has a strong history of promoting female entrepreneurship, and four out of five teams currently participating in the Center's Accelerator program are led by women. Notably, the I-Corps Site will be led by two successful and experienced female innovators.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

While our efforts were hampered in 2020 by the Covid-19 crisis, UMaine ultimately had 46 teams participate in the I-Corps Site over the life of this grant, exceeding the target of 41 teams.

I-Corps participants are trained in customer discovery techniques and the Business Model Canvas.  Through their customer discovery activities, participants identify the 1-3 best high-potential market applications for product-market fit, value proposition, and growth opportunity.\n\nUpon completion of I-Corps, teams are encouraged to pursue follow-on programs such as our MIRTA accelerator, National I-Corps, and Top Gun startup accelerator.  The I-Corps Site program has helped UMaine achieve its goal of creating a pipeline for the MIRTA research accelerator program and National I-Corps Teams training.\n\nMIRTA is designed to advance the commercial readiness of selected projects  in a short period of time.

Possible outcomes include a new startup company, a license to an existing company, or the formation of an extended research collaboration. Through weekly learning cycles, teams determine how to position and develop their research for commercialization success.\n\nTeam Results\nSince becoming an I-Corps Site, UMaine recruited for three MIRTA cohorts (2020, 2021, and 2022). All twelve teams that were selected to participate in this opportunity had completed I-Corps programming prior to MIRTA participation, which enabled the teams to make greater gains during MIRTA. As a result of participation in the I-Corps Site and MIRTA programs, eight startups have been created and teams have raised more than $2.5 million dollars in non-dilutive funding.  Five teams completed the National I-Corps program.\n\nImpact\nOne of the goals of UMaine's I-Corps site has been to translate technologies that can have a direct impact on economically distressed rural regions of our state. About one-third of the Site's I-Corps teams have innovations that are directly tied to Maine's natural resource economy and are well positioned to have an impact on rural Maine's forest, ocean, and agricultural sectors.  For some of these projects, access to raw materials, for instance, forest biomass for cellulose nanofibers that can be transformed into medical devices, is critical to success.
