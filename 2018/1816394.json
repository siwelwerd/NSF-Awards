 "awd_abstract_narration": "Just as a ball rolls downhill and comes to rest at the lowest point of potential energy, many physical and biological systems approach equilibrium at an energy-minimizing state. Sand is an example of such a system: being poured in a container it comes to rest in a randomly arranged state, but can transition to an even lower energy state through the addition of energy in the form of tapping the container. This research project seeks to predict how such granular materials respond to applied forces from the viewpoint of their underlying energy landscape, which like a mountain range is a vast expanse of valleys and peaks. Of particular interest is the effect of microgravity environments on granular systems, such as rubble-pile asteroids composed of loosely held-together dust and fractured rock. Like the sand sitting in a container, the weak gravitational force loosely holds the asteroid together in its shape. How the asteroid responds to the forces of probing or digging is important for developing mining techniques for such near-earth asteroids. \r\n\r\nThe project aims at developing new techniques for quantifying the relationship between high-dimensional complex energy-landscapes and the dynamics of the system. This relies on a new computational method for extracting the dominate features of the energy landscape by forming a low-dimensional bipartite graph representation; a network with two types of nodes, energy minimizers and accessible saddle points, connected by edges weighted by the energy barrier heights. The graph and dynamics taking place on the graph are then used to explain the behavior of large stochastic systems of interacting spheres, a model for granular materials in microgravity.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nUnderstanding systems with randomness creates additional mathematical challenges.  Such systems may have randomly arranged elements, or the elements might evolve randomly in time (or both!).  This project adressed two main mathematical challenges in such systems. \n\nThe first was to predict not only the random arrangement of elements given some physical rules, but also what neighboring states the system could directly transition to.  Much as a ball rolls down hill to the lowest point, the preferred state of a system is an energy-minimizing one with neighboring states being connected via a \"mountain pass\" (see the figure depicting the computational algorithm that searches for such mountain passes and neighboring states developed in this project.)\n\nAnother breakthrough of the project was creating an effective energy landscape for a randomly evolving in time system.  This approach correctly accounted for two sources of noise in the model while simultaneously determining the pathways the system follows in this effective energy landscape to visit different states.  \n\nThe complex stochastic (noisy) systems studied in this project are models of real physical systems, thus the found mathematical structure and mechanisms have helped explain the physical systems' dynamics.  Representing a granular material as a collection of randomly positioned soft spheres allowed exploration of the landscape and noticing correlations between the energy of neighboring states that has not been reported before.  This has the potential to lead to a better understanding of the transition from a jammed to an unjammed state and thus the stability of soil for landing spacecraft on asteroids or predicting catastrophic landslides.  A similar soft sphere model for chromosome dynamics with additional stochastic forces accounting for protein binding and unbinding dynamics has illuminated a possible mechanism for the formation of \"clusters\" seen experimentally.  This new insight into biology suggests the system utilizes noise in the protein binding to produce the desired behavior, in stark contrast to the usual picture that biological systems function properly despite the presence of noise.  This has the potential to change the viewpoint of many biological functions at the small scales of a cell and have a lasting impact on the field.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/06/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Katherine Newhall"
