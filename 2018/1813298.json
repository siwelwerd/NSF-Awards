 "awd_abstract_narration": "More than half of the stars in the night sky come with siblings.  Instead of maturing through their birth, middle age and death alone, they live their lives with one or more companion stars.  \"Binary stars\", where two stars progress through their life cycle together, are the most common form of multiple star systems.  The investigators seek to understand the final stages of the binary star life cycle, where the smaller star plunges into the atmosphere of the larger one leading to the spectacular phenomena called Common Envelope Evolution (CEE).  The CEE stage is one of the most difficult to understand and one of the most important stages of the binary star life cycle.  It is important because many of the Universe?s strangest and most exotic phenomena come from the Common Envelope stage.  The most famous recent example of a CEE event was the Black Hole-Black Hole merger, which made headlines across the world after being observed via gravitational waves with the NSF funded LIGO project.\r\n\r\nModeling CEE requires the most sophisticated supercomputer simulations because the process is so violent and occurs so quickly.   The investigators will use a newly developed supercomputer code to reveal new details of CEE and resolve long-standing mysteries about how the binary stars quickly shrink their orbit and drive huge amounts of material into space.  Their work will be closely tied to observations via their codes' ability to produce \"synthetic observations\" that can be directly compared with what is seen on the sky.  In addition, the investigators  will bring this research to the public through articles written for popular and on-line magazines.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Since the 1990s, the Hubble Space Telescope in particular, has revealed that most of these nebulae are puzzlingly bipolar if not multipolar. Most likely, these dying stars are not alone, but are under the strong gravitational and dynamical influence of a second less evolved more compact star. Much of the shaping likely happens when this companion star becomes engulfed by the distended envelope of the primary star, Understanding this so-called \"common envelope evolution phase has been a grand challenge problem of theoretical and computational astrophysics. Key questions that we address included: (i) how does the common envelope phase work to shape these bipolar nebulae, (ii) is the gravitational potential energy released from in-spiral of typical secondary stars enough to eject the envelope of the primary? and (iii) what happens if the secondary is not a star but a planet?\n\n\nOur work provided answers to these questions. We performed the highest resolution computer simulations of common envelope evolution to date and combined these with careful theoretical analyses to reach the following conclusions that resolved some long standing questions. For a typically evolved, distended, primary star of 2 solar masses we determined that the gravitational in-spiral of a secondary star of 1 solar mass can eject the envelope of the primary within 10 years after the envelope engulfs the companion, and the gravitational potential energy release from in-spiral is sufficient to accomplish this. Observations allow for 10,000 years for this ejection to occur, so this much shorter 10 year ejection time resolves a long standing debate as to whether an additional \"recombination\" energy that arises as expanding gas cools and transitions from ionized to neutral is needed: it is not.\n\n\nWe also found that, since angular momentum of the binary is transferred to the primary envelope material, which thereby produces an equatorial density enhancement and polar density deficit, even a spherical wind emanating from within will be collimated into bipolar outflows. This goes a long way to explain the universality of planetary nebulaes bipolarity. We also found that as the companion, as it in-spirals, can accrete matter from the envelope of the primary. Ultimately this may produce an accretion disk around the secondary from which a powerful jet can emerge.

Both possibilities may occur in nature.\n\n\nBroad Impact: In the process of studying these specific questions about interacting binary stars, we also worked on basic principles of rotating, ionized, magnetized, astrophysical flows around gravitating bodies. The uinderstanding systems with these features applies not only for binary stars but also anywhere gas flows in orbit around a gravitating body including newly forming stars and galactic centers.\n\n\nOur outreach and ...\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/11/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: AdamFrank\n"
