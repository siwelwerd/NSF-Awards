 "awd_abstract_narration": "Energy-harvesting devices are an emerging class of tiny, embedded computing and sensing systems that operate by collecting small amounts of energy extracted from their environment, tapping into sources such as radio waves, solar energy, and vibration.  With system support to make batteryless devices operate reliably, these devices will be a key enabler of future applications including the Internet of things, disaster zone and conflict zone sensing and communication, wearable and implantable medical devices, and aerospace applications including chip-scale nano-satellites. Building reliable batteryless hardware and software computer systems is a challenge because, unlike in a typical system, energy is only intermittently available.  When a batteryless device's intermittent energy supply is interrupted, the system suddenly resets, erasing some of the computer's memory, retaining some parts of the computers memory, and requiring the system to collect more energy before it can continue operating.  The intermittent power interruptions that occur in a batteryless system lead to new kinds of software errors are extremely difficult for a system designer to understand and fix. \r\nThe work in this project develops the tools and techniques required for non-experts to build batteryless computer systems that are highly reliable, efficient, and capable.  Making these systems reliable enables their use in societally important domains that demand dependable operation including in medical devices, defense applications, and emerging consumer space exploration systems.  This project will make batteryless systems accessible to even non-expert system builders, allowing entrepreneurs, researchers, and hobbyists to leverage these crucially important future computer sytems. Technology transfer of the ideas in the project will allow industry to incorporate batteryless computer systems into products, contributing to existing economic sectors such as the Internet of Things and Smart Cities devices.  Future industry adoption of the ideas in this proposal will contribute to the creation of new economic sectors around reliable, batteryless medical devices, disaster zone and war zone sensing and communication devices, and emerging small satellite-based devices.\r\nThe project serves the national interest with a coherent, integrated research and education plan that will help to prepare the next generation of STEM innovators, technology workers, makers, and computational thinkers.  The project's products incorporate into graduate and undergraduate curricular development and research creating an immediate impact and equipping undergraduate and graduate students to innovate using batteryless computer systems.  The project's high school intern program component and high school outreach program enables early learners to understand and use batteryless computer systems and develop an early interest in STEM.  The work makes batteryless computing devices broadly accessible facilitating outreach outside of the STEM field, allowing even artists and designers to use products of this project in creative applications.  The purpose of outreach to high schoolers and creative users is to encourage involvement of under-represented minorities in computing and to build a more diverse and effective future STEM workforce.\r\n\r\n",

These \"energy-harvesting\" devices can only operate when energy is available and cannot operate when energy is not available. The benefit of energy-harvesting is that a device can operate without having a battery, or any of the supply chain, maintenance (e.g., battery replacements and charging), or disposal chain costs of batteries. Batteryless devices are cheaper, can be scaled to larger deployments, and at the same time, have a smaller environmental footprint, providing a more sustainable path for future large-scale deployements. Uses cases that benefit from the scale of batteryless devices are far-reaching and include use cases spanning from civil infrastructure monitoring, smart cities instrumentation, industrial equipment monitors, perimeter security and national interest applications, and even tiny, chip-scale space systems; in fact, a system developed as part of this project was even deployed to low-Earth orbit to validate the key findings of the project.\n\n\nThe benefits of batteryless devices are many, but their challenges are many as well. Batteryless devices operate only intermittently, when energy is available. Intermittent execution on energy-harvesting devices can lead to problems, when power fails at an inopportune moment in an application's execution. Normally, when an application developer builds an application, they do not expect power to fail, and when an abrupt power failure in an intermittent execution violates that expectation, hardware and software behavior can deviate from the intention of the application developer and fail to work correctly. These failures to operate correctly can cause safety problems, can cause devices to crash and need to be redeployed, and can even lead to security vulnerabilities.\n\n\nThis project developed new technology to make it possible for a device to operate intermittently without facing any of these existentially detrimental problems. The techniques rely on a mixture of hardware and software support, spanning from the highest level of abstractions around new programming languages, down to the lowest level of abstraction around new circuits for power systems, and everything in between, including computer architecures and operating systems. Together this mix of techniques lets programmers reason in a simple way about how to build their programs and applications, without having to think about the complexities that stem from abrupt power failures, such as memory corruption, the lack of forward progress in a program, or unexpected behavior by input/output devices. The work produced a variety of new hardware and software systems that are of immediate and concrete value to other researchers and practicioners for developing new, batteryless devices that can be applied to problems of societal importance today. The techniques provide a firm intellectual foundation for the now-growing field of intermittent computing, enabling researchers to build out new sub-disciplines based on the underpinnings of this system support for intermittent computation.\n\n\nIn the long view, this project's lasting impact will be to enable the widespread use of batteryless devices that safely and reliably perform intermittent computations. This project established intermittent computation as a core sub-discipline of computer systems and architecture, and will enable generations of practitioners and researchers to create value to society through new applications that are now possible, more sustainable batteryless solutions to societal problems, and new research that will increase the visibility and prominence of the ever-important goal of energy-efficiency, sustainability, and scalability for real world devices.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/18/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: BrandonLucia\n"
