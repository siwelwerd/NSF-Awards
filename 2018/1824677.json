 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports attendance for up to 40 U.S. scientists at the 35th SCAR Open Science Conference (OSC) to enable them to present their scientific findings, develop new collaborations with international scientists and become involved in SCAR-related activities and SCAR specialists groups. In previous symposia, U.S. scientists have made important and significant contributions to the success of the SCAR Open Science Conferences. The SCAR-OSC provides a key platform for generating or augmenting international collaborations not generally available for graduate students and early-career researchers. The 35th SCAR-OSC meeting: Polar 2018 will bring together Antarctic and Arctic researchers for a unique bi-polar event and exchange of information in Davos, Switzerland, June 19-23, 2018. \r\n \r\nThe scientific program for the SCAR Open Science Conference emphasizes interdisciplinary research that places Antarctica and the Southern Ocean in a global context, providing essential perspective for students and early-career researchers. In 2018 the meeting is being organized around 12 science themes that include polar (arctic and Antarctic) physical, biological, and social sciences. In addition, there are a myriad of side-meetings, activities, trainings, and workshops surrounding the main sessions. This support will allow a more diverse group of researchers to participate in defining the future direction of international Antarctic and polar research and will encourage global collaboration and cooperation. It will augment the training and development of graduate students and young investigators as they benefit from the opportunity to interact with the international community of Antarctic (and Arctic) researchers. Individuals at all levels (students to senior researchers) interested in engaging in international collaborative activities and, potentially, assuming active leadership roles in SCAR groups, will be targeted for support. The Association of Polar Early Career Scientists (APECS), an international organization that aims to facilitate interdisciplinary research collaborations and develop future leaders in polar research, education and outreach, will have a one-day career development workshop available for early-career researchers at the 35th SCAR Open Science Conference.",
