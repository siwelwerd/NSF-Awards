 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-Technical Summary\r\n\r\nThe discovery and design of new metals involves controlling material composition and structure at the microscale.  By such control, better materials can be made for many different applications, from structural materials to catalysts to batteries, and to materials with high tolerance to radiation damage.  This program is examining a new approach to making these next-generation metals and metallic nanostructures, mixing inspiration from powder metallurgy and from an exotic materials processing technique called dealloying.  Dealloying occurs when one element of a solid metal is pulled out of the metal, leaving behind a nanoporous material.  The central hypothesis of this work, is that a powder mixture can be used to create dealloyed materials.  One powder component acts to absorb elements dealloyed from the other.  Because powders are being used, it is expected that bulk amounts of processed materials can be made easily and readily tested for different applications. Student training at the undergraduate and graduate levels will help develop the next generation of materials scientists trained in modern metallurgy.  Such training will be complemented by organizing and participating in international conferences on dealloying and related professional development.\r\n\r\n\r\nTechnical Summary\r\n\r\nNanocomposite and nanoporous metals consisting of multiple interpenetrating but compositionally distinct solid and void phases hold promise for structural applications requiring high strength, high ductility, radiation tolerance, catalysis, sensing, supercapacitors, batteries, and as templates to make new nanocomposites via backfilling.  A technique to make such materials is dealloying - the selective dissolution of one component from a multi-component alloy.  This project explores the next-generation of dealloyed nanostructured materials, using a concept called powder-based dealloying.  Powder-based dealloying refers to the metallurgical phase evolution in the environment of mixed powders, where the composition of one powder is the material to be dealloyed, and the other powder, when melted, acts as the dealloying medium.  This involves analysis of the kinetics of dealloying in fixed volumes, and it is hypothesized that bulk samples of metals can be made that exhibit very fine microstructures with characteristic lengths less than 50 nm.  We are also taking the first steps to assess how dealloying can be integrated into powder metallurgical processing methods, and perhaps ultimately additive manufacturing. By examining a range of model materials made by powder-based dealloying, a database of basic physical kinetics behavior will be developed that will be applicable to many high-temperature processing technologies, from sintering to additive manufacturing, as well as more efficiently work with rare, hard-to-sustain, and refractory materials. Student training at the undergraduate and graduate levels will help develop the next generation of materials scientists trained in modern metallurgy.  Such training will be complemented by organizing and participating in international conferences on dealloying and related professional development.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nNanocomposite and nanoporous metals consisting of multiple interpenetrating but compositionally distinct solid and void phases hold promise for structural applications requiring high strength, high ductility, radiation tolerance, catalysis, sensing, supercapacitors, batteries, and as templates to make new nanocomposites via backfilling.  In this program, we have explored the next-generation of a pioneering technique to produce these kinds of nanostructured metals - Powder-Based Dealloying (PBD).  Dealloying generally refers to the selective dissolution of one component from a multi-component alloy.  Historically, there has been a focus on electrochemical dealloying, in which selective dissolution occurs in an electrolyte; more recently there has been a focus on liquid metal dealloying, in which selective dissolution occurs in a molten metal in which only one alloy constituent can be dissolved.  Here we used alloy powders mixed with a second powder capable of driving dealloying either in the liquid or solid state.  By using powders instead of bulk materials, we showed we were able to make solids with a uniform microstructure and that these materials are compatible with additive manufacture (3D printing of metals).  Specific outcomes include:\n\n* An in-depth study of PBD of Ti-Ta powders dealloyed by copper powders.  We identified processing conditions in which Ti-Ta powders can be processed into bicontinuous microstructures by simply pressing and heat treating.  The length scale of the microstructures were tunable by annealing for different times and temperatures, driven by diffusion in molten Cu at high temperatures, or solid state diffusion at temperatures below the melting point.  By adjusting the Cu:Ti-Ta ratio, we were able to confirm a project hypothesis that the driving force for dealloying could be tuned by controlling the saturation of Ti in the copper phase.  Materials with small (&lt; 500 nm) microstructural lengthscales were found to exhibit \"smaller is stronger\" properties compared to bulk alloys of the same composition.\n\n* We examined a dealloying of silicon from SiC in molten germanium and discovered a new method to produce porous carbon.  We did a study using bulk SiC, with an eye toward using powdered SiC/Ge mixures in a follow-up study.  A study of selective dissolution of Ni from Ni-C metastable alloys was also completed.\n\n* We worked in collaboration with Alain Karma at Northeastern University on a theory project examining the fundamental of liquid metal dealloying of Ti-Ta alloys using phase field modeling supported by experiments.  We made an important discovery, namely, that when Ti dissolves in Cu inside a pore, a small but finite solubility of Ta near the interface is created.  This \"Ta-leak\" leads to lateral partitioning of Ta in the melt - a kind of inverted eutectic solidification effect - that has profound implications for the range of morphological microstructures formable via PBD or liquid metal dealloying.\n\n* We studied the properties of a plasma-sprayed coating of Cr-Ti powders on nickel-based substrates, and disovered that these powders can react with the substrate to \"internally dealloy\" through the formation of an interfacial eutectic molten metal phase.  The properties of these coating include extremely high hardness.\n\n* We worked in collaboration on a new modality for dealloying, vapor phase dealloying, in which one component selectively evaporates from a bulk alloy.\n\nThis program supported two graduate students, who participated in real and virtual conferences.  Five published papers were produced, with four more in preparation.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/16/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jonah D Erlebacher"
