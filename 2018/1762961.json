 "awd_abstract_narration": "Physical interaction of a cell with the surrounding tissue is very important in cancer metastasis, wound healing, development, angiogenesis and many other normal and disease conditions. We still have only a small quantitative understanding of this for real tissues.  One type of interaction that is not understood quantitatively is where a cell extends thin structures called a 'filopodia' that sense chemicals and \"feel\" the stiffness of the surrounding parts of the tissue.  This research will create a three dimensional (3D) model of filipodia from the finest scale, to model the molecules in the 3D network of collagen fibers around the cell through the intermediate scale, where the molecules for viscoelastic mesh structures that undergo large deformations caused by the filopodia pushing and pulling on the network, and at the largest scale, model the migration of the cell as a coordinated activity of multiple filopodia, secretions of molecules that change the surrounding mesh and the pulling forces of the cell.  This research will help to bring computational cell mechanics into the mainstream by building a 3D cell migration simulation software for researchers, educators, and students. The tools will be available as web tutorial modules and open software for educators, students, and researchers around the world. The project will also form a Forum of software users and research collaborators.  This research project will further the goal of the United States to understand the activities of cells that contribute to health and disease of its citizens.\r\n\r\nThis project's computational model will significantly advance the quantitative understanding of 3D cell invasion into the ECM fiber network. It will include cell-ECM interactions at the binding kinetics level and integrate the numerous key mechanisms into the modeling of whole cell-level migration. In vitro microfluidic experiments will be conducted to determine unknown parameters and verify the computational model. The resultant model will be used to predict how cell migration in 3D ECM is influenced by the stiffness and, also, ECM porosity, single fiber diameter, and cross-linker properties. It will be used to predict whether there is an optimal MMP secretion level for 3D cell invasion into ECM; too much secretion of MMP rapidly degrades the ECM fiber network and makes it too soft, while too little secretion of MMP impedes the cell to invade into ECM. A group of cells can communicate with one another through stress and strain propagation in the ECM and create migratory behaviors as a collective event. The emergent behavior of collective cell migration will be predicted using the multi-scale computational model.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

How does a cancer cell become aggressive, invading into a blood vessel and traveling to other locations in the body? What sort of machinery is involved in the cancer cell that enables the deadly cell to invade into a blood vessel? Cancer cell invasion is a critical process of metastasis. Thousands of research articles have dealt with this critical process, each reporting valuable findings obtained through extensive experiments and clinical tests. How can we integrate these valuables pieces of research work into a model that we can simulate, visualize, and examine? How can we stitch together these pieces of knowledge to construct an entire picture? There may be missing pieces, contradictory points, and debatable issues in the vast amount of reported information.</p>\n<p>The goal of this NSF project is to construct a computational model that can simulate the machinery of cancer cell invasion into a blood vessel wall. The computational model is obtained based on hundreds of reported articles, whilst several critical mechanisms are still missing. We have identified those missing parts and filled the gaps by introducing new mechanisms required for elucidating the aggressive behaviors of invading cancer cells.</p>\n<p>One such missing link is the molecular machinery that allows a cancer cell to form a bundle of strong fiber network, called invadopodia, that penetrates a base membrane of blood vessel. We have constructed a computational model to explain this process in a manner that is consistent with the known actin machinery properties and that is validated by comparing its behavior to reported experimental data. Figure 1 shows the actin machinery producing key elements of invadopodia.</p>\n<p>To make the penetrating structure even stronger, a cancer cell creates rings that tie together a bundle of fibers. Moreover, the cancer cell can stick to the wall of a blood vessel, so that a large penetrating force can be generated. These mechanisms, too, can be explained by constructing a computational model based on similar molecular-level machinery. Furthermore, the cancer cell can probe the surrounding extracellular matrix (ECM), cleave the ECM fibers, and migrate towards the wall of a blood vessel. To explain these behaviors at a molecular level, we have built a 3-dimensional ECM fiber network to which a cancer cell interacts. The cell changes its intracellular state in response to interactions with the ECM fibers and secretes proteins to break the ECM.</p>\n<p>Integrating all these molecular-level mechanisms, we have built the detailed computational model of an invading cancer cell, as shown in Figure 2. Simulation videos are also available at the NSF Project website of the MIT d?Arbeloff Laboratory (<a href=\"http://darbelofflab.mit.edu/cancer-cell-mechanobiology/\">http://darbelofflab.mit.edu/cancer-cell-mechanobiology/</a>).</p>\n<p>This computational model delineates behaviors of a single cell. Cancer cells and many other cells, however, work as a group. It is necessary to investigate collective behaviors of multiple cells interacting each other. Different behaviors may emerge when multiple cells interact and communicate through the surrounding ECM. Unfortunately, the computation of interacting multiple cells is extremely complex, requiring an enormous computing resource. In this NSF project, we have proposed a novel method for computing multi-cellular systems where single cell models can be added - or superposed ? without causing intricate interaction problems. In general, the dynamics of individual cells are nonlinear, and the cell-to-cell interactions are multiplicative and thereby nonlinear. We cannot simply add the dynamics of individual cells. However, our method allows us to simply superpose individual dynamic models that are nonlinear.</p>\n<p>It is known that a nonlinear dynamical system can be represented as a linear system when additional variables, called observables, are used. A nonlinear system behaves more linearly when represented in a higher dimensional space where not only independent state variables but also many observables represent the system. We have applied this lifting linearization method, underpinned by Koopman operator theory, to the multi-cellular system modeling. Namely, we first represent the dynamics of a single cell surrounding by ECM as a linear state equation in a high dimensional space. As described previously, a cancer cell exhibits multifaceted behaviors represented by multiple sets of nonlinear dynamic equations. The lifted linear model, however, provides us with a unified, global linear model integrating the diverse nonlinear dynamics. Once the linear lifted model is derived, it is copied to create multiple cells, and a group of the linear cell equations are superposed to create an interactive multi-cellular system. The computational complexity increases linearly instead of exponentially. More importantly, we can gain clear insights into the overall behaviors of interacting multiple cells by examining the linear model represented in the lifted space.</p>\n<p>Figure 3 shows the schematic of a multi-cellular system created by superposition of individual cell models represented in a lifted space. The multi-cellular system is created by superposition of the linear single cell models.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 11/21/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Haruhiko&nbsp;H&nbsp;Asada</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1762961/1762961_10571627_1637548140050_Fig-3-Outcome-11-21-R--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1762961/1762961_10571627_1637548140050_Fig-3-Outcome-11-21-R--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 3\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1762961/1762961_10571627_1637548140050_Fig-3-Outcome-11-21-R--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 3\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Multi-cellular system constructed by superposition of linear lifted cell dynamics models</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Harry Asada</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Haruhiko&nbsp;H&nbsp;Asada</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 3</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1762961/1762961_10571627_1637547925096_Fig-2-Outcome-R--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1762961/1762961_10571627_1637547925096_Fig-2-Outcome-R--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 2 Cancer cell extravasation model infiltrating into base membrane and ECM fiber network.\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1762961/1762961_10571627_1637547925096_Fig-2-Outcome-R--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 2 Cancer cell extravasation model infiltrating into base membrane and ECM fiber network.\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The three actinbasedstructures are formed (A), invadopodia penetrated throughthe base membrane (B) and (C), invadopodia protrusion was maximized (D), the nucleus was pulled toward invadopodia (E,F)</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Min-Cheol Kim and Harry Asada</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Haruhiko&nbsp;H&nbsp;Asada</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 2 Cancer cell extravasation model infiltrating into base membrane and ECM fiber network.</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1762961/1762961_10571627_1637547537820_Fig-1-Outcome--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1762961/1762961_10571627_1637547537820_Fig-1-Outcome--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1762961/1762961_10571627_1637547537820_Fig-1-Outcome--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Key components of invasive cancer cell produced by actine machinery</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Min-Cheol Kim and Harry Asada</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Haruhiko&nbsp;H&nbsp;Asada</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 1</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
