The Workshop will bring together the NSF EFRI Two- Dimensional Atomic-Layer Research and Engineering (2-DARE), as well as New Light, EM (Electronic) and Acoustic Wave Propagation: Breaking Reciprocity and Time Reversal Symmetry (NewLAW) supported researchers working on materials and devices in these areas to help promote future collaborations and address common challenges. This includes faculty, postdoctoral researcher and graduate students from the institutions supported by the 2-DARE and NewLAW programs. The Workshop is expected to play a key role in addressing in detail currently faced bottlenecks in material and device research and identifying new directions for research.  The research discussed at the Workshop is expected to lead to technological breakthroughs and disruptive technologies that can have great societal impact in the future in many areas such as sensing, communications and health.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
