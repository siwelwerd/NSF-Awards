 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project investigates how four different ecosystems in the southwestern U.S. respond to changes in temperature and precipitation. This is important because temperature and precipitation have strong effects on ecosystems. The main effects are on the flow of carbon, the supply of nutrients, the types of soil microbes, and the growth of plants. However, the exact rate and magnitude of change are unknown. This project will investigate a key knowledge gap by using experimental treatments that reduce precipitation and warm soil. This experiment has been sustained for almost two decades. This project will support the completion of the experiment in the next five years. The main question is whether the initial responses to shifts in temperature and precipitation are consistent over time, or whether the ecosystems adjust to the new conditions. In addition, this project will support scientific workforce training. Undergraduate and graduate students will be trained in methods of data collection and analysis. Outreach activities will be conducted with broad audiences through local non-profit groups. Finally, data will be provided online about primary production, plant community composition, and ecosystem carbon and nutrient balance, in open access format.\r\n\r\nThis project will extend a unique long-term experiment conducted across multiple ecosystem types, extending the timeline to over two decades. This experiment occurs along the C. Hart Merriam elevation gradient, extending from the forested slopes of the San Francisco Peaks to the woodlands and deserts of the Colorado Plateau, a region identified for its high sensitivity to climate. The project follows up on an earlier hypothesis that change in temperature and precipitation will elicit progressive reductions in primary production in semi-arid ecosystems that are sustained on decadal timescales. In other words, primary production may increasingly decline in response to the interactive effects of drought and heat. Here, two mechanisms will be tested that could drive this change: shifts in the plant community and changes in the nitrogen cycle. The prediction is that the combination of these two effects modulates long-term carbon and nutrient balance responses to experimental warming. Because these progressive effects operate on the timescales of community change and biogeochemistry (years to decades), measuring them requires continuing this long-term dataset. In this case, two decades will be sufficient time to see experimental responses of total ecosystem carbon and nitrogen balance. It is likely that that these responses will vary among the biomes represented along the elevational gradient, with the variation largely explained by the magnitude of the progressive effects. Testing these progressive effects across ecosystems ranging from desert grasslands to coniferous forests will fill critical knowledge gaps in ecosystem science.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This NSF renewal award (#1754204) funded the final five years of a 22-year-long climate manipulation experiment conducted along a mountain-to-desert elevation gradient in northern Arizona (Figure 1). This experiment measured how changes in temperature and precipitation, expected under climate change, would affect plants and microorganisms as well as the carbon stored in ecosystems of the American Southwest.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Begun in 2002, the climate manipulation subjected intact monoliths of soil and associated vegetation to warmer annual temperatures by transplanting them from a higher-elevation ecosystem to a lower elevation ecosystem at five sites (Figure 2). Those five ecosystems included mixed conifer forest (2620m), ponderosa pine forest (2344m), pi&ntilde;on-juniper woodland (2020m), Plains and Great Basin grassland (1760m), and Great Basin Desert (1556m). Average annual temperatures ranged from 6.6&deg;C to 12.8&deg;C and annual precipitation ranged from 660mm to 150mm for the mixed conifer forest down to the Great Basin Desert. The experiment also included a precipitation manipulation (Figure 3), wherein subsets of both transplanted and control soil monoliths received an annual amount of precipitation either matching the ambient levels of their ecosystem of origin, or elevated (+50%), or reduced (-30%) levels.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Over 22 years, this project documented dramatic changes to the plants, microbes, and biogeochemistry of the manipulated ecosystems. Perhaps the most consequential finding was the long-term loss of about one-third of all carbon from soils that were transplanted down the elevation gradient into warmer and drier conditions. This was accompanied by a short-term increase in plant productivity in the warmed treatments, however this effect diminished over time such a net loss of carbon could be inferred after two decades of warming.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>While warming altered plant productivity as well as the species composition of the plant community, precipitation effects were negligible, and plant community composition within the transplanted soil monoliths tended to converge toward that of the ecosystem (and climate) to which they were transplanted.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The biomass and growth of soil microbes also declined with warming (Figure 4), suggesting pronounced alterations in the workings of the below-ground food web. The soil food web was not explicitly considered at the outset of this research, but advances in microbial ecology and multi-omics techniques have since enabled additional ongoing research that suggest changes to both predatory and cooperative microbial interactions in the warmed soils (Figure 5). In this way, the climate manipulation that began in 2002 continues to yield fresh discoveries going forward by providing soil for investigations of microbial interactions as well as native plant germination and fitness.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>This project has also had numerous outcomes beneficial to the scientific community. For example, data from this long-term work is included in an ongoing synthesis of eleven soil climate transplant experiments from around the globe. It has also contributed to the direct training of nine undergraduate research students, fifteen graduate students and five postdoctoral researchers. Data from this work, along with a 22-year repeat-photography series of images of the transplanted and control soil monoliths are publicly available for future research efforts.&nbsp;<span>These
