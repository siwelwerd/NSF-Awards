 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computer science includes abstract, high-level concepts as well as concrete details, such as the proper arrangement of code. As a result, teaching computer science is particularly challenging. Pencil puzzles show promise for learning computer science, as well as for promoting critical and computational thinking and problem solving. This project builds on a previous analysis that demonstrated the effectiveness of pencil puzzles in introductory computer programming courses.   It aims to aims to extend the assessment to multiple course levels and to multiple institutions that have different characteristics and student demographics. Pencil puzzles are diagrams that pose a problem that humans solve through deduction, using only a pencil. Most pencil puzzles are language and culture independent, giving them broad potential as a teaching and learning tool. The use of pencil puzzles to teach computer science principles has the potential to broaden participation in computing. This project seeks to provide insights into the puzzles' effects on learning, engagement of diverse populations, suitability for both K-12 and upper division computational thinking courses, and value to instructors as pedagogical tools. The study intends to include a population of deaf and hard-of-hearing students and aims to provide insight into the suitability of the puzzles for this group of students. The project aims to contribute to the growth and diversity of the national computing workforce.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to develop an understanding of how pencil puzzles can provide an effective context for computer science education across populations. This project aims to investigate four research questions. (1) Do pencil-puzzle-based assignments promote measurable learning of computer science concepts and computational thinking across a diverse student population and at various types of institutions? (2) Are the engagement with and the grades on pencil-puzzle-based assignments independent of prior computing experience, gender, and other demographics? (3) Are pencil-puzzle-based assignments suitable for upper levels of collegiate computer science education and for K-12 students learning computational thinking? and 4) Are pencil puzzles valuable to a broad spectrum of educators, including undergraduate educators (including faculty and teaching assistants) and K-12 teachers? The PIs plan to collaborate with instructors at seven different undergraduate institutions (ranging from research intensive to small liberal arts institutions) as well as a middle school and a high school to develop assignments suited to each institution's student body and course format. The project intends to make the new assignments available through an existing online repository (https://www.cs.rit.edu/~pencilpuzzle/#/). Assessments of pencil puzzle effectiveness will take place at each institution and include interviews with instructors and teaching assistants, student surveys, and student grades.  The project intends to include extended training of instructors in the use of pencil puzzles to increase their impact on student learning and demonstrate the utility and adoptability of the approach.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThis project built on prior work exploring the use of pencil puzzles as a way to teach computer science (CS) concepts by working with instructors at 10 different universities to deliver puzzle-based assignments and collect data from their students. In particular, pencil puzzles are those like sudoku and many others which are designed to be solved by humans. As such, they can be easily explained to students and naturally encourage an algorithmic thought process. We had previously shown that in our own department, they were engaging and effective with little to no dependence on student gender or prior programming experience. In this project, we surveyed hundreds of students in ?? different courses to determine whether they appreciated the puzzle context, whether the assignment helped them to understand the CS topic at hand, and other similar questions. We also asked demographic questions, not only their gender and ethnicity, but also their academic background, inclination to puzzles, and other factors, to understand whether these had impact for students from a wider range of situations than simply our own single department.\nWe analyzed the data collected from across the different courses and institutions in several ways. Looking at the baseline survey data, we found that the large majority of students appreciated the learning experience provided by the puzzle-based assignments. Also encouraging was that across the different survey questions, the student background and demographics mostly did not have a statistical impact on their appreciation, with the exception that for some questions, female students had a slightly more positive sentiment. Since the data was quite heterogeneous, coming from different courses and different assignments, we used advanced statistical techniques such as mixed-effects linear regression to analyze the relationship between student responses and demographic factors while allowing for the different environments.\nWe also did in-depth analysis of open-ended text comments that students were able to leave in the surveys. Here we discovered that students volunteered comments on similar topics as in the previous study, including notably that students who commented on assignment difficulty level were also more likely to mention that they appreciated the learning experience. In addition, since performing this type of qualitative analysis of large amounts of open-ended data can be challenging and time-consuming, we investigated how well modern AI tools including ChatGPT can assist in this process. We learned that while it is not yet able to provide a labeling scheme for comments on its own, it can effectively label student comments with given labels and can be an effective collaborator with a human researcher to make the analysis more efficient.\nWhile the majority of our investigations were in introductory-level courses, we also worked with some instructors of more advanced courses to provide assignments appropriate to those venues. Here again, the majority of students enjoyed the puzzle-based assignments and wanted to see more similar assignments in the future. We also found no statistical dependence of student responses on traditional demographic factors such as gender and ethnicity, though we did find some dependence on whether the student felt well-prepared for the course in general.\nFinally, we performed and analyzed interviews with our collaborating instructors, to understand how integrating this new type of assignment impacts their course and their students. Together with our own observations, we determined that even when the instructor themselves was responsible for creating the assignment, the puzzle context tends to lead itself to more open-ended assignments and a more problem-solving-based approach. While instructors appreciated the type of experience this provided their students, they noted that there was a tendency for these assignments to be more difficult than others, which may challenge some students. This was notable in that student sentiment was largely independent of their prior experience and preparedness, but that the instructors still felt this was something to take note of. As such, we recommend that instructors do adopt puzzle-based assignments in their CS courses, but take special care that the problem-solving approach (which is valuable for student learning) be handled appropriately for the level of students in the course.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/18/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: ZackJButler\n"
