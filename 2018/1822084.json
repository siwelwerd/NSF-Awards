 "awd_abstract_narration": "This NSF award provides partial support for the 2018 Stochastic Networks conference, to be held June 25-29, 2018, at the International Centre for Mathematical Sciences (ICMS) in Edinburgh, and the preceding Summer School in Applied Probability, June 18-22, 2018. The 2018 Stochastic Networks conference is interdisciplinary, bringing together mathematicians, engineers, physicists and operations researchers to discuss cutting-edge research on Stochastic Networks. The conference will emphasize new model structures and new mathematical problems that are motivated by contemporary developments in various application domains, as well as new mathematical methods for random graph and stochastic network analysis. Research in this area is strongly motivated by applications arising in diverse domains, ranging from the traditional areas of telecommunications and manufacturing to service operations, biological and social networks, neural and neurological networks, revenue management, and healthcare.\r\n\r\nThe conferences on Stochastic Networks are highly interdisciplinary and bring together mathematicians and applied researchers who share an interest in stochastic network models. The 2018 Conference will continue the tradition of featuring talks on key developments at the cutting edge in stochastic networks, ranging from the development of new mathematical techniques in currently active areas of research such as infinite-dimensional scaling limits, rare event simulation, dynamics on random graphs, and graphical models, to applications in diverse areas including distributed systems and cloud computing, biochemical reaction networks, revenue management, randomized algorithms in computer science and statistical physics. In addition, the 2018 edition of the conference also has the special characteristic that it will be preceded by a special Summer School in Applied Probability, which will feature courses on spatial stochastic models, energy systems and measure-valued scaling limits of stochastic networks. \r\nThe conference website is at: http://www.icms.org.uk/stochasticnetworks.php\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
