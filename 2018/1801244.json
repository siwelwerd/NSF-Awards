 "awd_abstract_narration": "High-energy storms like Hurricane Irma, which recently struck the Florida coast, can damage ecosystems by rapidly delivering excessive rain, wind, and surges of water and materials. Such disturbance effects can have lasting consequences that can be difficult to anticipate because they interact with other short- and long-term changes occurring in nature, including prior events and chronic alterations driven by land- and water-use changes. Whether or not an ecosystem recovers rapidly, slowly or not at all from an extreme event may depend on exposure, resistance, and resilience to prior disturbances and chronic changes. This research will study the impacts of Hurricane Irma on carbon and nutrient cycles and animal populations, and how the impacts of such a severe disturbance are influenced by the legacies of previous storm events and long-term saltwater encroachment that predated the storm. New knowledge gained from this work on recovery trajectories will improve understanding of the longer-term impacts of storms like Irma on ecosystem services provided by coastal ecosystems; including storm buffering, carbon dioxide removal, biodiversity conservation and freshwater provisioning. The investigators will also use the information gained from this work to create K-12 classroom activities and media outreach programs that will enhance public understanding of the value of coastal environments, and the impacts of hurricanes.\r\n\r\nThis study will use the context of the Florida Coastal Everglades Long Term Ecological Research (FCE LTER) program to measure the impacts of storm surge, winds and rains from Hurricane Irma that passed over the Everglades on Sept 10, 2017. A field campaign will be conducted to measure the storm's impact on the distribution of nutrients, vegetation, soils and aquatic animals on the landscape. By examining impacts on areas that have had different histories of exposure to prior storms and chronic encroachment of saltwater that have been well-documented by the FCE LTER program, researchers will be able to determine how prior conditions influence the magnitude and duration of the storm's effects. By quantifying these impacts in the context of ongoing research, this study will also allow scientists to understand how the storm influenced the ability of the ecosystem to withstand future changes. A model that predicts how well coastal forests protect inland areas from storm surges will also be produced. Findings will be compared to other locations with long-term research programs impacted by tropical storms in 2017 and the results distributed through publications, multiple media outlets, and K-12 classroom activities.",

High-energy storms like tropical cyclones can damage ecosystems by rapidly delivering excessive rain, wind, and surges of water and materials. Such disturbance effects can have lasting consequences that can be difficult to anticipate because they interact with other short- and long-term changes occurring in nature, including prior events and chronic alterations driven by land- and water-use changes. Whether or not an ecosystem recovers rapidly, slowly or not at all from an extreme event may depend on exposure, resistance, and resilience to prior disturbances and chronic changes. Understanding recovery trajectories is important because of the value of functions that support services provided by ecosystems, including storm buffering, carbon dioxide removal, biodiversity conservation and freshwater provisioning. Long-term ecosystem studies provide an unusually rich context for unravelling how recovery from extreme events depends on prior conditions, and how these events may influence future ecosystem responses to external pressures.</p>\n<p>This study used the context of the Florida Coastal Everglades Long Term Ecological Research (FCE LTER) program to measure the impacts of storm surge, winds, and rains from Hurricane Irma that passed over the Everglades on Sept 10, 2017. The project had three major goals, to: (1) document the role of mangrove forests and elevation gradients in attenuating storm surge, and assess associated elevation changes driven by sediment deposits or losses, (2) determine whether a storm surge erases or enhances a storm surge deposit associated with a prior storm (Hurricane Wilma, 2005), and influences the stability of mangrove-derived carbon in the coastal zone, and (3) determine the influence of coastal storms on hydrologic connectivity and the access to food supplies by mobile consumers.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Intellectual Merit:</strong> We updated the Coastal and Estuarine Storm Tide (CEST) model to incorporate effects of mangrove forests on storm surge attenuation, finding that maximum storm surge was 3.4 m with an inundation extent of ~13-16 km. The model well predicted tidal gauge heights and high-water marks. The surge delivered a mineral deposit up to 10 km to the forest interior containing double the concentration of the nutrient limiting plant production, phosphorus. About 40-80% of mangroves were defoliated and most large trees in the wind field died. Smaller trees increased their fine root biomass and the concentrations of phosphorus in their leaves, indicating increased nutrient uptake to efficiently restore the lost canopy. Significant differences in nutrient update among mangrove species across sites may determine recovery trajectories. Strong effects of the storm on mobile consumers were detected via telemetry. Bull sharks, common snook, and American alligators moved away from the study area prior to the storm, linked to changes in barometric pressure. About a quarter of these animals reappeared after the storm, and the remainder either died or are living elsewhere.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Broader Impacts: </strong>This project trained seven undergraduate students and five research technicians from underrepresented groups, three graduate students, and three postdocs from underrepresented groups at Florida International University. The project led to a cross-system workshop to compare disturbance impacts and interactions among legacies across a broad range of ecosystem types. Results were disseminated to scientific audiences national and internationally through 15 presentations, 9 peer-reviewed publications, and 6 workshops. Public dissemination was through 10 press releases and stories in local to national media outlets. The updated storm surge model will be employed internationally to improve predictions of storm surge extent in social-ecological systems.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 03/30/2020<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Evelyn&nbsp;E&nbsp;Gaiser</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1801244/1801244_10526505_1585583242673_IMG_2172_RT_SRS2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1801244/1801244_10526505_1585583242673_IMG_2172_RT_SRS2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"High Water after Hurricane Irma\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1801244/1801244_10526505_1585583242673_IMG_2172_RT_SRS2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"High Water after Hurricane Irma\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Research technician Rafael Travieso at FCE LTER site SRS 2 in Everglades National Park after Hurricane Irma.
