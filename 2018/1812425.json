The Summits will serve to illustrate the important role that advanced networks play in the emerging smart and connected communities / Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem and provide a unique opportunity to facilitate partnerships among university-based researchers, industry and community leaders. The applications that will be showcased as part of the summit will also demonstrate how advanced networking technologies support economic growth and prosperity, improvement of quality of lives and delivery of healthcare services.  \r\n\r\n  \r\nThe US Ignite Application Summits in 2018 and 2019 will also complement the Smart and Connected Community program.  By co-locating the Application Summit with the NSF Smart and Connected Community (S&CC) program principal investigators' (PI) meeting, there will be increased opportunity for transition of technologies to communities as well as additional insights into both community needs and the state of the art in smart applications and S&CC PI research. The Application Summits will also provide a venue for community leaders spanning rural and urban regions of various size to interact with application developers and researchers in panel discussions, poster sessions, and technology demonstrations.  They will also give exposure to applications that other local governments and their project partners have developed, and enhance opportunities to transfer research products across communities. The Application Summits in 2018 and 2019 will serve to build research capacity by disseminating information, lessons learned and best practices across the research community and its partners in municipal government.",
