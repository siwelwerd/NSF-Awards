 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fewer than 40% of students who intend to major in STEM complete a STEM degree, and more than two-thirds of students pursuing STEM associate degrees do not complete their STEM programs within four years.  One barrier faced by prospective STEM majors is the failure to successfully complete the mathematics requirements. To address the mathematics barrier that impedes students' persistence and success in STEM associate degree technician programs, Lehigh Carbon Community College (LCCC) will redesign Intermediate Algebra and College Algebra to answer the question students continually ask: \"Why do I need math?\"\r\n\r\nMathematics faculty will work with an advisory committee of faculty and industry professionals from various engineering, technology, computing, and science fields to develop real-world applications that mimic those encountered in industry. Through multi-disciplinary, collaborative, and discovery-based learning, the students will increase their awareness of the relevance of algebra to STEM disciplines. It is expected that the revised mathematics courses will support an increase in the percentage of STEM students successfully passing algebra courses, and increase fall-to-fall retention in targeted STEM technician programs. The project has the potential to positively affect the teaching of algebra beyond LCCC. A professional development program will provide workshops for LCCC's full-time, part-time, and adjunct faculty and faculty at other colleges in the region and for secondary instructors who teach dual enrollment college algebra for high school students seeking college credit. Participants will receive kits of instructional materials to take back to their classrooms. A project website will be created to share the course materials and project results, and materials developed will be archived with ATE Central.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOur main goal for this project was to improve success and retention of college level intermediate algebra courses for students enrolled in previously identified technician programs.  This was to be done by providing students with activities, based on real-life applications, that would provide academic reinforcement and also demonstrate the practical benefit of this material.  The original vision was to create actual simulations for students to work with, potentially in the form of a makerspace, to be included in the course content.\n\nAs the project progressed, several issues with this approach arose.  First, it became clear that the in-class time to engage in these simulations would not be available, due to the density of content in the course.  Secondly, these resources would not have been available to the increasing number of students taking this course off-site, either at a satellite campus or through dual enrollment in a high school setting.  The second issue was further exacerbated following the Covid pandemic, when the use of both synchronous and asynchronous online instruction was emphasized.\n\nBecause of these issues, the project team pivoted our direction and moved toward creating virtual simulations which could be incorporated directly into a learning management system and thus accessible to all students, regardless of the location or modality of instruction.  Following this decision, an external partner was identified to create the virtual simulations based on our specifications.\n\nThe end result of the process was eight virtual simulations, build around real-life applications and focused on course content with which students typically struggle.  The simulations were designed to provide maximum flexibility for individual instructors in how they may be used in a particular section of the course.  They may be used as graded activities for students to complete or as ungraded supplemental aides to provide added reinforcement.\n\nThe time lost during the pandemic, along with the drastic change in direction from physical to virtual simulations, caused a significant delay in progress with this project.  As a result, we do not yet have significant data regarding any improvements to success or retention, based on the use of the simulations.  Even though from this point of view the project is concluding, the project team views our work as moving into a next phase.  We will continue with our plans to monitor and evaluate the use of the simulations in the intermediate algebra courses.  Our study of relevant success and retention data will continue, as will our plan to report any findings in an appropriate forum (article, conference presentation, etc.).  At this point in time, we are expecting to see some improvement but the depth and scope is yet to be determined.\n\nWhile there was some disappointment among the team, as a result of the need to refocus the project and the corresponding delays in progress, the team is satisfied with the project output in the form of the virtual simulations that were developed.  We believe they are a satisfactory alternative to the physical activities originally conceived and are hopeful that the data we collect over the next several years will support that belief in the form of measurable improved outcomes.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/25/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Erik J Csikos"
